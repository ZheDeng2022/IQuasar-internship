  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stone disease is a common condition, affecting approximately 9% of Americans in 2007. It&#xD;
      causes great morbidity and is also a costly condition, estimated to cost the US healthcare&#xD;
      system approximately 3.79 billion dollars in 2007. Ureteroscopy (URS) is the most commonly&#xD;
      performed surgical treatment for upper tract stone disease. Ureteral stenting is a common&#xD;
      practice after ureteroscopy and placed in ~75% of cases to prevent ureteral edema and renal&#xD;
      obstruction. Unfortunately, ureteral stenting can be very painful and has been shown to&#xD;
      increase the rate of emergency room visits. Many strategies have been attempted to decrease&#xD;
      pain with ureteral stenting including modification of stent material and designs, but efforts&#xD;
      so far have been unsuccessful in decreasing stent-related morbidity. Stent-related morbidity&#xD;
      is hypothesized to be secondary to irritation of ureteral/bladder mucosa and muscle.&#xD;
      Analgesics such as alpha blockers and NSAIDs have been shown to reduce stent morbidity.&#xD;
      Anticholinergic drugs are also utilized as they decrease bladder spasms and, therefore, are&#xD;
      hypothesized to reduce stent irritation. However, the evidence for anticholinergics has been&#xD;
      conflicting. Anticholinergics also have a serious side effect profile including dry mouth,&#xD;
      dry eyes, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and even dementia. Some authors&#xD;
      even hypothesize that these side effects may offset any purported benefits the&#xD;
      anticholinergics provide for stent-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methocarbamol is anti-spasmodic muscle relaxant that is believed to work by acting on central&#xD;
      neurons and possibly by blocking sodium channels. Given that anticholinergics have many side&#xD;
      effects and questionable efficacy, the investigators hypothesize that methocarbamol may&#xD;
      achieve superior analgesia for stent morbidity and stent-related bladder spasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxybutynin is used for the treatment of overactive bladder. The rationale is that the&#xD;
      oxybutynin relaxes the muscles in the bladder to help decrease problems of urgency and&#xD;
      frequent urination caused by the urinary stent irritation. Since anticholinergics have&#xD;
      multiple side effects, finding an equally efficacious alternative with less side effects is&#xD;
      highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the clinical and demographic factors of patients undergoing&#xD;
      ureteroscopy and treated postoperatively with methocarbamol vs. oxybutynin for stent-related&#xD;
      morbidity. Additionally, the study will aim to understand the postoperative outcomes and&#xD;
      complication rates of patients discharged with methocarbamol vs. oxybutynin after&#xD;
      ureteroscopy with a ureteral stent in place.&#xD;

      This study is comparing the effectiveness of pain control after ureteroscopy for stone&#xD;
      removal between two medications: oral Oxybutynin XL 10mg daily and oral Methocarbamol 750mg&#xD;
      every six hours as needed for spasms. The study medications will be given in addition to a&#xD;
      standard postoperative pain regiment including Tylenol 1000mg every six hours, Tamsulosin&#xD;
      0.4mg daily, phenazopyridine 200mg every eight hours, and diclofenac 50mg every eight hours,&#xD;
      and finally the investigational agent (either oral oxybutynin XL 10mg once daily or oral&#xD;
      methocarbamol 750mg every six hours as needed for pain depending on which group the&#xD;
      participant is randomly assigned).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be undergoing ureteroscopy for stone removal (anyone with upper tract&#xD;
      stones, total stone burden &lt; 2 cm) will be identified in clinic and consented to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Patients will be randomized to either methocarbamol or oxybutynin in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion using RedCAP prior to the procedure. Pain regimen after surgery includes: Tylenol&#xD;
      1000mg every six hours, Tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily, phenazopyridine 200mg every eight hours, and&#xD;
      diclofenac 50mg every eight hours, and finally the investigational agent (either oral&#xD;
      oxybutynin XL 10 mg once daily or oral methocarbamol 750mg every six hours as needed for&#xD;
      pain). Both drugs are FDA approved, but will be used off-label for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study. Although oxybutynin is not FDA approved for the treatment of ureteral spasms, multiple&#xD;
      studies have been performed to study its efficacy for this indication and it will be used in&#xD;
      an off-label fashion. The study will document age, sex, BMI, preoperative stone burden,&#xD;
      laterality of surgery, OR duration, laser energy (kJ), laser settings, ureteral access sheath&#xD;
      use, stent size, stent duration, stone analysis, preoperative urine culture, stone culture,&#xD;
      and any medical comorbidities. Neither patients nor investigators will be blinded to which&#xD;
      drug they are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered the PROMIS questionnaire, which has been validated for&#xD;
      assessing ureteral stent symptoms. The VAS pain scale will also be administered to assess&#xD;
      pain (scores from 1-10). The PROMIS questionnaire and VAS pain scale will be administered at&#xD;
      time of study enrollment or prior to surgery. The questionnaire and VAS pain scale will be&#xD;
      administered daily by text message (RedCAP electronic survey) from POD1 until the day of&#xD;
      stent removal, and 1 day after the stent is removed. Stent removal typically occurs 3-7 days&#xD;
      after surgery. The questionnaires will be completed by the patient on a mobile device.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a drug diary, so study investigators can ensure they took&#xD;
      the medication as prescribed. On the final survey (the one sent 1day after stent removal),&#xD;
      the study investigators will also inquire about if the patient had any unplanned clinic or ED&#xD;
      visits during the period the stent was in.&#xD;
