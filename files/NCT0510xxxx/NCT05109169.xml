  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is the main cause of disability in older adults, currently affecting about 50&#xD;
      million people world-wide with this number estimated to triple in the next 30 years. In&#xD;
      MET-FINGER, we aim to understand whether the FINGER 2.0 multidomain intervention, combining&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle changes and a drug for diabetes (metformin), may help reduce the risk of&#xD;
      dementia and improve health and independence among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study primary objective is to test the effect of the intervention, compared to healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle advice, on the change in cognition, measured as a composite score including 14 of&#xD;
      neuropsychological/cognitive tests. The secondary objective is to test the intervention&#xD;
      effect on change in individual cognitive domains, functioning level, and risk factors for&#xD;
      dementia (e.g., lifestyle, medical, and psychosocial). To this aim, a range of&#xD;
      personal/health-related data and blood samples, will be collected. Potential interactions&#xD;
      between metformin and lifestyle changes; potential disease-modifying effects; and feasibility&#xD;
      of the metformin + lifestyle combination will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 older people with risk factors for dementia, but without dementia/substantial cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, will be recruited in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Sweden (at least 50% with&#xD;
      higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease/dementia based on the Apolipoprotein E (APOE)&#xD;
      gene). Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to either a self-guided multidomain&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention or to the FINGER 2.0 multidomain lifestyle-based intervention. Outcome&#xD;
      assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Within the FINGER 2.0 intervention group,&#xD;
      participants at increased risk of diabetes, will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to either the&#xD;
      metformin 2000mg/day, metformin 1000mg/day, or placebo group (double blinded). The&#xD;
      intervention duration is 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle intervention includes four main components: physical exercise, diet, brain&#xD;
      training and health checks. In the self-guided group, participants will create their own&#xD;
      program, based on health advice and recommendations which will be provided during the study.&#xD;
      In the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants will receive intensive lifestyle guidance,&#xD;
      and participate in structured activities, which will be as tailored as possible on each&#xD;
      person's daily habits and needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the 2-year study period, all participants will attend four assessment visits: baseline,&#xD;
      6-, 12-, and 24-months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being identified and pre-screened in relevant registers, potential participants will&#xD;
      undergo a screening assessment (after providing informed consent for the screening&#xD;
      procedures) where inclusion criteria related to both cognition and cardiovascular/lifestyle&#xD;
      risk factors will be checked. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will undergo the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria assessment with the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited to the baseline visit where informed consent for the&#xD;
      full study will be signed, baseline assessment will be conducted, and participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the FINGER 2.0 multidomain lifestyle-based intervention or self-guided&#xD;
      multidomain lifestyle intervention group. Based on the results of the baseline assessment,&#xD;
      the eligibility to the metformin/placebo treatment will be assessed in all participants&#xD;
      randomized to the FINGER 2.0 intervention group. Eligible participants will be further&#xD;
      randomized to one of the three metformin treatment groups (metformin 2000mg/day, metformin&#xD;
      1000mg/day, or placebo). Non eligible participants will continue the study by following the&#xD;
      structured lifestyle intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the self-guided intervention group, participants will build their own healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      program based on standard healthy lifestyle advice that they will receive at individual&#xD;
      consultations with the study physician/nurse as part of the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the FINGER 2.0 intervention group, participants will be invited to attend individual&#xD;
      consultations and group meeting sessions in relation to the four intervention components&#xD;
      (diet, physical activity, cognitive training, and cardiovascular/metabolic risk monitoring).&#xD;
      As part of the physical activity component, group training sessions with a&#xD;
      physiotherapist/professional trainer will be organized both at a gym as well as online.&#xD;
      Within the cognitive training component, participants will have access to an online cognitive&#xD;
      training program for independent training sessions. Individually tailored recommendations and&#xD;
      plans will be provided to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin and placebo will be dispensed every 3 months, both administered orally. The active&#xD;
      drug is GlucophageÂ® XR 500. All participants randomized to the metformin/placebo groups will&#xD;
      receive 4 identical tablets per day as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2000mg/day: 4x500mg metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1000mg/day: 2x500mg metformin + 2x500mg placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: 4x500mg placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin will be titrated weekly from 500mg/day up to 2000mg/day over 4 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      who do not tolerate the treatment will be allowed to remain in the study either in a lower&#xD;
      dose treatment group, or receiving the structured lifestyle intervention only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be actively told to what lifestyle intervention group they have been&#xD;
      assigned and assessors for primary and secondary outcomes will be blinded to the lifestyle&#xD;
      group allocation. The metformin/placebo treatment will be conducted in double blind.&#xD;
