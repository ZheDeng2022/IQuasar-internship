             the participant's healthcare provider. Participants will be included on the basis of&#xD;
             medical history and vital signs performed between informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
             signature and vaccination&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse&#xD;
             reactions to vaccines or their excipients (including specifically the excipients of&#xD;
             the study vaccine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from clinical conditions or&#xD;
             medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Per medical history, participant has chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C&#xD;
             infection&#xD;

             idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had major surgery (per the investigator's judgment) within 4 weeks before&#xD;
             administration of the study vaccine or will not have recovered from surgery per the&#xD;
