      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase III study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of Amphotericin B liposomes in patients with persistent neutropenia and fever. About&#xD;
      93 patients will be recruited in this study. The patients will receive Amphotericin B&#xD;
      liposomes intravenous infusion at a dose of 3 mg/kg over 2 hours once daily (qd) for a&#xD;
      maximum of 12 weeks.&#xD;
