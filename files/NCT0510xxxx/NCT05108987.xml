  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to test the effect of Noom on exercise and diet advice in&#xD;
      adults with type 2 diabetes. The overarching hypothesis is that the use of Noom may promote&#xD;
      better dietary adherence during an exercise program, thereby promoting greater weight loss&#xD;
      and cardiometabolic health compared to lifestyle advice only. In particular, we anticipate&#xD;
      that changes in metabolic and vascular insulin sensitivity will correlate with glycemic&#xD;
      control and blood pressure changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with a 3-fold cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk&#xD;
      compared with healthy controls, and it is estimated that 30 million adults in the United&#xD;
      States have the disease. In recent years the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American&#xD;
      College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommend moderate intensity (40-60% heart rate max, HRmax)&#xD;
      aerobic exercise 3-5d/wk for the management of T2D. The statement also recognized that higher&#xD;
      exercise intensity (&gt;60% HRmax) may yield better blood glucose control. Cardiovascular health&#xD;
      (e.g. fitness, blood pressure, etc.) also appears to respond in an exercise dose dependent&#xD;
      manner. Despite these suggestions, many people exercising compensate by eating calories back&#xD;
      from exercise, thereby negating weight loss. Moreover, compliance and adherence to exercise&#xD;
      and diet medical counsel is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most commonly cited barriers to weight loss with exercise is social support and&#xD;
      interest. We propose that use of mobile applications (apps) is a way to enhance&#xD;
      personalization and digitalization of medical therapy. Indeed, observational work suggests&#xD;
      Noom may promote exercise and diet adherence as well as induce clinically meaningful weight&#xD;
      loss in men and women with obesity. Thus, the overall purpose of this proposal is to&#xD;
      determine whether using the Noom app that tailors individualized recommendations and offers&#xD;
      feedback is best prescribed with exercise to enhance weight loss as well as glycemic control.&#xD;
      Our overarching hypothesis is that Noom will enhance the effectiveness of exercise to induce&#xD;
      weight loss and improve glycemic control compared to exercise alone with diet advice (i.e.&#xD;
      newsletter/education). To this end, individuals will be stratified by time of day for&#xD;
      exercise (i.e. morning vs. afternoon) to further determine interactions of exercise with&#xD;
      circadian rhythms. Measures will be taken before and after treatment mainly to understand&#xD;
      health gains in body weight, glucose metabolism and vascular risk. Taken together, findings&#xD;
      from this study will inform public health recommendations to behavioral strategies to treat&#xD;
      T2D. The study will also provide much needed experimental evidence to time of day in which&#xD;
      exercise is performed influences public health risk.&#xD;

    <description>If subjects are randomly assigned to this group, they will participate in exercise training and receive a Noom mobile app. Subjects will be asked to attend 2 regularly supervised and scheduled training sessions per week. For 3 days of the week, they will be instructed to exercise on their own for half the time they do in the supervised training sessions. Additionally, they will be provided standard of care diet advice that matches the American Diabetes Association recommendations.</description>
