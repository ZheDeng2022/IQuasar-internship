  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intense exercise can bring about various side effects to one's body. Less range of motion,&#xD;
      increased pain sensitivity, increased muscle swelling, and decreased muscle strength can&#xD;
      occur immediately after exercise. These side effects can be referred to exercise induced&#xD;
      muscle damage (EIMD) and can sometimes last many days. This study's goal is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of various protein supplements on EIMD symptoms as well as on blood vessel health&#xD;
      during the recovery period after muscle damaging exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eccentric exercise can result in exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD), which can cause an&#xD;
      abundance of ultrastructural muscular disruption and pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant&#xD;
      activity in the body, leading to an impairment of muscular force production and range of&#xD;
      motion, along with elevated pain sensitivity, increased swelling, and arterial stiffness.&#xD;
      Pasture-raised dairy products, obtained from strictly grass-fed cows, have been shown to&#xD;
      possess more anti-inflammatory-, antioxidant-, and antihypertensive-like biochemicals&#xD;
      compared with conventional products (i.e., with a different nutrient composition from a diet&#xD;
      rich in grains versus grasses). However, human research trials on these products, such as&#xD;
      whey protein concentrate (WPC), are neglected. This study addresses this gap, with a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that compares the effect of conventional&#xD;
      WPC versus WPC supplementation reported to be derived from pasture-raised cows on vascular&#xD;
      function and indirect markers of muscle damage and inflammation in response to eccentric EIMD&#xD;
      in healthy, young, resistance-trained women and men. Thirty resistance-trained individuals&#xD;
      will complete an intense EIMD bout consisting of eccentric barbell back squats and then will&#xD;
      be assessed 24, 48, and 72 hours post-EIMD for muscle soreness, range of motion, maximal&#xD;
      isometric voluntary contraction, peripheral fatigue via magnetic stimulation, countermovement&#xD;
      jump, barbell back squat velocity, and vascular function (i.e., arterial stiffness via&#xD;
      carotid femoral pulse wave velocity). Subjects will be grouped into a conventional WPC,&#xD;
      pasture-raised WPC, and placebo supplementation group and consume their respective&#xD;
      supplementation thrice daily immediately post-EIMD until the study's completion.&#xD;
