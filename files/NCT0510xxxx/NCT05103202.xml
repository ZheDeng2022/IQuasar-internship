  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that botulinum toxin injections (with onabotulinum toxin, incobotulinum&#xD;
      toxin, and abobotulinum toxin) given at 10-week or shorter intervals for the indication of&#xD;
      treatment of muscle spasms associated with neurological disorders are associated with equal&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness as those given at 12-week or longer intervals. We also hypothesize&#xD;
      that for those patients who would prefer a shorter inter-injection interval, but for whom&#xD;
      their insurance carrier has prevented this, have worse health-related quality of life&#xD;
      compared to patients who receive injections at a 10-week or shorter interval. We aim to&#xD;
      investigate this hypothesis by collecting demographic and injection data and patient survey&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

      Our project has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: to determine if any difference exists in safety or efficacy between patients receiving&#xD;
      injections of botulinum toxin at 10-week or shorter intervals as compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving injections at 12-week or longer intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: to determine if patients who have expressed a preference for injections at 10 week or&#xD;
      shorter intervals but whose insurance carriers have mandated a 12-week interval have worse&#xD;
      health related quality of life as compared to patients who are receiving injections at&#xD;
      10-week or shorter intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of two analyses, each designed to accomplish aims 1 and 2. For both&#xD;
      aims, we will invite consecutive patients who meet entry criteria to participate who are&#xD;
      followed in the botulinum toxin injection clinics of the University of Texas Southwestern&#xD;
      Medical Center movement disorders faculty. Participants who consent to data collection by&#xD;
      participating in an email-administered survey of quality of life will have their medical&#xD;
      records reviewed by an investigator for abstraction of clinical data (to include dose,&#xD;
      injection site, injection interval, side effects, demographics, and diagnoses). Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will fill out two or more survey instruments on the date of their enrollment visit&#xD;
      following their botulinum toxin injection visit. The survey instruments completed will be 1)&#xD;
      the SF-36 health questionnaire and 2) a disease-specific HRQoL survey chosen to be applicable&#xD;
      to the specific condition for which that subject is receiving botulinum toxin injections.&#xD;
      Patients receiving injections for multiple conditions will receive surveys for each condition&#xD;
      for which they are receiving treatment. The disease specific scales to be used selectively&#xD;
      depending on the patient's specific condition include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blepharospasm disability index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Craniocervical dystonia questionnaire (CDQ-24)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm dystonia disability scale (ADDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemifacial spasm scale (HSF-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oromandibular dystonia questionnaire (OMDQ-25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spasticity scale (SQoL-6D)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analysis, patients will be segregated into two groups (10-week or shorter inter-injection&#xD;
      interval and 12 week or longer inter-injection interval) on the basis of time elapsed between&#xD;
      the most recent botulinum toxin treatments. Clinical and survey data will be analyzed to&#xD;
      determine if differences exist between the two groups.&#xD;

        Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient provides responses to an internet based survey which includes consent to&#xD;
             participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has been diagnosed with one or more of the conditions for which a HRQoL scale&#xD;

             condition by one of the study investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Both of the two most recent intervals between injections are either a) 10-weeks or&#xD;
             less or b) 12-weeks or more&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient provides responses to an internet based survey which includes consent to&#xD;
             participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has been diagnosed with one or more of the conditions for which a HRQoL scale&#xD;
             exists and will be employed in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has received at least 2 prior injections with botulinum toxin for that&#xD;
             condition by one of the study investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Both of the two most recent intervals between injections are either a) 10-weeks or&#xD;
             less or b) 12-weeks or more&#xD;

          5. If receiving injections at 12-weeks or more, notes must have previously indicated that&#xD;
             patient needs an injection interval of 10-weeks or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If receiving injections at 12-weeks or more, the reason must be that the insurance&#xD;
             carrier covering that patient's medical costs refused to allow a 10-week or less&#xD;
             injection frequency&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        For both Aims 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is unwilling to consent to study procedures (refuses to fill out surveys)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has variable injection frequencies such that the two most recent injections do&#xD;
             not both meet criteria of being 10-weeks or less in frequency or 12-weeks or more in&#xD;
             frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a diagnosis of and is being treated for a condition for which a HRQoL&#xD;
