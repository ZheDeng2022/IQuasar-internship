    <description>0~5 score. FAC 0(Nonfunctional ambulator), FAC1(Ambulator, dependent on physical assistance - Indicates a patient who requires continuous manual contact to support body weight as well as to maintain balance or to assist coordination), FAC 2(Ambulator, dependent on physical assistance - Indicates a patient who requires intermittent or continuous light touch to assist balance or coordination), FAC3(Ambulator, dependent on supervision), FAC4(Ambulator, independent level surface only), FAC5(Ambulator, independent). Higher score means better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change of Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, immediately after rehabilitation completion, and 1-month after rehabilitation completion</time_frame>
    <description>0~56 score. Berg balance scale is 14-item objective measure that assesses static balance and fall risk in adults. Each item consists of a five-point ordinal scale(0 to 4), with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. Higher score means better outcome.</description>

    <description>Active rehabilitation programs were done for all patients. Participants were asked to attend exercise program at PT room or bedside. Exercise program was offered once or twice daily on weekdays, by trained kinesiologists. In PT programs, most patients performed strengthening exercise of lower extremities, balance training, sit-up training, sit-to-stand training and gait training for about 30 minutes. Each program was individualized to participants' current physical function. In bedside programs, patients also underwent strengthening exercise and balance training without gait training for about 10 minutes. The duration of exercise program at PT room depends on the patient's condition(upto 1 month).</description>
