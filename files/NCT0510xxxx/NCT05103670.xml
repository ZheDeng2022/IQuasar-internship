  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with pulmonary embolism (PE), after three or six months of anticoagulation,&#xD;
      persistent dyspnea and impairment of quality of life are observed in at least 30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;RAMBO&quot; trial is a French academic, multicenter, randomized (1:1 ratio), parallel arm,&#xD;
      controlled, that aimed to assess the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on the quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with an acute symptomatic PE treated with anticoagulant therapy during at&#xD;
      least 3 months and who present an impairment of quality of life and/or persistent dyspnea&#xD;
      despite anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) PET/CT is a novel imaging modality for the assessment of regional&#xD;
      lung function. The same carrier molecules as conventional V/Q imaging are used, but they are&#xD;
      labeled with 68Gallium, a ß+ isotope, instead of 99mTc, allowing acquisition of images with&#xD;
      PET technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EOLE study is an ancillary pilot study of the RAMBO trial, in which patients will&#xD;
      benefit, in addition to the extensive work up scheduled as per study protocol, from a V/Q&#xD;
      PET/CT scan before and after PR. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of PR on&#xD;
      regional lung function with lung V/Q PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
