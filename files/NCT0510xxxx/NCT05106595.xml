  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that completing bilateral simultaneous movements during upper&#xD;
      extremity practice may result in facilitation of coactivation and interhemispheric activation&#xD;
      of both the ipsilesional and contralesional brain areas, with one limb entraining the other&#xD;
      and enabling the limbs to function as a unit. Other research has proposed that the use of&#xD;
      virtual-reality (VR) activities during treatment sessions can improve upper extremity&#xD;
      function following stroke as it is motivating, challenging, offers external feedback that may&#xD;
      facilitate motor learning, and allows for the &quot;high-intensity, repetitious practice necessary&#xD;
      to drive recovery&quot;. Coupling bilateral simultaneous upper extremity movement and&#xD;
      virtual-reality activities is the Bimanual Arm Trainer (BAT), a non-powered mechanical device&#xD;
      by which the non-paretic upper extremity moves the paretic arm. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of the Bimanual Arm Trainer (BAT) compared to traditional&#xD;
      occupational therapy treatment sessions as these relate to upper extremity functional return&#xD;
      following stroke, as measured by scores on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and Upper&#xD;
      Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UE-FMA) measures. The investigators plan to use&#xD;
      retrospective data for a pre-implementation group, comparing this data to prospectively&#xD;
      collected post-implementation data. ARAT scores are routinely collected and will be used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups. UE-FMA measures are commonly used in this area of research, and&#xD;
      will be taken to provide additional context for the post-implementation group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical charts of patients with a diagnosis of stroke will be reviewed retroactively to&#xD;
      determine if there is a significant difference in improvement of upper extremity function&#xD;
      (measured by ARAT and UE-FMA scores) following traditional occupational therapy services vs.&#xD;
      use of the bimanual arm trainer. Medical charts of patients from November 2019 to November&#xD;
      2020 will be reviewed to obtain ARAT scores of patients who received traditional occupational&#xD;
      therapy services. The Bimanual Arm Trainer was obtained in April 23, 2020; however, due to&#xD;
      the pandemic, it was not able to be utilized until November 13, 2020. Patients from Review&#xD;
      Board-approval onward will be assessed for ARAT and FMA-UE scores while using the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: A minimum of 10 minutes for 3 separate sessions with Occupational Therapy for BAT&#xD;
      participation. 15-30 minutes with Occupational Therapy (OT) within 3 days of admission and&#xD;
      discharge for ARAT administration. The investigators anticipate that without mixed&#xD;
      retrospective/prospective collection sample (post intervention application), the&#xD;
      investigators will be able to reach the investigators' target participant number in 12 months&#xD;
      after approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not use a placebo or non-treatment group. The investigators will compare data&#xD;
      retrospectively to patients who received standard care prior to the BAT being accessible&#xD;
      within the investigators' rehabilitation department. Once the BAT was obtained and training&#xD;
      occurred on the unit among staff members, the device was considered standard of care&#xD;
      treatment to qualifying stroke patients; therefore, there is not a placebo group in the&#xD;
      prospective portion of this study. Appropriate patient's will receive treatment sessions on&#xD;
      the BAT regardless of participation in this study.&#xD;
