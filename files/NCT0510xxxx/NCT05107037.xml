  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      TQ-B3234 capsules in Chinese subjects associated with neurofibromatosis type I (neurofibroma&#xD;
      and peripheral malignant neurilemmoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study phases were designed, including (1) dose escalation and (2) cohort expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerance, pharmacokinetic characteristics,&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TQ-B3234 capsule, and to explore the therapeutic biomarkers related to&#xD;
      this product.&#xD;
