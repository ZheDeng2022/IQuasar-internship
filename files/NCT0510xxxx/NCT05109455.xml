  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Urinary tract infections (UTIs) is very high in kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
      Most UTIs occur during the first six months (82% within the first three months) of kidney&#xD;
      transplantation and are frequently recurrent. The component D-mannose of our authorized food&#xD;
      supplement acts by inhibiting the adherence of E.coli to the urothelium. It also has a&#xD;
      controlled release formula that ensures the presence in urine of D-mannose and the other&#xD;
      components during 24 hours. This is the reason why this experimental study aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the oral intake of this food supplement is effective in the prevention of&#xD;
      UTIs in kidney transplant patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study tries to analyze the impact of a food supplement (Manosar®) on the incidence of&#xD;
      urinary infections in patients undergoing kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly distributed (1: 1 ratio) into two treatment groups of 30&#xD;
      patients each. In one group, they will be treated with Manosar®, and in the other group they&#xD;
      will be treated with Proanthocyanidins. All patients will be followed for 6 months, being the&#xD;
      first three months of the study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experimental study is double-blinded and there are 7 monthly study visits. Properties of&#xD;
      D-mannose and Proanthocyanidins make interesting to evaluate the clinical benefit of the use&#xD;
      of food supplements with D-mannose and Proanthocyanidins in order to prevent the UTIs without&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
