      The aim of this study was to develop electronic systems (e-systems) for oncofertility&#xD;
      support, and to examine the comprehensibility, feasibility, usability, and effects on social&#xD;
      support and preparation for decision-making.&#xD;

      Background: When reproductive-aged women with breast cancer lack support in making decisions&#xD;
      about fertility, this results in conflicts in decision-making with negative effects on their&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study was to develop electronic systems (e-systems) for&#xD;
      oncofertility support, and to examine the comprehensibility, feasibility, usability, and&#xD;
      effects on social support and preparation for decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study steps were guided, tested, and utilized to (a) identify the requirements&#xD;
      of a patient, (b) guide the development of support interventions, and (c) evaluate the&#xD;
      quality of web-based oncofertility support. Both qualitative and quantitative data were&#xD;
      collected to explore supportive requirements related to oncofertility care, and an initial&#xD;
      website concerning oncofertility was developed based on the resulting requirements and system&#xD;
      review regarding social support. Alpha testing and beta testing were used to ensure the&#xD;
      quality of the web-based oncofertility support tool. The effectiveness was evaluated using&#xD;
      the Preparation for Decision-Making Scale and Social Support Questionnaire.&#xD;

    <measure>Degree of social support rated before and after using the web-based tool by patients</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social support was measured using a 16-item Likert-type questionnaire rating (from 0-3). Women of reproductive age were instructed to complete the social support questionnaire, assessing four dimensions of social support: emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental, before and after using the web-based tool.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparation for Decision Making (PrepDM) evaluated by patients and healthcare providers</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Both patients and healthcare providers were instructed to evaluate the Preparation for Decision Making Scale by the Joint Commission of Taiwan. All participants were instructed to respond to 10 questions based on a five-point Likert scale rating (from 1-5). A higher score indicates a greater agreement with the effect.</description>

    <description>User-centered design practices were used to develop an oncofertility support website for women with breast cancer before treatment. The steps of the Ottawa Decision Support Framework were used throughout the development process. A multidisciplinary steering group was assembled, and the input was provided. Guidelines from the International Patient Decision Aid Standards were applied to test the quality of the oncofertility support website.&#xD;
Three steps included:&#xD;
Identify the supportive needs of a patient;&#xD;
Guide the development of support interventions;&#xD;
Evaluate the quality of web-based oncofertility support.</description>

    <description>The website structure was developed to satisfy the needs of reproductive-age women was investigated based on four domains of social support, as developed by Cohen and Syme (1985). The important needs of patients can be classified as emotional, informational, appraisal, and instrumental support.</description>
