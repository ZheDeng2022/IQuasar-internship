      MindMics earbuds is a new technology designed enhance an individual's quality of life by&#xD;
      continuously monitoring the heart rate, stress, and blood pressure allowing patients to make&#xD;
      decisions regarding their health. MindMics has a working prototype of the ear buds which will&#xD;
      perform all the conventional tasks of earbuds (listen to music, etc.), but, in addition, will&#xD;
      measure heart rate, stress, blood pressure. The earbuds capture the sounds made by the&#xD;
      various cardiac structures pulsing and moving blood. The sound is caused by the acceleration&#xD;
      and deceleration of blood and the turbulence developed during rapid blood flow.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of the MindMics earbud recording apparatus to record&#xD;
      data from patients with known atrial fibrillation as well as those in sinus rhythm. Patients&#xD;
      in the clinic and patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled to undergo elective&#xD;
      direct-current cardioversion will be the chosen subjects. This process will select a variety&#xD;
      of patients to allow evaluation of the Mindmics apparatus's ability to collect data from&#xD;
      patients with normal as well as abnormal cardiac rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MindMics earbud device is capable of recording normal cardiac rhythms in patients&#xD;
      noninvasively using earbud device in a noninvasive manner. The same apparatus may be capable&#xD;
      of discerning atrial fibrillation compared with normal sinus rhythm. This will be evaluated&#xD;
      by collecting information from patients with atrial fibrillation in the office as well as&#xD;
      those scheduled to undergo an elective direct-current cardioversion procedure. A timed&#xD;
      recording of the clinical rhythm while wearing the apparatus will allow simultaneous&#xD;
      recording of data from an ECG recording (documenting the patient's clinical arrhythmia) at&#xD;
      the same time the MindMics earbud records its data obtained during the ECG recording of the&#xD;
      patient's rhythm. For those patient scheduled for direct current cardioversion, the patient&#xD;
      will undergo the direct-current cardioversion and a second recording will be obtained during&#xD;
      sinus rhythm afterwards allowing an appropriate comparison of the differences in the&#xD;
      recording sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to demonstrate differences between recordings made in atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      and those in sinus rhythm that can be used to develop an algorithm allow discernment between&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to collect sequential patient's in a nonrandomized unblinded procedure&#xD;
      designed to collect information using the apparatus to document its capability of recording&#xD;
      cardiac rhythm data, then using this recorded data to determine whether the patient has an&#xD;
      abnormal cardiac rhythm. Initial efforts will be directed to develop an algorithm to detect&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from inpatients at Palmetto Tuomey Medical center or in the&#xD;
      outpatient office during routine office visits for patients with clinical arrhythmias for&#xD;
      elective recording for group 1. Group 2 patients will be recruited prior to direct-current&#xD;
      cardioversion. Both groups will be explained the study, what is their participation,&#xD;
      potential risk and expectations for their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once selected each patient will be required to sign a study protocol consent form before&#xD;
      actual entry into the study. Once the consent is completed, the patients will be connected to&#xD;
      the Mindmics apparatus as well as an electrocardiographic recording system. The study&#xD;
      participant will lie quietly collecting simultaneous electrocardiographic data and data from&#xD;
      the Mindmics earbuds. Group 1 patients will be identified as outpatients during their routine&#xD;
      office visits will have 15 minutes of recording in a patient examination room during the&#xD;
      office visit. Group 2 patients undergoing Direct-Current Cardioversion will have 15 minutes&#xD;
      of recording prior to the cardioversion procedure and 15 minutes of recording after&#xD;
      completion of the cardioversion procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will be recruited for group 1 from inpatient or outpatient office&#xD;
      visits. These patients will have persistent atrial fibrillation during the office visit. If&#xD;
      necessary would consider increasing the total number of patients to 50 in this group&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will be recruited for group 2 prior to direct-current cardioversion&#xD;
      allowing collection of data from before and after cardioversion to document differences in&#xD;
      recordings during sinus rhythm after having successful cardioversion from atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. While certainly some patients will revert back to atrial fibrillation and not&#xD;
      have periods of sinus rhythm is anticipated the vast majority of patients will have&#xD;
      successful cardioversions long enough to record at least the 15 minutes post cardioversion in&#xD;
      sinus rhythm. If necessary would consider increasing the total number of patients to 50 in&#xD;
      this group&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION The total duration of involvement for each study participant is for the duration of&#xD;
      the recording interval. Group 1 participants will have a 15-minute recording interval while&#xD;
      those in group to will have 2 sessions of 15 minutes each separated by the direct current&#xD;
      cardioversion. No further participation will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected during the study will be kept by Mindmics. All data collected in the study&#xD;
      will be de-identified&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each recording will be evaluated by Mindmics to evaluate the ability of the recording&#xD;
      apparatus to provide data that would lead to clear discernment of the patient's cardiac&#xD;
      rhythm as well as rate related phenomena. At this juncture, it is anticipated the collected&#xD;
      data will be used to develop and test algorithms yet to be developed and to make clinical&#xD;
      determinations of the cardiac rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data will be evaluated to determine if the Mindmics earbuds are capable of&#xD;
      discriminating atrial fibrillation from normal sinus rhythm. For that reason, it is not&#xD;
      possible to suggest a statistical method until it is determined the device data can be used&#xD;
      to evaluate differences in cardiac rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no potential harm or injury associated with the research. The probability and&#xD;
      magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater than those&#xD;
      ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or&#xD;
      psychological examinations or tests. There are no potential risks with respect to&#xD;
      psychological, sociological, economic, or legal. The overall risk of the device in minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefit to Participants This study is performed in such a manner that it is not&#xD;
      anticipated there would be an ability to provide diagnostic data that may be helpful for the&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
