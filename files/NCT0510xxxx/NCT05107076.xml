      2D Echocardiography with color Doppler assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be done within 24 h after PPCI. Measurements will be as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pulsed wave (PW) Doppler will be performed in the apical 4chamber view within a 3 mm&#xD;
           sample volume at the tip of the mitral leaflets to obtain mitral inflow velocities to&#xD;
           assess LV filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. E (early diastolic)/A (late diastolic) - Using PW Doppler, the peak E and A velocities&#xD;
           were recorded, then the ratio of E/A will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IVRT (isovolumic relaxation time) - derived by placing the cursor of Continuous wave&#xD;
           (CW) Doppler in the LV outflow tract to simultaneously display the end of aortic&#xD;
           ejection and the onset of mitral inflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Deceleration time (DT) - from the peak of E wave to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. E/e'- PW tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) was performed in the apical views to acquire&#xD;
           mitral annular velocities. The sample volume will be positioned at or 1 cm within the&#xD;
           mitral leaflet's septal and lateral insertion sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Left atrial volume and left atrial volume index (LAVI) - The maximal left atrial (LA)&#xD;
           volume measured from the apical four-chamber view using the modified Simpson method in&#xD;
           end-systole before mitral valve opening. The LAVI obtained for all patients by dividing&#xD;
           the LA volume by the body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples were obtained within 48 hours after acute MI, and the serum will be&#xD;
      frozen at -70째C until tested for Galactin-3 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up 2D Doppler echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All previous echocardiographic measurements will be repeated at 40 days of the event.&#xD;
