      To Study serum CRP, D-dimer and serum ferritin in adult patients with COVID-19 for the&#xD;
      presence or absence of clinically validated definitions of mortality, severe COVID-19, ARDS,&#xD;
      and intensive care unit (ICU) care.&#xD;

      Inflammatory markers are often elevated in patients with COVID-19, notably C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-6and ferritin. Multiple prior studies have&#xD;
      found correlations between various biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      However, the clinical utility of these various biomarkers for risk-stratification and&#xD;
      determining prognosis among patients with COVID-19 is evolving and still ill-defined [4]&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute inflammatory protein that increases up to 1,000-fold at&#xD;
      sites of infection or inflammation. CRP is produced as a homopentameric protein, termed&#xD;
      native CRP (nCRP), which can irreversibly dissociate at sites of inflammation and infection&#xD;
      into five separate monomers, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). CRP is synthesized primarily in&#xD;
      liver hepatocytes but also by smooth muscle cells, macrophages, endothelial cells,&#xD;
      lymphocyte. CRP showed different distribution feature and existed differences in various&#xD;
      ages, clinical types and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The features corresponded with&#xD;
      disease progression [5] There is an over-exuberant cytokine release with hyperferritinemia&#xD;
      leading to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome spectrum. Indeed,&#xD;
      very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease,&#xD;
      catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock. Numerous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the immunomodulatory effects of ferritin and its association with mortality and sustained&#xD;
      inflammatory process. High levels of free iron are harmful in tissues, especially through the&#xD;
      redox damage that can lead to fibrosis. Iron chelation represents a pillar in the treatment&#xD;
      of iron overload. In addition, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-fibrotic&#xD;
      activity. Through analysis of the pathogenic role of iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection so,&#xD;
      iron depletion therapy may be a novel therapeutic approach in the COVID-19 pandemic.[6]&#xD;
      Cytokine storm is an interesting point in COVID-19 patients. High levels of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines were observed in COVID-19 patients with more severe disease and were associated&#xD;
      with pulmonary inflammation, lung damage and multiple organ failure. IL-6 is an important&#xD;
      cytokine whose production is related with various inflammatory diseases. Subjects with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 had high levels of IL-6 that were correlated with patient symptomatology including&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage. Additionally, patients with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection had low levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3, which regulates and&#xD;
      stimulates the negative feedback mechanism of IL-6. On the same line, another study reported&#xD;
      that IL-6 levels were higher in severe COVID-19 patients and this may be used as one of the&#xD;
      bases for predicting the transition from mild to severe infection. Some studies showed that&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients in intensive care had lower CD8+ T cell counts and their total CD4+ and&#xD;
      CD8+ T cell counts were also negatively correlated with TNF-Î± and IL-6 concentrations. In&#xD;
      addition, recent studies showed that higher level of IL-6, CRP and also IL-10 were more&#xD;
      significant rather than other cytokines in critical group of COVID-19 patients. It can be&#xD;
      suggested that immune dysregulation is a highly important point and therapeutic target for&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. The reasons for the large scale of the inflammatory cytokines are not&#xD;
      clear, but it could play a crucial role in cell apoptosis associated with organ damage.[7]&#xD;
      Some studies have reported that the humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors,&#xD;
      tocilizumab, can be used in COVID-19 treatment based on its cytokine storm blocking property.&#xD;
      A recent Chinese retrospective study showed that tocilizumab improved fever, CRP levels and&#xD;
      hypoxemia without leading to any significant adverse reactions in 21 severe COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. According to the Italian guidelines, tocilizumab can only be used for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients who are at the end of the high viral load phase, with interstitial pneumonia, heavy&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency and high lL-6 and/or D-dimer/CRP/ferritin/fibrinogen levels [8]&#xD;
      D-dimer is a degradation product of crosslinked fibrin resulting from plasmin cleavage.&#xD;
      During fibrinolysis plasmin may degrade fibrin monomers, crosslinked fibrin polymers and&#xD;
      possibly fibrinogen during systemic fibrinolysis following alpha2 depletion. All these&#xD;
      fragments are collectively called fibrin degradation products (FDPs). D-dimer constitutes two&#xD;
      adjacent fibrin 'D' domains (ends) that are cross-linked and released as an intact fragment,&#xD;
      hence the name D-dimer. Several studies from Wuhan have shown elevated D-dimer in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients is associated with higher mortality, Although it is not clear what effect&#xD;
      anticoagulation has on D-dimer levels in the setting of COVID-19, very low D-dimer levels are&#xD;
      usually observed in patients receiving anticoagulation.Because D-dimer is a product of&#xD;
      cross-linked fibrin, it is considered a sensitive biomarker to rule out venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism. However, D-dimer has low specificity as there are many other conditions with&#xD;
      ongoing activation of the hemostatic system in which D-dimer can be elevated such pregnancy,&#xD;
      inflammation, malignancy, trauma, liver disease (decreased clearance), heart disease, sepsis&#xD;
      or as a result of hemodialysis, CPR or recent surgery.[9] Although several studies have&#xD;
      suggested that severe disease may be associated with elevated CRP, Ferritine and D-Dimer, the&#xD;
      results across these studies are not entirely consistent. So far, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      inflammatory markers are significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those&#xD;
      with mild disease.[10] So the investigators will try to assess CRP, Ferritine and D-Dimer and&#xD;
      their association with the severity of the COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
