  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of NOX66 given&#xD;
      rectally, in cohorts of patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who have not been&#xD;
      exposed to anthracycline therapy, using a fixed dose-escalation schema every 21 days to&#xD;
      establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will contain dose-escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. The study design&#xD;
      allows an exploration of different doses of NOX66 with safety monitoring to ensure the safety&#xD;
      of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-escalation cohorts: It will include three planned Treatment Groups (800, 1200, 1800 mg&#xD;
      daily) and patients enrolled in these groups will receive 7 days of monotherapy treatment&#xD;
      with NOX66 followed by a 5-day washout period. Thereafter, patients will enter a combination&#xD;
      therapy (only if no significant toxicity is observed during monotherapy). This will commence&#xD;
      with Cycle 1, which will consist of 7 days of NOX66, and on Day 2 of the 21-day cycle,&#xD;
      doxorubicin will be administered. Patients will continue to be treated for up to 6 x 21-day&#xD;
      cycles of NOX66 and doxorubicin. New patients will be entered at the next dose level of&#xD;
      NOX66, if no dose-limiting toxicities have occurred among the first 3 patients at the end of&#xD;
      cycle 1. During the dose-escalation, MTD of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-expansion cohort: On completion of the dose-escalation cohort, patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      into a dose-expansion at the MTD of the combination of NOX66 and doxorubicin. All patients&#xD;
      will enter directly into 21-day combination cycles and will be given NOX66 therapy for 7 days&#xD;
      and doxorubicin will be administered on Day 2 of each cycle. Treatment will be terminated&#xD;
      upon disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 6 cycles.&#xD;

    <description>Determination of quality of life (QOL) of NOX66 in combination with doxorubicin. Fatigue will be measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - EORTC QLQ-FA12. The QLQ-FA12 incorporates three multi-item scales to assess physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, and cognitive fatigue. In addition, two single items assess interference with daily life and social sequelae. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. For all the scales and single items, a high score represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>

    <description>Determination of quality of life (QOL) of NOX66 in combination with doxorubicin. The effects of NOX66 on pain and other cancer-related signs and symptoms will be explored. Worst pain, general pain and pain's interference with daily life will be assessed during the study drug using the BPI-SF. The BPI-SF comprises a total of 15 items measuring 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference. Items measuring pain severity (including 'worst pain') are rated on an 11 point numeric rating scale ranging from 0=No pain to 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
