      Abstract Implementation of Physical Activity Counseling Program in Healthy Adult Individuals&#xD;
      It was planned to investigate the effects of physical activity counseling on physical fitness&#xD;
      level, physical activity level, depression level, sleep quality, quality of life and the&#xD;
      change in the number of daily steps. 48 healthy adults aged 18-65 years will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Participants will be randomized to the experimental group receiving&#xD;
      videoconferencing counseling for eight weeks and the control group receiving single-session&#xD;
      informational counseling. Participants will be evaluated with online questionnaires and&#xD;
      physical fitness tests during the video conference before the study begins, at the end of the&#xD;
      first month and at the end of the second month. Online surveys to be applied; PACE Score,&#xD;
      Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), Short Form International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PUKI), Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (BDI), World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Short Form ( WHOQOL-BREF) and physical&#xD;
      fitness tests; Plank Test, Curl Up Test, Modified Push Up Test and Squat Test. Demographic&#xD;
      information of the participants such as age, weight, height will be recorded. In addition,&#xD;
      all participants will record their step counts with the pedometer application they download&#xD;
      to their phones one week before the study starts and for one week after the study ends.&#xD;

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire of Short Form:IPAQ-SF records the last 7 day recall for four intensity levels of physical activity which is vigorous-intensity activity, moderate-intensity activity, walking, and sitting. From IPAQ-SF, data were converted to Metabolic Equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week) using. Compendium average MET score (Walking = 3.3 METs, Moderate Physical Activity = 4.0 METs and Vigorous Physical Activity = 8.0 METs).</description>

    <description>Beck Depression Scale: BDI scores of 0-13 indicate minimal depression, 14-19 (mild depression), 20-28 (moderate depression) and 29-63 (severe depression).</description>

    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Short Form: WHOQOL-BREF is a scale for the quality of life assessment developed by the World Health Organization. It is composed by 26 questions graded from 1 to 5.&#xD;
Scoring:&#xD;
1 to 2.9 - needs improvement 3 to 3.9 - regular 4 to 4.9 - good 5 - very good&#xD;
Question 1 asks about the individual's overall perception of quality of life. Results refer to question 1.</description>
