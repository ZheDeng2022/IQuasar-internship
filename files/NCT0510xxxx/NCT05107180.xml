      Substance use disorder (or drug addiction) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by&#xD;
      recurring desire to continue taking the drug despite harmful consequences. Substance use&#xD;
      disorders are a major risk factor for suicide Suicide is a leading cause of premature death&#xD;
      in young adults. Data from the World Health Organization indicate that the rate of completed&#xD;
      suicide for the world's population is 16 per 100,000 inhabitants, which means that each year&#xD;
      more than a million people in the world commit suicide. Suicide attempts are five to twenty&#xD;
      times more common than the completed suicide.Based on the data from the research community,&#xD;
      approximately 5% of adults attempts suicide at least once in their lifetime .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental health problems are the most common and best explored risk factor associated suicidal&#xD;
      ideas, suicide attempts and completed suicide. About 90% of all people who commit suicide met&#xD;
      the diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders . People who use alcohol and/or&#xD;
      drugs or are dependent on them, attempting suicide nearly six times more often than people&#xD;
      who do not use these substances. The rate of completed suicide among addicts is 2 to 3 times&#xD;
      higher than among the males who are not addictst, while in a few cases the manner in which&#xD;
      the suicide is attempted is not directly related to drugs . Although there is a correlation&#xD;
      between the disorder caused by the use of substances and suicidal behavior, a large number of&#xD;
      addicts will never attempt suicide. It is therefore important to identify those individuals&#xD;
      with the disorder caused by the use of substances that may be at higher risk for suicide .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many risk factors for suicide in the general population also apply to drug addicts. The older&#xD;
      drug addicts are at higher risk for attempts and suicides than younger addicts Another very&#xD;
      important fact when it comes to suicide attempts is the drug used. It is known that heroin&#xD;
      and sedatives are substances with which suicide attempts suicide are most often made, while&#xD;
      other drugs are less characteristic .&#xD;
