  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, 2:1 randomized phase III trial to determine whether the&#xD;
      addition of AV-GBM-1, a therapeutic, patient-specific dendritic cell vaccine, to standard&#xD;
      therapy increases OS of patients with a recent diagnosis of primary GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to enroll approximately 726 patients for tumor collection to enroll 690 who are&#xD;
      eligible for treatment at the time of randomization and who have granted consent for&#xD;
      participation. Because of the lack of toxicity, there are no restrictions related to&#xD;
      performance status or blood tests at the time of treatment. The key endpoint is OS from date&#xD;
      of first injection after RT/TMZ; secondary endpoints are PFS from date of first injection,&#xD;
      and OS and PFS from date of randomization prior to RT/TMZ. Date of PFS will be determined by&#xD;
      the principal investigator at each site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, 2:1 randomized phase III trial to determine whether the&#xD;
      addition of AV-GBM-1 to standard therapy increases OS of patients with a recent diagnosis of&#xD;
      primary GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will sign two treatment-related consents, one for obtaining fresh tumor tissue at&#xD;
      the time of craniotomy for the purpose of establishing a short-term tumor cell line and for&#xD;
      awareness of subsequent leukapheresis procedure, and the other for randomization and&#xD;
      participation in the randomized trial. As required for related medical procedures, patients&#xD;
      will sign medical consents for craniotomy/tumor resection, and for leukapheresis to obtain&#xD;
      monocytes for the MC control arm, or to manufacture DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility criteria are (1) recovered from debulking surgery from which a short-term&#xD;
      cell culture has been established, (2) undergone leukapheresis prior to planned concurrent&#xD;
      RT/TMZ, from which a sufficient number of MC have been derived, (3) screened, stratified and&#xD;
      randomized prior to starting RT/TMZ. Patients will be stratified by KPS and by whether MGMT&#xD;
      promotor-methylated and/or IDH-mutated, then randomized 2:1 (AV-GBM-1 vs MC control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final products will be manufactured while the patient is being treated with RT/TMZ. After&#xD;
      recovery from RT/TMZ, one of the study agents, either the DC-ATA AV-GBM-1 or autologous MC&#xD;
      control, will be administered weekly for three weeks just prior to starting adjuvant TMZ, and&#xD;
      then every four weeks concurrently with, adjuvant TMZ or second-line therapy per managing&#xD;
      physician. Both products are admixed with adjuvant 500 mcg of GM-CSF by a local pharmacist,&#xD;
      just prior to each injection. The pharmacist, the patient, their health care givers and local&#xD;
      research team will be masked as to whether the patient is receiving AV-GBM-1 or MC control,&#xD;
      which are similar in appearance. Only the AIVITA manufacturing team will be aware of&#xD;
      randomization so that the appropriate product can be manufactured per SOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 3 weekly SC injections of study agent will be administered prior to beginning&#xD;
      adjuvant or salvage chemotherapy. Subsequently study agents will be injected about every 28&#xD;
      days as long as treatment product is available until one month before completion of follow&#xD;
      up, which at the most will be 2.5 years from the start of injections of the study agent.&#xD;
      Depending on the number of study agent doses available, additional leukaphereses and&#xD;
      manufacturing of more study agent may be required if treatment is to continue up to 2.5&#xD;
      years. In previous trials, 8 total injections were given over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous trials each patient-specific batch of DC-ATA was divided into 10 aliquots, 8 of&#xD;
      which were intended for injection. The range of cells was from 1 to over 30 million per&#xD;
      aliquot. However, the clinical trials have consistently suggested that 1 to 2 million cells&#xD;
      is a sufficient dose. Therefore, for this trial each patient-specific batch of DC-ATA will be&#xD;
      divided into aliquots containing 2 million cells (prior to cryopreservation), and after the&#xD;
      initial series of three weekly injections, subsequent injections will be administered up to&#xD;
      two years from the first injection. If the product is used up, a cryopreserved cell line can&#xD;
      be re-expanded and an additional leukapheresis procedure performed in order to make more&#xD;
      AV-GBM-1, if the patient and their physician wish to continue treatment. For patients in the&#xD;
      control arm, this would involve collecting additional monocytes by leukapheresis. If an&#xD;
      additional patient-specific DC-ATA or monocyte batch is required, the patient will undergo a&#xD;
      repeat leukapheresis. For those who were randomized to AV-GBM-1, a GBM cell culture would be&#xD;
      re-established from a cryopreserved sample of the original cell line. If for some reason the&#xD;
      cell line cannot be reestablished, then patients randomized to the AV-GBM-1 arm would receive&#xD;
      injections of their monocytes with GM-CSF to preserve the double-blind conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are determined to have experienced PD while on study may continue AV-GBM-1&#xD;
      treatment in conjunction with any other standard systemic therapy as prescribed by their&#xD;
      managing oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent is to enroll approximately 726 patients for tumor collection to have 690 patients&#xD;
      who are eligible for treatment at the time of randomization and who have granted consent for&#xD;
      participation. Because of the lack of toxicity, there are no restrictions related to&#xD;
      performance status or blood tests at the time of treatment. The key endpoint is OS from date&#xD;
      of first injection after RT/TMZ; secondary endpoints are PFS from date of first injection,&#xD;
      and OS and PFS from date of randomization prior to RT/TMZ. Date of PFS will be determined by&#xD;
      the principal investigator at each site.&#xD;
