  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study of patients with acute mTBI and comparison with&#xD;
      chronic mTBI patients and a cohort without history of TBI or none within 5 years of&#xD;
      enrollment. The patients will be recruited from the eligible population at military medical&#xD;
      centers in the National Capital Region.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients seen with suspected mTBI will undergo standard TBI assessment per institutional&#xD;
      standard operating procedure. Mild TBI will be defined by Department of Defense/Department of&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Consensus- based Classification of Closed TBI Severity. This project will&#xD;
      leverage several existing TBI clinics/programs and benefits from the clinical and technical&#xD;
      knowledge gained from each. All participants will undergo the same screening, eligibility&#xD;
      assessment, informed consent, baseline history/physical, statement of negative pregnancy&#xD;
      status (if applicable), survey questionnaires, VOMS, BESS, King-Devick and abbreviated&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing once. Participants will undergo research MRI twice at time points &gt; 2&#xD;
      weeks apart and one clinical MRI. Blood samples will be collected at each study visit. The&#xD;
      research blood specimens will be processed immediately, frozen and sent to the WRNMMC&#xD;
      Research Laboratory for future biomarker and genomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI imaging findings (common data elements or newer imaging biomarkers discovered during the&#xD;
      initial two-year technical development phase) will be analyzed to determine the most relevant&#xD;
      biomarkers indicative of mTBI injury and/or prognosis for recovery. More advanced correlation&#xD;
      analysis and relative risk regression will be performed to correlate mTBI and PTSD and their&#xD;
      comorbid associations (e.g., depression, anxiety), Statistical tests will be corrected for&#xD;
      multiple comparisons as appropriate.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>A: Acute mTBI</arm_group_label>
    <description>Consists of up to 80 patients with acute mTBI. All acute mTBI subjects will be scanned per the HHI study design at 3 to 5 timepoints relative to their time of injury ( Visit 1 within 72 hours; Visit 2, 7 +/- 4 days; Visit 3, 30 +/- 7 days; Visit 4, 90 +/- 14 days; Visit 5, 180 +/- 30 days from injury). Even though for practicality Visits 1 and 5 are optional, every effort will be made to image as close to the time of acute injury as possible and to complete imaging for all time points.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>B: Control</arm_group_label>
    <description>Consists of 40 age-matched participants described above who will undergo imaging twice on the MAGNUS 3.0T MRI scanner at two distinct time points. The 2 MRI imaging sessions will be at least 2 weeks apart. One of the 2 visits will include a clinical MRI scan using the same MRI acquisition protocols used for Group A. Because age-matched Controls are not expected to exhibit structural and functional changes during the study period, it was not deemed necessary for the interval between scan-visit time points to be identical for all participants in Group B.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>C: Chronic mTBI</arm_group_label>
    <description>Consists of 40 age-matched participants with chronic mTBI (≥6 months and &lt;5 years from mTBI injury to enrollment). Participants in this group will have 1 set of procedures at the Baseline Visit. This cohort will be used to understand functional and structural changes in chronic mTBI patients to identify indications of progression of patients from the acute to chronic phase</description>
