  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is evaluating the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to reduce risky&#xD;
      firearm carriage among a high risk sample of youth reporting recent firearm carriage and&#xD;
      ownership of a smartphone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Firearms are the leading cause of death for U.S. youth; 60% due to homicide. This study will&#xD;
      test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention at reducing risky firearm behaviors among a&#xD;
      high-risk community sample of youth (age 16-24) that report past 3-month firearm carriage and&#xD;
      smartphone ownership. The behavioral intervention consists of 3 remotely delivered therapy&#xD;
      sessions integrating motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and&#xD;
      care management (CM), supported by a smartphone APP that facilitates therapist contact,&#xD;
      conducts automated daily assessments, delivers between session tailored therapy content,&#xD;
      delivers just-in-time Global Positioning System (GPS)-triggered notifications upon entry into&#xD;
      high-risk locations, and aids with utilization of local resources. Recruitment will proceed&#xD;
      in two high-risk communities (Flint, Saginaw), including through the main Emergency&#xD;
      Departments/trauma centers that are located in both cities. Given elevated rates of firearm&#xD;
      violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to community services,&#xD;
      the proposed intervention, if found to be efficacious, has the potential for significant&#xD;
      public health impact.&#xD;
