  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AdimrSC-2f is a subunit protein-based vaccine produced using the baculovirus insect cells&#xD;
      manufacturing process to prevent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The primary goal of&#xD;
      this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the vaccine safety and immunogenicity of AdimrSC-2f in&#xD;
      healthy adult individuals, as compared to placebo.&#xD;

      This will be a Phase I/II, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind within dose cohort,&#xD;
      dose-finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response of AdimrSC-2f&#xD;
      vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthy&#xD;
      adults aged from 18 to 60. Two hundred forty (240) subjects will be sequentially enrolled&#xD;
      from low dose to high dose cohort and then randomized into AdimrSC-2f vaccine group or&#xD;
      matched placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Each enrolled subject will receive a total of 3 doses with&#xD;
      3-week apart by 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection to the deltoid region of non-dominant arm&#xD;
      preferably. All enrolled subjects will be follow their safety and immune response for six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
