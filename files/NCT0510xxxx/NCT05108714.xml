    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine efficiency and safety of injecting a micro-amount&#xD;
      of 2% lidocaine with the commercially available microneedle device MinronJet600 (NanoPass&#xD;
      Technologies Ltd, Israel) (registration number RZN2017/5544 by Federal Service for&#xD;
      Surveillance in Healthcare of Russian Federation) to achieve rapid local anesthesia for&#xD;
      peripheral venous cannulation.&#xD;

      The trial is prospective, randomised, open-label, placebo-controlled. The start date of&#xD;
      patient enrolment was January 29 of 2019. Simple randomization was performed to allocate&#xD;
      subjects into two groups using the Microsoft Excel random number generator. As a result of&#xD;
      randomisation, subjects were allocated into two groups - Group1 and Group2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, each subject from Group1 received injection of local anaesthetic into the left&#xD;
      arm and sterile saline as a placebo into the right arm, the injections were performed with&#xD;
      MicronJet600 and followed by the intravenous cannulation; each subject from Group2 will&#xD;
      receive injection of local anaesthetic into the left arm, which was performed with&#xD;
      MicronJet600 and followed by the intravenous cannulation, with no pre-treatment prior to the&#xD;
      intravenous cannulation in case of the right arm. Pain caused by the cannulations was rated&#xD;
      by the subjects in accordance with 100-point visual analogue scale. Safety parameters was&#xD;
      assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
