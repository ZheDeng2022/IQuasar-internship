      Literature Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject of this research is mechanical ventilation in intensive care with pneumonia&#xD;
      caused by Covid-19 it is aimed at ensuring compliance of patients receiving support with the&#xD;
      application of CPAP. for this purpose, it was aimed to investigate the effect of listening to&#xD;
      music. In CPAP application, positive pressure oxygen is applied to the patient with a mask.&#xD;
      With the breathing rhythm of the device, inconsistency between the patient's spontaneous&#xD;
      respiratory rhythm and high oxygen with positive pressure pushing the patient into the&#xD;
      airways, conscious patient's fear, anger, anxiety, and panic to live and may lead to refusal&#xD;
      of treatment. In this research, music listening will be used to synchronize the rhythm of the&#xD;
      device and the patient's breathing rhythm and to facilitate the adaptation of patients to the&#xD;
      device. CPAP compliance of the patient's arterial blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, tidal volume (mL) Total Respiratory Pressure (cmH20), monitoring of air&#xD;
      leakage (l/min), Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) will be assessed. With music,&#xD;
      adrenergic activity and neuromuscular stimulation can be reduced. Thus, heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and blood pressure decrease. vital signs of patients such as pulse rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate harmonizes with the melody and rhythm of the music. The effect of music,&#xD;
      sound made up of waves depends on the number of vibrations (pitch) and the number of beats&#xD;
      per minute (tempo). Loud voice curtain acts as a psychological stressor and stimulating the&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure is raising. low&#xD;
      pitched fixed, slow and repetitive rhythms by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system&#xD;
      it is known to have a relaxing and relaxing effect. music for relaxation, in a regular rhythm&#xD;
      (60-80 per minute) should be should not be excessively loud and active, fluent, calming like&#xD;
      violin, flute, piano soothing sound should provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music used in nursing care practices and nursing research non-drug one of the methods. Nurses&#xD;
      benefit from the physiological and psychological effects of musical sounds able to solve the&#xD;
      nursing problem. In studies conducted in recent years; health care procedures with music that&#xD;
      there is a close relationship between, can be used in all areas of health, painless, safe,&#xD;
      inexpensive, no side effects it is stated that it is a treatment method. Adaptation to the&#xD;
      CPAP device effect of music a limited number of studies have been found that show. Smith et&#xD;
      al. In 2009; Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome of patients diagnosed they investigated the&#xD;
      effect of listening to music on compliance with CPAP treatment. study 53 men it was realized&#xD;
      with the participation of 44 female patients. Patients receiving CPAP therapy a every night&#xD;
      before going to sleep a voice played with the band. In the results of working It was found&#xD;
      that listening to music had a beneficial effect on compliance with CPAP at 1 month but&#xD;
      improving CPAP use and more extensive research to strengthen long-term compliance explained&#xD;
      that you need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original Value:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to pneumonia due to COVID-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation support in&#xD;
      intensive care to the CPAP device has difficulty adapting. Covid-19 patients facilitating&#xD;
      adaptation to the CPAP device music listening effectively no research has been found. In this&#xD;
      aspect, the work is unique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: H1: Listening to music increases the patient's CPAP compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread Effect:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP in intensive care units if the results from the study support the working hypothesis the&#xD;
      success of the treatment can be increased by listening to music to reduce the incompatibility&#xD;
      of the patients. This situation is related to COVID 19 reduction of related complications,&#xD;
      reduction in hospitalization costs, early discharge and patient it will help increase your&#xD;
      comfort. Publishing the research results in an international journal with the announcement,&#xD;
      it will be used by intensive care nurses all over the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Research: Research is of experimental type Characteristics and Date of the Research&#xD;
      Place: The data of the research are between July - December 2021 betweeni t will be collected&#xD;
      in the Covid Intensive Care Unit at Fethi Sekin City Hospital in Elazig. This the number of&#xD;
      intensive care units and beds varies according to the course of the number of Covid-19 cases&#xD;
      and the need in the hospital along with showing 1-10 intensive care units are in service, the&#xD;
      number of hospitalizations per day is between 4-30 is changing. There are 12-13 beds in each&#xD;
      intensive care unit and a maximum of 10 patients can be admitted to a unit is done. All&#xD;
      patient rooms in the intensive care unit are single occupancy. the physical structure of the&#xD;
      room, its temperature, lighting is similar and ventilation system is negative pressure. The&#xD;
      intense work the duration of CPAP to be applied to the patients in the care is determined by&#xD;
      the doctor's request and should be at least 30 minutes is implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of the research and the sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of the research was carried out at Fethi Sekin City Hospital in Elazig between&#xD;
      September and December 2021. It will consist of patients who are inpatient in the Intensive&#xD;
      Care Unit and need CPAP support. This in the study, a priori power analysis was performed to&#xD;
      determine the sample size. In the power analysis Cohen's standard effect sizes reference&#xD;
      method was chosen. In the power analysis he study was at a significance level of 0.05 at a&#xD;
      95% confidence interval and 80% in the high effect size range to reach the power it was&#xD;
      determined that at least 52 people, 26 in each group, should be reached. Study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were met in order for the power to be over 80% and to meet the parametric&#xD;
      conditions. 30 patients will be included in each suitable group and data will be collected&#xD;
      until a total of 60 patients are reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Experimental and Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients in the intensive care unit at the same hours every day (between 18 and 22 in the&#xD;
      evening) and being included in the study. Experiment and control with the &quot;easy&#xD;
      randomization&quot; method by determining the patients who meet the criteria will be assigned to&#xD;
      the group. Until the determined number is reached by taking a maximum of 2 experimental and 2&#xD;
      control groups every day data collection will continue until.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music Listening to be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recommendation was received from the Turkish Music Research and Promotion Group for the&#xD;
      piece of music to be played. Music therapist and voice artist Andrea Azize Güvenç, from her&#xD;
      music archive, for patients who underwent CPAP he compiled 4 music tracks of 30 minutes in&#xD;
      total in a relaxing and appropriate rhythm. in music the sounds and instruments used are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Müzik: Su - Dombra - Ses,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Music: Su - Kopuz&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Music: Su- Tambourine - Sound&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Music: Water - Dombra - Sound These 4 tracks have been combined as a single sound&#xD;
           recording and will be played to the patients in sequence without interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bluetooth MP3 Player : The music tracks will be loaded into a digital, portable LCD 4GB&#xD;
      rechargeable MP3 music player Bluetooth Headset: The music will be played with over-the-ear,&#xD;
      full size, bluetooth, rechargeable headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables: Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and&#xD;
      respiratory rate of the patients, oxygen Saturation Value, Tidal Volume (mL), Total&#xD;
      Respiratory Pressure (cmH20), Air Leak Monitoring (L/min) are Richmond agitation sedation&#xD;
      scale (RASS) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables: : Music concert&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will visit the intensive care unit at 18-22 pm everyday during this visit&#xD;
      wearing protective equipment will prevent transmission. Patients meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be determined and assigned to the experimental or control group by&#xD;
      randomization. For the patient included in the experimental group determined by&#xD;
      randomization, patient Identification Form before CPAP is administered systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate RASS scores will be&#xD;
      determined and recorded by observation. with CPAP application music concert will start with&#xD;
      the help of ear and systolic blood at the 1st, 15th and 30th minutes of administration&#xD;
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate from the patient monitor,&#xD;
      RASS scores will be recorded again by observation, 1st, 15th and 30th min Oxygen Saturation&#xD;
      Value with CPAP, Tidal Volume (mL), Total Respiratory Pressure (cmH20), Air Leak Monitoring&#xD;
      (L/min) by CPAP monitor will be saved. The pressure and oxygen settings of the CPAP are&#xD;
      determined by the doctor according to the patient's need will be set. Questions to be&#xD;
      answered by the patient regarding the application will be asked before and after the&#xD;
      application. If the patient will continue to receive CPAP, the observation will be terminated&#xD;
      and CPAP will continue. Music the concert will be played with a Blueooth MP3 player and&#xD;
      Bluetooth headphones. Headphones from every use then it will be disinfected, the Mp3 player&#xD;
      is in a disposable plastic bag to prevent contamination the patient will be taken to the&#xD;
      room. CPAP application without music will be applied to the control group and pre-CPAP, CPAP&#xD;
      during the application, the same measurements will be made at the 1st minute, 15th minute and&#xD;
      30th minute. In intensive care silicone masks are used in CPAP application. Mask size is&#xD;
      according to the patient's face size will be set.&#xD;
