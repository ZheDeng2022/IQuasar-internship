      The investigators will carry out multi-center and large sample research based on the Chinese&#xD;
      population, screen the optimal diagnostic and prognosis recognition biomarkers and analyze&#xD;
      the diagnostic critical cutoff values in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, so as to provide a substantial basis for clinical diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      recognition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex disorder that comprises a spectrum of intracranial&#xD;
      pathologies, many of which present diagnostic challenges. Detection of intracranial injuries&#xD;
      after TBI relies on head CT, which is overused and resource intensive. Prior studies have&#xD;
      shown the potential for blood-based brain injury biomarkers to predict the absence of&#xD;
      intracranial injury after TBI and aid in reducing unnecessary head CT use. Furthermore,&#xD;
      plasma biomarker concentrations in the acute phase after TBI identified patients with a&#xD;
      suspected TBI and normal head CT who had detectable pathology on MRI. However, most of the&#xD;
      current studies are based on the European and American population, and whether the research&#xD;
      results are applicable to the Chinese population remains to be studied. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will carry out multi-center and large sample research based on the Chinese&#xD;
      population, screen the optimal diagnostic and prognosis recognition biomarkers and analyze&#xD;
      the diagnostic critical cutoff values, so as to provide a substantial basis for clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis recognition.&#xD;
