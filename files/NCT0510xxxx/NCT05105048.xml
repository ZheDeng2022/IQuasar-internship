      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is a Japanese Adult 18-40 years of age at the time of consent who, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, is in good health based on review of medical history and&#xD;
             screening physical examination. Japanese participants are defined as individuals born&#xD;
             in Japan, with both parents and 4 grandparents who were born in Japan, and who have&#xD;
             not lived outside of Japan for more than 10 years in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the CMV-seronegative groups: Participant is serum CMV IgG negative/ IgM negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the CMV-seropositive groups: Participant is either serum CMV IgG positive/IgM&#xD;
             negative or IgG positive/IgM positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a body mass index (BMI) from ≥18 kilograms (kg)/square meter (m^2) to&#xD;
             ≤35 kg/m^2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a diagnosis or condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, is&#xD;
             clinically unstable or may affect participant safety, assessment of safety endpoints,&#xD;
             assessment of immune response, or adherence to study procedures. Clinically unstable&#xD;
             is defined as a diagnosis or condition requiring significant changes in management or&#xD;
             medication within the 2 months prior to screening and includes ongoing workup of an&#xD;
             undiagnosed illness that could lead to a new diagnosis or condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has elevated liver function tests, defined as aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or elevated&#xD;
             creatinine or reduced platelets, with a toxicity score of Grade &gt;1 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has laboratory test results (hematology, chemistry, and coagulation) with&#xD;
             a toxicity score of Grade ≥1 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received or plans to receive any non-study vaccine within &lt; 28 days prior to any study&#xD;
             injection; in addition, the following criteria for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines&#xD;
             apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Any COVID-19 vaccination series must have been completed a minimum of 28 days prior&#xD;
             to receiving any dose of the study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. COVID-19 vaccines (regardless of manufacturer) must be administered at least 28 days&#xD;
        prior to or after any study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. Influenza vaccines may be administered &gt;14 days prior to or after any study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received systemic immunosuppressants or immune-modifying drugs for &gt;14&#xD;
             days in total within 6 months before the day of first injection (Day 1) (for&#xD;
             corticosteroids, &gt;5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent) or plans to do so during the&#xD;
             course of the study. Inhaled, nasal, and topical steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received an antiviral with activity against CMV (ganciclovir,&#xD;
             valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, letermovir, acyclovir, valacyclovir) within 2&#xD;
             weeks before the first injection or plans to do so during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant received any investigational CMV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
