  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial aims to identify if skills acquired during aquatic exercise are&#xD;
      more effectively transferred to a reactive balance task than land exercise. This study is&#xD;
      designed as a double-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty-four older adults&#xD;
      aged 60 years or above who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
      into an aquatic exercise group or land exercise group. Each group will participate in the&#xD;
      same balance training exercise during a single session that includes a ball throwing and&#xD;
      catching task. A modified lean-and-release test will be implemented on land immediately&#xD;
      before, after, and one week after the training session. The outcomes will include reaction&#xD;
      time, rapid response accuracy, and mini-BESTest scores obtained from stepping and grasping&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the modified lean-and-release test, there are two possible settings: 1) the leg block&#xD;
      is placed in front of both legs, and a safety handle is uncovered; or 2) the leg block is&#xD;
      removed, and the safety handle is covered. The leg block and handle cover will be controlled&#xD;
      via computer-triggered, servo motors. The testing session will be comprised of three blocks:&#xD;
      1) REACH (grasping a safety handle using their right hand while maintaining both feet fixed),&#xD;
      2) STEP (stepping forward using any leg), and 3) RANDOM (random variations of STEP and&#xD;
      REACH).&#xD;
