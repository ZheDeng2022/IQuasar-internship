      The study was conducted on patients registered to the Ministry of Health Kartal Dr. Lütfi&#xD;
      Kırdar City Hospital Adatepe Community Mental Health Center and was followed up regularly. It&#xD;
      was carried out on 108 individuals who met the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the&#xD;
      DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association 2013) and met the inclusion criteria. Individuals who&#xD;
      were respectively classified as hospitalized group (HG) during the Covid-19 pandemic period&#xD;
      (n=39), non-hospitalized with emergency care group (NHECG) without hospitalization (n=37),&#xD;
      and non-hospitalized with non-emergency care group (NHNECG) (n=32). Individuals who had been&#xD;
      diagnosed with schizophrenia for at least two years, were not in the active phase of the&#xD;
      disease, did not have organic mental disorders, did not have any other psychiatric diseases&#xD;
      were included in the study. In the study, the Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Calgary&#xD;
      Depression Scale in Schizophrenia (CDSS), the Buss-perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ), and&#xD;
      the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) were used.&#xD;

    <measure>Calgary Depression Scale in Schizophrenia</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by Addington et al. (1994) to measure the presence of depression and the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. 19 The scale consists of 9 items to assess depression and is answered with a four-point Likert scale.The validity and reliability of the scale in&#xD;
schizophrenia patients in the Turkish population was determined by Oksay et al. by (2000). In the reliability study, the Cronbach&amp;#39;s alpha coefficient was found to be 0.88. The cut-off point of the scale was stated as 11.</description>

    <measure>Buss-perry Aggression Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>

Questions 9 and 16 on the scale are reverse scored. The score value on the scale varies in direct proportion to the aggression, that is, the higher the score, the higher the aggression. The Cronbach Alpha internal consistency coefficients of the original version of the scale is defined as; 0.89 for physical aggression, 0.85 for physical aggression, 0.72 for verbal aggression, 0.77 for hostility, 0.83 for anger subscale.</description>
