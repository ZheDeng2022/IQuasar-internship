  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization advocates for breastfeeding as the best source of food for&#xD;
      optimal infant development, which reduces the risk of infant mortality and morbidity. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of a father-involvement breastfeeding&#xD;
      telephone support intervention on prevalence and duration of exclusive breastfeeding,&#xD;
      postnatal depression and parent-infant bonding. The intervention consists of four weekly&#xD;
      20-30 minutes telephone-administered counselling sessions on breastfeeding, delivered&#xD;
      individually in the first month postpartum for mothers and fathers. We expect that women who&#xD;
      receive the intervention will have a higher rate and longer duration of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, fewer depressive symptoms and better parent-child relationship. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained from this study can provide direction for the development of flexible, accessible and&#xD;
      culturally sensitive interventions to promote breastfeeding and mental health in Chinese&#xD;
      society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended as the most beneficial form of infant nutrition during&#xD;
      the first 6 months of life, which protects infants against childhood illness and reduces the&#xD;
      risk of infant mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate a&#xD;
      breastfeeding telephone support intervention that involves mothers and fathers during the&#xD;
      postpartum period. The objectives are to evaluate the effect of a father-involvement&#xD;
      breastfeeding telephone support intervention on prevalence and duration of exclusive&#xD;
      breastfeeding, postnatal depression and parent-infant bonding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mothers who receive the father-involvement telephone support intervention will have a&#xD;
           higher rate and a longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months&#xD;
           postpartum than those who receive the standard postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mothers and fathers who receive the intervention will have: (a) fewer depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, and (b) better parent-infant bonding at 2 and 6 months postpartum than those&#xD;
           who receive the standard postpartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: Randomized controlled trial. A sample of postpartum mothers (n = 738)&#xD;
      and fathers (n = 738) will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Postpartum Bonding&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PBQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention consists of four weekly 20-30 minutes telephone-administered&#xD;
      counselling sessions on breastfeeding, delivered individually in the first month postpartum&#xD;
      for mothers and fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: The prevalence and duration of exclusive breastfeeding will be&#xD;
      collected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months postpartum. Postnatal depression and parent-infant boding&#xD;
      will be assessed by the EPDS and the PBQ, respectively, at 2 and 6 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Generalized linear mixed models and survival analysis will be conducted to&#xD;
      compare differences in the outcomes between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential application: The implementation of a simple, brief telephone-based intervention for&#xD;
      breastfeeding families is most likely to be taken up in the primary health care setting. The&#xD;
      results may better equip policy makers and health professionals to design health promotion&#xD;
      programs for breastfeeding families, thus reducing the public health burden of childhood&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
