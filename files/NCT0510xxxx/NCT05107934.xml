    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of RPH-104&#xD;
      treatment in patients with recurrent pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of RPH-104 multiple doses in this patient&#xD;
      population will be assessed as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2/3 seamless design study with one interim efficacy analysis. At stage 1&#xD;
      (assuming possible 10% dropout rate in run-in period and screening), around 25 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled. At least 20 patients will be randomized to receive either RPH-104 treatment or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the interim analysis, the enrollment won't be paused. Based on interim analysis&#xD;
      results the study could be continued or closed. In the case of study continuation, the final&#xD;
      estimated sample size is at least 72 patients to be randomized in the withdrawal period&#xD;
      (including 20 or more patients randomized in the Stage 1 of the study). Assuming possible 10%&#xD;
      dropout in run-in period and 45% dropout in screening period, approximately enrollment of 80&#xD;
      subjects are planned and around 146 subjects will be screened in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consists of five following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (up to 4 weeks). The patients' eligibility for the study will be&#xD;
           evaluated based on the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Run-in (RI) single-blind treatment period (16 weeks) will include single- blind&#xD;
           treatment with RPH-104 at a dose 160 mg subcutaneous (SC) on Day 0, and 80 mg on Day 7,&#xD;
           Day 14 and thereafter once in two weeks (Q2W) for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RI period includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2-weeks Stabilization period, during which blinded RPH-104 is administered on top&#xD;
                of standard of care (SOC) pericarditis therapy, and the ongoing pericarditis&#xD;
                episode is treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10- week Weaning period, during which patients are gradually tapered and stopped&#xD;
                background SOC pericarditis therapy, while treatment with blinded RPH-104&#xD;
                continues. corticosteroids (CS) and analgesics (opioid and non-opioid) dose will be&#xD;
                tapered starting at RI week 2 and will be stopped by Week 12. NSAIDs and colchicine&#xD;
                will be tapered starting at RI Week 6 and will be stopped by Week 12. Opioid&#xD;
                analgesics can be continued after Week 12 at stable doses through the end of the OL&#xD;
                period if cannot be discontinued without withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4-week Monotherapy period: patients who stopped of background SOC pericarditis&#xD;
                therapy will continue to receive blinded RPH-104.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who discontinue SOC therapy and achieve clinical response at Week 16 are&#xD;
           eligible for randomization in the randomized withdrawal (RW) period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomized withdrawal (RW) period (24 weeks) includes double-blind treatment with&#xD;
           RPH-104 80 mg or placebo Q2W depending on the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Open-label treatment period (OL) (12 weeks). After completion of the RW period, all&#xD;
           subjects that did not discontinue study drug will be transferred to Open-Label (OL)&#xD;
           period and will receive open-label RPH-104 80 mg once in two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety follow-up period includes monitoring of safety for 8 weeks after the last dosing&#xD;
           of the study drug for patients who decided not to participate in open label extension&#xD;
           long-term safety study (CL04018108).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total maximal duration of the study for an individual subject will be approximately 64&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
