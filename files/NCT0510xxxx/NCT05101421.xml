      Ceramides have been added to newer cosmetic products to improve skin barrier function and&#xD;

      are the most effective at restoring barrier function and increasing skin hydration. Different&#xD;
      ceramides have been incorporated into cosmetic formulations, but understanding the&#xD;
      differences between ceramides used in formulations, or even identifying ceramides in&#xD;
      formulations can be complex. This is mostly because of an archaic nomenclature system that is&#xD;
      fundamentally flawed based on current scientific evidence. In the recent past, due to the&#xD;
      unique bioactive components of rice, it has been explored to a certain limit for its&#xD;
      components. Further, much attention has been paid to the plant ceramide with its&#xD;
      incorporation into cosmetics and food preparations owing to its safety in contrast to&#xD;
      animal/synthetic origin. There are reports on plant ceramide deciphering its protective&#xD;
      effects on human skin by preventing moisture loss. It has been anticipated that ceramides,&#xD;
      fatty acids, and cholesterol in combination with hydrocortisone (HC) can be an useful&#xD;
      therapeutic agents against xerosis and atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effects of oral intake of plant-derived ceramides for skin hydration and skin&#xD;
      barrier reinforcement have been established in several studies involving animal models as&#xD;

      atopic dermatitis patients as well as healthy volunteers. Results showed improved skin&#xD;
      symptoms and reduced skin allergic responses. The foregoing studies support the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of oral intake of plant ceramides and their potential complementary and alternative&#xD;
      therapeutic applications in the restoration and maintenance of skin barrier function.&#xD;
      However, the findings from human study are still very limited, more detailed and&#xD;

      EFFECTS OF RICE CERAMIDES IN IMPROVING SKIN HEALTH - STUDY PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceramides are important structural components of the epidermis, which plays a key role in&#xD;
      maintaining homeostasis of the human body. Specifically, its outermost layer, known as the&#xD;
      stratum corneum, forms a barrier between the external environment and the internal body. This&#xD;
      barrier function serves multiple purposes including prevention of water loss and protection&#xD;
      from foreign insult. The structure of the stratum corneum is often referred to as ''brick and&#xD;
      mortar''. The ''bricks'' are terminally differentiated keratinocytes composed mostly of&#xD;
      keratin filaments and filaggrin. The ''mortar'' is composed of intercellular lipids arranged&#xD;
      into lamellar layers consisting of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Ceramides&#xD;
      are the predominant lipid comprising approximately 50% of the intercellular lipid content by&#xD;
      mass. Stratum corneum lipids are essential for maintaining skin barrier function and&#xD;
      preventing transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Disruptions or damage to the stratum corneum can&#xD;
      impair skin barrier function and result in TEWL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceramides have been added to newer cosmetic products to improve skin barrier function and&#xD;
      exogenously replenish skin ceramides. Of the stratum corneum intercellular lipids, Ceramides&#xD;
      are the most effective at restoring barrier function and increasing skin hydration. Different&#xD;
      ceramides have been incorporated into cosmetic formulations, but understanding the&#xD;
      differences between ceramides used in formulations, or even identifying ceramides in&#xD;
      formulations can be complex. This is mostly because of an archaic nomenclature system that is&#xD;
      fundamentally flawed based on current scientific evidence. In the recent past, due to the&#xD;
      unique bioactive components of rice, it has been explored to a certain limit for its&#xD;
      components. Further, much attention has been paid to the plant ceramide with its&#xD;
      incorporation into cosmetics and food preparations owing to its safety in contrast to&#xD;
      animal/synthetic origin. There are reports on plant ceramide deciphering its protective&#xD;
      effects on human skin by preventing moisture loss. It has been anticipated that ceramides,&#xD;
      fatty acids, and cholesterol in combination with hydrocortisone (HC) can be an useful&#xD;
      therapeutic agents against xerosis and atopic dermatitis. In addition, report also showed&#xD;
      that topical emulsions containing ceramides possessed anti-inflammatory and skin beneficial&#xD;
      properties. Hence, isolation of ceramide from natural source possessing anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      skin protective properties becomes vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effects of oral intake of plant-derived ceramides for skin hydration and skin&#xD;
      barrier reinforcement have been established in several studies involving animal models as&#xD;
      well as human subjects. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted on&#xD;
      women with dry skin to investigate the moisturizing effect of dietary supplement containing&#xD;
      wheat extract enriched with ceramides and digalactosyldiglycerides (DGDG). According to the&#xD;
      finding, there was a significant increase in skin hydration with improved associated clinical&#xD;
      signs (itching, squamae, roughness, and redness). Ingestion of konjac ceramides has also&#xD;
      shown positive effects in atopic dermatitis patients as well as healthy volunteers. Results&#xD;
      showed improved skin symptoms and reduced skin allergic responses . The foregoing studies&#xD;
      support the beneficial effects of oral intake of plant ceramides and their potential&#xD;
      complementary and alternative therapeutic applications in the restoration and maintenance of&#xD;
      skin barrier function. However, the findings from human study are still very limited, more&#xD;
      detailed and comprehensive studies are still required to document the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      oral supplementation of ceramides. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of rice&#xD;
      ceramides consumption in improving skin health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of rice ceramides consumption in improving skin health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open-label, single arm, prospective interventional study that involves&#xD;
      three-months period of rice ceramides (komercera) supplementation. Fifty subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited via convenient sampling for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty subjects are required to consume rice ceramides (komecera) supplements at the dosage of&#xD;
      40mg, one vegetarian capsule per day. Monthly follow-up for the duration of 3 months will be&#xD;
      conducted to allow sufficient time for the changes to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good general healthy subjects who are free from any skin diseases, aged 20 to 45 and willing&#xD;
      to comply with rice ceramides consumption plan will be recruited. Participant with underlying&#xD;
      skin medical condition such as eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis or&#xD;
      vitiligo, undergoing medication plan, currently taking antimicrobial or antiviral medication,&#xD;
      undergone major surgical procedures in the past six months, pregnant or lactating woman will&#xD;
      be excluded from this study. All the study participants will be provided with a participant&#xD;
      information sheet, briefly containing the research detail and a written informed consent will&#xD;
      also be sought from each recruited participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will be conducted at baseline when they were first recruited, and also during&#xD;
      their 3 times monthly follow ups. Participants will be remunerated with RM200 vouchers by the&#xD;
      end of the study to compensate the time they spent in this research. Location of recruitment&#xD;
      will be at public settings in Klang Valley.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of rice ceramides in improving the overall skin health will be assessed using&#xD;
      the parameters below: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total Wrinkle Score (TWS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin firmness and elasticity (Courage &amp; Khazaka Cutometer®, MPA580)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin hydration (Courage &amp; Khazaka Corneometer®, CM825)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transepidermal Water Loss and Skin Barrier Function (Courage &amp; Khazaka Tewameter®, TM&#xD;
           300)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin whitening (Courage &amp; Khazaka Mexameter®, MX18)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sebum Secretion (Courage &amp; Khazaka Sebumeter®, SM815)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin pH (Courage &amp; Khazaka pH meter®, PH900)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment mentioned above will be carried out using Multiprobe Adapter System (MPA),&#xD;
      which is a non-invasive assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Self-Perceived Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will also be required to do a self-perceived Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to reflect&#xD;
      their self-perceived changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics will be presented as categorical data, expressed in frequency and&#xD;
      percentage. All outcomes will be analyzed as continuous dependent variables, presented as&#xD;
      mean ± SD. The changes in clinical assessment from baseline visit to last follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be analyzed using general linear model (GLM) for repeated measures model.&#xD;
      Within-subjects factor will be defined as the sampling time point. Gender and age will be&#xD;
      tested as between-subject effect. Homogeneity of the variance and covariance structure of the&#xD;
      dependent variables will be assessed by Levene and Box M tests. Sphericity test of the&#xD;
      residual covariance matrix will be assessed using Mauchly's sphericity test. Results will&#xD;
      only be considered significant if P&lt;0.05 with 95% of confidence interval. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM Corp., New York, United States) for MacOS.&#xD;
