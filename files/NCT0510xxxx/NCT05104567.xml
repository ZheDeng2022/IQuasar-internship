    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 2 non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center study assessing&#xD;
      the clinical benefit of SAR444245 (THOR-707) combined with other anticancer therapies for the&#xD;
      treatment of participants aged 18 years and older with advanced and metastatic&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancer. This study is structured as a master protocol for the investigation&#xD;
      of SAR444245 with other anticancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 01 - Cohort A aims to establish proof-of-concept that combining the non-alpha-IL2&#xD;
      SAR444245 with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab will result in a significant increase in&#xD;
      the percentage of patients experiencing an objective response in the setting of advanced&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic ESCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 02 - Cohort B1, B2 and B3 would focus on non MSI-H tumors with a large unmet need&#xD;
      to establish proof-of-concept that combining the non-alpha-IL2 SAR444245 with the anti-PD1&#xD;
      antibody pembrolizumab will result in a significant increase in the percentage of patients&#xD;
      experiencing an objective response in the setting of advanced unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      gastric cancer or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJ), especially with low&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression or after progression on prior PD1/PD-L1-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 03 - Cohort C aims to establish proof-of-concept that combining the non-alpha-IL2&#xD;
      SAR444245 with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab will result in a significant increase in&#xD;
      the percentage of patients experiencing an objective response in participants with advanced&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic HCC who relapsed on prior PD1/PD-L1-based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 04 - Cohort D1 and D2 aims to establish proof-of-concept that combining the&#xD;
      non-alpha-IL2 SAR444245 with either the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab or with the anti-EGFR&#xD;
      IgG1 antibody cetuximab will result in a significant increase in the percentage of patients&#xD;
      experiencing an objective response in the setting of advanced unresectable or mCRC.&#xD;

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will start from the signature of the main&#xD;
      informed consent and include a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatment period [max 35&#xD;
      cycles {cohort A; B1,B2, B3, C and D1} = 735 days or until PD {cohort D2}], an&#xD;
      end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug (or&#xD;
      until the patient receives another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier), and a follow-up&#xD;
      visit 3 months after treatment discontinuation and every 3 months following, until disease&#xD;
      progression, or initiation of another antitumor treatment, or death, whichever is earlier&#xD;
