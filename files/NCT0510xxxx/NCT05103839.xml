    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of yoga&#xD;
      classes for persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners. A secondary aim of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the impact of yoga on caregiver burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the D-Care Study in dyads. Both the caregiver and person&#xD;
      with dementia must agree to participate. Screening will be done either in clinics or by&#xD;
      telephone in the participants' homes. The intervention will be conducted in community&#xD;
      facilities and participants' homes. The sample size will consist of 10 caregiver/person with&#xD;
      dementia dyads. This number was chosen to provide evidence of feasibility of conducting yoga&#xD;
      classes with dyads.&#xD;
