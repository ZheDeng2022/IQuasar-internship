  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, dose expansion, and&#xD;
      clinical expansion study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of HLX301 administered as a single-agent by IV infusion every&#xD;
      2 weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies, who have failed&#xD;
      or are intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available. This&#xD;
      study has three parts: phase 1a dose escalation, phase 1b dose expansion, and phase 2&#xD;
      clinical expansion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 150 patients will be included in this study. Up to 30 DLT evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in phase 1a (dose escalation), 40 per-protocol treated patients in phase 1b (dose&#xD;
      expansion), and 80 per-protocol treated patients in phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1a uses the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      determine the MTD of HLX301. BOIN design combines rule-based and model-based design, allowing&#xD;
      for flexibility of dose escalation and de-escalation, and high patient enrollment in doses&#xD;
      closest to the target toxicity rate (pre-defined as 30% in this study). This study will also&#xD;
      evaluate safety profiles at different dose levels, PK parameters, pharmacodynamic markers,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and the preliminary efficacy of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following dose escalation and determination of the MTD, additional patients with NSCLC will&#xD;
      be enrolled in phase 1b dose expansion to further evaluate PK and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      characteristics, and preliminary efficacy in order to determine the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 clinical expansion will include patients with various cancer types, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 per-protocol treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 20 per-protocol&#xD;
      treated patients with gastric/esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (GC/EGJ) 20&#xD;
      per-protocol treated patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 20&#xD;
      per-protocol treated patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC)&#xD;
