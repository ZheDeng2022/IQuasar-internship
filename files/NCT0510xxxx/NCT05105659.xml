  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies showed the negative impact thalassemia disease and its therapy have on the&#xD;
      cognition of these patients. This study aims to assess and compare the cognition,&#xD;
      psychological impact and quality of life among patients with B thalassemia major, requiring&#xD;
      regular blood transfusion, patients with B thalassemia intermedia, who don't, and healthy&#xD;
      controls. Thus, estimating the role of blood transfusion and hemosiderosis in cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, psychological symptoms, and low quality of life in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is one the most common autosomal recessive haemolytic diseases both worldwide and&#xD;
      in the middle east. (1) Beta-thalassemia is a disorder characterized by the congenital&#xD;
      absence of the beta chain synthesis of the haemoglobin tetramer, In healthy individuals the&#xD;
      haemoglobin chain consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta globin chains, as a result the absence of 2&#xD;
      beta chains in the b thalassemia patients results in clinical symptoms as pallor and failure&#xD;
      to thrive. (2,3,4) These patients thus rely on blood transfusions for their entire lives,&#xD;
      unless they undergo bone marrow transplant, exposing them to many complications both&#xD;
      organically and psychologically. (5) Other patients with b thalassemia whose anaemia doesn't&#xD;
      require regular blood transfusion are considered to have B thalassemia intermediate. (6)B&#xD;
      thalassemia is among one the most common haemoglobinopathies in Egypt, estimating t 1000/ 1.5&#xD;
      million per year live births born with thalassemia disease. (7) Attention, orientation,&#xD;
      memory, gnosis, and executive functions are among some of the cognitive functions that enable&#xD;
      an individual to perceive, store, interpret and restore information from the surrounding. (8)&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patients with B thalassemia have impairment in most of these&#xD;
      cognitive functions in comparison to their healthy counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      psychological problems as stress, anxiety, and depression are some of the psychological&#xD;
      disorders that negatively impact the lives of thalassemia patients and may cause multiple&#xD;
      comorbidities if not managed properly (9) Quality of life is assessed by focusing on the&#xD;
      person's own view of his/her life and his/her well-being taking any conditions or issues that&#xD;
      may affect the person's life into consideration. (10) Multiple studies showed the negative&#xD;
      impact thalassemia disease and its therapy have on the cognition of these patients. This&#xD;
      study aims to assess and compare the cognition, psychological impact and quality of life&#xD;
      among patients with B thalassemia major, requiring regular blood transfusion, patients with B&#xD;
      thalassemia intermedia, who don't, and healthy controls. Thus, estimating the role of blood&#xD;
      transfusion and hemosiderosis in cognitive impairment, psychological symptoms, and low&#xD;
      quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
