    <textblock>
      The Swiss Patient Registry for DMD/BMD and SMA was launched in 2008 in order to give Swiss&#xD;
      patients access to new therapies. It was founded with the financial support of several&#xD;
      patient organizations and research foundations. Since 2008, children, adolescents and adults&#xD;
      with DMD, BMD and SMA are registered with the help of all major muscle centers in&#xD;
      Switzerland. After nearly ten years of activity, the Swiss Patient Registry for DMD/BMD and&#xD;
      SMA implemented several adaptations in 2018 to meet current and future expectations of&#xD;
      patient's organizations, health authorities and research organizations.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Swiss registry for neuromuscular disorders' (Swiss-Reg-NMD) collects medical information&#xD;
      from people with neuromuscular disorders. It is led by specialized physicians from all over&#xD;
      Switzerland and located at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) in Bern.&#xD;
      The registry includes children and adults living or treated in Switzerland who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with Duchenne-Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD/BMD), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and recently&#xD;
      also merosin-deficient muscular dystrophy also called LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (MDC1A&#xD;
      respectively LAMA2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swiss Registry for neuromuscular disorders was initially founded in 2008 to give Swiss&#xD;
      patients with a neuromuscular disease access to new therapies. In 2018, the registry was&#xD;
      reorganized to meet new legal requirements and expectations of patients and research&#xD;
      organizations. The Swiss Ethics Commission approved the project (project ID: 2018-00289,&#xD;
      observational study, risk category A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMDs are rare diseases with few patients scattered across the country. A national patient&#xD;
      registry with a centralized registration facilitates the participation of Swiss patients in&#xD;
      therapeutic trials and the creation of Swiss trial sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of the Swiss-Reg-NMD project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a representative population-based Swiss cohort of children, adolescents and&#xD;
           adults with NMDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide epidemiological data to investigate the incidence, prevalence, spectrum of&#xD;
           diagnosis, survival rates and mortality of NMDs in Switzerland&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide a platform for clinical research:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Offer a resource to recruit Swiss patients in current and future national and&#xD;
                international therapeutic trials or observational studies&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Offer a resource to facilitate the establishment of therapeutic trial sites in&#xD;
                Switzerland&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Answer questions in the following areas: health, health care, social-,&#xD;
                educational-, professional-, economic aspects, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Offer a resource for post-marketing surveillance (effects and side effects of&#xD;
                therapies/treatments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provide a platform for communication:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Promote the exchange of knowledge between clinics, researchers, therapists and&#xD;
                national and cantonal health authorities in particular regarding standards of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Facilitate national and international collaborations, in particular with the&#xD;
                international registry of TREAT-NMD and the upcoming Swiss Registry for Rare&#xD;
                Diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children, adolescents and adults living or treated in Switzerland who are diagnosed with&#xD;
      a NMD. The diagnosis needs to be confirmed, whenever possible, by genetic testing, or at&#xD;
      least by biopsy and/or electroneuromyography, according to international standards for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the given NMD. Once the diagnosis is established, there is no specific exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients with SMA, DMD/BMD, merosin-deficient muscular dystrophy also called&#xD;
      LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (MDC1A respectively LAMA2) and Collagen 6 related muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a NMD diagnosis, the treating physician informs the patient and the parents (if the&#xD;
      patient is still a child) during a consultation in a clinic or practice in writing and orally&#xD;
      about the Swiss-Reg-NMD. The patient/parents who wish to participate sign the consent form&#xD;
      and the patient is registered in the Swiss-Reg-NMD. If the patient/parents do not wish to&#xD;
      participate, only a minimal anonymous data set is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from questionnaires for patients and families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from links to routine statistics and other medical registries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data (report of new cases and follow-up reports): NMD subtype, severity, and&#xD;
      associated conditions; Comorbidities; Medical care and medication; Therapies; (Serious)&#xD;
      adverse events; Hospitalisations; Motor Function Assessments; Socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire data: We will collect data through questionnaires with a focus on (but not&#xD;
      exclusively):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related questions like nutrition, sleep, pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health behaviours (e.g., physical activity, smoking)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical equipment use (type, usage, satisfaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments and therapies: frequency, intensity, start, types&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life and participation (involvement in a life situation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social-economic factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education (early childhood education, school, professional integration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient/caregiver reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needs and concerns of persons with NMDs and their families&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine data and linkages: e.g. Federal Statistical Office (e.g. birth registry, cause of&#xD;
      death statistics, hospital statistics); Swiss National Cohort (socioeconomic data, family&#xD;
      information); other medical registries (e.g. rare disease registry); Communities of residence&#xD;
      (vital status, date of death, address).&#xD;

      Data protection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data generation, transmission, storage and analysis of health related personal data within&#xD;
      this project will follow strictly the current Swiss legal requirements for data protection.&#xD;
      Data analyses will always be done using pseudonymised datasets. Health related personal data&#xD;
      captured during this project are strictly confidential. Project data shall be handled with&#xD;
      uttermost discretion and only be accessible to authorized personnel. Direct access to source&#xD;
      documents will be permitted for purposes of monitoring, audits or inspections. The data&#xD;
      protection concept of ISPM ensures the secure handling of all sensitive data at ISPM and&#xD;
      within Swiss-Reg-NMD. The Swiss-Reg-NMD team is responsible for the implementation and&#xD;
      compliance with the confidentiality and data security measures.&#xD;
