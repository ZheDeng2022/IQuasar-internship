  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to protect their new renal graft, post-transplant patients follow a rigorous&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy combined with prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients are prescribed long-term immunosuppression maintenance regimens that are the&#xD;
      prophylaxis of organ rejection. The most frequently used are calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
      (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) combined with glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone, prednisone)&#xD;
      and antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine). However, the use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication in transplanted patients have well-documented limitations.&#xD;
      Recent studies reported major changes in microbiota composition as a result of&#xD;
      immunosuppression use. A large majority of transplant patients develops severe GI problems,&#xD;
      with the most common complication being post-transplant diarrhea. Several studies have&#xD;
      assessed and confirmed negative effects of post-transplant diarrhea. According to (3, 4),&#xD;
      post-transplant diarrhea affects 1 in 5 patients in the first year after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation and is associated with decreased quality of life, allograft failure, and even&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Challenges faced by patients after kidney transplantation prompted providers to look for&#xD;
      additional strategies to improve their quality of life and decrease graft risks. In daily&#xD;
      practice, investigators noted that a good percentage of transplant patients develops&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, particularly diarrhea. In literature, this is known as&#xD;
      Immunosuppression Acquired Diarrhea (IAD). These episodes are especially distressing and&#xD;
      usually lead to immunosuppressive medication being reduced in dose or stopped. As a result of&#xD;
      these actions, transplant patients become exposed to rejection, graft loss, and even death.&#xD;
      Considering how the microbiota is altered during the post-transplant medication regimen,&#xD;
      restoring the gut balance through the administration of probiotics presents a suitable&#xD;
      solution. The proposed research would help increase knowledge on the beneficial effects and&#xD;
      safety of probiotics in post-transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea is a very common and severe complication in post-transplant patients. In the&#xD;
      majority of the cases, it is categorized as unspecified noninfectious diarrhea (1, 3).&#xD;
      Transplant physicians associate it with immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      (MMF) (7) and other agents such as tacrolimus, azathioprine, and adrenal corticosteroids that&#xD;
      are the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving allogenic renal transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common strategy to reduce post-transplant noninfectious diarrhea is the reduction of&#xD;
      MMF dosing (4). Many times, the diarrhea events are so severe that the recipient's&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications are tapered, changed or stopped. As a result, patients become&#xD;
      at risk of early acute rejection and graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a large body of literature that offers information about the etiology of diarrhea&#xD;
      for these patients. The main cause is an alteration in microbiota composition - a condition&#xD;
      known as dysbiosis. Offering great insight, Swarat et al., (8) wrote, &quot;the microbiota is able&#xD;
      to induce disease (10, 12) and also able to regulate immunity or tolerance. An imbalance&#xD;
      between pathogenic and protective microbes characterizes dysbiosis, a perturbation in the&#xD;
      normal composition of commensal microbiota&quot;. In the post-transplant patient population, the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen and use of prophylactic antimicrobial treatments create new&#xD;
      post-transplant microbiota communities. In literature, dysbiosis is associated with clinical&#xD;
      conditions and systematic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four main phyla found in the GI tract are known to contribute to human health and disease:&#xD;
      Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with the majority of species&#xD;
      being non-pathogenic [13]. These commensal microbes play an important role in immune&#xD;
      regulation, nutrition, and maintenance of host barriers against pathogens [14, 15]. It was&#xD;
      reported that during diarrhea episodes (dysbiosis) in post-transplant patients, there is an&#xD;
      increase in Proteobacteria and a decrease in Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, and&#xD;
      Dorea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are clinical trials offering information about microbiota composition in&#xD;
      patients with diarrhea, there is not much information that links it to probiotic use after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this clinical trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate if daily use of low dose probiotics is effective in alleviating symptoms&#xD;
           of diarrhea as well as lowering pro-inflammatory and inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
           increasing anti-inflammatory biomarkers in renal transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize microbiota in subjects with and without diarrhea and determine if there&#xD;
           is any correlation between microbiota content and pro-inflammatory, inflammatory, and&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
