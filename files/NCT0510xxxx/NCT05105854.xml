  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with painful hand osteoarthritis are invited to take part in this observational cohort&#xD;
      study. The course of hand pain can vary and is not well understood - some people seem to have&#xD;
      short episodes of worsening pain ('flares') and the trend (or 'trajectory') over a longer&#xD;
      period of time may be of improvement, staying stable or worsening. The study aims to identify&#xD;
      and define different pain trajectories in hand OA, including factors which may predict the&#xD;
      future course of pain in the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, currently all study related activities are being carried out&#xD;
      remotely (online, by post, by phone).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant reports a diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis made by a health care&#xD;
             professional OR (Optional inclusion, for review after 3 months*) The participant&#xD;
             reports a diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Given the Covid-19 pandemic, it is not clear if requiring a health care&#xD;
                  professional diagnosis will limit participation in the study. If, after 3 months&#xD;
                  of recruitment, fewer than 24 participants have been recruited, self-reported&#xD;
                  diagnosis, supported by additional materials available on the study website or by&#xD;
                  discussion with a study team member by phone will be acceptable. Numbers in each&#xD;
                  of these two categories will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Two or more painful hand joints: interphalangeal and/or base of thumb&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hand pain on most days of the last month i.e. â‰¥15 days in the last month&#xD;
&#xD;

             haemochromatosis or connective tissue disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or previous diagnosis of psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional condition which is substantially contributing to hand pain or would&#xD;
             confound the measurement of hand pain, including but not limited to: chronic&#xD;
             widespread pain, active tenosynovitis causing hand pain, active carpal tunnel&#xD;
             syndrome, active cervical radiculopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent change in treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Within the last four weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Initiation of new analgesic or change in usual dose or route; Use of oral steroids or&#xD;
        intraarticular steroid to sites other than the hand&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within the last three months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of intraarticular steroid to the hand; Initiation of glucosamine, chondroitin, hand&#xD;
        exercises or other relevant non- pharmacological therapy for hand pain; Initiation or&#xD;
        change in dose, route or formulation of hormonal therapy (such as hormone replacement or&#xD;

        months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participant in an interventional research trial that involves blinding of&#xD;
             treatment allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant or uncontrolled disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
             study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
