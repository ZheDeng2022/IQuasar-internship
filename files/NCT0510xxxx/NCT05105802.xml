  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness is a promising tool which may foster adaptative interpersonal qualities to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of persistent post-concussion symptoms. The present feasibility study will customize&#xD;
      and validate a mindfulness mobile smart-phone app easily accessible to youth and families.&#xD;
      The study will also determine whether mindfulness training increases quality of life, reduces&#xD;
      symptom burden and promotes neurophysiological recovery at 4 weeks post-injury in adolescents&#xD;
      who were diagnosed with an acute concussion compared to a cognitive sham app + usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in three youth with a concussion will be afflicted with persistent post-concussive&#xD;
      symptoms (PPCS), defined as the persistence of symptoms beyond one month of injury. PPCS may&#xD;
      impair daily activities including schoolwork, socializing, and sports, thus reducing the&#xD;
      quality of life. Preventive psychological interventions that foster coping skills may be key&#xD;
      to managing concussions and reducing the risk of PPCS. Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI)&#xD;
      are &quot;present-centered&quot; interventions, encouraging acceptance of thoughts and emotions as they&#xD;
      occur in the moment, without judgment. The goal of the present pilot and feasibility&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to investigate whether the introduction of early targeted&#xD;
      MBI training, delivered via a mobile application, can increase the quality of life and lead&#xD;
      to improved adaptation to acute impairments of concussion. Further, we will establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a larger RCT by investigating the ease of recruitment, credibility&#xD;
      score, adherence to treatment, and retention of an app-based MBI. Participants with an acute&#xD;
      concussion will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) experimental group (n=63):&#xD;
      early introduction of the MBI training; (2) control group (n=63): sham cognitive task and&#xD;
      usual care. The targeted MBI training consists of a 4-week custom-made program for youth.&#xD;
      Each standardized psychoeducation of meditation practice will be unlocked as the participant&#xD;
      progresses through the program. The curriculum is based on previous validated MBI app&#xD;
      protocols and team expertise in MBI.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Connectivity measured by Resting-State Functional MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours and 4th week post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of 60 participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI), which includes a resting-state functional MRI to assess function connectivity. To measure intra- and interconnectivity between regions of interest (default-mode network) and regions across the brain, will be measured. To calculate functional connectivity per participant, the mean blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal time series will be extracted for each individual seed-region. Then, the correlation coefficients between the time series of each seed region will be grouped into functional connectivity maps. The functional connectivity maps will be converted into z-scores for normality and used for the statistical analysis. Whole-brain and region of interest functionally connectivity analysis will be conducted.</description>

    <description>MBI training will consist of a 4-week custom-made program that include, setting intentions and check-in with mood, audio-recorded lectures, guided meditations such as body scans, and writing events journal. Each standardized course will be unlocked as the child progresses through the program. Users will be encouraged to participate in the app-based activities for a total of 10-15 minutes every day, with a minimum of 4 days in a week, over a period of 4 weeks.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cognitive Sham Application + Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Usual care recommends that the patient refrain from physical and cognitive activities for 24-48 hours after injury. After the rest period, it is recommended that low to moderate levels of physical and cognitive activity be gradually started 24-48 hours after injury. The activities should be performed at a level that does not result in recurrence or exacerbation of symptoms. Children must refrain from any activities that increase the risk of re-injury (drills with body contact or that risk falls) until fully asymptomatic and cleared by their primary care or other medical provider. We consider this arm as active as participants will be assigned to a cognitive sham app (cognitive math game) delivered via the same app (same main interface as the mindfulness intervention). However, they will not take part in the MBI program for the first 4 weeks. On a daily basis, participants will be asked questions about their stress and emotions and about their symptoms.</description>

The sham journey will consist of playing an open-source cognitive math game delivered through the same app as MBI, but without the mindfulness content.</description>
