    <textblock>
      Why in some situations can words soothe our cravings? This research proposal will test the&#xD;
      power of self-generated reasons for behavioural change in food addiction, which concerns&#xD;
      about three out of ten persons and causes major life hazards such as obesity, diabetes and&#xD;
      cancer. While food addiction is becoming more and more frequent in western societies, not&#xD;
      much is known about its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and how to tackle it. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate if and why certain types of affirmation-based therapies such as&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI) are beneficial for the treatment of food addiction. The&#xD;
      working hypothesis proposes that cognitive regulation-based self-control underpins the&#xD;
      neurocognitive shift of a patient's willingness to change addictive behaviour, generated by&#xD;
      the patient during MI therapy of food addiction. To test this hypothesis this study combines&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging with behavioural testing of dietary decision-making&#xD;
      following a participant's change or sustain talk statements. It will compare three groups of&#xD;
      participants with and without food addiction and obesity and lean controls. This study will&#xD;
      contribute to the improvement of therapies based upon talking oneself in and out of addiction&#xD;
      promoting goals. Findings will provide a better understanding of how our everyday life&#xD;
      dietary decision-environments prompt good intentions such as improving long-term nutritional&#xD;
      quality to actual behaviours such as forgoing immediate desire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food addiction is a growing problem that currently concerns 1 out of 5 persons in Western&#xD;
      societies. Although food intake is essential to survival and well-being, research in animals&#xD;
      and humans has provided convergent evidence that certain types of high palatable, fat- and&#xD;
      sugar-rich foods (hp foods) can become as addictive as cocaine or amphetamines. However, in&#xD;
      humans, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of food addiction are to date unknown, and&#xD;
      successful treatment is to be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An approach that has been shown to lead to promising results during drug abuse rehabilitation&#xD;
      involves Motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a goal-oriented style of communication and&#xD;
      focuses on resolving a patient's ambivalence while eliciting his/her own reasons to change&#xD;
      addictive behavior, also known as change talk. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      studies have shown that patients' individual change talk recordings from prior MI sessions&#xD;
      attenuated very, and enhanced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) responses to addictive&#xD;
      drug cues. This finding suggests that a neurocognitive shift in the patients' attitude toward&#xD;
      his/her addiction is considered to play a key role in rehabilitation and recovery. However,&#xD;
      it is unknown what exactly this neurocognitive shift means on a joint behavioral and neural&#xD;
      level. MOTIVFOOD aims to shed light on these dynamics in the context of food addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change compared to sustain talk in obese food addicts alters responses within the&#xD;
           brain's valuation and self-control systems, and dietary self-control and food valuation&#xD;
           on the behavioral level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food-addicted obese participants will be compared to (a) non-food addicted obese, and&#xD;
           (b) to normal weight control participants to explore potential differences in dietary&#xD;
           decision-making after the change and after sustain talk on the neural and behavioral&#xD;
           level. Expected results are that the MI approach only works when participants are&#xD;
           willing and need to engage in therapy. If so, the contrast between change and sustain&#xD;
           talk statements should be stronger, when behavior needs indeed to be changed because of&#xD;
           (a) obesity, which is a major life hazard, and/or (b) food addiction, for which MI was&#xD;
           designed for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Study with three groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. food-addicted participants with obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. non-food addicted participants with obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. non-food addicted, normal-weight participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food addicted and non-food addicted participants with obesity will be matched on body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), age, gender, and education, whereas the normal-weight controls will be matched&#xD;
      to the two groups of participants with obesity on age, gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      No blinding is involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves a mixed 3x2 factorial design with the factor group (3 levels)&#xD;
      crossing the within-subject factor talk condition (2 levels). Before the fMRI session, all&#xD;
      participants will attend a motivational interviewing (MI) session with a dietitian, who will&#xD;
      guide the participants to elaborate their reasons to change (i.e., change talk: sentences&#xD;
      that support a wanting to change addictive behavior) and their reasons to remain in the&#xD;
      status quo (i.e., sustain talk: sentences that support the status quo of not changing&#xD;
      addictive behavior). The MI session will be recorded, and the relevant statements selected to&#xD;
      be included in a dietary decision-making task paradigm performed about one week later during&#xD;
      fMRI. A 24h dietary recall will measure everyday life dietary intake to obtain health indexes&#xD;
      for each participant. The YFAS will assess food addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a second session (about one week after the MI session) all participants will perform&#xD;
      the fMRI exam in the fasted state, after at least 2 hours of fasting. During fMRI, they will&#xD;
      perform a modified version of a food choice task from decision neuroscience. The task&#xD;
      involves viewing food pictures displayed on a trial-by-trial basis on a computer screen. On&#xD;
      each trial, the participant decides on how much they would like to eat the food for real at&#xD;
      the end of the experiment on a 4-point Likert scale between strong no (1), no (2), yes (3),&#xD;
      and strong yes (4). This response corresponds to the variable stimulus value. Importantly,&#xD;
      before a series of such yes/no food choices, participants will listen to (1) &quot;their&quot; personal&#xD;
      change talk - itself, or (2) &quot;their&quot; personal sustain talk - STself. Participants will also&#xD;
      evaluate at the end of the decision-making task each food stimulus on its healthiness and&#xD;
      tastiness. These ratings will be used to assess how much taste and health attributes&#xD;
      determine food stimulus value, respectively, and how this integration differs as a function&#xD;
      of listening to either a change or a sustain talk statement. The depressive mood will be&#xD;
      assessed with Beck's depression inventory, weekly physical activity with the IPAQ, and body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed by a medically approved, bioelectrical impedance scale (weight,&#xD;
      size, BMI, % body fat, % body water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A month after the MI session, all participants will be reassessed on dietary intake (24h&#xD;
      dietary recall) and food addiction (YFAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be matched as to BMI, age, gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through (1) a network of healthcare Institutes specialized in&#xD;
      eating disorders (the Institute of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition, ICAN) and (2) an&#xD;
      electronic public announcement on the RISC website (http://www.risc.cnrs.fr/). Each&#xD;
      participant will receive 120€ for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be aged from 18 to 70 years old, right-handed, able to read, write,&#xD;
      understand written information and sign the informed consent. Additionally, the participants&#xD;
      should be able to perform the cognitive tasks, without a recent diagnosis of neurological or&#xD;
      psychiatric disease, treatment, or history of substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) will be divided into two groups according to the score of&#xD;
      the French version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS) score. Those with symptoms ≥ 2&#xD;
      will compose the obesity with food addiction group, whereas those with ≤1 will belong to the&#xD;
      obesity without food addition group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria are contraindications of MRI (eg. Pacemaker, peri-pregnancy period,&#xD;
      cochlear implants, brackets, metallic prostheses, and permanent makeup).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As exclusion criteria: Participants with a history of substance abuse, who were unable of&#xD;
      performing the experimental tasks, or with bad MRI data quality will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 30 participants in each group (total sample N=90). We further expect a&#xD;
      dropout rate of about 10% and therefore foresee recruiting an additional number of maximum of&#xD;
      15 (5 per group) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables from seven domains will be collected (1) sociodemographic, (2) anthropometric and&#xD;
      dietary data, (3) clinical outcomes, (4) MRI-related, (5) dietary decision-making&#xD;
      task-related (6) MI-related, and (7) covariables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
           gender, age, education.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. anthropometric variables: weight, height, percentage of body fat, and lean mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. dietary behavior data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. a nutritional anamnesis will focus on weight history, weight loss attempts and&#xD;
                methods, use of supplements and maximal weight and approximate dates as well as the&#xD;
                date of when it was diagnosed with food addiction,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. a 24h dietary recall interview will assess the dietary intake of the previous 24h.&#xD;
                This pass involves obtaining a list of all food items eaten on the previous day,&#xD;
                the interviewer probes for frequently forgotten foods such as savory snacks, sugar&#xD;
                added to beverages, candies. Then, the time and name of the eating occasion (i.e.&#xD;
                breakfast or lunch) and a detailed description of the type of food item, cooking&#xD;
                method, and other relevant aspects are collected. Once the data is collected,&#xD;
                energy and nutrients intake and food group data will be determined by appropriate&#xD;
                software (e.g. Nutrilog) to compute the dietary-related variables resorting to a&#xD;
                French-specific database.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Food addiction by using the YFAS 2.0. The YFAS 2.0 aims at assessing the&#xD;
                addictive-like eating behavior of the consumption of foods high in fat and/or&#xD;
                refined carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, white flour) based upon the DSM-5. This&#xD;
                questionnaire is composed of 35 items with eight response options that range from&#xD;
                &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Every Day.&quot; Each question accounts for one of the 11 diagnosis criteria&#xD;
                (e.g tolerance, withdrawal, clinical Significance). The cut-off for food addiction&#xD;
                is a total score of at least 2 or more meaning that 2 or more of the 11 diagnosis&#xD;
                criteria were met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. fMRI-related measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. we will assess resting-state fMRI&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. fMRI during a dietary decision-making task&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. anatomical MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. dietary decision-making task-related measures: The task involves&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. stimulus value: food wanting to rate each food stimulus on a 4-point Likert scale&#xD;
                for strong no (1), no (2), yes (3) to strong yes (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. healthiness and tastiness ratings to build regulatory success scores that can be&#xD;
                operationalized within the dietary decision-making paradigm by the following&#xD;
                measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. The regression coefficient (beta) of the tastiness ratings of food on stimulus value&#xD;
           ii. The beta of the healthiness rating of food stimuli on stimulus value iii. The&#xD;
           difference between the tastiness and healthiness beta in change vs sustain talk&#xD;
           conditions iv. The difference in stimulus value between change versus sustain talk&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           v. The sum of the percentage of healthy, untasty food choices (strong yes and yes food&#xD;
           wanting ratings) and unhealthy, tasty food rejections (strong no and no food wanting&#xD;
           ratings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. MI-related measures will consist in change and sustain talk statement recordings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. sustain and change talk statements will be selected according to their length so&#xD;
                every subject is exposed to the same length of stimuli using the Audacity software&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. sessions will be coded by trained researchers in MI and MISC (Motivational&#xD;
                intervening Skill Code). The latter phase will assess both counselor's and&#xD;
                subjects' behaviors. The MISC is comprised of behavior counts and global ratings.&#xD;
                For behavior count, each counselor's and patient's complete thought or utterance is&#xD;
                attributed to an MI technical code (e.g. open question, reflection, affirmation,&#xD;
                for counselor; change talk, sustain talk, neutral, for the patient). Global ratings&#xD;
                attribute an overall appreciation of relational factors on Likert scales (e.g.&#xD;
                overall score of empathy, acceptance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At last, variables are known to influence both functional brain activity and adherence&#xD;
           to specific dietary patterns or weight loss will be collected. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. psychological comorbidity variables such as depressive mood (BDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. physical activity: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical models&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within-subjects and between-subjects comparisons will be conducted by using analyses of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) and linear mixed models. When these analyses yield statistical differences,&#xD;
      post-hoc analyses will be conducted through student T-tests to characterize main effects and&#xD;
      interactions. The main analysis will focus of the dependant variables: fMRI activity and&#xD;
      regulatory success during the dietary decision-making task and dietary behavior as well as&#xD;
      food addiction score on the YFAS.&#xD;
