  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the third common problem, after problems of spine. Abnormal scapular&#xD;
      kinematics, so called scapular dyskinesis, is believed to be associated with shoulder pain.&#xD;
      Studies showed that individuals with shoulder problems demonstrate less upward rotation,&#xD;
      posterior tilt and external rotation during shoulder movement. The shortness of the&#xD;
      pectoralis minor (PM) is one of the factors leading to scapular dyskinesis. Short pectoralis&#xD;
      minor has been shown to prevent scapula from tilting posterior and rotating externally during&#xD;
      shoulder motion. The decreased scapular posterior tilt and external rotation may decrease&#xD;
      subacromial space and result in impingement. However, although many assessment methods have&#xD;
      been used to assess PM tightness or shortness, no study has tested the validity of these&#xD;
      testing methods. Moreover, although stretching exercises for PM have been shown to increase&#xD;
      the PM length, previous studies found that PM stretching exercises did not restore scapular&#xD;
      kinematics and did not further decrease pain and improve function. Shoulder pain and&#xD;
      discomfort has also been reported during stretching. Therefore, rather than stretching&#xD;
      exercise, other types of treatment that can specifically increase the PM length and restore&#xD;
      scapular kinematics may be needed. Manual therapy could specifically increase the flexibility&#xD;
      of PM, and scapular orientation exercises could improve scapular kinematics. These types of&#xD;
      treatment may be better options. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated whether&#xD;
      manual therapy combined with scapular orientation exercises could improve scapular&#xD;
      kinematics, pain and function. Therefore, the first part of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      which tests for length or tightness of PM can predict the scapular dyskinesis. The second&#xD;
      part of the study is to investigate the effects of manual therapy and scapular orientation&#xD;
      training on PM length, scapular kinematics, pain, and function in subjects with shoulder&#xD;
      pain. In the first part of the study, 67 healthy subjects will be recruited. In the second&#xD;
      part, 62 patients with shoulder pain will be recruited and randomized into either a PM&#xD;
      treatment group or a control group. While no treatment will be provided for the healthy&#xD;
      subjects in the first part, subjects with shoulder pain in the second part will receive 12&#xD;
      sessions of treatment in 4-6weeks, with 30-40 minutes per session. Patients in the control&#xD;
      group will receive general shoulder strengthening exercise, while patients in the PM&#xD;
      treatment group will have additional manual therapy and scapular orientation exercise. The&#xD;
      measures include tests of PM length, scapular kinematics in the first and second parts, and&#xD;
      pain and shoulder disability were also additionally assessed in the second part.&#xD;
