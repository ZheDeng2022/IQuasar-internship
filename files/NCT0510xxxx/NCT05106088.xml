    <textblock>
      This study investigates correlations between humeral head bone marrow characteristics and&#xD;
      tendon healing of rotator cuff repairs. The anticipated results would motivate future&#xD;
      research aimed to investigate local enrichment or transplantation of connective tissue&#xD;
      progenitor cells to augment rotator cuff repair and the pursuit of novel methods of bone&#xD;
      marrow screening to preoperatively identify patients with bone marrow characteristics related&#xD;
      to rotator cuff repair success or failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healing following rotator cuff repair (RCR) remains a significant clinical challenge, and&#xD;
      repair failure rates of 20-30% continue to be reported. To date limited attention has been&#xD;
      directed toward understanding how intrinsic mechanistic factors may contribute to variable&#xD;
      healing rates following RCR. The objective of this proposal is to quantify the variability of&#xD;
      the humeral head bone marrow in patients undergoing RCR and test the prognostic significance&#xD;
      of the local concentration of connective tissue progenitors (CTPs) for tendon healing. Our&#xD;
      approach will be to enroll 50 patients undergoing RCR. At the time of RCR, 8 ml of bone&#xD;
      marrow will be aspirated from the humeral head for quantitative progenitor cell assays. A&#xD;
      core biopsy at the tendon repair footprint will be collected for histologic analysis of bone&#xD;
      marrow composition. Tendon healing will be assessed by MRI (Sugaya score) at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up, the timeframe in which majority of re-tears occur The variation of bone marrow&#xD;
      characteristics among patients will be described (Aim 1) and their correlation with rotator&#xD;
      cuff tendon healing will be investigated (Aim 2). The proposal seeks to shift the&#xD;
      investigational paradigm to intrinsic patient biologic factors, a fundamental and&#xD;
      under-investigated realm of potential prognostic factors of RCR healing. Demonstrating that&#xD;
      humeral head characteristics associate with re-tear after RCR will support future work to&#xD;
      develop tools to screen patient bone marrow for characteristics predictive of RCR success or&#xD;
      failure and advance novel methods that promote local enrichment or transplantation of&#xD;
      progenitor cells to augment RCR.&#xD;
