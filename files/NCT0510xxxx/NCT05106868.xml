  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies investigating acupuncture for major depressive disorder (MDD) have been&#xD;
      carried out. However, investigators found the results were in high heterogeneity and poor&#xD;
      methodological quality. Thus, investigators intend to provide high quality of the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for MDD.&#xD;
