  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Central Corneal Staining Score (CCSS) at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The CCSS will be assessed by the Ora Calibra® corneal and conjunctival staining scale for grading of fluorescein staining. The score ranges from 0 to 4 (0=none and 4=severe), and lower score indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Eye Dryness Score (EDS) Assessed by Visual Analogue Scale at Day 57</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be asked to rate the symptom of ocular dryness by placing a vertical mark on the horizontal line to indicate the current level of discomfort. 0% corresponds to &quot;no discomfort&quot; and 100% corresponds to &quot;maximal discomfort.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The score for individual region is assessed by the Ora Calibra® corneal and conjunctival staining scale for grading of fluorescein staining. The score ranges from 0 to 4 (0=none and 4=severe), and lower score indicates improvement. Total score is sum of each region.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Conjunctival Lissamine Green Staining by Region (Central, Superior, Inferior, Temporal, Nasal, Corneal sum, Conjunctival Sum and Total staining) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The score for individual region is assessed by the Ora Calibra® corneal and conjunctival staining scale for grading of lissamine green staining. The score ranges from 0 to 4 (0=none and 4=severe), and lower score indicates improvement. Total score is sum of each region.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Conjunctival Redness Score at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>It is evaluated by the Ora Calibra® conjunctival redness scale for dry eye. The score ranges from 0 to 4 (0=none and 4=severe), where lower score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Schirmer's Test Score at Weeks 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Schirmer test strip will be placed in the lower temporal lid margin of each eye. Participants will be instructed to close their eyes, and after 5 minutes have elapsed, the length of moistened area of schirmer strip will be recorded (mm) for each eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Tear Film Break-up Time at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sodium fluorescein solution will be instilled into each eye and participants will be instructed to blink several times. The time it takes to form micelles from the time that the eye is opened will be noted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked the questions regarding ocular discomfort (unrelated to study drug instillation). The participant will be asked to rate each ocular symptom due to ocular dryness by placing a vertical mark on the horizontal line to indicate the current level of discomfort. 0% corresponds to &quot;no discomfort&quot; and 100% corresponds to &quot;maximal discomfort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a simple 12-question survey that rates the severity of your dry eye disease based on your symptoms. It is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher score representing greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort Scale at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>It is assessed by the Ora Calibra® ocular discomfort scale. The score ranges from 0 to 4 (0=none and 4=severe), where lower score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ora Calibra® Ocular Discomfort &amp; 4-Symptom Questionnaire at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the severity of each of the following symptoms, with regards to how they feel in both eyes - overall ocular discomfort, burning, dryness, grittiness, and stinging on 0 to 5 scale, where 0=none and 5=severe.</description>
