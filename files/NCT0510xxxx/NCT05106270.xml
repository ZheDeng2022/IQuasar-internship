  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-stop procedure combining catheter ablation (CA) and left atrial appendage closure (LAAC)&#xD;
      has been a feasible treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke&#xD;
      and/or bleeding. Although it could achieve considerable rhythm control and stroke&#xD;
      prophylaxis, a number of patients has experienced progressive heart failure after the&#xD;
      procedure. Notably, previous studies indicate that both pulmonary vein isolation by CA and&#xD;
      LAAC could significantly increase left atrial pressure, while currently no study has&#xD;
      investigated left atrial pressure change in patients underwent combined procedure. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that combined procedure would significantly increase left atrial&#xD;
      pressure and subsequently deteriorate cardiac function. Therefore, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      measure the left and right atrial pressure change before and after CA and LAAC in combined&#xD;
      procedure, and investigate the influence of the pressure change on clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. Study aim. This study was designed to measure the left and right atrial pressure change&#xD;
           before and after catheter ablation (CA) and left atrial appendage closure (LAAC)&#xD;
           combining procedure, and investigate the influence of the pressure change on clinical&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject selection. This study is designed to recruit patients diagnosed with atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation and planned to undergo combined procedure. Primary inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Atrial fibrillation recorded by 12-lead ECG or Holter that last for longer than 30&#xD;
           seconds within the preceding 6 months; ii. Eligible for left atrial appendage closure,&#xD;
           that meet at least one of the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. At high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score≥3 in female, ≥2 in male) and/or bleeding&#xD;
                (HAS-BLED score≥3);&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Contraindicated to oral anticoagulation (OAC);&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Refused OAC treatment albeit comprehensively informed of the necessity and benefits&#xD;
                of OAC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure detail. All the patients recruited is planned to undergo combined procedure.&#xD;
           CA is performed before LAAC. For CA, the energy source is optional (either&#xD;
           radiofrequency or cryoenergy). And ablation should be performed for pulmonary vein&#xD;
           isolation only. For LAAC, the occluder type is optional (either plug or pacifier&#xD;
           occluder), and intracardiac echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)&#xD;
           is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For atrial pressure measurement, right atrial pressure should be measured before&#xD;
           transseptal puncture and after combined procedure is accomplished. Left atrial pressure&#xD;
           should be measured at 3 timepoints: after transseptal puncture, after pulmonary vein&#xD;
           isolation and after LAAC. Atrial pressure is measured via Swartz transseptal puncture&#xD;
           sheath. And at each timepoint, atrial pressure should be recorded at 1min, 3min, and&#xD;
           5min after the placement of the sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up. study endpoint includes a primary composite endpoint of rehospitalization due&#xD;
           to heart failure and death due to cardiovascular disease, and secondary endpoints&#xD;
           including: 1. all-cause mortality 2. major cardiovascular adverse event 3.&#xD;
           rehospitalization due to cardiovascular diseases 4. recurrence of atrial arrhythmia 5.&#xD;
           stoke/transient ischemic attack 6. echocardiographic measurement 7. quality of life&#xD;
           evaluation 8. cardiac function evaluation 9. evaluation of left atrial appendage&#xD;
           closure. Patients are required to have outpatient follow-up at 3rd month, 12th month,&#xD;
           and every year since then. The anti-thromboembolic regimen should follow: 3-month OAC&#xD;
           treatment and 3-month double anti-platelet therapy and lifelong single anti-platelet&#xD;
           therapy. For LAAC follow-up, either TEE or CTA is scheduled to perform in the 3rd month&#xD;
           after procedure.&#xD;
