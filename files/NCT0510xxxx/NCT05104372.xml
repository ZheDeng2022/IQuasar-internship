    <textblock>
      Nasal washing (washout) followed by gargles with hypertonic saline (HSNIG) is believed to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing the duration of illness in those with clinically suspected or confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 being managed at home, and also is effective in reducing complications of COVID-19&#xD;
      and onward household transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to investigate whether the use of HSNIG performed by adults with symptoms&#xD;
      consistent with COVID-19 reduces the duration of symptoms when compared to participants&#xD;
      managed using standard care.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data from the recent &quot;Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Study&quot; (ELVIS)&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicates that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and&#xD;
      gargling (HSNIG) reduced the duration of coronavirus upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)&#xD;
      by an average of two-and-a-half days. As such, it may offer a potentially safe, effective and&#xD;
      scalable intervention in those with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) following infection&#xD;
      with the beta-coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers recently reported that epithelial cells mount an antiviral effect by&#xD;
      producing hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from chloride ions. HOCl is the active ingredient in&#xD;
      bleach. Epithelial cells have this innate antiviral immune mechanism to clear viral&#xD;
      infections. Since bleach is effective against all virus types, it was tested to see whether a&#xD;
      range of DNA, RNA, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were inhibited in the presence of&#xD;
      chloride ions supplied via salt (NaCl). All the viruses tested were inhibited in the presence&#xD;
      of NaCl. The human viruses which were tested included: DNA/enveloped: herpes simplex virus;&#xD;
      RNA/enveloped: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A&#xD;
      virus; and RNA/non-enveloped: coxsackievirus B3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COVID-19, high titers of SARS-CoV-2 are detectable in the upper respiratory tract of&#xD;
      asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. The titers are higher in the nose than the throat&#xD;
      suggesting measures that control the infection and viral shedding will help reduce&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till the time a significant proportion of the world population is vaccinated against&#xD;
      COVID-19, a safe and effective intervention is needed that can be implemented globally. The&#xD;
      in-vitro data gives the evidence that NaCl has an antiviral effect that works across viral&#xD;
      types. The findings from this post-hoc analysis of ELVIS need to be interpreted with caution.&#xD;
      These data do however suggest that HSNIG may have a role to play in reducing symptoms and&#xD;
      duration of illness in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES Primary: HSNIG is effective in reducing the duration of illness in those with&#xD;
      clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 being managed at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: HSNIG is effective in reducing complications of COVID-19 and onward household&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The Intervention group will be suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infected&#xD;
      individuals. They will make hypertonic saline at home, and perform nasal washing and gargles,&#xD;
      as per instructions and study videos, which will be available to be viewed by the&#xD;
      intervention group only, in the study website &quot;www.nasalwash.pk&quot;. This will be used as&#xD;
      required to a maximum of 12 times/day for a maximum of 14 days. Participants are informed&#xD;
      that symptoms might reduce after HSNIG, but may return after a while. Symptoms could hence&#xD;
      return as early as 30 minutes to many hours after HSNIG. Participants will be advised to&#xD;
      perform HSNIG as soon as symptoms return, and as many times as needed (but not more than 12&#xD;
      times/day) until they become symptom-free, or until the end of their study participation&#xD;
      (either on day 14, or on admission to hospital or on withdrawal from the study), and follow&#xD;
      standard advice from their physicians or the Pakistan Government website on personal and&#xD;
      household hygiene and social distancing: http://www.covid.gov.pk/prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL The participants randomized to the control arm will be asked to perform ablution,&#xD;
      which includes washing of the nose by the prescribed Islamic method with plain water,&#xD;
      (instructions and study videos are available to be viewed by the control group in the study&#xD;
      website) and to follow the guidance on personal and household hygiene and social distancing&#xD;
      as advised by the Ministry of Health, Government of Pakistan, at&#xD;
      http://www.covid.gov.pk/prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary Objective To investigate whether the use of HSNIG performed by adults with&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. Participants attending hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Length of stay in hospital, if admitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Number of participants reporting over the counter medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Reduction in transmission to household contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Number of participants reporting side effects of nasal irrigation&#xD;
&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pragmatic, non-CTIMP, web-based, Bayesian adaptive randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) of HSNIG vs. standard care in adults over 18 years of age with suspected or&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19. The study will run throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic until&#xD;
      numbers have been recruited for sufficient analysis, or until 30th of November 2021.&#xD;
      Participants are recruited within 5 days of developing COVID-19 symptoms by use of the study&#xD;
      website (&quot;www.nasalwash.pk&quot;), study advertising through traditional media such as radio and&#xD;
      internet advertisements, as well as social media. Paper leaflets will be distributed at&#xD;
      chemists, doctors' clinics, COVID testing centers, and through organizations working with&#xD;
      COVID patients. For the purposes of this study, symptoms or diagnosis of COVID-19 are defined&#xD;
      as at least one of the following symptoms, which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sore throat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New loss of taste or smell&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea or vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congestion or runny nose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willing participants will be directed by the study advertising to a study specific webpage at&#xD;
      &quot;www.nasalwash.pk&quot;, where they will be able to access further study information and&#xD;
      documents, which will include a Patient Information Sheet and a Consent form. All data&#xD;
      including consent will be obtained electronically, details of how the process of electronic&#xD;
      consent will work is given in detail below in the section titled &quot;Consenting Participants&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining their electronic consent, they will be randomized automatically by the&#xD;
      software to either the Intervention Group, or the Control Group. They will be provided a&#xD;
      password to a personal area, which will contain an instructional video on whether they will&#xD;
      perform hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargles (the intervention group); or do either&#xD;
      nothing, or regularly continue to perform ablution for prayers (the control group). The&#xD;
      affected individual (not more than one participant per household) will be centrally&#xD;
      randomized through an easy to access web-based randomization schedule hosted at the study&#xD;
      data center at the Allergy &amp; Asthma Institute, Pakistan, in collaboration with the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Unit, University of Edinburgh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pre- and post-randomization data will be collected through mobile phone/web-based&#xD;
      questionnaires (see Daily Study Diary, Daily Symptom report, End of Illness questionnaire and&#xD;
      Day 14 questionnaire). Participants will be randomized to either a Control arm of standard&#xD;
      symptomatic care, or an Intervention arm of HSNIG up to 12 times per day for a maximum of 14&#xD;
      days or until asymptomatic, alongside standard symptomatic care. All participants will be&#xD;
      required to complete a daily symptom diary until Day 14 and all participant will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the Day 14 questionnaire, which will establish if any other members of the&#xD;
      participant's household have developed symptoms of COVID-19. If a participant's symptoms&#xD;
      clear before Day 14, they will be invited to complete the End of Illness questionnaire&#xD;
      (healthcare use, adverse events, acceptability, infection in household contacts) on the day&#xD;
      that these symptoms resolve, and continue to fill in the Daily Diary, in case of recurrence&#xD;
      of symptoms until Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have been randomized to the Intervention arm, will be directed towards a&#xD;
      password-protected webpage featuring videos and instructions on how to prepare the hypotonic&#xD;
      saline solution and how to perform HSNIG, while those randomized to the Control arm will be&#xD;
      directed towards a password-protected webpage featuring a video and instructions on how to&#xD;
      perform ablution with plain water and gargling, as well as washing the nose other than&#xD;
      ablution, but with plain (salt-free) clean water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who have been randomized to the intervention arm will be directed to the&#xD;
      instructional video in which it will be explained that they should take 250 ml of clean water&#xD;
      (water which has been boiled and cooled, or filtered or mineral water) in the measuring jug&#xD;
      provided, and add one level teaspoon of salt (6.5 grams) and use this salty water for nasal&#xD;
      washing and gargles. In order to standardize the study, and since sea-salt is not very&#xD;
      commonly available in Pakistan, patients in the intervention arm will be provided sea salt&#xD;
      (or preservative-free sodium chloride) for the treatment by the project, along with a&#xD;
      measuring spoon calibrated at 6.5 grams of salt when filled level, and a graduated container&#xD;
      showing 250 ml. This will be posted to them by courier as soon as they are randomized into&#xD;
      the trial / intervention arm of the study. The addition of 6.5 grams of salt to 250 ml of&#xD;
      water will make a 2.6% saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At consent, participants will be given the option to consent to the future collection of&#xD;
      samples for COVID-19 serological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also proposed to randomly select approximately a proportion of all participants,&#xD;
      according to availability of funds for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, which will&#xD;
      include a swab sample from the nose and/or the throat. to support the diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
      The selected participants will be informed of the government approved laboratories near their&#xD;
      home which provide the required testing facilities and participants will be asked to pay the&#xD;
      costs of these additional tests up front. The cost of the test and transport to the&#xD;
      laboratory will be reimbursed to the participant after the participant sends the report of&#xD;
      this test to the Allergy and Asthma Institute, Pakistan (AAIP), physically or electronically,&#xD;
      and provides the original receipts of payment. Patients who have already had these tests done&#xD;
      will be excluded from the random selection, and their results collected and recorded.&#xD;
