      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Petersen's hernia after gastrectomy Petersen's hernia was reported in 1900 by German&#xD;
           surgeon Walther Petersen following the occurrence of an internal hernia after&#xD;
           gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy (G-J) 1[]. Petersen's hernia occurs in the free space&#xD;
           posterior to a G-J site after any type of G-J and is caused by herniation of the small&#xD;
           bowel through the defect between the small bowel mesentery and the transverse mesocolon.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As shown in CT figure in Figure 1, the small bowel mesentery rotates and twists, leading&#xD;
           to an emergency situation in which necrosis of the entire small intestine occurs due to&#xD;
           decreased blood circulation of the small intestine The occurrence rate of Petersen's&#xD;
           hernias after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y G-J is approximately 1.7~9.7%&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Peterson's hernia can occur in the RNY esophagojejunal anastomosis after gastrectomy,&#xD;
           or after the RNY gastrojejunostomy and Billroth type 2 anastomosis after distal&#xD;
           gastrectomy. Also, it can occur after the obesity surgery RNY gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of internal hernia has been reported to be higher in laparoscopic&#xD;
           approaches than in open gastrectomy One possible cause of the increasing incidence of&#xD;
           Petersen's hernias is the recent development of minimally invasive surgery. A higher&#xD;
           incidence of internal hernia is reported in minimally invasive gastrectomy than in open&#xD;
           gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After open surgery, adhesion was made between the small bowel and the operative wound&#xD;
           site, however with minimally invasive surgery, adhesion is remarkably decreased, not&#xD;
           only because of the disappearance of the open wound in the upper abdomen but also the&#xD;
           use of antiadhesive agent Therefore, non-absorbable sutures require the closure of&#xD;
           Peterson's spaces, and according to report of Blockhuys M, the frequency of internal&#xD;
           hernia decreased after closure of Petersen's space.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The frequency of internal hernia significantly decreases when Peterson space closure is&#xD;
           implemented compared to the group that performed mesentery defect closure only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The problem of Petersen's space closure procedure The closure of the defect at&#xD;
           Petersen's space can induce bleeding by injuring the mesenteric vessels, as well as&#xD;
           small bowel ischemia, caused by injuring the peripheral mesenteric vessels near the&#xD;
           small bowel lumen. It has also been reported that early postoperative obstruction could&#xD;
           be due to jejunal kinking of the closing site of the mesenteric defect. The closure of&#xD;
           mesenteric defects increased the risk for severe postoperative complications in the&#xD;
           early postoperative phase (&lt;30 days) following the closure, mainly because of kinking of&#xD;
           the jejunostomy site. We also encountered kinking of the jejunojejunostomy in the early&#xD;
           postoperative periods after gastrectomy. However, it is not easy to determine if the&#xD;
           complications are because of kinking of the entero-entero anastomosis or the adhesion&#xD;
           effect from the closure of Petersen's space. Peterson space closure is necessary, but it&#xD;
           is difficult by technical problem to develop an easy method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Previous study We conducted jejunal mesentery fixing (Mefix) to the transverse mesocolon&#xD;
           with a non-absorbable suture to prevent of a Petersen's hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory of the Mefix method is as follows. When the mesentery of the small intestine is&#xD;
      fixed to the transverse mesocolon between the small bowel and the colon mesentery, the defect&#xD;
      still remains. However, the small bowel does not enter the defect because the small bowel&#xD;
      mesentery is fixed at the transverse mesocolon; consequently, a Petersen's hernia does not&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEFIX method allowed partial herniation of bowel, but it prevent of total herniation. This&#xD;
      prevent bowel infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      We closed Petersen's space defect between March 1st, 2016 and Dec 31th, 2017 (N=49), and we&#xD;
      performed the Mefix procedure between July 1st, 2017 and June 30th, 2018 (N=26). We&#xD;
      classified patients into the Petersen's space closure group (closure group) and the mesentery&#xD;
      fixing group (Mefix group). All patients visited the hospital at six months and one year&#xD;
      after surgery, and a CT scan was performed to check for the recurrence of gastric cancer. We&#xD;
      determined the incidence of Petersen's hernia by abdominal CT scan, and we found no incidence&#xD;
      of Petersen's hernias in either group. The procedure times for mesentery fixing (3.7 ± 1.1&#xD;
      minutes) were significantly shorter than those for Petersen's space closures (7.5 ± 1.5&#xD;
      minutes) (p&lt;0.001). However, a retrospective study and a small group of patients seem to&#xD;
      require a large, prospective random study.&#xD;

    <description>Surgeons fixed the jejunal mesentery (jejunojejunostomy[J-J] distal 30 cm) to the transverse mesocolon using non-absorbable barbed suture VLocTM 3-0 sutures. The suture area was exposed by grasping the jejunum side mesentery (jejunal side, at site 30cm distal J-J) and the transverse mesocolon (colonic side). The jejunal side mesentery was fixed to the colonic side mesocolon between the jejunum and the transverse colon using nonabsorbable barbed V-LocTM 3-0 sutures.The suture started between jejunal mesentery just below of SMA vascular arcade and transverse mesocolon, and it finished when it reaches the root of the mesentery. To anchor the mesentery, continuous suturing with V-Loc two-point backward sutures were performed at the final step.</description>
