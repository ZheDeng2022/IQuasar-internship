  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided modified&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal nerves blocks through perichondrial approach (M-TAPA) and oblique subcostal&#xD;
      transversus abdominis plane block(OSTAP) will be searched in patients recruiting for&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and the two groups will be compared in terms postoperative&#xD;
      opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effects of ultrasound-guided (M-TAPA) and&#xD;
      OSTAP blocks on opioid consumption after LC surgery. It is hypothesized that M-TAPA will&#xD;
      reduce opioid consumption of the patients more than the OSTAP block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure, but postoperative pain is still the most&#xD;
      common symptom after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) block is a regional anesthesia&#xD;
      technique defined for abdominal surgeries. Previously, several studies have reported that&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided OSTAP blocks reduce postoperative pain scores after LC. M-TAPA block is&#xD;
      performed by applying local anesthetic to the lower surface of the chondrium. This technique&#xD;
      provides effective analgesia in the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded&#xD;
      trial in a university hospital. Patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      will be screened for enrollment in the study. After randomization, M-TAPA and OSTAP blocks&#xD;
      will be performed under ultrasound guidance after administering general anesthesia and prior&#xD;
      to the skin incision. An anesthesiologist who performed blocks will not involve in the data&#xD;
      collection. Other health care workers who will involve in the evaluation of postoperative&#xD;
      pain scores, vital parameters, nausea and vomiting, antiemetic, opioid consumption, and&#xD;
      Quality of Recovery score will be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;

    <description>A 15-parameter Quality of Recovery score (QoR-15) has been recommended as the optimum tool to evaluate overall patient-centers measures of recovery after surgery, including pain. It is a questionnaire that is given to patients to do postoperatively and is scored from 0 to 150 where 150 indicates that the patient has had an excellent recovery QoR-15 score will be recorded on the morning of operation and at the postoperative 24th hour.</description>

    <description>In the operating room, all of the patients will receive standard monitoring. An anesthesiologist will perform anesthesia inductions. After tracheal intubation, a linear probe will be placed in the sagittal direction at the 10th costal margin, and transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles will be identified. A block needle will be inserted with in-plane technique and 25 ml 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected between the transversus abdominis muscle and the lower aspect of the costal cartilage. The same procedure will be repeated on the contralateral side. The pain intensity during rest and motion will be evaluated with the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia comprising paracetamol, dexketoprofen, and tramadol.</description>

    <description>In the second group, the patients will receive oblique subcostal TAP block in the supine position immediately after the endotracheal intubation. The anesthesiologist of the operating room will place the ultrasound with a linear probe subcostally and from the xiphoid to the right iliac crest obliquely. Rectus abdominis muscle and underlying transversus abdominis muscle, will be identified near the costal margin. The needle will be directed to the transversus abdominis fascia. Local anesthetic solution of 25 ml 0.25% will be injected to between rectus abdominis and transversus abdominis muscles along the oblique subcostal line. The same procedure will repeated to the contralateral side. The pain intensity during rest and motion will be evaluated with the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Patients will receive standard multimodal analgesia comprising paracetamol, dexketoprofen, and tramadol.</description>
