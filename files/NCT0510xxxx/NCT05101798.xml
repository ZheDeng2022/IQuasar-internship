      This study allows head and neck cancer surgeons to specifically visualize cancerous cells&#xD;
      apart from normal healthy tissue. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a safe and effective&#xD;
      FDA-approved agent successfully used by neurosurgeons for FGS of different brain tumors is&#xD;
      given to the patients preoperatively. Using specific wavelengths of light as well as&#xD;
      specialized magnified lenses the surgeons use this technique to assist in tumor resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for many head and neck cancer involves surgical resection, or removal, of the&#xD;
      tumor. A potential outcome of surgery is subtotal resection, in which some cancerous material&#xD;
      fails to be removed resulting in tumor recurrence and lower overall survival. Achieving total&#xD;
      resection without interfering with normal tissue is a challenge due the critical anatomical&#xD;
      structures of the head and neck. Fluorescent-guided surgery (FGS) is a new method of&#xD;
      intraoperative imaging that can be used to clearly visualize cancerous tissue aprt from&#xD;
      normal tissue during surgery in real-time. Before surgery, an agent that preferentially&#xD;
      enters tumor cells is given to the patient. Tumor cells then glow brightly when exposed to&#xD;
      specific wavelengths of light during surgery, allowing the surgeon to easily distinguish&#xD;
      between healthy and cancerous tissue. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a safe and effective&#xD;
      FDA approved agent successfully used by neurosurgeons for FGS of different brain tumors which&#xD;
      has not been assessed for use in head and neck cancers. The aim of the study is to determine&#xD;
      if 5-ALA can be effectively used in FGS for different types of head and neck cancers, and if&#xD;
      it will improve survival, tumor regrowth, and other outcomes for patients. 23 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled from the Mount Sinai Hospital, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Union Square Faculty Practices over a 1 year period and will be completed by December 2022.&#xD;

    <description>The feasibility of using oral Gleolan® as an adjunct diagnostic imaging tool for malignant tumor tissue fluorescence will be primarily assessed by computing sensitivity of intraoperative Gleolan® induced PPIX tissue fluorescence.&#xD;
PPIX tissue fluorescence will be defined categorically as &quot;no&quot; (score 0), &quot;low&quot; (score 1), &quot;medium&quot; (score 2), and &quot;high&quot; (score 3) by operative surgeon, and images will be recorded. For purposes of computing measures of diagnostic performance a score of 0 will be considered a negative test result and a score of 1, 2 or 3 will be considered a positive test result.</description>

    <description>The closure consists of colorless glass vial (Type II, Ph Eur) and bromobutyl-rubber stopper ø 20 mm (Type I, Ph Eur) and flip cap. The powder for oral solution is intended for single (partial) use. To prepare the ready-to-use solution the content of one vial is dissolved in 50 ml of water or apple juice. The concentration of the reconstituted solution is 3%. Gleolan® is administered orally to patients prior to tumor removal by surgery (20 mg/kg BW). The reconstituted solution may be prepared up to 24 hours prior to use if protected from light. It should be given 3 hours (range 3-5 hours) prior to planned induction of anesthesia for surgery, although its effect is present for up to 8-12 hours. This step is critical for an optimal visualization of tumor tissue due to pharmacokinetic properties of Gleolan®.</description>

          -  Women who are pregnant or become pregnant will be excluded from the trial as it is&#xD;
             unknown if ALA is teratogenic or has abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with 5-ALA breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
             is treated with 5-ALA.&#xD;
