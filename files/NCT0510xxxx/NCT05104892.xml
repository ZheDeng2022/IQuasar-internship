  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, treatment, Phase 2, double-blind, 2 arm, 12-week Proof of Concept (PoC)&#xD;
      study that is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of rilzabrutinib in&#xD;
      adult participants (aged 18-70 years) with moderate-to-severe asthma who are not well&#xD;
      controlled on inhaled ICS/LABA therapy. Study treatment includes investigational medicinal&#xD;
      product (IMP) (rilzabrutinib or placebo) added-on to a background therapy of ICS/LABA&#xD;
      (fluticasone/salmeterol [non-investigational medicinal product], standardized at screening).&#xD;
      Background therapy of ICS/LABA will be withdrawn during the 12week randomized treatment&#xD;
      period and resumed at the end of the IMP treatment period, as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening period (4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized IMP treatment period (12 weeks ± 3 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Background therapy stabilization phase (4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Background therapy withdrawal phase (4-5 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No background therapy phase (3-4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post IMP treatment safety follow-up period (4 weeks ± 3 days)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration per participant is expected to be up to 20 weeks: up to 4 weeks&#xD;
      screening, 12 weeks on-treatment double-blind period, and 4-week post-IMP treatment follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;

    <description>Loss of Asthma Control (LOAC) event is defined as any of the following:&#xD;
A 30% or greater reduction from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) on 2 consecutive days&#xD;
≥6 additional reliever puffs of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol in a 24-hour period (compared to baseline) on 2 consecutive days&#xD;
Increase in ICS ≥4 times the last prescribed ICS dose (or ≥50% of the prescribed ICS dose at V2 if background therapy withdrawal completed)&#xD;
Requiring use of systemic (oral and/or parenteral) steroid treatment&#xD;
Requiring hospitalization or emergency room visit for asthma exacerbation</description>

    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) score change from baseline at EOT and at each assessment time point</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a questionnaire that measures the adequacy of asthma control and any changes in asthma control that may occur spontaneously or as a result of treatment. The ACQ-5 has five questions on the asthma symptoms and patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond on a 7-point scale for each question (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). The ACQ-5 score is the mean of the 5 questions and, therefore, between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). A high score indicates low asthma control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (AQLQ[S]) Self-administered score change from baseline at EOT and at each assessment time point</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S) was designed as a self-administered patient reported outcome to measure the functional impairments that are most troublesome to adolescents and adults ≥12 years of age as a result of their asthma. The instrument is comprised of 32 items, each rated on a 7-point Likert scales from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Asthma Daytime Symptom Diary (ADSD) and Asthma Nighttime Symptom Diary (ANSD) scores from baseline to EOT and each week</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ADSD and ANSD assess asthma severity based on patient self-report of asthma core symptoms, i.e., difficulty of breathing; wheezing; shortness of breath; chest tightness; chest pain; and cough. Both the ADSD and ANSD are composed of 6 items rated using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) that ranges from 0 = None to 10 = As bad as you can imagine. The participants will record their daytime and nighttime asthma symptoms in an electronic diary, once in the evening and once in the morning, respectively.</description>
