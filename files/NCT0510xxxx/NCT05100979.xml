  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot test of The Art of Medicine Series, a smartphone-based educational tool&#xD;
      to improve clinician-patient communication. Investigators will enroll clinicians (residents,&#xD;
      fellows, attending physicians) and family caregivers (most often parents) from the Children's&#xD;
      Wisconsin neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Participants will then receive a series of&#xD;
      links to short, animated videos sent to their phone by text message. Each video teaches&#xD;
      best-practice communication techniques such as how patients can prompt teach back and how&#xD;
      clinicians can avoid biased phrasing in delivering news. Over the 4-week intervention (the&#xD;
      length of resident's rotation), clinicians will receive 15 videos and patients will receive 8&#xD;
      videos. Communication skills of clinicians and patients will be assessed pre and post&#xD;
      intervention using validated measures and participants' engagement with the videos will be&#xD;
      tracked with software in the website.&#xD;
