    <textblock>
      Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common supraventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia in clinical practice, more common in women than in men. It can occur at all ages,&#xD;
      but it is more likely to begin in young adults, with average age of onset around 32 years.&#xD;
      Due to its sudden onset and cessation it is classified in the group of paroxysmal&#xD;
      supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), accounting for almost two thirds of the total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVNRT is a regular supraventricular tachycardia resulting from formation of reentry circuit&#xD;
      confined to atrioventricular node and perinodal atrial tissue. About 80-90% of patients with&#xD;
      AVNRT have the common form of arrhythmia, also called &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;slow-fast&quot; type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow-fast AVNRT usually begins when premature atrial complex (PAC) arrives at AV node when&#xD;
      fast pathway is in its refractory period. Therefore, antegrade conduction along fast pathway&#xD;
      is blocked. If premature beat arrives in specific time window, slow pathway, with shorter&#xD;
      refractory period, is available for conduction to ventricle. Premature beat leads through&#xD;
      slow way, and, through final common way, to His bundle. As a result, PR interval of premature&#xD;
      beat will be longer than normal beats conducted through fast track. If fast pathway has&#xD;
      recovered its excitability by the time impulse of the slow pathway reaches distal junction of&#xD;
      the two paths, impulse can lead retrograde through fast pathway. Circuit can then become&#xD;
      repetitive with antegrade conduction along slow pathway and retrograde conduction along fast&#xD;
      pathway with consequent triggering of sustained tachycardia. This proposed mechanism explains&#xD;
      series of clinical observations of AVNRTs: single PAC can initiate arrhythmia and in the same&#xD;
      way penetration in reentry circuit by PAC can abruptly interrupt arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20% of patients with AVNRT have uncommon forms of arrhythmia, referred to as &quot;atypical&quot;&#xD;
      AVNRT. There are cases in which antegrade conduction can occur along fast pathway with&#xD;
      retrograde conduction along slow pathway (fast-slow type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients, on the other hand, have more slow pathways, in which both antegrade and&#xD;
      retrograde pathways of circuit use slow AV nodal pathways (slow-slow type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with AVNRT episodes that occur frequently and are poorly tolerated or require&#xD;
      hospitalization, the only chronic therapy recommended in class I by international guidelines&#xD;
      is catheter ablation. Evidence from randomized trials has shown that catheter ablation is&#xD;
      significantly superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy in preventing hospital admission for&#xD;
      recurrences of tachycardia at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVNRT catheter ablation is a procedure that involves cardiac mapping and subsequent ablation&#xD;
      of the arrhythmic substrate. Cardiac mapping refers to the careful movement of a mapping or&#xD;
      ablation catheter in the area of interest, probing site where ablation will be able to cure&#xD;
      arrhythmia. Cardiac mapping during electrophysiological testing identifies temporal and&#xD;
      spatial distributions of electrical potentials generated by myocardium during normal and&#xD;
      abnormal rhythms. This process allows to describe spread of activation from its inception to&#xD;
      its completion within a region of interest and, in its usual application, is focused towards&#xD;
      identifying site of origin or critical site of conduction for arrhythmia. The recurrence rate&#xD;
      after radiofrequency catheter ablation varies from 3.5 to 5.2% during a 6 - 24 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most worrying complication related to AVNRT ablation is iatrogenic disturbance of&#xD;
      atrioventricular conduction requiring pacemaker implantation. According to large recent&#xD;
      trial, 3% of patients treated with AVNRT ablation underwent pacemaker implantation during a&#xD;
      median follow-up of 4 years [9]. In particular, the risk of pacemaker implantation is present&#xD;
      not only in the periprocedural period, but persists during the long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first description of radiofrequency ablation directed to site of slow pathway and&#xD;
      guided by fluoroscopic anatomical landmarks or intracardiac electrograms, technique for AVNRT&#xD;
      ablation has been implemented in years. One of the major improvements was three-dimensional&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping. Electroanatomic (or electromagnetic) mapping, available in many&#xD;
      electrophysiology laboratories, is based on use of special catheter with locatable sensor&#xD;
      tip, connected to mapping and navigation system. The system can generate color-coded static&#xD;
      maps or animated dynamic maps of activation wavefront. These images can define reentrant&#xD;
      circuits as well as site of origin of ectopic activity with centrifugal, regional or&#xD;
      asymmetric diffusion of electrical activity. A major advantage of three-dimensional&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping is its ability to allow catheter to anatomically and accurately&#xD;
      &quot;revisit&quot; critically important recording site previously identified during&#xD;
      electrophysiological study, even if tachycardia is no longer present or inducible. This&#xD;
      accurate repositioning can allow further application of the radiofrequency current to&#xD;
      critical sites that otherwise cannot be performed with high degree of accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility. Furthermore, direct visualization of anatomical structures such as coronary&#xD;
      sinus ostium, tricuspid anulus and bundle of His allows to delineate in precise and 3D way&#xD;
      the Koch triangle, which is crucial a reference to perform ablation of slow pathway without&#xD;
      affecting the atrioventricular node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system also reduces or avoids radiation exposure&#xD;
      and improve accuracy in localization and ablation of target site by means of&#xD;
      three-dimensional visualization of anatomical map, with high success rates and reducing rate&#xD;
      of complications and recurrences. The use of three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping has&#xD;
      been associated with significant reduction in patient radiation dose, operator radiation&#xD;
      dose, and total fluoroscopy time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another technical improvement was irrigation of distal electrode of ablation catheter with&#xD;
      saline and heparin, which reduced the risk of complications such as thrombus and steam pop&#xD;
      formation. While in non-irrigated catheters, energy delivery is limited by temperature at&#xD;
      catheter-tissue interface, irrigated catheters allow for greater energy delivery and create&#xD;
      deeper lesions. Use of irrigated catheters for AVNRT ablation increased from 0% in 2005 to&#xD;
      23% in 2015 but still remains low. Combination of irrigation and flexible tip allows stable&#xD;
      contact with myocardial tissue with uniform delivery of radiofrequency and continuous&#xD;
      cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019, our group released an initial report on efficacy and safety of AVNRT ablation with&#xD;
      new flexible tip open irrigated catheter (FlexAbilityTM, Abbott, St. Paul, MN, USA) combined&#xD;
      with 3D EAM system (EnSite PrecisionTM, Abbott, St. Paul, MN, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of flexible tip open irrigated catheter&#xD;
      ablative technique used in combination with 3D EAM. Our group recently published a subsequent&#xD;
      work on a larger cohort of patients with long-term follow-up. About 150 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled with mean follow-up period of 38 months. Acute procedural success rate was 96.7%&#xD;
      (145/150 patients). During follow-up, 11 patients experienced arrhythmia recurrence (7.3%).&#xD;
      No patient developed atrioventricular conduction block requiring pacemaker implantation (0%).&#xD;
      In our study, therefore, results related to acute procedural success and long-term follow-up&#xD;
      showed that AVNRT can be treated safely and effectively with irrigated flexible tip catheters&#xD;
      and 3D EAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the WATER ATTAC study we want to verify if the same results can be obtained by expanding&#xD;
      the sample size in a multicentric context, with the aim of externally validating AVNRT&#xD;
      tranascatheter ablation procedure with irrigated catheter and three-dimensional&#xD;
      electroanatomic mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of AVNRT ablations&#xD;
      performed by combining irrigated catheter with three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping&#xD;
      system. The effectiveness of procedure and incidence of complications in medium and long term&#xD;
      follow-up will be evaluated.&#xD;
