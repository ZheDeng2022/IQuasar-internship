      There have been concerning case reports of marked elevations of LDL-c in some individuals&#xD;
      consuming a KD and Dr. Lewis has been referred a number of these cases to his lipid clinic,&#xD;
      some of whom have had extreme elevations of LDL that mimic familial hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
      These marked elevations of LDLc are unique to a ketogenic diet and far exceed the typical&#xD;
      mild elevations seen in those consuming a high fat, low carbohydrate LGIT. The degree of&#xD;
      elevation of LDL-c suggests that ketosis per se may impair LDL receptor-mediated LDL particle&#xD;
      clearance. This clinical observation is a concerning and clinically important issue since&#xD;
      millions of people are consuming this popular diet. There are currently no studies that have&#xD;
      examined the mechanism of the LDL-raising effect of a ketogenic diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A ketogenic diet (KD) has recently gained popularity amongst the public due to its ability to&#xD;
      induce rapid weight loss and for a number of other putative but unproven health benefits.&#xD;
      Ketogenic diets also have proven efficacy in resistant cases of seizure disorders. However,&#xD;
      due to palatability and adherence issues with KD, alternative diets like the less extreme low&#xD;
      glycemic index treatment (LGIT) diet have been effectively used as a seizure disorder&#xD;
      treatment option. KD primarily restricts the total amount of carbohydrates in the diet to&#xD;
      ≤10% of total caloric intake whereas LGIT primarily restricts high glycemic index foods with&#xD;
      total carbohydrates constituting 15% of total energy consumption. While several benefits have&#xD;
      been outlined previously, conflicting results have been observed on the effect of&#xD;
      diet-induced ketosis on plasma concentrations of the atherogenic low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDLc). While some studies showed a significant increase in LDLc with KD&#xD;
      treatment, other studies reported the opposite effects with some studies reporting no&#xD;
      difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the studies that reported an increase in LDLc, a review conducted by Chawla et al reported&#xD;
      that restricting carbohydrates did not lower LDLc compared to a low-fat diet. In fact, the&#xD;
      studies that utilized a low carbohydrate diet reported a significant increase in plasma LDLc&#xD;
      concentrations. Similar results were observed by others who reported a significant increase&#xD;
      in plasma LDLc within 3 weeks, six months, and 12 months of KD, respectively. Contrary to&#xD;
      these findings, Dashti et al reported a significant reduction in plasma LDLc within eight&#xD;
      weeks of KD, which remained lower for 24 weeks. Interestingly, in a study conducted by&#xD;
      Luukkonen et al, six weeks of KD did not result in any changes in the plasma LDLc. Similar&#xD;
      findings were reported by others. With regard to the effect of KD on apoB, limited studies&#xD;
      reported that KD increased apoB in the pediatric population but resulted in no change in&#xD;
      plasma apoB concentration in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Importantly, there have been concerning case reports of marked elevations of LDL-c in some&#xD;
      individuals consuming a KD and Dr. Lewis has been referred a number of these cases to his&#xD;
      lipid clinic, some of whom have had extreme elevations of LDL that mimic familial&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. These marked elevations of LDLc are unique to a ketogenic diet and far&#xD;
      exceed the typical mild elevations seen in those consuming a high fat, low carbohydrate LGIT.&#xD;
      The investigators speculate that there may be metabolic effects of ketosis per se,&#xD;
      independent of the macronutrient composition of the diet that could impair LDL clearance or&#xD;
      increase its production. Hence our interest in comparing the effects on LDL metabolism of two&#xD;
      low carbohydrate, high-fat diets, differing in their degree of carbohydrate restriction, with&#xD;
      and without ketosis. Of course, the investigators cannot completely match the macronutrient&#xD;
      composition of the two diets, but the diets will be matched as closely as possible apart from&#xD;
      maintaining carbohydrates below or just above the ketogenic threshold, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the popularity of ketogenic diets has increased exponentially amongst the general&#xD;
      public in recent years and is commonly used for the treatment of epilepsy, a significant&#xD;
      increase in atherogenic LDL-c concentration in those consuming KD could have important public&#xD;
      health ramifications. Based on previous literature, at least 1/3rd of the individuals&#xD;
      following KD have reported a marked elevation in LDLc levels. Whether this marked elevation&#xD;
      in LDLc is due to excess production of LDLc or a defect in clearance is unknown. Due to the&#xD;
      complexities and difficulties in quantitating synthesis and clearance rates for LDLc, no&#xD;
      studies have been conducted to investigate the changes in LDLc kinetics in response to KD.&#xD;
