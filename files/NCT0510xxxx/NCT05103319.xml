  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to retrospective investigate the effects of the simultaneous intravenous (i.v.)&#xD;
      administration of lidocaine and ketamine on a four to six weeks interval in treatment&#xD;
      refractory different chronic pain conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of intravenous infusion therapy with lidocaine or ketamine has been of interest in&#xD;
      several chronic pain conditions. Studies showed a benefit in immediate pain reduction and&#xD;
      even longer lasting pain relief for treatment approaches with lidocaine and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a broad database on the use of lidocaine and ketamine in chronic pain&#xD;
      management as separate agents, very few pre-clinical animal studies have investigated the&#xD;
      combined use of said analgesics and none of them reports their combined use in chronic pain&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to retrospective investigate the effects of the simultaneous i.v.&#xD;
      administration of lidocaine and ketamine on a four to six weeks interval in treatment&#xD;
      refractory different chronic pain conditions.&#xD;
