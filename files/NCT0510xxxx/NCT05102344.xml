  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to replicate results of a previously studied novel, non-pharmacological&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention for children with ADHD, utilizing an Animal Assisted Intervention&#xD;
      with therapy dogs combined with traditional social skills training (AAI) compared to&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment as usual with social skills training alone (TAU). This study also aims&#xD;
      to determine if candidate physiological markers of HPA axis and ANS activity differ between&#xD;
      groups and if these markers moderate response to the interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly occurring&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States, with current prevalence rates between 8%&#xD;
      and 11%, up from an estimated 5% in 2003. Despite decades of research, individuals with ADHD&#xD;
      continue to be at significantly greater risk for poor life outcomes compared to non-affect&#xD;
      peers. Evidence-based interventions for ADHD include stimulant medications and psychosocial&#xD;
      treatments, but these practices are not always feasible or acceptable due to adverse&#xD;
      side-effects, cost, availability, and poor treatment adherence. ADHD is considered to be a&#xD;
      result of a physiological disruption of select catecholaminergic systems (e.g. dopamine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine) and related under-arousal of cognitive functions of the pre-frontal cortex&#xD;
      involved in executive functioning (EF). Research indicates that AAI with dogs is effective&#xD;
      for improving social-behavioral outcomes related to EF deficits. The mechanisms by which AAI&#xD;
      improves outcomes for this group and mediators of these outcomes, however, is not yet&#xD;
      understood. These gaps in understanding hinder progress in the application of AAI, limiting&#xD;
      the acceptability and availability of this integrative health care practice. Recent research&#xD;
      in other populations suggests that AAI acts on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis&#xD;
      activity, reducing physiological stress Children with ADHD, however, present with different&#xD;
      Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) response patterns when compared to typically developing&#xD;
      children and children with other mental health disorders and this phenomenon points to&#xD;
      altered physiological activity in response to stress, social feedback, and emotional stimuli&#xD;
      when compared to their peers. The bio-social mechanistic hypothesis proposed in this study&#xD;
      contends that dogs may elicit physiological responses related to cognitive arousal of EF&#xD;
      systems, thereby enhancing response to treatment in children with ADHD. Furthermore, given&#xD;
      the heterogeneity of impairment and high comorbidity with other mental health disorders among&#xD;
      children with ADHD and the prevalence of ADHD across cultures, race and ethnicity, individual&#xD;
      differences in response to AAI and in child/animal interaction may potentially mediate&#xD;
      response to AAI. This research will explore these gaps by: 1) replicating findings from a&#xD;
      previous AAI RCT on social-behavioral outcomes, 2) exploring candidate physiological&#xD;
      responses to AAI over time, and 3) ascertaining if individual differences during AAI mediate&#xD;
      primary and/or exploratory main outcomes. This study hypothesizes AAI will result in enhanced&#xD;
      social-behavioral outcomes and improved diurnal patterns of HPA and ANS for these children.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is suspected acute physiological responses to AAI (markers of HPA &amp; ANS) and&#xD;
      social interaction quality (child/child and child/dog) will mediate main outcomes. To explore&#xD;
      these hypotheses, the investigators will conduct an exploratory parallel-group randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial with 48 young children with ADHD, participating in psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention with or without AAI using a previously manualized AAI model developed and found&#xD;
      successful in prior work. This work will yield the first information on candidate mechanisms&#xD;
      thought to play an important role in AAI for children with ADHD, thus laying foundations for&#xD;
      later submission of a fully powered, multi-site randomized clinical trial aimed to better&#xD;
      inform approaches refined for this group, and promote acceptability and generalizability of&#xD;
      AAI with children with special needs.&#xD;
