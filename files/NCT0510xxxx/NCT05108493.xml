  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis is painful tendinosis of the main extensor tendon that occurs at the&#xD;
      fibro-osseous junction of the outer elbow region. Histopathological samples in patients with&#xD;
      chronic lateral epicondylitis show that there is angiofibroblastic degeneration and failure&#xD;
      in the normal tendon repair process rather than acute inflammation in this region. It has&#xD;
      begun to be accepted that the main factor in lateral epicondylitis is not the inflammatory&#xD;
      events but the degenerative process. There are many treatment methods that trigger structural&#xD;
      healing in tendinopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of the dry needling method of&#xD;
      the lateral epicondyle region.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis occurs as a result of micro-tears and progressive degeneration caused&#xD;
      by repetitive tension, especially at the attachment of the main extensor tendon to the&#xD;
      lateral epicondyle. The treatment modality to be used, which causes an increase in functional&#xD;
      cells, can prevent the apoptotic process; Thus, it is suggested that there are methods that&#xD;
      can reconstruct tendon structure and function. Inflammation can have a positive effect on the&#xD;
      healing process in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. Methods such as prolotherapy and&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma therapy are among the methods that trigger the inflammation process in&#xD;
      the lateral epicondyle region and subsequently contribute to the regeneration process. In all&#xD;
      these treatments, there is evidence that the local healing process is triggered by the&#xD;
      'needle effect'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry needle therapy is a method that has been widely used in musculoskeletal diseases for many&#xD;
      years, and it is one of the safe and cost-effective applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators planned to evaluate the clinical efficiency of dry needling&#xD;
      of lateral epicondyle area those are the origin of the extensor muscle groups of the wrist in&#xD;
      addition to the home exercise program and to compare the groups in terms of pain severity,&#xD;
      functionality, and improvement in handgrip strength with the participants applied for the&#xD;
      only home exercise program.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire. PRTEE is a 15-item questionnaire designed to measure forearm pain and disability in patients with lateral epicondylitis. PRTEE allows patients to rate their levels of elbow pain and disability from 0 to 10. The test consists of 2 subscales: 1) Pain subscale [5 items] (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable) 2) Function subscale [Specific activities - 6 items, Usual activities - 4 items] (0 = no difficulty, 10 = unable to do). A total score can be computed on a scale of 100 (0 = no disability).</description>

    <description>The experimental intervention will consist of 3 sessions of dry needling of the lateral epicondyle region, once per week with disposable acupuncture needles (0.25x25mm).&#xD;
Range of motion, stretching exercises, ulnar and radial deviation, forearm pronation, supination, elbow extensor, and flexor strengthening exercises will be given to all participants.&#xD;
The exercise program will be performed for 10 repetitions 2 times a day. All participants will be advised to continue the exercise program for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>All participants will start the home exercise program during the study period consisting of range of motion exercises for wrist flexion, extension, ulnar and radial deviation, elbow flexion and extensor; forearm supinator, and pronator muscles; stretching exercises. Eccentric strengthening of the wrist flexor extensors, ulnar and radial deviation, forearm pronation, supination, and strengthening exercise training will be given to the elbow extensors and flexors. Progressive strengthening exercises will be added to the program. The exercise program will be terminated with stretching exercises. The exercises will be performed for 10 repetitions 2 times a day, stay in each position for 10 seconds, and rest for 30 seconds between periods. Both groups will be advised to continue the exercise program for 12 weeks.</description>
