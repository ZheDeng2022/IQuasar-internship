  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial with a stratified (diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      non-diabetes mellitus), balanced randomization (1:1), placebo-controlled study regarding the&#xD;
      effect of carbohydrate loading 2 hours prior to the outpatient upper endoscopic procedure.&#xD;
      All patients who were assigned for outpatient oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) were invited&#xD;
      to join in this study voluntarily from January 2021 until August 2021. This study was&#xD;
      conducted in the Endoscopy Unit, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Malaysia.&#xD;
      The endoscopists that performed this procedure were blinded and there was trained staff who&#xD;
      was not involved in the study to assess the well-being score. The study protocol had been&#xD;
      approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia (JEPeM) with the&#xD;
      assigned protocol code USM/JEPeM/20080414.&#xD;

      Patient planned for OGDS in HUSM will be randomized into 2 groups. Plain water is given to&#xD;
      group A of subject and carbohydrate loading is given to group B subject 2 hours before OGDS.&#xD;
      Gastric residual volume is visualized directly and measured through aspiration via OGDS and&#xD;
      subject's well-being is assessed for both group of the subject prior and after clear fluid&#xD;
      have been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design :- This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial. This is a stratified&#xD;
      (diabetes mellitus, non-diabetes mellitus) with balanced randomization (1:1),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study Study area :- This study will be conducted in the endoscopy room,&#xD;
      Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) in Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjected planned for OGDS with the complaint of one or more of the following symptoms :&#xD;
      Bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain or epigastric burning and&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria are selected. Patients will be approached and be explained&#xD;
      regarding the study in surgical outpatient clinic before OGDS. The patient will be approached&#xD;
      again on the day of OGDS, if agree to participate, informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained after explanation regarding the study and procedure again&#xD;
      by researcher nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation sequence is according to computer-generated random number list, it was&#xD;
      prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The allocation&#xD;
      sequence was concealed from researcher enrolling and assessing participants. The allocation&#xD;
      sequence will be sealed in sequentially numbered and opaque envelopes. A manila card will be&#xD;
      placed inside envelop to render it impermeable to intense light. To prevent subversion of the&#xD;
      allocation sequence, the name and identification number of the participants will be written&#xD;
      on a book together with the series number on the envelope. The details in the book will be&#xD;
      kept confidentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolled subject complete all the baseline assessment, the corresponding envelope will&#xD;
      be enclosed by the trained staff (who not involved in the study) who prepare the drink. The&#xD;
      staff need to ensure that the envelop is still sealed when receiving it. The staff will&#xD;
      prepare the drink into an identical container according to the assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are randomized into 2 groups: 1 group with 400mL plain water and another group&#xD;
      given 1 packet carborie (400mL). Subjects need to finish the drink over 10 minutes. After&#xD;
      that, subjects are not allowed to leave endoscope room until finish OGDS to prevent&#xD;
      consumption of other drink or food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 hours after that, the subject undergoes OGDS. OGDS is performed following the standard&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient lies in the left lateral position&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medication/lignocaine spray to numb the back of throats (spray) will be given to prevent&#xD;
           gagging during the passage of the instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A plastic mouth guard (mouthpiece) is placed between the teeth to prevent damage to the&#xD;
           teeth and endoscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The endoscope (also called a gastroscope) will be inserted through the mouthpiece&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A small container or yankauer suction is placed close to the mouth of a patient to&#xD;
           collect saliva during and after the oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The endoscope will be inserted along the middle line of the soft palate&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Once endoscope advanced, the patient may be asked to swallow to facilitate advancement&#xD;
           of scope&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Throughout the procedure, no water flushing is allowed, only air inflation is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visualized pooling of fluid in the stomach is aspirated until dry via direct visualization&#xD;
      with the endoscope. The aspirated fluid will be collected in the suction reservoir and the&#xD;
      fluid will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's well-being score is assessed via visual analogue scale (VAS) which consist of 5&#xD;
      parameters: hunger, thirst, anxiety, tiredness and general discomfort. This scale will be&#xD;
      used repeatedly during this study to assess the patient's well-being. The trained staff nurse&#xD;
      will ask the patient regarding the level of 5 parameters and subject need to mark [X]&#xD;
      somewhere along the horizontal line given before drink and before OGDS procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are advised to inform assessor if there is an adverse reaction. Medical&#xD;
      personnel are available to manage any adverse events that might occur throughout the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible risk that may arise in the study includes injury to the gastrointestinal wall,&#xD;
      aspiration and bleeding which is the similar risk for all patient undergoing for OGDS&#xD;
      procedure. The small volume of the drink will not cause psychological distress to the&#xD;
      subject, but its taste may not be palatable.&#xD;
