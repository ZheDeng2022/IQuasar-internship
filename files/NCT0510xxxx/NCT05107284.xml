  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy episodic alcohol use within the college student population is widespread, creating&#xD;
      problems for student drinkers, their peers, and their institutions. Negative consequences&#xD;
      from heavy alcohol use can be mild (e.g., hangovers, missed classes), to severe (e.g.,&#xD;
      assault, even death). Although online interventions targeting college student drinking reduce&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and associated problems, they are not as effective as in-person&#xD;
      interventions. Online interventions are cost-effective, offer privacy, reduce stigma, and may&#xD;
      reach individuals who would otherwise not receive treatment. In a recently completed&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial, an emailed booster with personalized feedback improved the&#xD;
      efficacy of a popular online intervention (Braitman &amp; Henson, 2016). A second randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial confirmed efficacy for students of legal drinking age for a longer timeline&#xD;
      (Braitman &amp; Lau-Barraco, 2018). Although promising, the booster incorporated in the study&#xD;
      needs further empirical refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project seeks to build on past progress by further developing and refining the&#xD;
      booster. In particular, the current project is an extension of previous work by expanding the&#xD;
      investigation into complete social networks (students involved in Greek life). This booster&#xD;
      contains feedback about alcohol use tailored to the recipient, and will be emailed 2, 6, 10,&#xD;
      and 14 weeks after baseline (experimental condition), or not at all (control condition). This&#xD;
      study will be conducted specifically with students who are members of fraternities or&#xD;
      sororities at ODU (specifically, those in the organizations that agree to participate). This&#xD;
      population engages in heavy alcohol use so is ideal for an alcohol intervention. Members of&#xD;
      fraternities and sororities (i.e., &quot;Greek life&quot;) engage in more frequent drinking, consume&#xD;
      more when drinking, and have higher peak drinking occasions than students not involved in&#xD;
      Greek life. We aim to administer the intervention and associated booster among complete&#xD;
      networks of Greek organizations to examine how the intervention and booster and progress&#xD;
      through social networks.&#xD;

    <description>The e-checkup to go alcohol program is designed to motivate individuals to reduce their alcohol consumption using personalized information about their own use and risk factors. The program is a combination of several components including alcohol education, personalized feedback, attitude-focused strategies, and skills training. It is self-guided and requires no face-to-face time with an administrator. It provides tailored feedback regarding quantity and frequency of alcohol use, normative comparisons, physical health information, amount and percent of income spent on alcohol, negative consequences feedback, explanation and advice for how to reach their goals, and resources.</description>
