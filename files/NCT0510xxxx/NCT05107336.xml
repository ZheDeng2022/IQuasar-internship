    <textblock>
      This Phase I, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled study has been designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD2693 following subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      administration of AZD2693 in healthy Japanese participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be performed at a single study center in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An 8-week Treatment Period during which participants will be randomized to receive&#xD;
           multiple doses of AZD2693 or placebo at the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Period of 15 weeks post last dose of study intervention consisting of 8&#xD;
           Follow-up Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in 2 consecutive cohorts of 11 participants where 8&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive AZD2693 and 3 participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant is considered to have completed the study if the participant has completed all&#xD;
      phases of the study including the last visit.&#xD;
