  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of daily supplementation of the NUTRIOSE® on the fecal microbiota. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of the study is that the NUTRIOSE® is able to modulate the intestinal microbiota in a&#xD;
      positive way, compare to a placebo, in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
