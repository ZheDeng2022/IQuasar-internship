  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the daily clinical practice, one of the most frequent reasons for consultation&#xD;
      physiotherapists is low back pain (LBP). Regardless of the origin of the problem, the&#xD;
      approach from physiotherapy contemplates the reduction of pain through different procedures,&#xD;
      including neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of Physiotherapy, ultrasound-guided Percutaneous Neuromodulation (PNM) is&#xD;
      defined as the application through a needle with ultrasound guidance of an electrical current&#xD;
      at low or medium frequency, seeking a sensitive and / or motor response of a peripheral nerve&#xD;
      in some point of its trajectory, or of a muscle in a motor point, with a therapeutic&#xD;
      objective. The objective of the study is to analyze that the effect of PNM on the sciatic&#xD;
      nerve produces statistically significant changes in pain, joint range and functionality in&#xD;
      patients with chronic LBP. Forty subjects will be recruited, which will be divided into 2&#xD;
      groups: group 1 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve at 250 microseconds, 3 Hz)&#xD;
      during 90 seconds; group 2 to which PNM will be applied to the sciatic nerve in at 250&#xD;
      microseconds, 10 Hz during 90 second. The PNM intervention with NMP will consist in the&#xD;
      single application of an asymmetric rectangular biphasic current.&#xD;

    <description>Participants received the percutaneous electrical stimulation intervention. Specifically, this consisted of the application of a square wave biphasic electrical current, with 3 Hz frequency and a 250µs pulse width, at the maximal tolerable intensity, to cause an tolerable muscle contraction. The application was 10 stimulations of 10 seconds, with 10 seconds at rest between stimulations. A trained physiotherapist performed the PNM intervention.</description>
