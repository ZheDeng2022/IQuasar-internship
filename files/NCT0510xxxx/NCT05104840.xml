  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV and HCoV-19 1), a novel beta&#xD;
      coronavirus B lineage (βCoV), has sparked a global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.&#xD;
      It has been suggested that RRAR, a unique furin-like cleavage site (FCS) in the spike protein&#xD;
      (S) that is absent in other B βCoV lines such as SARS-CoV, is responsible for its high&#xD;
      infectivity and transmissibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furin is a protein with a special function of a fermentative biocatalyst: which recognizes&#xD;
      the degree of maturity of a group of amino acids Functionally, Furin works to renew the body,&#xD;
      but it is also a path to the introduction of the SARS-CoV virus into a living human cell, HIV&#xD;
      virus, Ebola virus, and others that penetrate a human cell using the Furin protein, sending a&#xD;
      conditioned signal from the extracellular matrix, and gives the virus the opportunity to&#xD;
      merge the protein of the coronavirus spike and the protein content of the cut cell, which&#xD;
      activates the phase of virus replication in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that measuring the quantitative indicators of Furin protein expression in&#xD;
      patients (at the onset of the disease) who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 and vaccinated&#xD;
      (with all types of vaccines) against coronavirus can provide an understanding of the&#xD;
      molecular-cellular mechanisms of the virus's cellular invasion. This means that it will be&#xD;
      possible to find new ways to prevent the fusion of the membranes of infected cells with&#xD;
      normal ones (this mechanism allows the virus to spread throughout the body without leaving&#xD;
      the affected cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein identification will be carried out by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (the method of&#xD;
      enhanced chemiluminescence differs from the method of immunochemical staining using&#xD;
      chromogenic substrates by a much greater sensitivity)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The parameters of the Furin protein in the blood of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      COVID-19 on days 4, 8, or 14 after the onset of symptoms of the disease or a positive PCR&#xD;
      test will be assessed ( provided they are in a hospital or clinic for inpatient or outpatient&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to donate blood for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of&#xD;
           levels of specific IgM and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 from the 3rd to the 39th day after the&#xD;
           development of COVID-19 (provided they are in a hospital or clinic for inpatient or&#xD;
           outpatient treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to take a blood test to quantify antibodies (IgG, IgM) to the IgG&#xD;
           class coronavirus to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and IgM antibodies, to proteins&#xD;
           (nucleocapsid (N) and RBD site of the S-protein ) SARS-CoV-2, (ELISA),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of specific antibodies in the blood serum allows you to determine whether the&#xD;
      body has met with the COVID-19 virus and whether antibodies have been developed during the&#xD;
      contact that recognizes] this virus when they meet again. ⠀ The primary immune response to&#xD;
      antigens new to the body begins with the production of immunoglobulins M (IgM). IgM to&#xD;
      COVID-19 appears in the blood about 2-3 weeks after exposure to the virus in the case of&#xD;
      asymptomatic COVID-19 and disappears by about 14-16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the formation of antibodies is due to the individual characteristics of the immune&#xD;
      system, the results of selective testing on different test systems in different countries in&#xD;
      different ethnic groups should verify the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * The absence of antibodies will not be evidence of the absence of infection, since there is&#xD;
      a concept of a &quot;serological window&quot;, when the pathogen has already entered the body, the&#xD;
      pathological process develops, but antibodies have not yet appeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age data will be taken into account This study does not imply the receipt, storage and&#xD;
      processing of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the vaccinated, the level of Furin protein in the blood will be determined after the&#xD;
           first and (or) after the second vaccination, as well as after the booster dose on days&#xD;
           10-60-120-240-360 after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In those who have been ill, but not vaccinated with any vaccine against coronavirus, the&#xD;
           level of Furin protein in the blood will be determined up to 60 days after receiving a&#xD;
           negative PCR test and the absence of clinical signs of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with post-COVID conditions (syndrome), or with a severe form of the disease,&#xD;
           the indicators will be determined up to day 180 inclusive after receiving a negative PCR&#xD;
           test and the absence of acute clinical signs of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patients have data, the results of genotyping / mutation and coronavirus variant&#xD;
           will be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be offered compensation (financial reward) for taking tests, participating&#xD;
           in a survey, and providing data and/or travel expenses for testing.&#xD;
