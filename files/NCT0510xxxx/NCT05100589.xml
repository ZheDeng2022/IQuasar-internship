  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral ATP disodium (adenosine 5'- triphosphate disodium) is a commercially available product&#xD;
      available alone and as a constituent in a number of sports supplements that is purported to&#xD;
      maintain ATP levels and improve performance during high-intensity exercise. Acute deficits in&#xD;
      cognitive performance have also been reported in both young adults and children following&#xD;
      high-intensity exercise; however, the effects of supplemental ATP on cognitive performance&#xD;
      has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effect of ATP supplementation versus. placebo on mood, reaction time&#xD;
           and cognitive performance before and after an acute bout of fatiguing exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of ATP supplementation versus. placebo on anaerobic&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Oral ATP disodium (adenosine 5'- triphosphate disodium) is a commercially available product&#xD;
      available alone and as a constituent in a number of sports supplements that is purported to&#xD;
      maintain ATP levels during high-intensity exercise. Initial studies providing oral enteric&#xD;
      coated ATP disodium displayed no apparent efficacy toward enhancing ATP levels, and&#xD;
      subsequent research questioned the bioavailability of enteric coated ATP following oral&#xD;
      administration (1,2). However, a recent study demonstrated that ingestion of 400mg uncoated&#xD;
      ATP disodium for 15 days prevented decreases in ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and&#xD;
      adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in the bloodstream for up to 30 minutes following&#xD;
      high-intensity exercise when compared to placebo (3). Consistent with this, when oral ATP was&#xD;
      administered in the form of non-coated ATP disodium, beneficial effects including reduced&#xD;
      fatigue (3), improved strength, power, and body composition (5), and enhanced recovery (6)&#xD;
      were observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute deficits in cognitive performance have also been reported in both young adults (6) and&#xD;
      children (7) following high-intensity exercise. Cerebral activity is coupled to ATP&#xD;
      metabolism, where energy flux is tightly correlated with energy demand (8). Thus, inadequate&#xD;
      availability of metabolic resources may lead to acute or long-term cognitive impairments (9)&#xD;
      and correspondingly, interventions that sustain ATP levels may have application for&#xD;
      attenuating cognitive dysfunction in the face of an acute stressor that challenges brain&#xD;
      energy metabolism. Notwithstanding, no study to date has examined the effect of uncoated ATP&#xD;
      disodium supplementation on cognitive performance following high-intensity exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the the effects of uncoated ATP disodium (PeakATP) on mood (POMS -&#xD;
           Profile of mood states questionnaire), psychological stress and cognition (ANAM -&#xD;
           Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric), reaction time (RT - Dynavision D2&#xD;
           visuomotor tests), and multiple object tracking (MOT - Neurotracker)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of uncoated ATP disodium (PeakATP) on end power (mean power&#xD;
           during last 30 seconds of 3-minute test), anaerobic working capacity (work above end&#xD;
           power), peak power, mean power, time to peak power, fatigue slope (W/sec), rate of&#xD;
           fatigue (%), and total work (joules) during a 3-minute all-out cycle ergometer test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over trial comparing the effect of&#xD;
      supplementation with Peak ATP versus placebo on mood, reaction time and cognitive&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation will occur over a period of 14 days prior to completion of two separate&#xD;
      experimental trials (randomly assigned), with a 14-day washout period in between. An acute&#xD;
      dose will also be given during each experimental trial. POMS, RT, MOT and ANAM will be&#xD;
      assessed pre- (0) immediately post- (IP) and 60-minutes (60P) post-completion of a 3-minute&#xD;
      all-out cycle ergometer test. Anaerobic performance during the 3-minute test will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Multiple object Tracking (MOT) speed will be assessed via the completion of a CORE assessment using Neurotracker MOT software. The Neurotracker MOT assessment requires participants to track four targets among eight spheres projected within a cube space. The spheres follow a linear trajectory in space, with deviations in trajectory occurring in response to collisions between balls and with the walls of the cube. The CORE assessment includes 20 trials and lasts approx. 6 minutes and challenges attention, visual information processing speed and working memory. The MOT speed threshold, defined as the speed at which the participant correctly identifies all target balls 50% of the time (i.e., the point at which their performance neither improves nor deteriorates) will be determined.</description>

    <description>Subjects will complete 60 seconds of unloaded cycling at 90 rpm before immediately completing a 3-minute all-out test on a cycle ergometer. Resistance during the test will be set as a function of pedaling rate using a scaling factor based on the power output at a set cadence (70 rpm) being equal to 50% of the difference between the power output at gas exchange threshold (GET) and peak power output assessed during the VO2peak test. End power (mean power during last 30 seconds of 3-minute test), anaerobic working capacity (work above end power), peak power, mean power, time to peak power, fatigue slope (W/sec), rate of fatigue (%), and total work (joules) will be calculated</description>
