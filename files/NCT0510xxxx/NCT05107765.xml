      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of pioglitazone on stress-induced relapse&#xD;
      risk in a laboratory model and to examine the effects of pioglitazone on drinking,&#xD;
      stress/anxiety, and alcohol craving in the natural environment&#xD;

    <description>This self report assessment will be based on the human laboratory stress reactivity assessment and will be measured by the Alcohol craving scale which is a 5 item questionnaire and each item is scored form 0( none)- 10 (extreme) a higher number indicating a higher alcohol craving with a maximum score of 50.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline,week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PACS is a five-item self-administered instrument for assessing craving. Frequency, intensity, and duration of thoughts about drinking are assessed along with ability to resist drinking. The final item asks the responder to provide an average rating of his/her craving over the course of the past week. Each item is scored from 0(none)-10(extreme), a higher number indicating more craving.</description>
