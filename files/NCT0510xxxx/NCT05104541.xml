  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition therapy is the cornerstone of medical therapy in patients with cirrhosis. 70%&#xD;
      compensated patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) are overweight or obese. Obesity in CLD&#xD;
      augments decompensation, plausibly through increase in portal pressure. Moreover, the&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors are increased with increase in body weight, obesity also has an&#xD;
      impact on the already compromised health-related quality of life of patients with CLD. Most&#xD;
      feasible, safe, and widely used method of management of obesity is life-style modifications.&#xD;
      Hypocaloric with normal to high protein diet along with moderate-intensity exercises have&#xD;
      been practiced for weight reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These kinds of dietary changes reduce body weight and may bring about favourable changes in&#xD;
      the body composition (reduce the body fat percentage but at the same time preserving the lean&#xD;
      body mass). Weight loss in obese patients with CLD would in turn improve the clinical&#xD;
      outcome, reduce the hepatic complications, moreover weight loss may also improve health&#xD;
      related quality of life, and other prognostic markers of the disease like fibroscan along&#xD;
      with improvement in the associated metabolic derangements in patients with CLD. There is no&#xD;
      Indian data in this context. Thus, through this trial, investigator would be able to&#xD;
      ascertain an appropriate lifestyle-related non- intervention regimen that helps in the&#xD;
      management of obesity in patients with cirrhosis. Not only that the baseline information of&#xD;
      these obese patients with CLD would give us an idea or the profile of the body composition in&#xD;
      terms of muscularity, adiposity, sarcopenic obesity (if any), of these patients with CLD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver disease is one of the main causes of hospital admissions worldwide and the 12th leading&#xD;
      cause of mortality in many countries. Among all etiologies (toxic-metabolites, viral,&#xD;
      autoimmune, and genetic disorders), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) features as the&#xD;
      most common cause, with increasing prevalence attributed to the epidemic of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, more than 30% of the United&#xD;
      States population were obese and more than 60% overweight. Furthermore, 15% of all Western&#xD;
      population and 35% of patients with obesity will develop steatohepatitis (NASH). Hence world&#xD;
      over obesity is on a rise, the prevalence of obesity has consistently risen since past four&#xD;
      decades in both genders. Indian similar scenario is seen not only in the urban but also in&#xD;
      the rural population. This pandemic disease is attributed to both the increased amounts of&#xD;
      processed foods high in fructose, sodium, and saturated fats, and the increasingly sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle. Obesity is considered a chronic state of low-grade inflammation, being associated&#xD;
      with complications such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. It has also been linked with increased risks of certain cancers, such&#xD;
      as colon, breast, breast, endometrium, kidney, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and gallbladder.&#xD;
      The combination of obesity, insulin resistance, and NASH is also thought to increase the risk&#xD;
      of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Most of all obesity in cirrhotics accelerates&#xD;
      decompensation plausibly through an increase in portal hypertension. The risk of first&#xD;
      clinical decompensation of cirrhosis is approximately three times higher in obese cirrhotics&#xD;
      compared to those with normal weight. There are innumerable randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      examining the role of various kinds of weight-loss diets and regimens in NAFLD patients,&#xD;
      namely Mediterranean diets, Ornish diets, south beach diets, Atkins diets, Zone diet, weight&#xD;
      watcher's diets, etc. However, once cirrhosis sets in or is diagnosed the concept of&#xD;
      malnutrition akin to undernutrition is the prime consideration in a patient which baffles the&#xD;
      physicians. The nutritional guidelines either European Society of Parenteral and Enteral&#xD;
      Nutrition (ESPEN) or American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) have always&#xD;
      focused on a high calorie and a high protein diet in cirrhosis. These guidelines have not&#xD;
      even touched upon the topic of obesity in cirrhosis. Moreover, for decades, investigator have&#xD;
      been obsessed with the idea of protein restriction in patients with cirrhosis. In the recent&#xD;
      past, our attention is drawn towards the other end of the spectrum of malnutrition i.e.&#xD;
      obesity, which has been steadily on the rise world over and cirrhotics are no exception.&#xD;
      Obesity is associated with poor survival, severe hepatic decompensation, poor&#xD;
      post-transplantation outcomes as well as greater difficulty in liver transplantation, and&#xD;
      also higher non-response to antiviral therapy in patients with cirrhosis. Hence weight&#xD;
      reduction is the standard of care in such patients. A few studies have examined the role of a&#xD;
      monitored exercise program including resistance training including cycle ergometric exercises&#xD;
      have been shown to favorably change the body composition but none have been done in obese&#xD;
      cirrhotics with the aim of weight loss. At the same time, low-calorie and even&#xD;
      very-low-calorie ketogenic diets have been tried in obese cirrhosis and published as case&#xD;
      series. Based on the magnitude of the problem of obesity in CLD and its detrimental impact on&#xD;
      the clinical outcome investigator propose to assess the impact of weight loss with low&#xD;
      calorie, high protein diet and moderate physical activity (lifestyle modifications- a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological strategy) on liver fibrosis, body composition changes, functional&#xD;
      capacity, clinical outcome in obese cirrhotics in this study.&#xD;
