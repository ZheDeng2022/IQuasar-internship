      Introduction: Impulsivity is present in a range of mental disorders and has been associated&#xD;
      with suicide. Traditional measures of impulsivity have certain limitations, such as the time&#xD;
      required for administration or the lack of ecological validity. Virtual Reality (VR) may&#xD;
      overcome these issues. This study aims to validate the VR assessment tool &quot;Spheres &amp; Shield&#xD;
      Maze Task&quot; and speech analysis by comparing them with traditional measures. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that these innovative tools will be reliable and acceptable by patients, potentially&#xD;
      improving the simultaneous assessment of impulsivity, decision-making, and jumping to&#xD;
      conclusions. Methods and analysis: The sample consisted of adults divided into three groups:&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatients with a history of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors, psychiatric&#xD;
      outpatients without such a history, and healthy volunteers. The sample size required was&#xD;
      estimated at 300 participants (100 per group). Participants will complete the Barratt&#xD;
      Impulsiveness Scale 11; the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive&#xD;
      Urgency, Impulsive Behavior Scale; Iowa Gambling Task; Continuous Performance Test; Stop&#xD;
      signal Task, and Go/no-go task, three questions of emotional affect, the Spheres &amp; Shield&#xD;
      Maze Task and two satisfaction surveys. During these tasks, participant speech will be&#xD;
      recorded. External and internal consistency of the VR environment will be calculated. The&#xD;
      association between VR-assessed impulsivity and history of suicidal thoughts and/or behavior,&#xD;
      and the association between speech and impulsivity and decision-manking will also be&#xD;
      explored. Ethics and dissemination: This study will result in a series of manuscripts that&#xD;
      will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication. It is hoped that this VR&#xD;
      assessment tool combined with speech analysis can be used regularly in research and/or&#xD;
      clinical settings in the near future.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Impulsivity is defined as the tendency to act without prior reflection. It&#xD;
      implies poor self-control of behavior, leading to quick reactions without regard for&#xD;
      consequences. Impulsivity is strongly associated with suicidal behavior and may define a&#xD;
      particular suicidal phenotype in which action predominates over ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dimensional model of impulsivity considers three factors: decision-making, action, and&#xD;
      personality traits. The first two factors are the behavioral domains of impulsivity, assessed&#xD;
      with neuropsychological tests, while impulsivity as a personality trait is assessed with&#xD;
      personality questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these factors, the one that has been most strongly related to suicidal behavior is&#xD;
      decision-making. Decision-making is a complex cognitive function in which learning, previous&#xD;
      experience, and sensitivity to feedback interact. It can be intuitive or reflexive, involving&#xD;
      different brain structures: intuitive processes are mediated by the amygdala, ventral&#xD;
      striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex, while reflexive processes are mediated by the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal lobe. People with&#xD;
      suicidal behavior have difficulty making decisions in risky situations, and their learning to&#xD;
      make these decisions does not benefit from feedback. They tend to decide more emotionally&#xD;
      than rationally. Studies have found that more than half of all suicide attempts are&#xD;
      impulsive. Furthermore, increased impulsivity and aggression have been associated with death&#xD;
      by suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-administered questionnaires are the most common approach to assess impulsivity. Despite&#xD;
      its usefulness, self-report has significant limitations: the cultural influence of the&#xD;
      questionnaires hinders their generalizability. Furthermore, impulsive people may find it&#xD;
      challenging to describe their personality traits and may thus report unreliably. Computerized&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests overcome some of these limitations, as the cultural background does&#xD;
      not influence them, and they do not rely on the capacity for introspection and&#xD;
      self-awareness, but they are not without limitations, mainly the time it takes to administer&#xD;
      and score the tasks. In addition, the situations and stimuli presented to the persons&#xD;
      assessed are not very ecological, i.e., they do not usually have a translation to real life,&#xD;
      which may compromise their validity. Virtual reality (VR) may overcome these limitations.&#xD;
      There is empirical evidence showing that the neural mechanisms that people experience when&#xD;
      immersed in a VR environment are similar to those of real-life. Serious VR games have become&#xD;
      an innovative, engaging, and customizable way to provide healthcare. VR has been applied in&#xD;
      mental health interventions and the field of neuropsychological assessment with good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech has been increasingly studied for mental health assessment and particularly as a&#xD;
      biomarker for mental health. Speech samples can be collected easily and consistently from&#xD;
      patients and can help to solve the problem of limited or intermittent assessments due to cost&#xD;
      and time to see a clinician while providing ecologically relevant information that is&#xD;
      generally not available to clinicians. Combined with machine learning techniques, speech&#xD;
      features (textual features and/or acoustic features) are used for automatic assessment of&#xD;
      patients and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents the VR assessment tool &quot;Spheres &amp; Shield Maze Task&quot;, a virtual maze that&#xD;
      participants must go through while overcoming several obstacles, and which can decrease&#xD;
      administration time and provides an immersive experience that can approximate real-life&#xD;
      conditions, thus increasing ecological validity. The VR tool has been previously evaluated in&#xD;
      a non-clinical setting. This work aims to validate the Spheres &amp; Shield Maze Task by&#xD;
      comparing it with traditional measures of impulsivity, decision-making, and personality&#xD;
      traits in psychiatric patients with or without a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors&#xD;
      and in healthy controls. The secondary objective is to validate the implementation of speech&#xD;
      analysis in clinical settings and examine how speech correlates to impulsivity,&#xD;
      decision-making, impulsive personality traits, and jumping to conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that both the VR assessment tool and speech analysis will be reliable and&#xD;
      acceptable by patients, potentially improving the simultaneous assessment of impulsivity and&#xD;
      decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS &amp; ANALYSIS This is a cross-sectional study that will be carried out in the Department&#xD;
      of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz. Data will be collected over&#xD;
      an estimated period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size is 300 participants, 100 per branch. Psychiatric patients will be&#xD;
      recruited by their attending psychiatrist during regular visits. Healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited following the snowball methodology generated from mental health center workers,&#xD;
      trainees, and medicine and psychology students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, participants will be scheduled for the assessment&#xD;
      session, which will last approximately one hour. They will then be taken to another room and&#xD;
      administered the VR task that is recorded by the dual microphones in the Vive Pro Eye VR&#xD;
      headset. Trained psychologists will administer the questionnaires and assist the participant&#xD;
      during the VR task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be carried out: 1) collection of socio-demographic and&#xD;
      clinical data, 2) self-reported assessment of impulsive personality traits, 3) computerized&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, 4) VR-based impulsivity assessment, 5) assessment of jumping to&#xD;
      conclusions, 6) recording of spontaneous speech during both the assessment session and VR&#xD;
      task, and 7) satisfaction surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ad hoc questionnaire will be developed to record sociodemographic variables of interest,&#xD;
      including gender, age, marital status, employment status and educational level. History of&#xD;
      suicidal behaviour will also be assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional questionnaires will be the patients' health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the PANSS&#xD;
      scale -only in case of psychosis-, and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants will also be inquired about substance use -including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis,&#xD;
      cocaine, hallucinogens, and other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulsive personality traits will be measured through the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11),&#xD;
      and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency, Impulsive&#xD;
      Behavior Scale (UPPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computerized neuropsychological tests will be the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), the Continous&#xD;
      Performance Test (CPT), the Stop signal Task, and the Go/no-go Task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For speech analysis, the Emotional Affective Questions Good News Question and the Sadness&#xD;
      Characteristic Question will be used. Additionally, the patient is asked to respond for two&#xD;
      minutes and the interviewing psychologist will refrain from speaking during this period and&#xD;
      timestamp the recording. This question is designed to elicit an emotional response related to&#xD;
      positive and negative emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR environment, called Spheres &amp; Shield Maze Task, has been developed by the Laboratory&#xD;
      of Immersive Neurotechnologies (LabLENI) of the Universitat Politècnica de València. To&#xD;
      implement the virtual environment, a VIVE pro eye VR headset, a VNET INTEL I7 computer and a&#xD;
      Shimmer GSR (galvanic skin response) kit will be used. The game consists of a maze that the&#xD;
      user must solve by moving through space. The movement is done by combining a touchpad with&#xD;
      front-facing orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different hazards will present throughout the maze, with time penalty, energy loss, and&#xD;
      certain consequences, such as narrow walkways from which the player can fall, lightning&#xD;
      clouds that strike in intervals, flying insects, or locked rooms. The user can also make use&#xD;
      of a shield that allows moving through lightning and insects without time penalty at the cost&#xD;
      of being unable to gather green orbs. Hazards may also be avoided completely by choosing&#xD;
      another path through the labyrinth, however completion of the maze requires traversal of a&#xD;
      minimum number of hazards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screen displays an indicator of the energy which increases by gathering green orbs and&#xD;
      decreases with movement. If the energy decreases, the movement is slowed down. These&#xD;
      consequences may influence the user's decision-making. Energy can be recharged by consuming&#xD;
      green spheres to be found along the route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maze will be scored as the time taken to find the exit. Additionally, data will be&#xD;
      collected on behavioral and psychophysiological measures during the execution of the task,&#xD;
      including distance travelled, number of stops, trajectory, decision making at bifurcations,&#xD;
      total energy obtained, number of spheres collected, use of the Shield, and use of the break&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the session, participants will complete a quantitative and a qualitative&#xD;
      satisfaction survey, which have been used previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be carried out using SPSS 24.0, R, Matlab and Python statistical&#xD;
      software. External consistency of the VR task will be assessed using traditional&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures as Gold Standard, and internal consistency will be assessed using&#xD;
      Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient. To explore the differences between&#xD;
      groups (suicidal patients, non-suicidal patients, and healthy controls), the mean scores&#xD;
      obtained in the variables collected will be compared using ANOVA test or its non-parametric&#xD;
      equivalent if the distribution is not normal. Audio recordings will be analyzed in OpenSMILE,&#xD;
      an open-source offline software for audio analysis. Machine learning techniques will then be&#xD;
      used for feature selection and examining the relation between a participant's speech,&#xD;
      impulsivity, suicidality, and mental health questionnaires. Additionally, analysis of&#xD;
      recorded speech or utterance before and during the VR task will be used to predict&#xD;
      satisfaction of the participant. Descriptive statistics from the quantitative satisfaction&#xD;
      survey and content analysis for the qualitative satisfaction survey will also be provided.&#xD;
      All tests will be two-tailed with statistical significance stablished at p&lt;0.005 and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION It is expected that the VR-based assessment to be comparable to the traditional&#xD;
      self-report and neuropsychological assessment and to be better accepted by the participants.&#xD;
      This study will also contribute to increasing knowledge about the association between&#xD;
      impulsivity and suicidal behavior and the use of speech analysis in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will result in a series of manuscripts that will be submitted to peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journals for publication. Both significant and non-significant results will be reported. The&#xD;
      findings will also be presented in the form of oral communications and symposia at national&#xD;
      and international psychiatric conferences.&#xD;
