      This study evaluated the feasibility of an 8-week physical therapy program for persons with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain provided entirely using telehealth with real-time, interactive video&#xD;
      sessions with a physical therapist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At the time of the onset of the COVID pandemic, the research team was conducting a clinical&#xD;
      trial (the OPTIMIZE trial) investigating different nonpharmacologic treatments for persons&#xD;
      with chronic low back pain (NCT03859713). One intervention arm in this trial is in-person&#xD;
      physical therapy. COVID-related restrictions on in-person care prompted suspension of the&#xD;
      OPTIMIZE trial. In order to accommodate persons in the midst of receiving treatment at the&#xD;
      time of suspension, the study team adapted the in-person protocol for physical therapy for&#xD;
      telehealth delivery using two-way, real-time video sessions. Because of the lack of research&#xD;
      examining the feasibility of telehealth physical therapy provided in this manner, the study&#xD;
      team decided to conduct a pilot study to examine the feasibility of the telehealth protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a prospective, longitudinal cohort of persons with chronic LBP seeking care in&#xD;
      one of three healthcare systems; University of Utah Health and Intermountain Healthcare in&#xD;
      Salt Lake City, Utah, and Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. All participants&#xD;
      were offered up to 8 weekly sessions of telehealth physical therapy. Outcomes included&#xD;
      measures of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity as well as effectiveness&#xD;
      measures including the Oswestry Disability Index and the PROMIS-29 health domains.&#xD;
      Assessments occurred at baseline and after 10- and 26-weeks.&#xD;
