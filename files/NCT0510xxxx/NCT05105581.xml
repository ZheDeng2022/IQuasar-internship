  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder[7] in which a person&#xD;
      has certain thoughts repeatedly (called &quot;obsessions&quot;) and/or feels the need to perform&#xD;
      certain routines repeatedly (called &quot;compulsions&quot;) to an extent that generates distress or&#xD;
      impairs general functioning.[1][2] The person is unable to control either the thoughts or&#xD;
      activities for more than a short period of time.[1] Common compulsions include excessive hand&#xD;
      washing, the counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.[1] These activities&#xD;
      occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected,[1] often taking&#xD;
      up more than an hour a day.[2] Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.[1]&#xD;
      The condition is associated with tics, anxiety disorder, and an increased risk of&#xD;
      suicide.[2][3] The cause is unknown.[1] There appear to be some genetic components, with both&#xD;
      identical twins more often affected than both non-identical twins.[2] Risk factors include a&#xD;
      history of child abuse or other stress-inducing event.[2] Some cases have been documented to&#xD;
      occur following infections.[2] The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out&#xD;
      other drug-related or medical causes.[2] Rating scales such as the Yale-Brown Obsessive&#xD;
      Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.[8] Other disorders with similar&#xD;
      symptoms include anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic&#xD;
      disorders, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.[2]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment may involve psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and&#xD;
      antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or&#xD;
      clomipramine.[4][5] CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to fears and obsessions while&#xD;
      preventing the compulsive behavior that would normally accompany the obsessions.[4] Contrary&#xD;
      to this, metacognitive therapy encourages the ritual behaviors in order to alter the&#xD;
      relationship to one's thoughts about them.[9] While clomipramine appears to work as well as&#xD;
      do SSRIs, it has greater side effects and thus is typically reserved as a second-line&#xD;
      treatment.[4] Atypical antipsychotics may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side&#xD;
      effects.[5][10] Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.[2]&#xD;
