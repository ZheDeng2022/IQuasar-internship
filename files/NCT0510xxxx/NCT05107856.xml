  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1)&#xD;
      inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to define the dosing schedule, maximally tolerated dose and/or estimate the optimal&#xD;
      biological dose to be used in subsequent development of PRT1419.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1&#xD;
      inhibitor, evaluating patients as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap syndrome. The&#xD;
      study will employ a &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a minimum&#xD;
      safe and biologically effective dose or MTD is reached.&#xD;
