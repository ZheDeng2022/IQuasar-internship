  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, open-label, 8-week, prospective observational study, conducted at&#xD;
      multiple sites geographically dispersed within the U.S. The purpose of this Actual Use Study&#xD;
      (AUS) is to investigate how U.S. adult tobacco consumers 21 to 60 years of age, inclusive,&#xD;
      who typically smoke on average (≥5 cigarettes/day) on at least 20 out of the past 30 days&#xD;
      will use a heated tobacco product comprising a heating device and four non-combusted&#xD;
      cigarette variants (HTP Investigational Product [IP]) over a 6-week Actual Use Period (AUP)&#xD;
      in their real-life/naturalistic environment and in the context of typical consumer marketing&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult smokers will be recruited, and candidate subjects who meet study inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria will give verbal consent for further screening. Candidate&#xD;
      subjects will be scheduled to attend an in-person Site Enrollment Visit. Subjects will&#xD;
      self-report their ad libitum use of the HTP IP as well as use of combustible cigarettes (CCs)&#xD;
      and any other tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (TNPs) on a daily basis using an&#xD;
      electronic diary (eDiary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 1-week Baseline Assessment Period (BAP), enrolled subjects will record all CC and&#xD;
      any other TNP use in the eDiary. At the end of the BAP, subjects will return to the study&#xD;
      site for Site Visit 1 (SV1). At this visit, subjects will be provided the HTP IP for the&#xD;
      first two weeks of the AUP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the subsequent 6-week observational AUP, subjects can choose to use the HTP IP (or&#xD;
      not). Subjects will be instructed to record all daily TNP and CC use in the eDiary. They will&#xD;
      return to the site every two weeks during the AUP for an in-person interview, to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and for product accountability and resupply. As with SV1, at Site Visit 2 and&#xD;
      3, subjects will be able to select their preferred HTP IP variants (if desired) for use&#xD;
      during the subsequent 2-week AUP. Point of sale materials will be present during subject&#xD;
      interactions at SVs. After Week 6 of the AUP, there will be a final site visit and week-long&#xD;
      Close Out Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to collecting information on daily ad libitum use of HTP IP, TNP and CC use, the&#xD;
      study will assess subjective measures for each HTP IP, including product use/misuse and&#xD;
      intent to use again (at close of study). Information on intention to quit CC use will be&#xD;
      collected at enrollment and at study conclusion. A passive surveillance mechanism will be&#xD;
      used to collect information on adverse health experiences.&#xD;

        The study sample will comprise generally healthy, U.S. adult tobacco consumers 21 to 60&#xD;
        years of age, inclusive, who are regular smokers (≥5 cigarettes/day) on at least 20 of 30&#xD;
        days, who are not currently quitting all Tobacco- and/or Nicotine-containing Product (TNP)&#xD;
        use, and who have no intention of quitting all TNP use in the next three months (quitting&#xD;
        CC use only is allowable). Once enrolled, subjects confirming an intent to quit all TNP use&#xD;
        during the AUP will be discontinued. A recruiting target for younger smokers (21-30 years&#xD;
        old) of approximately 15% will be established to ensure that they are sufficiently&#xD;
        represented among the enrolled subjects.&#xD;
