  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Huntington's Disease Cognitive Assessment Battery (HD-CAB) Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The HD-CAB evaluates cognitive function via the following subtests: Symbol Digit Modalities Test; One Touch Stockings of Cambridge; Trail Making; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; Paced Tapping Test; and the Emotion Recognition Test. The HD-CAB composite is derived by transforming individual participants' scores on each of the 6 subtests to z-scores, and averaging z-scores to represent global performance relative to the reference sample. Change from baseline will be computed using baseline mean and standard deviation, with an expected z-score distribution of approximately -3 to +3. A positive HD-CAB composite at follow-up indicates improvement in cognitive function; a negative composite score indicates worsening in cognitive function; and a composite of &quot;0&quot; would reflect no change relative to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) - Independence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The UHDRS independence scale is a single item of independence rated from 0 to 100, with higher scores on the function scales indicating better functioning than lower scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the UHDRS - Total Motor Score (TMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The motor section of the UHDRS assesses motor features of HD with standardized ratings of oculomotor function, dysarthria, chorea, dystonia, gait, and postural stability. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-4, where 0 is &quot;normal,&quot; and 4 is the &quot;highest motor dysfunction.&quot; The total motor impairment score is the sum of all the individual motor ratings. The total score range is 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe motor impairment than lower scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 112 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of the investigational product, or any worsening of a pre-existing medical condition/AE with onset after the start of the investigational product and throughout the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet all the following criteria for HD:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Genetically confirmed disease with huntingtin gene CAG expansion â‰¥36.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. UHDRS-Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score &gt;6 and &lt;13.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No features of juvenile HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Score &lt;26 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be willing to invite a study partner, if available, who is reliable, competent, and at&#xD;
             least 18 years of age to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be ambulatory (use of assistance devices such as a walker or cane is acceptable;&#xD;
             individuals requiring a wheelchair are excluded), able to travel to the study center,&#xD;
             and, as judged by the investigator, is likely to be able to continue to travel to the&#xD;
             study center to complete study visits for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have participated in a previous clinical study of SAGE-718, have participated in a&#xD;
             previous gene therapy study, or have participated in any other drug, biologic, or&#xD;
             device trial within 180 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer), unless the patient&#xD;
             participated solely in the placebo arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of an ongoing neurodegenerative condition other than HD, including&#xD;
             but not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies,&#xD;
             or Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
