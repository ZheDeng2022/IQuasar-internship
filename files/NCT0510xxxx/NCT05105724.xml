  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients with POR who were aged &lt;40&#xD;
      years and underwent IVF/ICSI with assisted ovulation induction at our hospital were enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. After randomization using Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA),&#xD;
      these patients were divided into two groups. Group A was the experimental group, wherein&#xD;
      ovarian injections of PRP were administered to the patients, and group B was the control&#xD;
      group, wherein no ovarian puncture or injection was used in the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor ovarian response (POR) is a pathological state, wherein the ovaries are insensitive to&#xD;
      exogenous gonadotropin (Gn) stimulation; it is often noted older populations with ovarian&#xD;
      hypofunction. POR mainly manifests as the development of only few follicles during ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation cycles, low peak levels of blood estrogen on human chorionic Gn (HCG) trigger&#xD;
      day, high dosage of exogenous Gn, high rates of cycle cancellation, low number of oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved, and low rates of clinical pregnancy. The incidence of POR during ovulation&#xD;
      induction in assisted reproduction is reported to be approximately 9%-24%. With the&#xD;
      increasing age of individuals at marriage and childbearing as well as the reform of the&#xD;
      national family planning policy, an increasing number of women of advanced maternal age have&#xD;
      resorted to assisted reproductive technology for fertility, resulting in an increased&#xD;
      proportion of patients with POR in China. Repeated in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles and adverse pregnancy outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with POR have undoubtedly resulted in great financial burden and psychological pressure on&#xD;
      infertile couples. Therefore, the individualized selection of an appropriate ovulation&#xD;
      induction protocol has become a key factor in terms of improving ovarian responsiveness,&#xD;
      which can in turn improve ovarian sensitivity to ovulation drugs and increase oocyte quantity&#xD;
      and quality when the patient is supplemented with pre-treatment prior to ovulation induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraperitoneal injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the ovaries of&#xD;
      mice of the cyclophosphamide-induced premature ovarian failure model resulted in an increase&#xD;
      in ovarian cortical volume, preantral follicle number, and antral follicle and their&#xD;
      corresponding oocyte diameters. This finding suggests that PRP has a positive effect on the&#xD;
      tissue repair of damaged ovaries and that it stimulates the growth of various follicles after&#xD;
      ovarian damage in animals, is involved in oogenesis, induces an increase in the number of&#xD;
      follicles and granulosa cells, and stimulates estrogen secretion. The addition of PRP to&#xD;
      in-vitro three-dimensional cultures of follicles increases the viability and growth of human&#xD;
      primordial and preantral follicles and produced more beneficial growth factors. The Pantos&#xD;
      team pioneered the administration of intra-ovarian injections of PRP to four infertile&#xD;
      patients of advanced maternal age with ovarian hypofunction. These patients' ovarian reserves&#xD;
      improved, as evidenced by their elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, decreased&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and/or increased total antral follicular counts.&#xD;
      Then, the patients received IVF treatment, each patient receiving at least one blastocyst for&#xD;
      cryopreservation. A recent clinical study used PRP in 19 patients with POR. Two of these&#xD;
      patients had spontaneous pregnancies and one had a successful clinical pregnancy. Taken&#xD;
      together, this evidence suggests the promising use of PRP in ovarian tissue and the potential&#xD;
      of PRP as a novel effective treatment option for patients with POR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the current situation of POR treatment, the investigators proposed a clinical&#xD;
      research project of ovarian injection of autologous PRP for the treatment of POR. The PRP&#xD;
      used clinically has been evaluated in well-developed preclinical safety studies and necessary&#xD;
      quality control without any ethical controversy. Moreover, PRP does not pose a medical risk&#xD;
      and has high safety levels in the treatment of diseases. The goal of our project was to aid&#xD;
      in the development of new methods of POR treatment that can meet the urgent fertility needs&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
