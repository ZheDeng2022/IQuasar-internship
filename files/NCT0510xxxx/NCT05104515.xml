  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OVM-200 will be tested in humans for the first time in Study OVM-200-100. Up to 52 patients&#xD;
      aged 18-75 with prostate, lung or ovarian cancer will be enrolled in the Study to find out if&#xD;
      OVM-200 is safe to continue studying it in patients with cancer. The Study consists of 2&#xD;
      parts: a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, up to 4&#xD;
      increasing doses of OVM-200 will be evaluated in small groups of cancer patients to find the&#xD;
      recommended dose for the expansion part. The recommended dose of OVM-200 will then be given&#xD;
      to cancer patients in the dose expansion part to confirm safety and understand how effective&#xD;
      it is against their disease and if there are any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the Study and pass screening will receive 3 doses of&#xD;
      OVM-200 in total at 2-week intervals as an injection under the skin. After completing&#xD;
      treatment with OVM-200 patients will be followed up for side effects and to monitor changes&#xD;
      in their cancer. Patients will stay on the Study for about 6 months in total during which&#xD;
      they will have 10 hospital visits. The Study will run at around 5 sites in the UK.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  1. Histologically confirmed metastatic or locally advanced inoperable NSCLC, ovarian&#xD;
             cancer, or prostate cancer that have already received at least 1 line of approved&#xD;
             cancer therapy and either: exhausted current recognized treatment options; or are&#xD;
             stable in a planned treatment-free interval following completion of a set course of&#xD;
             treatment; or in the case of prostate cancer, are currently stable on an antihormonal&#xD;

             cancer treatment options until the Week 8 assessment (up to 9 weeks) after the first&#xD;
             dose of OVM-200 per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. At least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline by&#xD;
             computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is suitable for repeated&#xD;
             assessment (NSCLC only).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 75 years. 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Known history or evidence of significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness.&#xD;
             Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisolone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of the first dose of study drug. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal&#xD;
             replacement steroids are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a history of or active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease or a&#xD;
             syndrome that requires systemic or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo,&#xD;
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune disease only&#xD;
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted&#xD;
             to enrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior therapy with an anticancer vaccine; anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2,&#xD;
             anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody; or any other antibody or drug specifically&#xD;
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways in the 28 days before&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Administration of an investigational drug in the 28 days or 6 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Major surgery or treatment with any chemotherapy, or radiation therapy for cancer in&#xD;
             the 28 days before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active infection requiring antibiotics or physician monitoring, or recurrent fevers (&gt;&#xD;
             38.0°C) associated with a clinical diagnosis of active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active viral disease, positive test for hepatitis B virus using hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen test, or positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             or HCV antibody test indicating acute or chronic infection. Positive test for human&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Other prior malignancy within the previous 3 years, except for local or organ-confined&#xD;
             early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent and does&#xD;
             not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of residual disease, and has a&#xD;
             negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary&#xD;
             and secondary endpoints of the study, including response rate and safety and&#xD;
             tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Symptomatic brain metastases or any leptomeningeal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder (including cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
             renal, or autoimmune disease) that, in the opinion of the investigator or the medical&#xD;
             monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to any component of the OVM-200&#xD;
             therapeutic vaccine or adjuvant.&#xD;
