      This study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of SHR-1701 combined with&#xD;
      temozolomide in the treatment of advanced melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical research. Based on current&#xD;
      experience, single agent immunotherapy has limited efficacy in advanced melanoma. SHR-1701 is&#xD;
      a novel immunotherapy drug . Preclinical data suggest that temozolomide selectively depletes&#xD;
      regulatory T cells. This potential immunomodulatory effect of temozolomide provides rationale&#xD;
      for combination with SHR-1701. This study is aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      SHR-1701 combined with temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma. The safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of this study will be assessed through ORR, DCR,PFS, OS , and adverse effects as&#xD;
      graded by CTCAE 5.0.&#xD;
