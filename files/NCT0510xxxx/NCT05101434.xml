  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis and gingivitis are one of the most infectious diseases in humans. Several&#xD;
      studies have been carried out on the dependence of periodontitis and stroke. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to investigate gingivitis and periodontitis as risk factors for stroke in the&#xD;
      Pakistani population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic studies have shown that cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the 3rd cause of&#xD;
      death in developed countries with 0.8 % prevalence in the whole population. Although, the&#xD;
      prevalence rate of stroke is reduced yet is one of the most important health problems in the&#xD;
      United State. Periodontitis and gingivitis are the two most infectious man diseases. Today,&#xD;
      it is estimated that about 35% of people over 30-year-old in America and 50-55% of people in&#xD;
      developing countries are involved with these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These diseases are due to the practice of chronic bacterial infection and the inflammatory&#xD;
      response of the host. The relationship between periodontitis and CVA was first introduced by&#xD;
      Mackenzi and Millard in 1963 but the importance of this issue was not understood. Periodontal&#xD;
      infection can be a complex multiphase disease by associating this infection with organ&#xD;
      systems such as cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, and respiratory systems. Nowadays,&#xD;
      periodontitis is considered a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
