      Compare key clinical outcomes between controls and men treated with a novel CCH&#xD;
      administration protocol among men previously unresponsive to CCH administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning approximately 3 years ago, the investigators' team sought to achieve further&#xD;
      improvements with CCH through the addition of more aggressive modeling therapies. Results&#xD;
      from a comparison of CCH alone vs CCH and traction with RestoreX demonstrated a mean 33.8&#xD;
      degree (49%) curvature improvement with combined therapy compared to 19-20 degrees (30-31%)&#xD;
      with CCH alone or CCH and other traction devices). These results currently represent the&#xD;
      greatest improvements with CCH in published literature and further build upon phase IIb&#xD;
      results which demonstrated that mechanical traction (via manual modeling in the phase IIb&#xD;
      trial) represents a critical factor in achieving improvements with CCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' team additionally published a survey of men who had experienced suspected&#xD;
      penile fractures with CCH and demonstrated greater curvature improvements without any loss /&#xD;
      worsening of erectile function. This critical study highlighted that conservative management&#xD;
      of suspected fractures should not only be considered a standard of care in managing suspected&#xD;
      fractures, but also that these men achieved better final outcomes (again highlighting the&#xD;
      importance of the combination of mechanical curvature correction in addition to CCH&#xD;
      management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above findings, the investigators' team began performing a more aggressive&#xD;
      manual modeling protocol. This novel protocol included several notable innovations: dilution&#xD;
      of the 0.9 mg of CCH in 0.7 ml of diluent, injection to the erect penis to assure accurate&#xD;
      injection, repeat curvature assessments with each series (due to changing of the point of&#xD;
      maximal curvature), incorporation of RestoreX traction therapy post injection, and&#xD;
      'aggressive' manual modeling (equivalent of 10-15 lbs of force) to achieve curvature&#xD;
      correction. Preliminary (unpublished - abstract submitted to SMSNA 2021) results from these&#xD;
      men demonstrated a median ~60% curvature improvement. Importantly, several of the patients&#xD;
      had previously undergone 8 CCH injections with outside providers and were able to similarly&#xD;
      achieve a median 60% improvement with the investigators' injection / modeling protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary findings have several important ramifications for the treatment of PD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Men who have previously not achieved adequate curvature correction with 4 series of CCH&#xD;
           injections may benefit from additional injections using a more aggressive traction&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A more aggressive traction protocol would benefit patients to achieve greater outcomes&#xD;
           than with previously reported protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Investigational Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study would randomize men 1:3 into one of two treatment cohorts: 1. Observation&#xD;
      followed by CCH or 2. CCH followed by observation. This study design offers the benefits of a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial (highest level of evidence). RCTs are particularly important in&#xD;
      PD, where the disease changes over time in a percentage of men as a function of its natural&#xD;
      history. This would also allow blinding of measurements using photographs (single-blinded&#xD;
      assessments), which provides further study rigor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No treatment (control) followed by CCH. Men in this cohort would undergo baseline&#xD;
           assessments followed by no treatment for 6 months and then repeat assessments. Men would&#xD;
           then cross-over to CCH treatment and undergo up to 8 injections (or until curvature is&#xD;
           &lt;15 degrees). Interval assessments would be performed with the 1st injection of each&#xD;
           series, and final assessments would then be performed 6 weeks following the final&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CCH followed by no treatment. Men in this cohort would undergo baseline assessments&#xD;
           followed by up to 8 injections of CCH (or until curvature is &lt;15 degrees). Interval&#xD;
           assessments would be performed with the 1st injection of each series and 6 weeks&#xD;
           following completion of treatment. Men then would not undergo any additional treatments&#xD;
           for 6 months, after which final assessments would then performed.&#xD;

Control. Men in this cohort would undergo baseline assessments followed by no treatment for 6 months and then repeat assessments. Men would then cross-over to the CCH treatment phase and undergo up to 8 injections (or until curvature is &lt;15 degrees, whichever comes first). Final assessments would then be performed 6 weeks following the final injection.&#xD;

Assessments would then be performed 6 weeks after completion of treatment.
