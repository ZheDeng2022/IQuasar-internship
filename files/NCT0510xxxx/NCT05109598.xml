      Popular topic: A clinical trial comparing the immunogenicity of recombinant New Coronavirus&#xD;
      vaccine (CHO cells) among people aged 3 to 17 and 18 to 59 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:Non inferiority test design was used to evaluate the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccine inoculated to the age group of 3~17 and the age of 18~59. The non inferiority&#xD;
      hypothesis test was conducted with the results of immunogenicity of the 18-59 year old group&#xD;
      in China in the phase III clinical trial of our recombinant New Coronavirus vaccine (CHO&#xD;
      cell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:400 healthy people aged 3 to 17 years old, both male and female.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population:A total of 400 healthy people aged 3 ~ 17 were enrolled (including 130 cases&#xD;
      aged 3 ~ 5, 150 cases aged 6 ~ 11, and 120 cases aged 12 ~ 17)，both male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:Non inferiority test design was used to evaluate the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccine inoculated to the age group of 3~17 and the age of 18~59. The non inferiority&#xD;
      hypothesis test was conducted with the results of immunogenicity of the 18-59 year old group&#xD;
      in China in the phase III clinical trial of our recombinant New Coronavirus vaccine (CHO&#xD;
      cell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization program: Three doses were inoculated in 0, 1 and 2 months. Dose:25μg/0.5mL/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AE and SAE:Collect all adverse events (AES) 30 minutes after each dose of vaccination,&#xD;
           all AES 0-7 days (including solicited and non solicited AES), all AES 8-30 days (non&#xD;
           solicited AES), and all SAE from the first dose of vaccination to 12 months after the&#xD;
           whole course of immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital signs and physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects underwent axillary temperature examination every day during the screening&#xD;
           period, before the next dose of vaccination and within 7 days after each dose of&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects underwent physical examination (skin and cardiopulmonary auscultation)&#xD;
           during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy events:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For women of childbearing age, urine pregnancy test should be carried out before each&#xD;
           dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pregnancy events occurred within 12 months from the first dose of vaccine to the&#xD;
           whole course of immunization were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ADE / VED risk monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vaccination (at least one dose of test vaccine) (at each visit), remind the subjects to&#xD;
      contact the investigator in time for fever and / or respiratory symptoms (such as dyspnea,&#xD;
      sore throat, etc.) and covid-19 suspected or confirmed cases during the study. If the subject&#xD;
      is suspected or confirmed to be infected with sars-cov-2 during the test, he must go to the&#xD;
      local Xinguan designated hospital for hospitalization diagnosis and treatment. Detailed case&#xD;
      investigation shall be conducted for confirmed cases. In case of severe or dead cases of new&#xD;
      crown infection, an expert meeting shall be held to conduct special investigation and&#xD;
      evaluate whether it is ADE/ VED.&#xD;
