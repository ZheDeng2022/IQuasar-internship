  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is a progressive condition which affects the nervous system causing&#xD;
      tremors, slowed movement and often causes problems with memory and initiation. Treatment&#xD;
      management can be complex and challenging for patients and families. Poor memory in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease has been shown to reduce a person's ability to manage activities of daily&#xD;
      living, including tasks associated with treatment such a taking medications. However,&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's have been shown to benefit from external reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research project is to investigate whether the use of a reminder app that has&#xD;
      been designed for use by people with cognitive difficulties improves completion of activities&#xD;
      related to therapy goals in people with Parkinson's Disease, aiding self-management of their&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen in movement disorder clinics in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease, and a partner or carer who can monitor progress, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate. Measures of memory, emotional wellbeing and quality of life will be completed to&#xD;
      characterise each participant. Participants will have a randomly allocated initial baseline&#xD;
      period of either 10, 16 or 22 days in which their rate of completion of intended activities&#xD;
      will be monitored. Then, during the intervention period of 3 weeks (21 days) the ApplTree app&#xD;
      will be introduced to remind participants of treatment goals. Participants will create&#xD;
      specific and personalised treatment goals at the beginning of the monitoring period. Goals&#xD;
      will be everyday activities relevant to the management and treatment of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      The number of goals is not limited and will depend on how frequent targeted behaviours are.&#xD;
      However, at least one target behaviour a day in total will be recommended. E.g. Completing&#xD;
      daily exercises. Partners will monitor their goal attainment, via a daily/weekly monitoring&#xD;
      form in both phases of the study.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate whether the use of a recently developed reminder&#xD;
      app ApplTree improves attainment of personalised specific treatment goals in people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that introduction of the reminder app will significantly&#xD;
      improve attainment of treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single case experimental design (SCED) will be utilised with multiple baselines across&#xD;
      participants with randomisation of the onset of the intervention phase for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a clinical diagnosis of PD. Further, the Parkinson's care team or the&#xD;
      individual will have expressed concerns about adherence or attainment of treatment goals. Due&#xD;
      to the design of the study, participants will be required to own a smart phone and have a&#xD;
      partner or significant other who is able to, and consents to, monitor and support the&#xD;
      participant's goal attainment as the nominated person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD patients will be recruited via the movement disorder teams and movement disorder neurology&#xD;
      clinics in Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Trust (GGC) via their Parkinson's consultant, named&#xD;
      Parkinson's nurse specialist, occupational therapist, or physiotherapist within the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre intervention measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures are validated for PD and recommended by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cognitive screen will be completed with all participants, the Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
           Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire. A proxy-rating version will also be&#xD;
           utilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ). A proxy-rating version of the&#xD;
           PRMQ will also be utilised to alleviate limitations of self-report measures and build a&#xD;
           broader picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apathy Scale (AS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, no measure of anxiety is recommended by the MDS, therefore, the Generalised&#xD;
           Anxiety Disorder severity index (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)&#xD;
           will be used to assess emotional wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weekly/daily monitoring form will be used by the partner during all phases of the&#xD;
      intervention to record completion of intended goal related tasks (e.g., taking medication on&#xD;
      time, completing prescribed exercises, nutritional snack, attending support group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in batches of three participants, with replication of the design across&#xD;
      the second set of three. The data collection phase for each participant will vary based on&#xD;
      completing at least 5 data points within both the baseline and intervention phase and will&#xD;
      range from 31-43 days for each participant. It is hoped that the timeframes for goals will&#xD;
      require at least one reminder activity per day and so a two-day period will represent one&#xD;
      datapoint. Participants will be assigned to a baseline period of 10, 16 or 22 days and an&#xD;
      intervention period of 21 days (3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Members of the movement disorder teams in GGC will be asked to review caseloads for&#xD;
           suitable participants, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will have&#xD;
           a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, have a consenting partner or carer, have use of a&#xD;
           mobile phone and have difficulty adhering to treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential participants and their carers/partners (nominated person) will be sent out the&#xD;
           participant information sheet by post or be given them by a member of their clinical&#xD;
           team during a clinic appointment. Potential participants will be able to indicate their&#xD;
           willingness to discuss participation in the research with the researcher by returning a&#xD;
           consent to be contacted form by pre-post to the researcher directly or by emailing the&#xD;
           researcher informing them of their agreement for contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alternatively in cases where participant information is given in the appointment,&#xD;
           participants can inform the clinical team member at their clinic appointment of their&#xD;
           agreement for contact. In this instance staff will then send contact details of&#xD;
           potential participants who have agreed for contact along to the researcher, via NHS&#xD;
           secure email.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants and nominated persons who consent to contact will be given a phone call to&#xD;
           discuss the study in more detail and have the opportunity to ask any questions and, if&#xD;
           ready, make a decision on whether they would like to participate and if undecided will&#xD;
           be given a follow up call in 2 -5 days (depending on when is convenient for them).&#xD;
           Inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be reviewed at this point to ensure&#xD;
           eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eligible participants and nominated persons will then meet with the researcher initially&#xD;
           to complete written consent form and pre intervention measures. This meeting will be&#xD;
           either face-to-face in an NHS building, face-to-face in their own home or via video&#xD;
           call, depending on participant preferences and travel limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants and nominated persons will then meet with the researcher a second time&#xD;
           (Face-to-face or Video call) to discuss and formulate specific and personalised&#xD;
           treatment/therapy goals. Discussion of goals will be informed by pre-intervention&#xD;
           measures, partners and participants own views. Goals will be relevant to the management&#xD;
           and treatment of Parkinson's Disease and have a memory and motivational component such&#xD;
           as reminders for medication regime or physical exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A weekly monitoring form will then be given to participants' nominated person to record&#xD;
           completion of intended goal related tasks (e.g., taking medication on time, completing&#xD;
           prescribed exercises, nutritional snack, attending support group) and the baseline phase&#xD;
           will begin for a duration of 10, 16 or 22 days the following day. The duration of the&#xD;
           baseline phase will be randomly assigned using an online random number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The nominated person will receive a weekly reminder call to ensure the weekly monitoring&#xD;
           form is being completed and to troubleshoot any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The nominated person will receive a reminder text on a daily basis to ensure the form is&#xD;
           being completed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At the end of the baseline phase, participants and partners will meet with the&#xD;
           researcher (Face to face or video call) to receive a training session on using the app&#xD;
           and to input reminders for specific goal related actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Participants will then start an intervention phase of 22 days and partners will continue&#xD;
           to use the monitoring form provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Participants will receive a weekly phone call to troubleshoot any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The nominated person will receive a reminder text on a daily basis to ensure the&#xD;
           monitoring form is completed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. At the end of the intervention stage participants and nominated persons will meet with&#xD;
           the researcher a final time for a debrief (face-to-face or video call).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meetings with participants will be in an agreed NHS building, remote video call via attend&#xD;
      anywhere, or in some cases in the participants own home. Due to the nature of health&#xD;
      conditions and travel limitations within the population, the preferences of the participant&#xD;
      and their nominated person will be given priority for arranging meetings. Current Scottish&#xD;
      government/NHS GG&amp;C guidance surrounding COVID-19 will also be taken into account. Telephone&#xD;
      calls and video calls will be completed by the researcher from an NHS premises, to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality of data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ApplTree is a reminding app designed to be used by people with cognitive impairments as a&#xD;
      result of acquired brain injury. ApplTree has a narrow/deep user interface design which&#xD;
      presents a small amount of information at a time to minimise the burden on people with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. Each participant will download the ApplTree app onto their own smart&#xD;
      device. The app is free to use and maintained by Glasgow University Software Services (GUSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of goal related tasks carried out&#xD;
      independently (i.e., without prompting from another person) per two-day period. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is measured via the daily monitoring form, completed by participant's nominated&#xD;
      person. In line with recommendations for analysis of SCED data, the data will be analysed&#xD;
      through visual analysis of graphs and Tau-U analysis to determine whether a significant&#xD;
      improvement is found between baseline and intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Risk of Bias in N of 1 Trials (RoBiNT) recommends that SCED designs provide at least&#xD;
      three demonstrations of the treatment effect. In a multiple baseline across participants&#xD;
      design this means a minimum of three participants. Additionally, the RoBiNT highlights the&#xD;
      importance of replication, referring to replication of the overall study, meaning replication&#xD;
      of the set of three participants. Hence, the present study will aim to recruit a minimum of&#xD;
      six participants, and to allow for possible withdrawals the aim will be to recruit nine&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
