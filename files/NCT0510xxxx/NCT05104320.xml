  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will address essential questions of the efficacy and safety of MICS-CABG in&#xD;
      addition to the quality of life and patency rate of the grafts. The study will also address&#xD;
      the impact of patients' preferences on external validity and internal validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with a preference will be allocated to treatment strategies&#xD;
      accordingly, whereas only those patients without a distinct preference will be randomized.&#xD;
      The randomized trial is a 248-patient controlled, randomized, investigator-blinded trial. It&#xD;
      is designed to compare whether treatment with MICS-CABG is beneficial in comparison to CABG.&#xD;
      This study is aimed to establish the superiority hypothesis for the physical component&#xD;
      summary (PCS) accompanied by the noninferiority hypothesis for overall graft patency.&#xD;
      Patients with no treatment preference will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoints are the PCS score at 30 days after surgery and the overall&#xD;
      patency rate of the grafts within 14 days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      the PCS score and patency rate at different time points. Safety endpoints include major&#xD;
      adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, complications, bleeding, wound infection, death,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;

The PCS and mental component summary (MCS) can be calculated from the eight abovementioned indicators with different weights.
