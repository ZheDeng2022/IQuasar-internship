      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of genomic and epigenetic analysis of&#xD;
      rectal mucus to detect non-colorectal cancers of the aero- digestive tract using samples&#xD;
      collected by the OriCol™ Sampling Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether significant changes in DNA mutation&#xD;
      and methylation associated with Non-colorectal cancers of the Aero- digestive Tract (NCRCADT)&#xD;
      can be detected in rectal mucus as shed cells and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) pass through the gut&#xD;
      and theoretically can be collected from rectal mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will assess the participant acceptability of the OriCol™ Sampling Device&#xD;
      for Upper GI and Lung Pathology as well as contributing to a genomic library collating&#xD;
      information about rectal mucus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The embryological development of the aero-digestive tract (ADT) is from a single primitive&#xD;
      layer, the endoderm. Differentiation of this layer leads to epithelial and mucosal&#xD;
      histopathological similarities through a continuous connected lumen extending from the upper&#xD;
      third of the oesophagus to the anorectal junction and including the organs of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract (liver, pancreas, gallbladder) and the respiratory tract (trachea,&#xD;
      bronchi and lung).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancers of the aero-digestive tract include; non-small cell lung (NSCLC), distal oesophageal,&#xD;
      gastric, pancreatic, biliary, small bowel and colorectal cancer. The predominant type of&#xD;
      cancer is an adenocarcinoma arising in the glandular cells lining the viscera. These cells&#xD;
      have the capacity to secrete mucus and form the inner lining of the lumen All of these&#xD;
      cancers directly or indirectly sheds cells into the gastrointestinal tract. The&#xD;
      gastrointestinal epithelium regenerates every 5-7 days, the discarded cellular material&#xD;
      migrates distally and is excreted as part of faeces. The majority of lung secretions are&#xD;
      swallowed creating an interaction with the intestine which, to date, has primarily been&#xD;
      studied from the microbiota perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the strain on traditional diagnostic pathways, with a&#xD;
      drop by 90% of the normal endoscopy workload in the first wave of the pandemic emphasising&#xD;
      the need for practical investigations that can be used as a triage tool in primary care to&#xD;
      discriminate individuals that do not require more invasive diagnostic tests. Rectal mucus&#xD;
      sampling is potentially an appealing screening tool; quick, minimally invasive, cost&#xD;
      effective, can be serially repeated for potential prognostic value, requires minimal&#xD;
      equipment or training, and produces robust DNA material for extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has demonstrated that stable, good quantity and quality cfDNA from colorectal&#xD;
      cancer can be detected by rectal mucus sampling and clinical trials of the technique in&#xD;
      symptomatic participants are underway looking at the use of rectal mucus for detection of&#xD;
      colonic cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT identifier: NCT04659590). This unpublished, research&#xD;
      has created a genomic profile of colorectal cancer in the rectal mucus using Next Generation&#xD;
      Sequencing (NGS) detection of genetic mutations and alterations in methylation, which&#xD;
      correlates with the documented genetic mutations associated with colorectal cancer tumour&#xD;
      biopsies. Due to the embryological similarities KRAS and p53 are also found in association&#xD;
      with other cancers of the GI tract. Discovered in 1983, methylation is a growing field in&#xD;
      epigenetics, it is faster and more cost- effective than genetic mutation detection and&#xD;
      promises increased sensitivity and specificity. The literature suggests a strong link between&#xD;
      methylation changes and tumuorigenesis in cancers of the aero-digestive tract, which solely,&#xD;
      or in conjunction with cf-DNA mutation detection, could play a significant role in early&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to provide a novel insight into rectal mucus. The literature unanimously&#xD;
      agrees that further research and standardisation of biomarkers and sampling is required. With&#xD;
      novel genomic and epigenetic understanding of diagnostic and therapeutic targets a future of&#xD;
      personalised oncological care is anticipated.&#xD;
