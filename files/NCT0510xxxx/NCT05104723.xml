  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 open-label trial to study the safety and to explore the biological&#xD;
      efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with confirmed and symptomatic inflammatory complications&#xD;
      (gastrointestinal [GI], skin, lung) related to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). After a&#xD;
      3-month regimen of tofacitinib, participants inflammatory complications will be objectively&#xD;
      assessed. Samples collected before, during, and after therapy will be evaluated for&#xD;
      pathologic, molecular, and cellular changes in response to therapy, thereby refining our&#xD;
      knowledge of the mechanisms driving inflammatory complications in CGD patients while&#xD;
      evaluating the safety of this novel therapy. Inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) pathways is a&#xD;
      novel therapeutic intervention for CGD patients with inflammatory complications that are not&#xD;
      responsive to standard therapies. Preliminary data highlight the potential role of increased&#xD;
      activation of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of CGD. These data, paired with the success in treating other monogenic immune&#xD;
      disorders characterized by JAK/STAT pathway activation (ie, STAT1 gain-of-function,&#xD;
      STING-associated vasculopathy of infancy) with JAK inhibitors (JAKIs), suggest that JAKIs are&#xD;
      a reasonable candidate therapy for the difficult-to-treat inflammatory manifestations of CGD.&#xD;
      Tofacitinib, a first generation JAKI, is an attractive candidate for this purpose given the&#xD;
      following: 1) it is FDA-approved for treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, 2)&#xD;
      CGD colitis shares many clinical and pathologic features of inflammatory bowel disease, and&#xD;
      3) the GI, pulmonary, and skin inflammatory complications of CGD respond poorly to standard&#xD;
      therapies and cause significant morbidity. Patients taking tofacitinib are at increased risk&#xD;
      for developing serious infections, so participants will maintain their current antifungal and&#xD;
      antibacterial medications, and will start a shingles prophylaxis regimen. Major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) events, such as heart attack, stroke, blot clots, cancer, and death have&#xD;
      also been reported in patients with preexisting CV risk factors. Patients with CV risk&#xD;
      factors or a history of major adverse CV events will be excluded from the study, and&#xD;
      participants will be closely monitored for signs and symptoms. The hypothesis of this study&#xD;
      is that CGD patients with poorly controlled GI, skin, and pulmonary inflammatory&#xD;
      manifestations can be safely treated with tofacitinib and will experience improvement in&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, pathological findings, and molecular and cellular biomarkers.&#xD;

             reactogenicity, or a participant s ability to give informed consent, or increase the&#xD;
