    <textblock>
      This study examines the immediate and long-term effects of lumbosacral TENS on spasticity and&#xD;
      residual voluntary force control in spinal cord injury in comparison to no TENS. Participants&#xD;
      in the intervention group will receive 2 months of TENS. Participants in the control group&#xD;
      will receive TENS after a 2-month delay. Modified Ashworth score and pendulum test will be&#xD;
      used to assess spasticity and force control. Electrophysiological measures will be used to&#xD;
      assess the activity profile of motorneurons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been used to control pain in stroke,&#xD;
      MS, cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury (SCI) and its effect on spasticity reduction,&#xD;
      although not used clinically, has been examined recently. In the few SCI studies done to&#xD;
      date, the TENS electrodes have been placed on the nerve to the muscle under study and initial&#xD;
      reports show a consistent decrease in spasticity measures, like the Modified Ashworth Score&#xD;
      (MAS) and reflexes, during or hours after the TENS application. Recently, study team members&#xD;
      from the ReYu Recovery Centre in Edmonton have observed that when TENS is applied with both&#xD;
      electrodes over the lower back (lumbosacral TENS), varying amounts of immediate and long-term&#xD;
      spasticity relief are produced in both legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have observed 3 clients from ReYU and all have shown immediate reductions&#xD;
      in spasticity for at least 2 joints in both legs. The effect of the lumbosacral TENS varied&#xD;
      from an immediate dramatic reduction to a more moderate reduction when applied over several&#xD;
      days. This study will examine the immediate and longer-term (2 months) effect of using spinal&#xD;
      TENS in reducing spasticity of the lower limbs in a larger number of participants with SCI.&#xD;
      The investigators want to understand how spinal TENS affects spinal circuits and motoneurons&#xD;
      below the lesion to reduce spasticity to observe improvement in its effect in those with more&#xD;
      moderate responses. Lumbosacral TENS has the potential for a non-pharmacological, on-demand&#xD;
      control of SCI spasticity to greatly improve the quality of life of those affected.&#xD;
