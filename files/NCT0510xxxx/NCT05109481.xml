      What impact can facial masks have on face exploration in the first few weeks of life? No&#xD;
      study has yet investigated this. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of the&#xD;
      mask on the face processing (preferential gaze, visual recognition) of the term infant for&#xD;
      familiar (e.g. mother's face) and unfamiliar (stranger's face) faces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study which will take place in Grenoble Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 newborns will be enrolled between 24 hours and 7 days of life during one year. Different&#xD;
      pairs of images will be presented on a screen while an experimenter records the infant's&#xD;
      gaze. On each trial, the experimenter will judge when the infant is looking at the screen or&#xD;
      not and assess when 10 seconds of screen gaze time has been accumulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparisons will be made to determine whether statistically, one face is looked at&#xD;
      significantly longer than another.&#xD;

      Background Since March 2020, the mask has invaded the everyday life of families, workplaces&#xD;
      and hospitals. In contrast to the pre-Covid era, healthy newborns in their first days of life&#xD;
      are now exposed to the faces of adults wearing masks. Yet early visual experience of newborns&#xD;
      with faces is crucial, as it will set the stage for early communication .For example, a&#xD;
      systematic preference for human faces exists in newborns .However, this system is not limited&#xD;
      to a preferential orientation; it has been shown that the newborn recognises faces during the&#xD;
      first week of life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal recognition is particularly important for the development of attachment and&#xD;
      emotional interactions. Several studies have shown that 2-3 day old infants recognize their&#xD;
      mother's face (real, in vivo) despite relatively limited visual acuity .However, no study has&#xD;
      been able to show the same on the basis of photographs (without other sensory stimuli), such&#xD;
      as the mother's smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The aim of this study is to measure the impact that these masks can have on the&#xD;
      exploration of known (mother) and unknown faces in the first weeks of life. No study has so&#xD;
      far investigated this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study This is a prospective, single-centre study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The newborns included will be newborns between 24 hours and 7 days of life before&#xD;
      discharge from the maternity hospital, born at term (37 weeks of gestational age) at the&#xD;
      Grenoble University Hospital, whose parents speak French, are beneficiaries of social&#xD;
      security, and did not object to participating in the study. Newborns with a pathology&#xD;
      requiring or having required examinations, hospitalisation or other during the first 24&#xD;
      hours, which could have impacted on the exposure of the newborn to the mask or parents&#xD;
      suffering from Covid during the maternity stay will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol For a newborn, each test will take place between 24 hours and discharge from the&#xD;
      maternity hospital (generally &lt;7 days) for a newborn. Concerning the test: the newborns are&#xD;
      installed on the mother's, facing the computer screen above which is positioned the&#xD;
      experimenter in charge of recording the infants' gaze. The screen is positioned 30 cm from&#xD;
      the newborns' face, a distance appropriate to their poor visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to carry out visual preference tests. This involves pairs of&#xD;
      images presented on the screen while an experimenter records the infant's gaze. On each&#xD;
      trial, the experimenter will judge when the infant is looking at the screen or not and assess&#xD;
      when 10 seconds of screen time has been accumulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, a newborn should be able to do a series of trials, but as their attention fluctuates&#xD;
      according to the time of day and from one individual to another, it is possible that some&#xD;
      children may only do one trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A minimum of 30 participants per test will be required. As not all&#xD;
      infants tested can be included in our study, because they are likely to fall asleep, become&#xD;
      restless or exhibit maladaptive behaviour (approximately 30%), the invetigators will test 200&#xD;
      children for the 5 tests. The behavioural data consist of gaze times on stimuli during a&#xD;
      presentation period. The behavioural data consist of gaze times on stimuli during a&#xD;
      presentation period. These gaze times are obtained by manually scanning the videos.&#xD;
      Comparisons of the mean of the proportions of gaze times to each image will be made with&#xD;
      parametric tests (Student's t test, analysis of variance or mixed models if n = 30 in each&#xD;
      test) or non-parametric tests (Chi-2, if n &lt; 30 in each group) in order to determine whether&#xD;
      statistically, one face is gazed at significantly longer than another. Using Gpower software,&#xD;
      a moderate effect size was estimated for a sample of 20 newborns (estimated statistical power&#xD;
      of 0.8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Our hypothesis and clinical impression is that the mask has an impact on the&#xD;
      visual exploration of the neonate. The investigators expect that the effects will also be&#xD;
      modulated by the neonate's visual experience with the mask but also by the information&#xD;
      requested in the &quot;mask exposition&quot; questionnaire. Indeed, these characteristics may influence&#xD;
      the newborn's experience with masked and unmasked faces, as well as the quality of&#xD;
      mother-infant interactions.&#xD;
