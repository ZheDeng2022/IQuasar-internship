  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Direct extracorporeal removal of inflammatory mediators with various adsorbents has been&#xD;
      suggested as a novel treatment modality for COVID-19 patients. Study determined safety,&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of clinical use of a hemoperfusion (HP) with a novel styrene-&#xD;
      divinylbenzene copolymer (SDC) adsorbers to remove pro-inflammatory molecules from the&#xD;
      bloodstream of COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a coronavirus is affected, the inflammatory process develops in a wide variety of organs&#xD;
      and, in combination with a lack of oxygen, can lead to multiple organ failure. Acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), seen in severe COVID-19, is characterized by shortness&#xD;
      of breath and low blood oxygen levels. As a result, some patients may develop secondary&#xD;
      bacterial and fungal infections. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure, which is the cause of&#xD;
      death in 70% of COVID-19 deaths. In addition, the powerful release of cytokines by the immune&#xD;
      system in response to viral infection and / or secondary infections can lead to symptoms of&#xD;
      sepsis, which is the cause of death in 28% of COVID-19 cases, due to uncontrolled&#xD;
      inflammation leading to multiple organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most SARS-CoV patients who develop kidney failure end up dying. There is still no definitive&#xD;
      answer to the question of why some COVID-19 patients are so severe - this may be partly due&#xD;
      to concomitant diseases, although according to preliminary data from different countries it&#xD;
      can be concluded that blocking the hyperactivation of immunity at the levels of IL-1 and IL-&#xD;
      6 may be effective in treating patients with severe coronavirus by suppressing or preventing&#xD;
      cytokine storms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently being treated COVID-19 is purely supportive. The main cause of death in seriously&#xD;
      ill patients is acute respiratory failure. A possible reason for the development of this&#xD;
      condition may be a cytokine storm, leading to acute decompensation of patients, which may be&#xD;
      a possible direction of therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main reasons for the high mortality rate of patients with the new coronavirus&#xD;
      infection COVID-19 is the lack of etiotropic therapy. In this regard, pathogenetic therapy,&#xD;
      aimed at key factors in the pathogenesis of emerging critical conditions, acquires great&#xD;
      importance for saving the lives of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various pathogenetic treatment options are currently being discussed for the treatment of&#xD;
      COVID-19, including selective inhibitors of various interleukins and extracorporeal cytokine&#xD;
      elimination. So far, there is no convincing evidence of the effectiveness of the use of&#xD;
      COVID-19 for any of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, according to many researchers, taking into account the peculiarities of&#xD;
      pathogenesis, an important place in the pathogenetic treatment of patients with severe course&#xD;
      of coronavirus infection should be occupied by methods of extracorporeal hemocorrection. They&#xD;
      have complex multiple effects and can quickly normalize the level of cytokines and other&#xD;
      factors of pathogenesis and thereby prevent or reduce the severity of organ disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When planning this clinical trial, it was suggested that hemosorption of cytokines could&#xD;
      improve outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients with suspected cytokine storms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemosorption device Efferon CT provides a decrease in high concentrations of endogenous&#xD;
      mediators of the systemic inflammatory response, incl. cytokines leading to the development&#xD;
      of multiple organ failure and other pathophysiological disorders. The device for hemosorption&#xD;
      Efferon CT has a high adsorption capacity and biocompatibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efferon CT (Efferon JSC, Moscow, Russia) - a device for extracorporeal blood purification&#xD;
      using direct hemoperfusion. Detoxification is carried out by removing excess cytokines,&#xD;
      myoglobin, endogenous and exogenous toxic substances from the patient's blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efferon СT is a cylindrical polycarbonate body filled with spherical granules of a polymeric&#xD;
      cross-linked porous hemosorbent based on a hypercrosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer&#xD;
      and isotonic sodium chloride solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is manufactured according to TU 32.50.50-001-12264678-2018, passed the necessary&#xD;
      tests and is registered in Russia as a medical device RZN 2019/8886.&#xD;
