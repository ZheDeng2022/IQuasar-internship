  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Depression is a highly recurrent disorder, which often requires lifelong&#xD;
      treatment. Psychotherapy has an important role in the treatment of depression, both in the&#xD;
      treatment of the acute phase and in prevention of relapses. Mindfulness-based therapies have&#xD;
      become popular in the last decade. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an&#xD;
      established treatment for relapse prevention in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and there is&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of its efficacy in treating acute symptoms. Several studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the benefits of MBCT in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with a current Major Depressive Episode, as indicated by some meta-analyses showing&#xD;
      that MBCT is more effective than treatment as usual in decreasing depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      equivalent to active treatments. However, the results at follow-up were less conclusive, due&#xD;
      to the limited number of studies and moderate-to-large heterogeneity within the subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have examined the effects of MBCT on a larger spectrum of factors that&#xD;
      can affect the severity of depression. In patients with MDD, MBCT was more effective than&#xD;
      treatment as usual in decreasing rumination, worry, negative affect and dysfunctional&#xD;
      attitudes, increasing mindfulness skills and positive affect and improving sleep and quality&#xD;
      of life. However, data comparing the specific effect of MBCT with other active treatments&#xD;
      (for example Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, CBT) are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most trials exploring the efficacy of MBCT have been conducted with group MBCT, but there is&#xD;
      less evidence about the use of individual MBCT (I-MBCT). Individual MBCT may have some&#xD;
      advantages, compared with group therapy, such as better attendance and higher efficacy in&#xD;
      major depression, when compared with group therapy. Furthermore, the individual format can&#xD;
      often be better tailored to a specific patient, with a slower progression and a longer number&#xD;
      of sessions, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this pilot trial was to test the feasibility of a larger&#xD;
      randomized trial examining the changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms, rumination,&#xD;
      mindfulness, emotion regulation, behavioral activation and negative automatic thoughts during&#xD;
      I-MBCT and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Further objectives were: (a) replicating&#xD;
      studies evaluating the efficacy of I-MBCT to improve depression, in particularly in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with a major depressive disorder; (b) assessing the persistence of benefits of&#xD;
      I-MBCT after the end of treatment; (c) comparing the effects of I-MBCT with CBT, not only on&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, but also on factors which are specifically targeted by MBCT, such as&#xD;
      rumination and mindfulness; explore possible predictors of outcome of MBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We make the following hypotheses: a) a larger trial comparing I-MBCT with CBT&#xD;
      examining the changes of depressive and anxiety symptoms, rumination, mindfulness, emotion&#xD;
      regulation, behavioral activation and negative automatic thoughts is feasible, with&#xD;
      recruitment rates and drop-off rates consistent with those usually observed among&#xD;
      participants with current major depression; b) the levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      rumination, emotion dysregulation, and negative automatic thoughts will decrease during&#xD;
      I-MBCT, while the levels of mindfulness and behavioral activation will increase, with effect&#xD;
      sizes similar to those observed in CBT; c) the changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      rumination, emotion dysregulation, negative automatic thoughts, mindfulness and behavioral&#xD;
      activation will be maintained at follow-up; d) the changes in mindfulness and rumination&#xD;
      dimensions are expected to be larger during MBCT than CBT; these analyses will be&#xD;
      exploratory, given the state of knowledge; d) we will explore the role of predictors of&#xD;
      clinical variables, such as earlier age at onset of the mood disorder; longer and more severe&#xD;
      current episode; presence of current comorbidity with anxiety disorders, initial levels of&#xD;
      anxiety, behavioral activation, emotion dysregulation and of the history of severe childhood&#xD;
      maltreatment in predicting the outcome to MBCT and CBT.&#xD;

      The trial is a parallel, two-arm, randomised pilot trial (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Mood and Anxiety Program of the Royal Ottawa Mental&#xD;
      Health Centre, which is a specialized tertiary care centre, and from two psychiatrists&#xD;
      working in community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants will be referred to the study by the treating psychiatrist, then&#xD;
      screened in a telephone interview by the research coordinator; the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be finally assessed by a psychiatrist involved in the study and by the research coordinator.&#xD;
      The psychiatrist will administer the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV-TR&#xD;
      (First et al. 2002) and collect the information related to clinical variables: previous&#xD;
      hospitalizations, history of suicide attempts, comorbidity with a current anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      age at onset of the mood disorder, number of previous major depressive episodes, duration of&#xD;
      the current episode, severity of the current depressive episode, use of alcohol or street&#xD;
      drugs, family history of affective disorders, and number of chronic medical conditions. The&#xD;
      research coordinator will assess the severity of depression using the HAMD-17. If the&#xD;
      criteria of eligibility to the study were satisfied, participants will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed written consent. Individuals meeting study criteria will be randomly assigned by&#xD;
      computer-generated numbers to treatment with either I-MBCT or CBT (1:1). Participants&#xD;
      included in the trial will be followed by the referring clinician. Concurrent use of&#xD;
      psychotropics will be allowed. Concomitant treatment with any form of structured &quot;bona fide&quot;&#xD;
      psychotherapy is not permitted during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to I-MBCT receive 12 weekly 60- minute sessions of I-MBCT according&#xD;
      to the protocol of Segal et al. (2002), integrated with the &quot;theme, rationale, intention and&#xD;
      practice&quot; skills (TRIP) protocol (Woods et al. 2016, 2019). The original MBCT protocol,&#xD;
      created for eight group sessions lasting two hours, is adapted to twelve individual sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to CBT receive 12 weekly 60-minute individual sessions of standard&#xD;
      CBT strategies following Beck et al. (1979). Participants receive a copy of Greenberger and&#xD;
      Padesky's Mind over Mood (The Guilford Press, 1995) for use during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses The statistical analysis will be performed on the overall sample of patients&#xD;
      who will start the treatment. As this was a feasibility study, a formal sample size&#xD;
      calculation was not required. We applied the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; recommended by Julious (2005),&#xD;
      suggesting a minimum of 12 participants per treatment arm, which optimizes the gain in&#xD;
      precision around the mean. Pre-treatment demographic and clinical characteristics will be&#xD;
      compared between I-MBCT and CBT treatment using univariate analyses (t-test for continuous&#xD;
      variables and Fisher test for categorical variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the HAM-D. The changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      rumination, emotion dysregulation, and negative automatic thoughts during MBCT and at&#xD;
      follow-up will be tested through linear mixed-effects models (LMM, SPSS Mixed procedure).&#xD;
      Interaction between time and treatment will be use to compare the changes during MBCT and&#xD;
      CBT. Multiple regression analyses will be used to test the value of clinical variables in&#xD;
      predicting the changes in severity of depressive symptoms during psychotherapy, adjusting for&#xD;
      age, gender and baseline depressive severity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the strength of the changes in outcome variables (depressive and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, rumination, emotion dysregulation, and negative automatic thoughts) during I-MBCT&#xD;
      and CBT, within-group effect sizes of the change pre- and post-treatment using Cohen's delta&#xD;
      for repeated measures will be used.&#xD;
