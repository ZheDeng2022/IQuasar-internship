    <textblock>
      This study in adolescent participants with NF1 who have inoperable PN is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of a low fat meal on steady state selumetinib exposure; to assess the effect on GI&#xD;
      toxicity when selumetinib is dosed under fed and fasted conditions; and potentially, to&#xD;
      confirm an appropriate dosing recommendation of selumetinib with a low fat meal that&#xD;
      maintains efficacy with acceptable safety. These results may support labelling statements&#xD;
      with regard to posology and food.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selumetinib is approved by the FDA for the treatment of paediatric patients 2 years of age&#xD;
      and older with NF1 who have symptomatic, inoperable PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of selumetinib in the treatment of NF1 related inoperable PN in paediatric&#xD;
      participants was demonstrated in the SPRINT study in which selumetinib was taken at 25 mg/m2&#xD;
      bid under fasted conditions (fast for 2 hours before each dose and 1 hour after each dose).&#xD;
      Safety data from this study showed that selumetinib has a generally predictable and&#xD;
      manageable safety profile in this population. Gastrointestinal AEs were commonly reported but&#xD;
      were predominantly mild/moderate in severity, predictable, and generally did not affect the&#xD;
      ability of participants to remain on treatment. However, GI AEs in this paediatric study were&#xD;
      reported at a higher frequency than that reported in an analysis of selumetinib in adult&#xD;
      oncology participants. Dosing in a fed state is known to reduce GI toxicity for some oncology&#xD;
      drugs; such a dosing regimen has an added benefit of improving compliance and adherence to&#xD;
      dosing posology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food-effect studies conducted in healthy participants (Study D1532C00069) and adult&#xD;
      participants with cancer (Study D1532C00020) show that consumption of a high fat meal reduces&#xD;
      absorption of selumetinib: in healthy participants Cmax was reduced by 50% and AUC by 16%;&#xD;
      and in participants with cancer Cmax was reduced by 62% and AUC by 19%. A further study in&#xD;
      adult healthy participants (D1532C00089) found that a low fat, low calorie meal reduces the&#xD;
      rate of absorption (Cmax reduced by 65% and tmax delayed by 2.5 hours) and the extent of&#xD;
      absorption (AUC reduced by 38%) after a single dose of selumetinib. The finding that a low&#xD;
      fat meal had a greater impact on exposure than a high fat meal is unusual and without a clear&#xD;
      explanation although in vitro dissolution data suggest that the capsule shell disintegration&#xD;
      may be impacted by food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the steady state systemic exposure and safety (especially&#xD;
      GI toxicity) of selumetinib 25 mg/m2 bid given with a low fat meal versus the same dose given&#xD;
      in a fasted state. A third treatment period (T3) will be initiated if there is a significant&#xD;
      reduction in exposure (AUC0-12, SS between T2 vs T1) when selumetinib is given with a low fat&#xD;
      meal compared with a fasted state; T3 will evaluate the PK and safety of an adjusted dose of&#xD;
      selumetinib when given with a low fat meal. The recommendation as to whether to initiate T3,&#xD;
      and the dose to be used in T3, will be made by a DRC. This recommendation will be reviewed&#xD;
      with FDA before dosing in T3 is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 participants will be enrolled to achieve 16 evaluable participants&#xD;
      completing T2. An evaluable participant is defined as having received study treatment and&#xD;
      provided the last required PK sample in T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Review Committee(DRC) will review the PK and safety data from T1 and T2 and determine&#xD;
      whether T3 is required. If T3 is required the DRC will select the dose to be used. The&#xD;
      recommendation will be reviewed with FDA before dosing in T3 is initiated.&#xD;
