    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory finding) in study participants, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product (IMP).

    <measure>Percentage of participants with absence seizure freedom within 4 days prior to or during the 1-hour electroencephalogram (EEG) at each applicable visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Full Evaluation Visit (Month 6) up to the Final Visit (Month 24)</time_frame>
    <description>A 1-hour electroencephalogram (EEG) will be performed. The awake hours from the EEG will be analyzed for absence seizures. Every 1-hour EEG will include hyperventilation as a standard provocation test at the beginning of the EEG. Patient will be regarded as not meeting the criteria for absence seizure freedom if they received any permitted antiepileptic drugs including benzodiazepine in the 4 days prior to the EEG or during the EEG.</description>

    <description>During the study, subjects will keep a diary to record daily seizure activity from Visit 1 until the final visit. Each seizure type experienced will be recorded. The participant will be considered as not meeting the criteria for absence seizure freedom if they use any permitted anti-epileptic drugs at anytime during the period, and/or complete less than 80% of diaries during the period.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
