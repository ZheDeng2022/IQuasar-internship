  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One examiner (a licensed dentist) will perform the direct oral examination of the&#xD;
      participants and take the intraoral photographs in the aged care home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later, two remote examiners (licensed dentists) will assess the intraoral photographs of the&#xD;
      same group of participants. The participant's dentition will be examined using the scores&#xD;
      developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for oral health surveys. Also, the examiners&#xD;
      will perform a visual inspection of the oral mucosa for any signs of oral potentially&#xD;
      malignant disorders (OPMD), as the mortality of high-risk populations is proven to be reduced&#xD;
      by visual oral cancer screening. Finally, the residents will receive oral health education,&#xD;
      and the residents who require treatment will be referred to Kasr EL Ainy dental hospital to&#xD;
      receive dental treatments, this is similar to an integrated approach to oral health in aged&#xD;
      care facilities in Australia .&#xD;
