      The aims of the present study are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: In-vitro measures to determine the validity, precision and accuracy of the Vyntus CPX&#xD;
      metabolic cart assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Methanol burning tests. 1.2. Pure gas (nitrogen [N2] and carbon dioxide [CO2]) infusions&#xD;
      to simulate both, constant and variable fluxes of oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      production (VCO2) in different conditions and moments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Immediately after or prior the methanol burning test (in a randomized order).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In separate days and time-periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: In-vivo measures using the Vyntus CPX metabolic cart:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. To assess the resting metabolic rate (RMR or resting energy expenditure [REE]) and&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER) day-to-day biological reproducibility (i.e. reliability) of&#xD;
      the metabolic cart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Further, the investigators will use an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine&#xD;
      the post-prandial day-to-day biological reproducibility (especifically the post-prandial RER)&#xD;
      of the metabolic cart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be developed in three different experiments which are detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENT 1 (AIM 1.1 AND 1.2.A):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the Vyntus CPX measurement error over 14 different days by&#xD;
      using both, methanol burnings and pure gas infusions. The order will be random.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Methanol burning: the investigators will burn the methanol inside the glass-cage and the&#xD;
           investigators will measure dynamically the weight of burned alcohol; gas exchange will&#xD;
           be continuously measured with the Vyntus CPX while the produced gases are directed into&#xD;
           the metabolic cart's hose tube. The burning will take approximately 25-30 minutes and is&#xD;
           expected to produce a RER=0.667.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pure gas infusions: Pure N2 (concentration ≥99.9997%) for diluting ambient O2 and CO2&#xD;
           (concentration ≥99.995%) will be infused using high-precision mass-flow controllers (358&#xD;
           Series, Analyt-MTC, Müllheim, Germany; 0-2 l/min) into the metabolic cart's hose tube.&#xD;
           The infused volumes of N2 and CO2 will be selected to replicate (i.e. mimic) as much as&#xD;
           possible the VO2 and VCO2 produced by the methanol burning test. The gas infusions will&#xD;
           last 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENT 2 (AIM 1.2.B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the Vyntus CPX measurement error over 14 different days by&#xD;
      using pure gas infusions (each pure gas infusion will last 20 minutes). The procedures will&#xD;
      be as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pure gas infusions varying, in a random order, the simulated VO2 and VCO2 to poduce&#xD;
           different energy expenditure (EE) and RER values: the investigators will infuse pure N2&#xD;
           and CO2 gases at different volumes. The infusions will be performed either in the&#xD;
           morning or in the afternoon (i.e. random) in 14 different and separate days. The&#xD;
           randomly selected simulated EE will range between 1000 and 2000 kilocalories per day&#xD;
           (kcal/day) while the RER will range between 0.80 and 0.95. The investigators will&#xD;
           perform 5 pure gas infusions per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pure gas infusions varying, in a random order, the simulated VO2 and VCO2 to produce&#xD;
           different EE values while keeping a constant RER: the investigators will infuse pure N2&#xD;
           and CO2 gases at different volumes. The infusions will be performed either in the&#xD;
           morning or in the afternoon (i.e. random) in 14 different and separate days. The&#xD;
           randomly selected simulated EE will range between 1000 and 2000 kcal/day while the RER&#xD;
           is fixed at 0.85. The investigators will perform 5 pure gas infusions per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pure gas infusions varying, in a random order, the simulated VO2 and VCO2 to produce&#xD;
           different RER values while keeping a constant EE: the investigators will infuse pure N2&#xD;
           and CO2 gases at different volumes. The infusions will be performed either in the&#xD;
           morning or in the afternoon (i.e. random) in 14 different and separate days. The&#xD;
           randomly selected simulated RER will range between 0.80 and 0.95 while the EE is fixed&#xD;
           at 1500 kcal/day. The investigators will perform 5 pure gas infusions per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENT 3 (AIM 2.1 and 2.2.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the RMR and RER of 10-15 young-healthy adults using the Vyntus&#xD;
      CPX metabolic cart on two consecutive days in the morning. The assessment will last 30&#xD;
      minutes and will be performed in agreement with current guidelines. The subjects will lay on&#xD;
      a reclined bed in supine position and covered by a bed sheet for 20 minutes before the&#xD;
      assessment as an 'acclimation period'. Immediately after this acclimation period the RMR and&#xD;
      RER assessment will start under the same conditions. Then, the glucose beverage (75g of&#xD;
      glucose/200ml) is given to the participants and another 180 minutes of assessment are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the participants' weight, height and body composition (using a dual X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan [DXA scan]) will be measured upon arrival on the first visit. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected at different time periods to determine the blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration. Lastly, participants will be asked to consume a standardized dinner&#xD;
      (specifically designed by a dietitians team) the night before each study day.&#xD;
