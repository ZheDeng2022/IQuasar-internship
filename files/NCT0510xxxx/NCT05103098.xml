      the study will be made on female patients with the first trimester missed abortion confirmed&#xD;
      by ultrasound. Participants will be divided into 2 groups one group (A) will receive&#xD;
      sublingual Misoprostol 400 mcg and the other group(B) will receive sublingual Misoprostol 800&#xD;
      mcg every 4 hours in both groups up to 3 doses the aim of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of sublingual Misoprostol in complete termination of the first trimester missed&#xD;
      abortion and which route is the best will less side effects.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive three doses of sublingual misoprostol every four hours The first dose of misoprostol 400 mcg will be administrated at the hospital. Then the patient will be observed for 1 hour for any immediate adverse reaction Clear instructions about the method and timing of the second dose will be given upon sending home.&#xD;
Two doses of misoprostol 800 mcg each (2 tablets of 200 mcg per dose). Paracetamol, eight hourly, will be provided as an analgesic or antipyretic. A specimen bottle to collect the POC if passed out.
