  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerance and efficacy of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride liposome injection combined with&#xD;
      cytarabine in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The study will be divided into two&#xD;
      phases, the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase. Patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory(R/R) AML will be included in the dose-escalation phase, and patients with&#xD;
      treatment-naïve or R/R AML will be included in the dose-expansion phase.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation phase: Eligible patients will enter the screening period up to 14 days before&#xD;
      the start of treatment. Patients will receive mitoxantrone liposomes combined with&#xD;
      cytarabine, with a fixed dose of cytarabine and mitoxantrone liposomes in 3 dose groups: 24&#xD;
      mg/m^2, 30 mg/m^2 and 36 mg/m^2. The starting dose will be 24 mg/m^2, and the &quot;3+3&quot; principle&#xD;
      is adopted for the escalation. If the maximum tolerated dose is not explored at the preset&#xD;
      maximum dose (36 mg/m^2), the investigator and the sponsor will determine whether to continue&#xD;
      the dose escalation, and it is necessary to ensure that 6 patients complete the dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) observation under this dose group. The treatment period includes 2 cycles with&#xD;
      each cycle lasting 28 days. Cycle 1 is the DLT observation period and Cycle 2 is the extended&#xD;
      dosing period. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection will be given on the first day&#xD;
      of each cycle, and cytarabine will be given every 12 hours on Day 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Patients who do not experience a DLT in the first cycle and achieve is at least PR, may enter&#xD;
      the extended dosing period and be treated with the original regimen in Cycle 2. Patients who&#xD;
      have completed 2 cycles and have a DLT in the first cycle or have not achieved PR will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion phase: Newly treated AML or R/R AML patients will be included and divided into&#xD;
      two cohorts. Eligible patients will enter the screening period up to 14 days before receiving&#xD;
      treatments. The treatment period is 2 cycles, and each cycle is 28 days. Mitoxantrone&#xD;
      hydrochloride liposome injection will be given on the first day of each cycle, whose dose&#xD;
      size will be determined by the investigator and the sponsor based on the results of the&#xD;
      previous study. Cytarabine will be given on Day 1-7 of each cycle for the treatment-naïve&#xD;
      group, and on Day 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle for the R/R group. Patients will take 1 cycle of&#xD;
      therapy and will be assessed for response at the end of the 1st cycle. After the efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation, the patient may receive a second cycle of chemotherapy at the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion. And patients whose curative effect do not reach PR will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
