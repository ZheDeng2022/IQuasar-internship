      This phase I trial tests the safety and side effects of a cancer vaccine called Labvax&#xD;
      3(22)-23 and GM-CSF in treating adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced stage). Labvax 3(22)-23 is designed to target a specific antigen (labyrinthin),&#xD;
      which is a protein found on the surface of adenocarcinoma tumor cells. Labyrinthin is a&#xD;
      protein that is not expressed on normal cells in the skin, lungs, salivary glands, pancreas,&#xD;
      nor other tissues. In adenocarcinoma, the tumor cells produce too much labyrinthin causing&#xD;
      them to express this protein on the surface of the tumor cells. One way to control the growth&#xD;
      of these tumor cells is to teach the immune system to generate an immune response against the&#xD;
      labyrinthin protein by vaccination against labyrinthin. GM-CSF, or sargramostim, is a protein&#xD;
      that acts as a white blood cell growth factor. It has also been shown to stimulate immune&#xD;
      system. Thus, administration of GM-CSF may help to boost the immune system response when&#xD;
      given together with the vaccine. This study may improve the general knowledge about Labvax&#xD;
      3(22)-23 and how the body may generate an immune response to kill adenocarcinoma tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the adverse events of LabVax 3(22)-23 in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To obtain the preliminary assessment on the efficacy of LabVax 3(22)-23&#xD;
      and adjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) and LabVax 3(22)-23 intradermally&#xD;
      (ID) on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

             immunotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy must have been completed for at least 3&#xD;
             weeks prior to 1st vaccine injection. Prior palliative radiation must have been&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have documentation of positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)&#xD;
             response to common recall antigens prior to 1st vaccine injection. As part of the&#xD;

             and physical (mumps, Trichophyton, Candida antigens, influenza [flu] matrix, and/or&#xD;
             purified protein derivative [PPD], etc.). Skin tests will be read at or about 48&#xD;
             hours. A skin reaction will be considered positive if there is any measurable&#xD;
             induration associated with erythema of 10 mm or greater. Erythema alone will not be&#xD;
             regarded as a positive DTH response&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
             of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have a life expectancy of &gt;= 6 months at the time of 1st vaccine&#xD;
             injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All laboratory testing and all radiologic tests (e.g., computed tomography [CT],&#xD;
             positron emission tomography [PET] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan) must be&#xD;
             done within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute granulocyte count (AGC) &gt;= 1,000 obtained within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine&#xD;
             injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-treatment platelet count of &gt;= 75,000 obtained within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine&#xD;
             injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pre-treatment serum creatinine of =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL is required. Measurements must be&#xD;
             obtained within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 obtained within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limits of normal (=&lt; 5x&#xD;
             if with liver metastases) obtained within 4 weeks prior to 1st vaccine injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because the effects of the vaccine on the unborn fetus or nursing infant are unknown,&#xD;

             from participating and adhering to study related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled concomitant disease that in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             interfere with the subject's safety or compliance on trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe infection that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with subject&#xD;
             safety or compliance on trial within 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;

          -  Subjects who have contraindications to GM-CSF injections according to the package&#xD;
             insert (e.g., subjects with excessive leukemic myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or&#xD;

             any component of the product)&#xD;
