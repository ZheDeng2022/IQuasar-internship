      Survival and success rates of Zirconia dental implants compared with Titanium implants&#xD;
      (Two-Piece Zirconia implants)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last three decades the use of dental implants to support oral rehabilitation has&#xD;
      become a common treatment in dentistry and orthopedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants are made of titanium alloy and have shown high safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the gray color of the implant may be reflected through the gums and impair&#xD;
      aesthetics in the areas of the front of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Against this background, in recent years, implant companies have developed zirconia implants,&#xD;
      which are white in color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown an aesthetic advantage for zirconia implants and zirconia structures&#xD;
      compared to titanium when placed in an aesthetic area in patients with thin gums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zirconia implants are resistant to high forces and like titanium implants they undergo&#xD;
      osteointegration into the bone, another study in dogs demonstrated an improvement in the soft&#xD;
      and hard tissue integration in zirconia implants compared to titanium. In addition to the&#xD;
      aesthetic benefit, zirconia implants may have an advantage in a less inflammatory response in&#xD;
      the tissues surrounding the implant. In recent years, a number of studies have been published&#xD;
      showing detachment of titanium particles from titanium implants which cause an inflammatory&#xD;
      response and the absorption of supporting bone around the implant. In addition, several&#xD;
      laboratory studies have shown an advantage for zirconia implants in terms of bacterial&#xD;
      adsorption to the surface of the implant compared to titanium implants. Studies have been&#xD;
      found that show higher pathogenic bacterial adsorption to titanium compared to zirconia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TavMedical was established in 1975 and mainly specializes in the production, development and&#xD;
      marketing of consumable medical products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011 the company began to develop dental products including implants, parts and utensils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The company specializes mainly in zirconia dental products. Titanium implants are common and&#xD;
      well-known implants and the company focuses its activities on promoting zirconia implants,&#xD;
      which constitute a significant differentiation from the titanium implants currently sold in&#xD;
      the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of developing zirconia dental implants is to introduce zirconia implants as a&#xD;
      preferred alternative to the dental implants currently sold from titanium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, improving the implant treatments currently offered by providing an alternative with&#xD;
      high aesthetic results. Patients in the modern age are characterized by a high awareness of&#xD;
      their health condition and their demand for treatment with high aesthetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural tooth and being a metal-free material adapted to a growing trend all over the&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis - Based on the literature, the success rate and survival of zirconia&#xD;
      implants is similar to titanium implants and stands at about 95% chance of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus differences in the survival and success of titanium implants compared to zirconia are&#xD;
      not expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical inflammation markers and low-level pro-inflammatory cytokines were found around&#xD;
      zirconia implants compared to titanium implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study - Comparison of survival, success and signs of inflammation of zirconia&#xD;
      implants compared to titanium implants.&#xD;

    <description>Gingival index (GI) (Löe and Sillness, 1963): scores each site on a 0 to 3 scale, with 0 being normal and 3 being severe inflammation characterized by edema, redness, swelling, and spontaneous bleeding, the score is given by visual examining the gingiva around the implant.</description>

    <description>Plaque index (PI) (Sillness and Löe, 1964): The plaque index assesses the amount of dental plaque visible around the teeth and implants, scoring each site on 0 to 3 scale.</description>

    <description>Pink Esthetic Score (PES) (Fürhauser 2005): evaluates the esthetic outcome of soft tissue around implant-supported single crowns, the score is given by visual examining the gingiva around the implant.&#xD;
A score of 2, 1, or 0 is assigned to all seven parameters. A score of 0 indicated the worst and a score of 2 indicated the best result for each variable, therefore the highest possible score of 14 denoted perfect peri-implant soft tissues.</description>
