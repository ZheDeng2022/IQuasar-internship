      Background Managing perioperative stress, including endocrino-metabolic changes and,&#xD;
      inflammatory and pain responses, is a major challenge to improve patient's recovery.&#xD;
      Currently, minimally invasive surgical procedures combined with multimodal analgesia are&#xD;
      commonly used to increase the quality of postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To demonstrate that a minimally invasive approach including low insufflation pressure&#xD;
      and minitrocars in laparoscopic hysterectomy improves postoperative recovery and reduces pain&#xD;
      stimulation and opioid consumption in comparison with a conventional approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods After informed consent, all patients scheduled for a laparoscopic hysterectomy&#xD;
      including those with carcinologic disease will be part of this monocentric prospective&#xD;
      randomized double-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission in our outpatient unit, patients will have to fill the Post-operative Quality of&#xD;
      Recovery Scale assessment form, before to be randomized into one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional approach: laparoscopic procedure including standard trocars (3 trocars of 5&#xD;
           mm and a 10 mm-optic trocar) with insufflation pressures between 10 and 12 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-invasive approach : laparoscopic surgery using mini-trocars (3 trocars of 3 mm and&#xD;
           a 5 mm-optic trocar) with insufflation pressures of less than 8 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have general anesthesia with a deep neuromuscular blockade (TOF = 0 at the&#xD;
      thumb adductor) and will benefit of our enhanced recovery program. Patients and evaluators&#xD;
      will be blind regarding the allocated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is a comparison of the postoperative recovery between the two groups&#xD;
      through the Post-operative Quality of Recovery Scale.This evaluation will include pain data,&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting evaluation and cognitive function 6 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are morphine consumption surgical comfort and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      Introduction About 43,000 hysterectomies were performed in France in 2016 half of them as a&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedure. Compared to vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic surgery decreases&#xD;
      postoperative pain and hospital length of stay [PubMed ID: 25524534 ]. Laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy is also the most common surgical technique in the USA within enhanced recovery&#xD;
      after surgery programs (ERAS)[2]. However, postoperative pain is still an important issue and&#xD;
      results in most of the early re-admissions [3]. In addition, control of intraoperative&#xD;
      stress, including painful stimuli, but also endocrine-metabolic and inflammatory responses is&#xD;
      a major component of patient's recovery improvement. Reducing length of stay can lead to a&#xD;
      possible outpatient surgery with a high level of quality and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysterectomy in outpatient setting is barely done in France (0.1% in 2012 and 1.5% in 2017)&#xD;
      compare to USA (more than 50%) so there is still a significant scope of improvement [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many parameters need to be controlled to reduce perioperative stress [4,5]. Francophone teams&#xD;
      showed that the use of mini-invasive techniques such as low and stable abdominal insufflation&#xD;
      pressure is an important factor regarding pain and inflammation after gynecological surgery&#xD;
      [6,7]. Furthermore to reduce parietal and peritoneal injuries can be achieved by using very&#xD;
      small trocars while allowing surgery to be performed in good conditions [8,9]. Some teams&#xD;
      have combined these two techniques with promising results in abdominal surgery [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of anesthesia technic within an ERAS program that include quick elimination drugs,&#xD;
      vascular filling monitoring and optimization, prevention of hypothermia and postoperative&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting (PONV), as well as a multimodal analgesia, including loco-regional analgesia&#xD;
      allow a faster postoperative recovery after pelvic surgery [11, 12]. Among these parameters,&#xD;
      post-operative pain management is a major component. It has been demonstrated that pain&#xD;
      prolongs surgical stress, delays mobilization and full recovery. Opioid medication therapy&#xD;
      results in many adverse effects (PONV, sedation) and delays postoperative recovery[12].&#xD;
      Furthermore, availability of opioids at home is currently a real public health issue[13].&#xD;
      After a conventional hysterectomy use of opioids is almost systematic[14]. Therefore the&#xD;
      challenge is to provide effective analgesia with the minimum of opioids use. Anesthesia with&#xD;
      a deep neuromuscular blockade allows a low peritoneal pressure while maintaining optimal&#xD;
      surgical comfort[15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A mini-invasive approach of laparoscopic hysterectomy, combining mini-trocars and&#xD;
      low pneumoperitoneum pressure would improve quality of post-operative recovery and reduce&#xD;
      length of stay in the hospital allowing the procedure to be performed as outpatient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary goal: to demonstrate that a mini-invasive laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to&#xD;
           a conventional approach improves the PQRS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess intraoperative pain intensity using the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) and&#xD;
      whether minimally invasive surgery reduces the use of per- and postoperative opioids, PONV&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This randomized prospective study will be carried out according to CONSORT&#xD;
      methodological standards[17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and recruitment During the pre-operative clinic, surgeon will check patient's&#xD;
      eligibility regarding the inclusion criteria and patients will receive oral and written&#xD;
      inform consent about the study. During anesthesia clinic, eligibility for ambulatory surgery&#xD;
      will be confirmed and informed consent will be obtained. Throughout the duration of the study&#xD;
      (24 hours), the patient will not be able to be included in any other research protocol that&#xD;
      could affect her post-operative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population After informed consent, all eligible patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy&#xD;
      surgery for benign or malignant affections will be included. Inclusion criteria are: stable&#xD;
      ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists )score &lt;3, no contraindication to take&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , absence of chronic pain, perfect understanding of&#xD;
      post-operative psycho-motor assessment, presence of an attendant, distance between home and&#xD;
      hospital allowing a possible quick readmission and acceptance to respect all the given&#xD;
      medical instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be systematically excluded in case of laparo-conversion and surgical or&#xD;
      anesthetic complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and PQRS assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After admission in the day surgery unit all patient included in the study will fill a PQRS&#xD;
      form before to be randomized in one of the two groups. Randomization and intraoperative&#xD;
      patient care will not be achieved by the PQRS assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization into one of the two arms will be done by using a remote computer randomization&#xD;
      system :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conv group conventional approach : laparoscopic surgery using standard trocars (3&#xD;
           trocars of 5 mm and a 10 mm-optic trocar) with insufflation pressures between 10 and 12&#xD;
           mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-inv group mini-invasive approach: laparoscopic surgery using mini-trocars (3&#xD;
           trocars of 3 mm and a 5 mm-optic trocar) with insufflation pressures of less than 8&#xD;
           mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both group will have an anesthesia with a deep neuromuscular blockade (TOF = 0 at the thumb&#xD;
      adductor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the patient nor the evaluator will be aware of the randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The pre-operative and H6 PQRS score will be collected by an anesthesiologist not involve in&#xD;
      patient care either per or post operatively up to 24h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative management All patient will benefit of our ERAS protocol: fasting allowing the&#xD;
      use of drinks up to 2 hours before anesthesia[16], general anesthesia with oro-tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and protective mechanical ventilation (current tidal volume between 6-8 ml/kg of&#xD;
      ideal weight and peep at 5 cmH2O) with a mixture of air and oxygen (50/50) and multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia with intravenous lidocaine infusion (1,5 mg/kg bolus immediately after induction&#xD;
      followed by a continuous infusion of 1,5 mg/kg/h stopped 20 min before the end of the&#xD;
      procedure. Anesthesia will be performed according to our department protocol : induction and&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia by propofol/remifentanil operated by target controlled intravenous&#xD;
      anesthesia system (TIVA); anesthetic depth monitored with a bispectral index (BIS) between 45&#xD;
      and 55; per-operative analgesia provided by remifentanil with a brain concentration objective&#xD;
      0,35 ng/L for induction. Quality of analgesia will be monitored through the Analgesia&#xD;
      Nociception Index (ANI). Remifentanil brain concentration objective will be changed to keep&#xD;
      ANI in a range of 50 to 70. Depth of neuromuscular block with atracurium will be monitored by&#xD;
      train-of-four. Neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized at the end of surgery according to&#xD;
      the recommended procedure [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine analgesia will be started 20 minutes before the end of the procedure : paracetamol 1&#xD;
      g and ketoprofen up to 100 mg according to age and kidney function. Intraperitoneal (20 ml)&#xD;
      and trocars orifices (10 ml) infiltration will be achieved by 2 mg/ml ropivacaine at the end&#xD;
      of the procedure. In addition, heated blanket will be used to prevent hypothermia and central&#xD;
      temperature will be monitored with esophageal temperature sensor. Dexamethasone 8 mg and&#xD;
      droperidol 0.625 mg will be given to prevent PONV. Fluid therapy will be limited to 2 ml/kg/h&#xD;
      besides blood loss compensation with a balanced solution of Ringer-Lactate. No urinary&#xD;
      catheter will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), pain at rest and cough will be assessed using a&#xD;
      verbal numeric scale (VNS) between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain imaginable). Patients will&#xD;
      receive morphine intravenously (3 mg every 5 min) if the VNS level is &gt;3/10. In the case of&#xD;
      PONV, intravenous ondansetron 4 mg will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allowed to feed and intravenous catheter will be removed as soon as they&#xD;
      leave the PACU. Patients will be invited to walk as soon as they can. Preventive&#xD;
      anticoagulation with enoxaparin will be started 6 hours postoperatively. Postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia will be managed by a combination of paracetamol 500 mg and opium 20 mg and&#xD;
      ketoprofen 50 mg every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be discharged from the day surgery unit according to a &quot;Chung score&quot; &gt; 9.&#xD;
      Decision to keep the patient overnight will be made by the surgeon and anesthesiologist in&#xD;
      charge of the patient regardless of the study or randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four hours after surgery, outpatient will be called at home and inpatient seen in her&#xD;
      room by a research assistant to answer to a satisfaction survey and to assess postoperative&#xD;
      pain intensity and by mouth morphine consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes evaluation The primary outcome is a comparison between the two groups of immediate&#xD;
      postoperative recovery as determined by the PQRS score [18], applied at the 6th postoperative&#xD;
      hour (pain score, PONV and cognitive recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intraoperative intensity of nociceptive stimulation measured by the intraoperative&#xD;
           opioids consumption (remifentanil) according to the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI)&#xD;
           [19]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  postoperative pain intensity at rest, cough and walk (if possible) and based on the&#xD;
           Verbal Numeric Scale (VNS) at H2, H6 and H24 post-operative, intravenous morphine&#xD;
           consumption in PACU and by mouth opioids (morphine sulfate) during the first 24&#xD;
           post-operative hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of PONV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients who reached the preoperative PQRS score at H6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical comfort on the Leiden scale [20]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery duration, length of stay in PACU (Aldrete score/15min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients with PADSS scores &lt; 9 at H2 and H6 [21]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bowel movement at H24 post-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients who returned to hospital after discharge (or requiring medical&#xD;
           contact) within 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction (EVAN score) [22]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The number of patients required to show a 5-point difference in the PQRS&#xD;
      score, with a risk α of 5% and a risk β of 20%, taking into account a baseline score in the&#xD;
      Conv group of 30 +/- 5 at H6 is 31 patients per group. With 20% of patients included but not&#xD;
      evaluable or with deviations from protocol, 37 patients per group should be included. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be carried out on a per-protocol basis and with intention to treat.&#xD;
      It will be based on the t-Student test for the main criterion (PQRS) and Mann-Whitney or&#xD;
      Chi-2 tests for other parameters depending on the type of parameter.&#xD;
