  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of colorectal cancer patients will develop colorectal liver metastases&#xD;
      (CRLM). The most effective approach to increase long-term survival is CRLM complete&#xD;
      resection. Unfortunately, only 10 - 15% of CRLM are initially considered resectable. The&#xD;
      objective response rates (ORR) after current first-line systemic chemotherapy (sys-CT)&#xD;
      regimens range from 40 to 80% and complete resection rates (CRR) range from 25 to 50% in&#xD;
      patients with initially unresectable CRLM. When CRLM patients are not amenable to complete&#xD;
      resection after induction of sys-CT, ORRs obtained with second-line sys-CT are much lower&#xD;
      (between 10 and 30%) and consequently CRRs are also low (&lt; 10%). Hepatic arterial infusion&#xD;
      (HAI) oxaliplatin may represent a salvage therapy in patients with CRLM unresectable after&#xD;
      one or more sys-CT regimens with ORRs and CRRs up to 60 and 30%, respectively. This study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of an intensification strategy based on HAI oxaliplatin&#xD;
      combined with sys-CT as the first-line treatment in patients with unresectable CRLM.&#xD;
