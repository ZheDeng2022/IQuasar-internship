      The primary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (sequential dose-escalation): to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan-hziy (SG) as a single agent and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      SG in Japanese participants with advance solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (dose expansion): to evaluate the efficacy of SG in Japanese participants with&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
