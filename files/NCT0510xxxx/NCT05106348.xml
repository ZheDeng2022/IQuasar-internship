    <textblock>
      Aerobic fitness is an important part of sport training preparation for wheelchair rugby&#xD;
      players. Currently, there are some test protocols on arm crank ergometer for spinal cord&#xD;
      injury people. However, wheelchair propulsion seems to be better and more specific movement&#xD;
      to assess aerobic fitness in wheelchair rugby player. Thus, this pilot study was designed to&#xD;
      determine the reliability of the aerobic fitness test protocol on a wheelchair ergometer for&#xD;
      wheelchair rugby players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Ten wheelchair rugby players (C5/6 = 4, C6/C7 = 3, C7/th1 = 1 all with incomplete&#xD;
      lesions, cerebral palsy (CP) = 1; dysmelia = 1; mean age = 32,90 yr. ± 5,17; body mass =&#xD;
      70,04 kg ± 12,53; body height = 177,70 cm ± 18,64) participated in the aerobic fitness test&#xD;
      on the Lode Esseda wheelchair ergometer (LEM Software 10.12, Groningen, Netherlands). This&#xD;
      test involved different considering players' International Wheelchair Rugby Federation (IWRF)&#xD;
      class (class 0.5 = 4 players, classes 1.0-1.5 = 6 players, and classes 2.0-3.5 = 8 players)&#xD;
      increments of workload every minute at constant velocity of 4.5 km/h. Peak oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (V̇O2peak l/min, V̇O2peak ml/kg/min), minute ventilation (VE), and the test time achieved&#xD;
      were collected (Cortex Metamax). The load [N, Watts] from the last fully achieved level in&#xD;
      the test was noticed. Participants repeated the aerobic fitness test twice with 24h break.&#xD;
      Each player had 10 minutes warm-up before the test. Differences (T-test for independent&#xD;
      groups or Wilcoxon test) and correlations (Pearson test or Spearman test) between results&#xD;
      from the first and the second repetition of the test (fully achieved load level in the test)&#xD;
      were calculated to establish reliability. The intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and&#xD;
      standard error of measurement (SEM) were added. The significance level was set at p&lt;.05&#xD;
