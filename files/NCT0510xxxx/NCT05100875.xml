  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if the SSERT (Social Skills and Emotion Regulation Training)&#xD;
      intervention is feasible and acceptable in individual with psychotic disorder and a history&#xD;
      of trauma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with psychotic disorders experience poor functional outcomes such as lower&#xD;
      quality of life, lower levels of education, and lower life expectancy. Comorbid mental&#xD;
      disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and related posttraumatic stress symptoms&#xD;
      tend to aggravate psychotic symptoms and, as a result, worsen functional outcomes. Further,&#xD;
      emotion regulation and interpersonal functioning are generally impaired in individuals with&#xD;
      psychotic disorders and histories of childhood trauma, and preliminary evidence suggests that&#xD;
      these impairments may mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and psychotic symptom&#xD;
      severity. Despite the high levels of trauma observed in psychotic populations, the last&#xD;
      decade has seen only a modest increase in the number of trials examining the efficacy of&#xD;
      trauma interventions in this population. Further, given the initial distress,&#xD;
      destabilization, and increased vulnerability that may occur when first engaging in&#xD;
      trauma-focused intervention, it has been argued that in those with psychotic disorders,&#xD;
      stabilizing/grounding interventions may be a necessary fist step prior to engagement in&#xD;
      trauma therapy. This study will thus assess whether the Social Skills and Emotion Regulation&#xD;
      Training (SSERT) for Trauma in Psychosis is feasible and acceptable to offer as a preparatory&#xD;
      intervention, and will examine its preliminary effect on emotion regulation, interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning, and other functional outcomes. SSERT proposes a single-arm baseline with&#xD;
      post-intervention design. We will recruit 20 participants with a psychotic disorder, a&#xD;
      history of trauma, and an impairment in interpersonal functioning and/or emotion regulation.&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of nine weekly hour-long individual sessions and one final&#xD;
      90-minute session. The feasibility of SSERT will be assessed by examining the profile or&#xD;
      safety of the study (including whether there are any adverse events reported), the&#xD;
      participant flow (missed sessions, attrition rates, retention/completion rates), and through&#xD;
      both standardized and qualitative items assessing therapist feedback. The acceptability of&#xD;
      SSERT will be assessed subjectively, specifically though participant responses on therapy&#xD;
      satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and motivation for therapy questionnaires. Qualitative&#xD;
      analyses will identify common themes and assess participant comments. We expect that SSERT&#xD;
      will be both feasible and acceptable to administer to this population. Any expectations&#xD;
      regarding the intervention's effect in improving emotion regulation, interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning, and other functional outcomes is exploratory. Overall, SSERT may help people&#xD;
      with psychotic disorders to better understand how the experience and effect of trauma impacts&#xD;
      their relationships and emotion management. The intervention may also help to improve&#xD;
      functional outcomes and relationship quality by teaching emotion regulation and grounding&#xD;
      strategies, and through learning to become more engaged and flexible in relationships.&#xD;

    <description>The SSERT intervention will take place over 10 weekly individual intervention sessions of 60 minutes. SSERT for trauma history in psychosis will draw inspiration from the Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation intervention as well as other CBT and DBT-based interventions for emotion regulation and social skills functioning. Therapists will be provided with a semi-structured manual that can be implemented flexibly to consider participant needs.</description>
