  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first COVID-19 case in Turkey was reported on March 11, 2000. National COVID-19 mass&#xD;
      vaccination was initiated on Jan 13, 202, with two doses of CoronaVac (R) inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      (of Sinovac), 28 days apart. The health personnel were prioritized in the mass vaccination,&#xD;
      given their high rates of exposure and fatality. National COVID-19 statistics have been&#xD;
      limited to those announced in the media; data breakdown by gender, age, vaccine type and&#xD;
      status etc. is not provided, nor is the association between non-pharmaceutical preventive&#xD;
      measures (NPPM) and infection rates. Well-planned, longitudinal, detailed studies with&#xD;
      laboratory support are clearly warranted. Hacettepe University is a leading institution in&#xD;
      Turkey, with its large health sciences campus. Students of medical school (grades 4, 5, and&#xD;
      6) and dental school (grades 4 and 5) have been actively providing patient care in HU&#xD;
      Hospitals, and more than 10% of medical interns had been reportedly diagnosed as COVID-19&#xD;
      cases prior to vaccination activities, despite (reportedly) strict non-pharmaceutical public&#xD;
      preventive measures (NPPM) use inside/outside the occupational settings. A two-year&#xD;
      prospective cohort study was planned for periodic evaluation of students' general health&#xD;
      status and COVID-19 risk/exposure/infection, for timely referrals and quarantine/isolation,&#xD;
      as needed. Anti- SARS-CoV-2-RBS antibodies will be measured periodically after vaccination,&#xD;
      together with evaluation of potential adverse effects, presence and durability of&#xD;
      vaccine-induced immunity. Comparison of antibody levels were planned for incident COVID-19&#xD;
      cases and two test-negative controls of the same gender, attending the same grade and&#xD;
      faculty. A subcohort will be followed for aymptomatic infection risk. Institutional ethical&#xD;
      approvals were obtained, as required. A step-wise informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      participants, all tests will be done with de-personalized records, and all statistical&#xD;
      analyses and reporting will be completed anonymously. Follow-up of participants will be&#xD;
      ensured using participant-specific study identification numbers provided at enrollment. Study&#xD;
      team is composed of academic personnel of 10 selected departments, nursing support is&#xD;
      provided by the Students' Health Center in the Campus, and dental faculty are assigned for&#xD;
      obtaining informed during the 4 subsequent study visits. The budget of the study is provided&#xD;
      by the Hacettepe University Scientific Research Projects Office (BAP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned, and ethical approval procedures were initiated in late January, 2021.&#xD;
      However, serial official approval processes delayed the initiation of the study beyond the&#xD;
      pre-planned initiation date (late in March 2021, to catch the 28th day after the second dose&#xD;
      of CoronaVac vaccine). Thus, the study plan was revised, and so were the approval processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned prospective cohort study started its recruitment process in June, with the first&#xD;
      enrollment on June 21, 2021. The study is an open cohort; vaccination times vary, some&#xD;
      students participated in the first visit, but have/can leave the study before May 2023 (the&#xD;
      planned closure time for testing); some students did not participate in the first visit (in&#xD;
      June-July 2021), yet preferred to be involved in the study bythe time of the second visit&#xD;
      (October 2021) and so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are being recruited from students of medical school (grades 4,5, and 6) and&#xD;
      dental school (grade 4 and %), and are involved in the study for all/some of the procedures&#xD;
      offered. The study aimed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the sociodemographic characteristics, health status, life habits, quality of&#xD;
           life (via validated indices), COVID-19 status, vaccination status for SARS-CoV-2, use of&#xD;
           non-pharmaceutical preventive measures against COVID-19. These will be accomplished&#xD;
           through online, depersonalized, self-completed standardized questionnaire and use of&#xD;
           validated scales.;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete anthropometric measures and physical examination at each visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Check blood levels for complete blood count, renal function tests, liver enzymes,&#xD;
           D-dimer, vitamin D, HbA1c levels, and lipid profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Check vaccine-induced immunity using quantitative, Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding&#xD;
           Domain kit (Abbott Laboratories) at enrolment and each subsequent visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the durability of vaccine-induced immunity, as measured by antibody levels&#xD;
           periodically (at 3rd, 6th, 12th and 24th month after full immunization following full&#xD;
           vaccination, i.e. 2 doses plus 28 days);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The cohort will be followed up to 24 months (through September 2023) for detecting&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection and/or related hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU)-admission&#xD;
           or death; also, to study the potential association with personal risk factors and/or&#xD;
           vaccine-induced immunity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A nested, test-negative case-control study is integrated into the the cohort, such that&#xD;
           each time a new COVID-19 case is identified (with a PCR-positivity), two gender and&#xD;
           school/grade matched controls will be invited for PCR testing. Blood will be drawn from&#xD;
           PCR test negative controls at the day (or within 1 day later) of the PCR-positivity of&#xD;
           the case detected. This nested case-(test-negative) control design will enable to study&#xD;
           the association between infection and current Anti-Spike1 RBD antibody levels,&#xD;
           controlling for personal risk factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Given the considerable amount of asymptomatic infections among vaccinated individuals,&#xD;
           150 participants will be selected from among volunteers for 6 consecutive PCR-testing,&#xD;
           with 15 days intervals between each testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three study designs will be used to reach study objectives; namely, a large prospective&#xD;
      cohort (for evaluating changes in general health status and neutralizing antibody levels, as&#xD;
      measured by SARS-CoV-2-RBD Abs); a subcohort for periodical PCR testing to detect&#xD;
      asymptomatic infection rates;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the planned study, Pfizer-Biontech (R) m-RNA vaccination has been&#xD;
      introduced for mass vaccination, as 2 doses, 28 days apart. Also, the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      promoted a third dose of COVID-19 vaccination for health personnel in particular, due to&#xD;
      rapidly decreasing immunity for COVID-19 among 2-dose CoronaVac vaccinated individuals. This&#xD;
      change in mass vaccination introduced variation in our exposure status. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      objectives of the study extended to calculation and comparison of the incidence-rates of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection and related complications among those vaccinated with either of the 2&#xD;
      vaccines (namely, CoronaVac and Biontech), controlling for the first doses and boosters,&#xD;
      including mix-and-matches.&#xD;
