  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will utilize a randomized, factorial design trial to examine the effects of&#xD;
      nicotine messaging on nicotine harm beliefs and smoking behavior. After a 7-day period of&#xD;
      smoking own preferred brand cigarettes, participants will begin a 28-day experimental period&#xD;
      and will be randomized to one of four conditions: 1) Nicotine Corrective Messaging (NCM) +&#xD;
      Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes, 2) NCM + normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes,&#xD;
      3) Delayed Control Messaging + RNC cigarettes, or 4) Delayed Control Messaging + NNC&#xD;
      cigarettes. The investigators will aim to recruit and randomize 160 current, daily cigarette&#xD;
      smokers (80 male, 80 female) in a 35-day protocol. Participants will be asked to attend 6&#xD;
      in-person sessions at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA)&#xD;
      on Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 &amp; 35. Sessions will occur every 6-8 days.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nicotine beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through 35</time_frame>
    <description>Nicotine belief measures will be assessed by participant self-report and comprised of four broad constructs (nicotine beliefs, NRT beliefs, e-cigarette beliefs, and RNC cigarette beliefs). Nicotine beliefs relate specifically to its addictive nature, nicotine as a cause of cancer, and the role of nicotine in the health harms and cancer caused by smoking. The product-specific constructs (i.e., NRT, e-cigarette, RNC cigarette) include items related to the addictiveness of the product and the perceived health risks of the product compared to regular cigarettes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Manipulation Check (changes over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will ask participants to indicate whether the following statements are 1=true, 2=false or unsure (3= don't know): &quot;A tobacco product that says it has no additives is less harmful than a regular tobacco product (item 1), A tobacco product that says it is organic is less harmful than a regular tobacco product (item 2).&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Cigarette Consumption</measure>

    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess CO (measured in parts per million [ppm]), a measure of toxicant exposure, at the onset of each session, as well as before and after each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session. CO collected at the onset of each session represents daily exposure, while CO boost - the change in CO values before and after smoking a cigarette - estimates smoke exposure due to smoking an individual cigarette.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Nicotine Equivalents</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at Day 7 and Day 35 will be assessed for changes in total nicotine equivalents, nicotine plus its primary metabolites, across the experimental study period (Days 7-35). Total nicotine equivalents will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total NNAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at D7 and D35 will be assessed for changes in NNAL, a biomarker of carcinogen exposure, across the experimental study period (Days 7-35). Total NNAL will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Cigarette Ratings (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] of Cigarette Characteristics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide subjective ratings of each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session using a 14-item, 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) of cigarette characteristics. Anchors are item-specific (e.g., taste: 0 = &quot;very bad,&quot; 100 = &quot;very good&quot;), with lower scores indicating less favorable ratings.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nicotine Related Norms</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 14 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will ask participants &quot;How socially acceptable among peers do you think each of the following products (nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes, E-cigarettes/vapes, nicotine replacement products, hookah and low nicotine cigarettes) are?&quot; Participants will answer for each item on a scale from 1-5, where 1= not at all, and 5 = extremely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 14 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will ask: &quot;How confident are you that you could resist smoking a cigarette in situations where others are smoking?&quot; and for participants that have used tobacco products in the past 30 days, &quot;How confident are you that you can quit smoking cigarettes/using tobacco products totally and for good if and when you wanted to?&quot; Participants will answer for each item by selecting one of four possible answers (1 = Not at all confident, 2 = Somewhat confident, 3 = Moderately confident or 4 = Very confident). Additionally, for those who have used tobacco products in the past 30 days: &quot;How important is stopping tobacco use to you?&quot; &quot;How ready are you to quit using tobacco within the next month?&quot; and &quot;How confident are you that you will quit tobacco within the next month?&quot; Participants will indicate a response on a scale from 0-10 [0 (Not important at all) to 10 (Most important goal of my life), 0 (Not at all) to 10 (100% ready), &amp; 0 (Not at all) to 10 (100% confident).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Risk Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 21, and 35</time_frame>
    <description>To assess risk beliefs about the assigned cigarettes, the investigators will use an 8-item, 5-point scale (1 = definitely untrue; 5 = definitely true) including previously validated items (i.e., &quot;Compared to your own cigarettes, the cigarettes you are currently smoking: are lower in nicotine&quot;). The Cigarette Risk Beliefs questionnaire will be administered at Session 1 (D0) before the lab cigarette (18-item baseline version), Session 2 (D7) before lab cigarette 1 and 2, Session 4 (D21) before the lab cigarette, and Session 6 (D35) before the lab cigarette.</description>

    <description>Participants will report cigarette withdrawal at the onset of each in-person session. Withdrawal will be assessed using a summary score from the 20-item (21 items at Session 1 [Day 0]) revised version of the Withdrawal Symptom Checklist with a one-week frame of reference (WSC-W). Specifically, the participant will respond regarding to how the participant felt in regards to each potential withdrawal symptom along a 4-point scale (0=Not Present; 3=Severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Additional Topographic/Puffing Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be video recorded while smoking each lab cigarette in order to collect smoking topography data. The investigators have previously used a procedure where digital files of (video recorded) smoking sessions are scored that has good reliability and consistency (ICCs &gt;.55) for number of puffs taken, interpuff interval, total time lit, and amount smoked (by mass and length), and propose to quantify cigarette smoking behavior using the same procedures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stages of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will ask each participant to select the phrase related to smoking cigarettes that is best representative of the participant's experience: &quot;I smoke cigarettes now, and I have not thought about quitting, I currently smoke cigarettes but I'm considering quitting, I want to quit and I have begun to reduce the number of cigarettes that I smoke, I quit smoking cigarettes less than 6 months ago, I have not smoked cigarettes for more than 6 months, In recent years, I've stopped smoking cigarettes for more than 6 months but smoke occasionally, I quit smoking cigarettes several years ago, and I don't feel any desire to smoke again, I have never smoked cigarettes.&quot; Each participant will similarly select a phrase related to vaping nicotine or using e-cigarettes that is best representative of the participant's experience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Policy Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will ask each participant to select one of three policy statements on nicotine in cigarettes that the participant would support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Message Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure includes three items asking participants to rate the messages viewed. Participants will read the following statements and select an answer on a five point scale (1= Strongly disagree, 2= Disagree, 3= Neither agree nor disagree, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree): &quot;These messages discourage me from wanting to use nicotine,&quot; &quot;These messages make me concerned about the health effects of using nicotine,&quot; and &quot;These messages make nicotine seem unpleasant to me.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Message Credibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure will be completed by participants after viewing the messages on nicotine. The participant will indicate &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;disagree&quot; for each of the following statements about the messages viewed: &quot;A. Accurate, B. Authentic, C. Believable&quot; and will select an item on a scale from 1-7 for each (A, B, C) where 1= Strongly disagree, 4= Neither agree nor disagree and 7 = Strongly agree.</description>
