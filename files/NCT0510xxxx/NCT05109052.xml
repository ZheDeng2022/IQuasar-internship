      combination therapy Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. Phase 2 will assess the efficacy of this combination therapy in unresectable or&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary liver malignancies have doubled in incidence over the last two decades. These&#xD;
      malignancies are now the 4th leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide with a 19.6%&#xD;
      5-year relative survival. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% with&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) accounting for the remainder. Currently, just 20-30% are resectable&#xD;
      at presentation with many patients relying on systemic therapy. Beyond resection, effective&#xD;
      systemic therapies are lacking, thus new treatment regimens are of significant clinical need.&#xD;
      Recent phase III data with combination of Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (anti-VEGF) as first-line therapy in unresectable HCC demonstrated improved progression-free&#xD;
      and overall survival compared to Sorafenib, thus bringing immunotherapy to the forefront of&#xD;
      combating this disease. Despite this improvement, patients experience significantly more&#xD;
      adverse events with the addition of anti-VEGF therapy. This combination of Atezolizumab and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is an attractive immunotherapeutic backbone for pairing HCC therapy with means to&#xD;
      improve drug delivery and boost response in order to decrease anti-VEGF dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCC most often develops in the background of chronic inflammation from sustained liver&#xD;
      damage, hepatocyte cell death, and compensatory proliferation. During liver injury, hepatic&#xD;
      stellate cells (HSCs) transform from quiescent to activated cells, characterized by altered&#xD;
      matrix protease activity and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. ECM&#xD;
      deposition increases liver stiffness that leads to vascular resistance and hypoxia,&#xD;
      stimulating pro-angiogenic factors and subsequent angiogenesis. Secretion of growth factors&#xD;
      (TGF-β, PDGF, and FGF-2) by the ECM and tumor cells, attracts fibroblasts from neighboring&#xD;
      tissues and aids in transformation to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).[23] CAFs&#xD;
      interplay with the ECM, contributing to further desmoplasia and remodeling through secretion&#xD;
      of lysyl oxidases that catalyze collagen cross-linking. The accumulation of collagen&#xD;
      cross-links results in marked increase in stromal stiffening and interstitial fluid pressure&#xD;
      (IFP) reducing delivery of chemotherapy and immunotherapy Lysyl oxidases (LOX) are a family&#xD;
      of 5 secreted copper-dependent amine oxidases (LOX, LOXL1-4) that catalyze the cross-linking&#xD;
      of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. High LOX expression has been show to&#xD;
      correlate with poor prognosis across a variety of solid malignancies, including&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. This trial pairs PXS-5505 (pan-lysyl oxidase inhibitor) with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC. Phase 1b of&#xD;
      this study will be an open label safety and tolerability assessment of PXS-5505 (pan-lysyl&#xD;
      oxidase inhibitor) with a dose escalation design. The Phase 2 portion of the study will&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of combination PXS-5505 with Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab compared to&#xD;
      historical standard of care Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab.&#xD;
