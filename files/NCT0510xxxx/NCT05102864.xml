  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to examine whether non-invasive brain stimulation can&#xD;
      modulate dysfunctional brain dynamics underlying adolescent ADHD to subsequently improve&#xD;
      clinical symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Working memory (WM) is the foundational cognitive control process of holding information 'in&#xD;
      mind' to execute goal-directed behaviors. WM deficits are an established component of all&#xD;
      primary childhood psychiatric disorders, most notably ADHD. Despite being one of the&#xD;
      strongest predictors of poor clinical and functional outcomes in pediatric mental health,&#xD;
      there remains a dearth of available treatments for WM deficits. Non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation holds tremendous promise in transforming psychiatry, as it takes a &quot;brain-first&quot;&#xD;
      approach to treatment. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is the known structural&#xD;
      foundation of WM, and the interaction between slow and fast brain waves (i.e., &quot;theta-gamma&#xD;
      coupling [TGC]&quot;) is a neural, functional foundation of WM. Thus, the DLPFC and TGC are&#xD;
      potential brain-based targets for the modulation of WM with brain stimulation. Intermittent&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a novel paradigm that applies a three-minute dose of&#xD;
      stimulation to the DLPFC at an intensity that directly mimics TGC dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to utilize the experimental therapeutics approach to&#xD;
      investigate whether iTBS can lead to a lasting modulation of WM-related neural oscillations.&#xD;
      In a crossover, double-blind design, a sample of adolescents (13-17 years old) with ADHD and&#xD;
      WM deficits will complete a two-week course of active iTBS and a two-week course of sham iTBS&#xD;
      to their left DLPFC. The central hypothesis is that iTBS at the left DLPFC will modulate TGC&#xD;
      and subsequently improve WM abilities in adolescent WM deficits. Aim 1 will examine the&#xD;
      effect of iTBS on TGC (i.e., target engagement). Aim 2 will examine the relationship between&#xD;
      change in TGC and WM performance (i.e., target validation). The exploratory aim will identify&#xD;
      the neocortical circuitry underlying oscillatory modulation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Ability to provide assent and have parent provide parental permission&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. English fluency of the participant and the legal guardian/parent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 13-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parent rating on BRIEF-2 Working Memory: Greater than 1.0 SD above normative mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. IQ &gt; 80&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): predominantly&#xD;
             inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type, combined type, or&#xD;
             unspecified type. Diagnostic criteria will be confirmed with NICHQ Vanderbilt&#xD;
             Assessment Scales-Parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants are allowed to continue clinical ADHD treatments. However, changes to&#xD;

             will check on treatment stability at the start of each two-week phase with the&#xD;
             participant and parent, and document accordingly. Changes to treatment will be&#xD;
             reviewed by a physician and may result in study termination.&#xD;
