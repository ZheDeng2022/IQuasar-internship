      This study will enroll end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis with a&#xD;
      maturing arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for hemodialysis access. A study staff member will mark&#xD;
      with indelible ink on each participant's skin the three sites on the upper extremity where&#xD;
      the Eko CORE digital stethoscope will be used to take sound recordings. 9 recordings will be&#xD;
      taken (3 at each site) once per week during weekly dialysis treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis (HD) is conducted through a hemodialysis vascular access, such that the&#xD;
      patient's blood can be removed from the patient, circulated through the dialysis machine, and&#xD;
      then returned to the patient. HD vascular accesses may take the form of an arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula (AVF), an arteriovenous graft (AVG), or a temporary or permanent dialysis catheter.&#xD;
      Because of its low complication rate and good longevity (durability), the AVF is the&#xD;
      preferred access; current Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Improvement &quot;Fistula First&quot;&#xD;
      recommendations are that any patient with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25&#xD;
      mL/min should undergo AVF creation surgery in preparation for eventual HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage IV is chosen as the optimal time for AVF creation, even though the patient does not yet&#xD;
      need HD. This is because (1) it usually takes ~8 weeks to schedule a patient for AVF creation&#xD;
      surgery, (2) it takes another 12-16 weeks after creation for the AVF to &quot;mature&quot; and become&#xD;
      ready for use, and (3) as many as 60% of surgically created AVFs fail to mature at all.&#xD;
      Considering the time lag to maturation and the possible need to intervene on an access that&#xD;
      is failing to mature, a significant lead time is required to avoid encountering a patient in&#xD;
      stage V CKD who needs HD immediately and then has to resort to a tunneled dialysis catheter&#xD;
      with all its attendant risks of infection, thrombosis and central vein stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to actively monitor an AVF from the time of surgical creation with a device that&#xD;
      can predict whether that AVF will fail vs. mature, will empower patients and their physicians&#xD;
      to decide much earlier to intervene and put that AVF &quot;back on track&quot; to maturation. This&#xD;
      means that many more patients will be able to start HD when needed, using their AVF as a&#xD;
      dialysis access, and therefore reduce the use of tunneled dialysis catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of monitoring, however, requires frequent measurements in order to track&#xD;
      progression toward maturity. By training an AI/ML algorithm to analyze sound signals recorded&#xD;
      from the patient's nascent AVF, the algorithm can detect when an AVF is likely or not to&#xD;
      mature. If trained properly, it should be able to detect an &quot;unlikely to mature&quot; condition&#xD;
      very early after surgery, perhaps even within the first two weeks. This will prompt the&#xD;
      patient's physician to consider intervention on the AVF that would increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      maturation and increase the overall maturation rate. A digital, AI/ML-enabled stethoscope,&#xD;
      perhaps even used in the patient's home in the future, could easily facilitate that&#xD;
      monitoring requirement as well as transmit the relevant information to the patient's&#xD;
      physician so that timely intervention could be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eko CORE is an FDA-cleared and CE-marked electronic stethoscope. The CORE allows the&#xD;
      audio recording of lung, heart, and other body sounds. The CORE features 40x audio&#xD;
      amplification, ambient noise reduction, a 4000Hz sample rate, and 3 audio filters. The&#xD;
      de-identified auscultatory CORE sound recordings transmit wirelessly via Bluetooth to the&#xD;
      secure, HIPAA-compliant Eko application on a smartphone or tablet, which allows the user to&#xD;
      playback sound recordings, annotate notes on recorded audio, and save recordings. This data&#xD;
      is synced in real-time to a secure, HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS)&#xD;
      database server managed by Eko Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational, longitudinal, proof of concept study will be enrolling&#xD;
      patients at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Kidney Center. This study will enroll a&#xD;
      minimum of 25, maximum of 50, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the&#xD;
      hemodialysis unit (HDU) with maturing AVFs who are being dialysed through a tunneled dialysis&#xD;
      catheter (TDC). Recordings will be taken once per week during the patient's HD appointment.&#xD;
      Duration of the study will extend from the time of enrollment until one of the following&#xD;
      occurs first: (a) abandonment of the AVF, or (b) 2 weeks of measurement after documentation&#xD;
      of successful cannulation defined by 2-needle cannulation for 3 successive dialysis&#xD;
      treatments, or (c) 6 months of study participation. These datasets will be used to derive an&#xD;
      AI/ML model to predict the likelihood of a new AVF to mature or fail.&#xD;
