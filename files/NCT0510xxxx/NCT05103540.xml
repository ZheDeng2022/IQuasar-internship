      The research will use the Social Ecologic Model of behavior and WHO mhGAP framework to design&#xD;
      a comprehensive intervention across three levels (individual, interpersonal, and social) of&#xD;
      influence. The study will then pilot the intervention in 15 secondary schools through a&#xD;
      Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomized trial. After screening for eligibility and selecting&#xD;
      participating schools and individuals, investigators will randomize at the cluster level and&#xD;
      switch the groups from control to intervention arms at three months' intervals till the&#xD;
      research has moved all the clusters. The study will collect data at baseline, the switch&#xD;
      points, and the end of the study. The goal is to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness of a&#xD;
      comprehensive suicide behavior prevention intervention among in-school adolescents in&#xD;
      Nigeria. Another aim is to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation and the best&#xD;
      practices for scaling up the intervention. It is hypothesized that because our intervention&#xD;
      is based on the best contextual evidence and built on a sound theoretical model, it will&#xD;
      successfully mitigate suicide ideation. Also, the nature and efficiency of the stepped wedge&#xD;
      cluster randomized design will enhance the feasibility in the local context, characterized by&#xD;
      political, logistic, and ethical constraints.&#xD;

      The effect of comprehensive suicide behavior prevention intervention among in-school&#xD;
      adolescents Nigeria: a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a theory-based comprehensive&#xD;
      suicide behavior prevention intervention among in-school adolescents in the Ikenne local&#xD;
      government area (LGA) of Ogun State, Nigeria. The methodology of the study is a Stepped-wedge&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial of a suicide behavior intervention among fifteen secondary schools&#xD;
      in Nigeria. The study chose the stepped-wedge design because although the investigators&#xD;
      expect the intervention to reduce suicidal ideation, the feasibility of a full implementation&#xD;
      may be challenging due to political, logistical, and ethical constraints. The design fulfills&#xD;
      a secondary role of serving as a scientific tool to incorporate a fair method to determine&#xD;
      the order of intervention rollout under logistic impediments. The implementation of our&#xD;
      intervention is feasible only at the cluster level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trail among 15 secondary&#xD;
      schools over one year. The participating schools will cross in a one-way switch over from the&#xD;
      control to the intervention period. The sequence of switch over for the clusters will follow&#xD;
      a stratified randomization scheme. All the schools will receive the intervention by the end&#xD;
      of the study. All the groups will be recruited at the study onset and will act as control&#xD;
      until the point of randomization into the intervention group. To mitigate contamination, the&#xD;
      study will provide clear information on the purpose of the research to the participants. The&#xD;
      clusters will get the details of intervention at the point of switching into the experimental&#xD;
      group. The study will educate the intervention group against contamination. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the exposure of the control group to the intervention before&#xD;
      switching them. The study will report the level of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 15 secondary schools with a minimum of 100 enrolled students and do&#xD;
      not have an existing suicide behavior intervention program. The school boards need to approve&#xD;
      participation. Eligible students should be aged 10-19 years, give consent, and not have plans&#xD;
      of leaving the school in the next year. Parental/guardians' assent is also a prerequisite for&#xD;
      participation in the study. The study will not exclude non-participating students from the&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention. The study will randomly select, by balloting, Five (three&#xD;
      publicly and two privately-owned) schools in each of the three areas of the LGA. The&#xD;
      selection of students will follow a probability sampling method. Eligible schools will be&#xD;
      randomized into three sequences of five schools each, using a computer-generated stratified&#xD;
      randomized sampling scheme. The stratification, which will be according to the area and&#xD;
      ownership of the schools, will be supervised by the PIs. The nature of the experiment and&#xD;
      intervention makes blinding unrealistic. However, investigators will ensure the conduct of&#xD;
      the measurement of the study outcome objectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is a four-pronged comprehensive suicidal behavior prevention intervention in&#xD;
      schools. The prongs consist of evidence-based interventions that use the Social Ecological&#xD;
      Model (SEM). The SEM theorizes that there are multiple inter-related levels of influences on&#xD;
      human behavior, and a successful preventive program should address factors at each stratum.&#xD;
      The intervention addresses three levels; individual, interpersonal, and social. Firstly, the&#xD;
      research will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to design and obtain a commitment from&#xD;
      the schools to a suicidal behavior prevention policy and protocol document. Secondly, the&#xD;
      intervention will train staff and students on best practices to improve students'&#xD;
      connectedness thereby, creating a positive school environment. Thirdly, the study will&#xD;
      identify and train gatekeepers on the proper response to suicidal thoughts and other suicidal&#xD;
      behaviors; and serve as the link between the students and a school-linked mental health&#xD;
      specialist. The research will train the gatekeepers to use school-based screening tools.&#xD;
      Lastly, this research will educate all students on suicidal behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prong will create awareness, promote case-finding, and provide information about&#xD;
      available mental health resources. Also, the intervention will address the stereotypes that&#xD;
      promote stigma and improve the students' coping abilities. The entire intervention will&#xD;
      incorporate peer support and student involvement at all stages of planning and&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is suicidal ideation, as assessed by the Positive Inventory of the&#xD;
      Positive and negative Suicide Ideation (PANSI-PI). PANSI is a 14-item scale consisting of two&#xD;
      subscales, the 6-item positive scale (PANSI-PI) and the 8-item negative (PANSI-NSA). Higher&#xD;
      scores on PANSI-NSI scale and lower marks on PANSI-PI) symbolize the higher frequency of&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts. The secondary outcomes are grit, gratitude, and mental health status. The&#xD;
      study will use the gratitude questionnaire(GQ-6), the grit scales, and the General Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to assess gratitude, determination, and mental health status,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined using the Shiny CRT Calculator, a power and sample size tool&#xD;
      for cluster-randomized trials. The aim was to have three sequences with five clusters each,&#xD;
      assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.01 (0 to 0.02) and individual&#xD;
      autocorrelation of 0.08. The study desires a minimum statistical power of at least 90%,&#xD;
      considering a type I error of 5% and a 10% increase in the mean PANSI-PI score from 17.71&#xD;
      (_6:35) attributable to the intervention. Some allowance will be made for a school dropout&#xD;
      rate of 23.12%. The derived sample size was 30 per cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will analyze the data using Stata/SE 15.1 statistical software. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis is rooted in the principle of intention-to-treat and will use random effect mixed&#xD;
      modeling to address missing data while assuming that missingness is at random. The research&#xD;
      will use the linear mixed model for continuous outcomes and the generalized linear mixed&#xD;
      model for categorical outcomes and adjust for the possible confounding effects of&#xD;
      individual-level characteristics that our randomization did not capture. Also, the study will&#xD;
      adjust for age, sex, number of years in the school, ethnicity, and secular trends (the school&#xD;
      term), and will use multilevel analysis to adjust for cluster effect and the correlation&#xD;
      between repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of the research includes a suicidal behavior prevention policy and&#xD;
      protocol template for secondary schools in Nigeria and an effective suicide behavior&#xD;
      prevention program that is scalable for Ogun State, Nigeria.&#xD;
