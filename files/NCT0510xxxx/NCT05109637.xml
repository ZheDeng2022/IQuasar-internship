    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to explore the convergent validity of smartphone-based&#xD;
      Konectom DOAs against in-clinic standard assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the test-retest reliability of&#xD;
      smartphone-based Konectom Digital Outcome Assessments (DOAs); to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between Konectom upper limb DOAs and conventional upper limb assessments in clinical&#xD;
      environments; to determine the relationship between Konectom lower limb DOAs and status of&#xD;
      ambulation in clinical environments; to evaluate group differences in smartphone-based&#xD;
      Konectom DOAs [self-administered at home and in-clinic] between person with spinal muscular&#xD;
      atrophy (PwSMA) or person with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PwALS) and healthy subjects&#xD;
      (HS); to evaluate the variability of Konectom DOAs self-administered in everyday environment&#xD;
      in HS and PwSMA or PwALS; to compare Konectom DOAs between in-clinic supervised&#xD;
      administration versus self-assessments in everyday environment in HS, PwSMA and PwALS groups;&#xD;
      to evaluate the relationship of Konectom DOAs against patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in&#xD;
      PwSMA or PwALS and to evaluate the clinical safety of Konectom in PwSMA and PwALS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect. This outcome measure will assess the clinical safety of Konectom NMD in PwSMA and PwALS.</description>
