      This study aims to reduce morbidity and mortality among children and mitigate antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance using a novel clinical decision support algorithm, enhanced with point-of-care&#xD;
      technologies to help health workers in primary health care settings in Rwanda. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the tool provides opportunities to improve supervision and mentorship of health workers and&#xD;
      enhance syndromic disease surveillance and outbreak detection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children are a well-recognized vulnerable population that still suffers from a high rate of&#xD;
      acute infectious diseases and preventable deaths. This is especially true in fragile health&#xD;
      systems of Sub-Saharan Africa, where under-five mortality is 10 times higher than in&#xD;
      high-income countries. The management of sick children at the primary care level in these&#xD;
      environments remains of insufficient quality as front-line clinicians lack appropriate&#xD;
      diagnostics, supervision to improve their skills, and decision support tools. Clinically&#xD;
      validated point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are often not available, and practice&#xD;
      guidelines are quickly outdated by new evidence and changing epidemiology. When an epidemic&#xD;
      arises, these static, generic guidelines can even become deleterious if the event is not&#xD;
      detected on time and integrated into the recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of reliable guidance, health care workers (HCWs) tend to over-prescribe&#xD;
      antibiotics (Hopkins et al. 2017, Fink et al. 2019). Approximately 9 out of 10 children at&#xD;
      the primary care level in Tanzania receive an antibiotic, while only 1 in 10 needs one&#xD;
      (D'Acremont et al. 2014). Inappropriate antibiotic use disrupts the gut flora, favoring the&#xD;
      proliferation of pathogens and weakening a child's immune response (Benoun et al. 2016). It&#xD;
      is also a major driver of antibiotic resistance, which is estimated to be responsible for up&#xD;
      to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 (Holmes et al. 2016, Fink et al. 2019). Equally&#xD;
      important to antibiotic overuse, is its underuse. Missing a child in need of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment or providing a child with an inappropriate type or dosage of antibiotic puts them&#xD;
      at risk of preventable morbidity and death. The same occurs with antimalarials that are not&#xD;
      always prescribed to the children in need: those with a positive malaria test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misdiagnoses have consequences that reach beyond the patient. They increase re-attendance&#xD;
      rates, further congesting primary health facilities and accruing economic losses not only for&#xD;
      families but for the entire health system. Systematic errors in patient-level data&#xD;
      accumulate, and as they are aggregated to measure population-level indicators, they have the&#xD;
      potential to bias the statistics used to prioritize health interventions and, importantly,&#xD;
      identify epidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO has identified digital health interventions and predictive tools in primary care as&#xD;
      key accelerators in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3 of ensuring good health&#xD;
      and well-being for all. New simple and cheap technologies, such as mobile devices, coupled&#xD;
      with the advances in computing and data science, could help mitigate several of the&#xD;
      aforementioned challenges. The proposed digital intervention is a third-generation clinical&#xD;
      decision support algorithm (CDSA) intended to help HCWs at the primary care level manage&#xD;
      children with acute illnesses. The first two versions of the algorithm have undergone&#xD;
      rigorous evaluations in controlled research conditions as summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first-generation algorithm called ALMANACH was tested in Tanzania in 2010-2011, achieving&#xD;
      improved clinical cure (from 92% to 97%) and a decrease in antibiotic prescription (from 84%&#xD;
      to 15%) as compared to routine care (Shao et al. 2015A). ALMANACH also led to more consistent&#xD;
      clinical assessments without taking more time than a conventional consultation and was&#xD;
      perceived by clinicians as &quot;a powerful and useful&quot; tool (Shao et al. 2015B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second-generation algorithm called ePOCT was trialed in Tanzania in 2014-2016. In&#xD;
      addition to symptoms and signs, it made use of several POC tests to help detect children with&#xD;
      severe infections requiring hospital-based treatment (oximetry and hemoglobin level) and/or&#xD;
      children with serious bacterial infection (CRP). The use of ePOCT resulted in higher clinical&#xD;
      cure (98%) as compared to ALMANACH (96%) and routine care (95%). The algorithm also further&#xD;
      reduced antibiotic prescription to 11%, as compared to 30% with the use of ALMANACH and 95%&#xD;
      in routine care (Keitel et al. 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic algorithms can thus be successfully implemented to improve clinical guidance and&#xD;
      provide feedback to clinicians, as well as allow near-real-time analyses of data for M&amp;E of&#xD;
      health interventions, disease surveillance and outbreak detection. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to improve clinical diagnosis, decrease morbidity and mortality of children, and mitigate&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance using novel dynamic POC technologies that help front-line HCWs&#xD;
      manage sick patients, enhanced by smart disease surveillance and outbreak detection&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, this study seeks to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Improve the integrated management of children with an acute illness through the&#xD;
      provision of an electronic CDSA (ePOCT+) to clinicians working at primary care level;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Improve the accuracy of the clinical algorithm and adapt it to spatiotemporal&#xD;
      variations in epidemiology and resources, based on the data generated through the ePOCT+&#xD;
      tool, analyzed using machine learning and checked by clinical experts;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Enhance the health management information system for monitoring and evaluation&#xD;
      and conducting supportive supervision (increased number of meaningful indicators that are&#xD;
      reviewed and actioned regularly) in HFs using the clinical data generated by the ePOCT+ tool&#xD;
      and enhanced by additional data analysis and visualization dashboards;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Create a framework for the development and implementation of dynamic CDSA and&#xD;
      disease surveillance tools, for large-scale, sustainable, and clinically responsible use of&#xD;
      machine learning and data science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary intervention study will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: open-label two-arm parallel-group cluster non-randomized controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial implemented in a staggered/sequential manner in a total of 32 health facilities. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of ePOCT+ clinical decision support algorithm (CDSA) displayed on&#xD;
      tablets (medAL-reader), point-of-care tests and devices that are not part of routine care&#xD;
      (pulse oximeter, CRP rapid test, additional hemoglobin cuvettes), complementary training on&#xD;
      the tool, regular monitoring and mentorship/supervision visits by the study team and/or the&#xD;
      Douncil Health Management Team (DHMT). Mentorship and supervision will be enabled by a&#xD;
      complementary dashboard (medAL-monitor), used to visualize and monitor study-related&#xD;
      indicators. Due to the pragmatic nature of the study, the design is adaptive, in that changes&#xD;
      in the implementation across the three cluster studies may be made based on monitoring data&#xD;
      and feedback from the health facilities. These implementation changes (excluding significant&#xD;
      adaptations to algorithm content) will be thoroughly documented and accounted for in&#xD;
      comparing the effects across the three cluster studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: scale-up of the intervention to more health facilities and transformation into a&#xD;
      dynamic algorithm The ePOCT+ tool will be extended to the health facilities serving as&#xD;
      controls in Phase 1, as well as to additional neighboring facilities of the target area, to&#xD;
      reach a total of up to 40 facilities in Rwanda. In Phase 2, an adaptive study design will be&#xD;
      used to measure the same outcome indicators as in Phase 1. The medical content of the&#xD;
      algorithm will not be fixed anymore, but rather modifiable. Each potential modification will&#xD;
      first be evaluated by the Tanzanian clinical expert group for its clinical coherence, safety&#xD;
      and potential benefit and then applied to the retrospective data. If these analyses confirm&#xD;
      both a clinically relevant positive impact and estimate that there will be sufficient future&#xD;
      cases during the study period to detect this improvement, the change in the algorithm will be&#xD;
      tested in a randomized sub-study using the same study design as in Phase 1, except that&#xD;
      randomization will take place at patient level rather than health facility level. If the&#xD;
      positive impact is confirmed in the sub-study, the modification will be implemented in all&#xD;
      relevant locations/patient sub-groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cross-sectional mixed-methods operational research studies will take place&#xD;
      throughout the intervention period to study the implementation context, facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers to the scale-up of this intervention and its integration into the primary health&#xD;
      system of Rwanda.&#xD;
