    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multicomponent implementation&#xD;
      strategy entitled the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach for mental health (SAIA-M)&#xD;
      using a cluster randomized trial at the health facility level. SAIA-MH focuses on improving&#xD;
      the mental health treatment cascade in primary outpatient mental healthcare. The mental&#xD;
      health treatment cascade is a model that outlines the sequential, linked treatment steps that&#xD;
      people with mental illness must navigate, from initial diagnosis to symptom/function&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess the potential mechanisms by which the SAIA-MH implementation&#xD;
      strategy works, or does not work, along with the cost and effectiveness of scaling-up SAIA-MH&#xD;
      in Mozambique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to a shortage of 1.2 million mental health (MH) workers across low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries (LMICs), academic and policy leaders have advocated scaling-up task-sharing to&#xD;
      lower-level providers to close the mental health care gap, which exceeds 90% in many LMICs.&#xD;
      While task-sharing may increase access to care, limited attention has been paid to quality of&#xD;
      care provided by lower-level providers. Task-shared outpatient management of mental health in&#xD;
      Mozambique has shown low rates of retention in care (40%), medication adherence (&lt;15%), and&#xD;
      proportion of patients achieving function improvement (&lt;5%). Similarly high rates of&#xD;
      loss-to-follow-up, poor adherence, and poor patient outcomes have been reported across other&#xD;
      LMICs. To our knowledge, there are no evidence-based implementation strategies targeting&#xD;
      optimization of the MH treatment cascade in low-resource settings. This is an urgent need for&#xD;
      the field of MH care delivery globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MH treatment cascade is a model that outlines the sequential, linked treatment steps that&#xD;
      people with mental illness must navigate, from initial diagnosis to symptom/function&#xD;
      improvement. Quality problems in one step of a treatment cascade can have non-linear and&#xD;
      compounding impacts across the larger complex care system. Implementation strategies focused&#xD;
      on only one step in a cascade can potentially contribute to unintended system bottlenecks and&#xD;
      quality of care issues. By contrast, the &quot;Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA)&quot;&#xD;
      is a multicomponent implementation strategy focused on optimizing an entire treatment&#xD;
      cascade. SAIA blends facilitation, enhanced local clinical consultation, and the creation of&#xD;
      facility-level learning collaboratives with systems-engineering tools in a 5-step approach&#xD;
      specifically developed for task-shared providers, which include: (1) cascade analysis to&#xD;
      visualize treatment cascade drop-offs and prioritize areas for system improvements; (2)&#xD;
      process mapping to identify modifiable facility-level bottlenecks; (3) identification and&#xD;
      implementation of modifications to improve system performance; (4) assessment of modification&#xD;
      effects on the cascade; and (5) repeated analysis and improvement cycles. A previous cluster&#xD;
      RCT established effectiveness of SAIA for HIV treatment cascade improvement (R01HD075057; PI:&#xD;
      Sherr). However, no effectiveness data exist on SAIA applied to other complex treatment&#xD;
      cascades - such as task-shared MH care. Preliminary data suggest that applying SAIA to MH&#xD;
      treatment cascade optimization (SAIA-MH; R21MH113691; PI: Wagenaar) is feasible, acceptable,&#xD;
      and can result in clinically-significant treatment cascade improvements; Five months of&#xD;
      SAIA-MH implementation resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in medication adherence (aOR: 1.5; CI:&#xD;
      1.2, 1.9) and a 3.7-fold increase in function improvement (aOR: 3.7; CI: 2.5, 5.4). These&#xD;
      data suggest that SAIA-MH is a promising strategy for task-shared MH systems improvement&#xD;
      globally. Our specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of the SAIA-MH strategy using a pragmatic cluster RCT&#xD;
      design and assess determinants of implementation success. The investigators will implement&#xD;
      SAIA-MH using a 3-year parallel cluster RCT across 8 intervention and 8 attentional control&#xD;
      facilities and evaluate effects on mental health function improvement (primary) and retention&#xD;
      / medication adherence (secondary). Two years of study implementation will be followed by a&#xD;
      1-year maintenance phase to examine routine fidelity and sustainability. The Consolidated&#xD;
      Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to assess determinants of&#xD;
      implementation success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1: Test causal pathway models to analyze mechanisms of action for effects (or&#xD;
      non-effects) of the SAIA-MH implementation strategy. Using 3-years of monthly data on&#xD;
      strategy-mechanism linkages, moderators, preconditions, and outcomes for the full 8&#xD;
      intervention and 8 attentional control facilities, the investigators will examine causal&#xD;
      pathway effect estimates using longitudinal structural equation modeling. Qualitative CFIR&#xD;
      data from Primary Aim 1 will contextualize quantitative path analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling-up SAIA-MH in Mozambique.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct micro-costing and time-and-motion observation of the SAIA-MH&#xD;
      RCT to estimate costs of implementing the intervention. The investigators will construct a&#xD;
      Markov model parameterized with cost and outcome data from the SAIA-MH RCT to project budget&#xD;
      impact and cost-effectiveness for SAIA-MH scale-up to provincial and national levels.&#xD;
