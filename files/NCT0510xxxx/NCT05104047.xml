    <textblock>
      Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSP) is a chronic, debilitating painful condition&#xD;
      affecting quality of life in persons living with Type 2 diabetes. Treatments prescribed to&#xD;
      manage DSP pain, such as nonnarcotic and narcotic analgesics, antidepressants and&#xD;
      anticonvulsants, are largely ineffective. This is a preliminary study at assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility, efficiency and preliminary efficacy of a novel non-pharmacologic pain management&#xD;
      approach, moxibustion, to reduce DSP pain and improve quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSP) is a chronic, debilitating painful condition&#xD;
      affecting quality of life in persons with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). According to the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 29 million Americans are living with T2DM. Treatments&#xD;
      prescribed to manage DSP pain, such as nonnarcotic and narcotic analgesics, antidepressants&#xD;
      and anticonvulsants, are largely ineffective. Effective management of DSP pain is an unmet&#xD;
      therapeutic need for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of Moxibustion (Moxa) for persons with T2DM DSP lower limb&#xD;
      pain/discomfort. Participants with lower limb DSP pain/discomfort are randomized to one of&#xD;
      four Conditions: 1) Traditional Moxa, 2) Smokeless Moxa 3) Placebo Moxa (control), or 4)&#xD;
      WaitList (control). Participation involves a preliminary phone screening, provider&#xD;
      verification of medical condition, intake baseline session, neurologicial evaluations,&#xD;
      treatment sessions and follow ups. Participants assigned to the moxibustion conditions will&#xD;
      be blind to treatment assignment, attend a screening session, followed by twice-weekly&#xD;
      treatment sessions for 3 weeks, complete the same instruments and submit prospective symptom&#xD;
      diaries (SD). Subjects randomized to the WaitList control condition experience all aspects of&#xD;
      study participation with the exception of receiving moxibustion (during the study). They&#xD;
      undergo all screening and eligibility assessments; attend study visits; submit and review&#xD;
      their symptom diaries, update concomitant medication, complete assessment instruments;&#xD;
      receive neuro/NST assessments and compensation. In all respects, participants in the Control&#xD;
      groups receive the same concern as subjects assigned to the other groups. All moxibustion&#xD;
      interventions will be implemented by licensed acupuncturists.&#xD;

    <description>The GPS is a Likert magnitude-estimation log-scale of sensory pain. Subjects rate their DSP pain by selecting one of 13 words to describe their average and worst DSP pain.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline rating of pain intensity after 3 wks of twice-wkly treatment sessions (the end of the treatment phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness scale measures global severity of symptoms [in the context of peripheral neuropathy]. The patient rates discomfort from peripheral neuropathy on a scale of 0= No discomfort to 6= Very severe discomfort. The global improvement component measures the level of change from initial severity: 0= No improvement at all to 6= Great improvement</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Sensory Testing (NST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline neurological physical assessment after 3 wks of twice-wkly treatment sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological assessments with Neuro Sensory Testing (NST) include: muscle strength and reflexes and sensory testing for lower limb vibration, pain and thermal sensation. Standard neurological assessment: muscle strength 0-5; reflexes 0-5; pain- intact, reduced, absent, hyperalgesia; vibration - intact, impaired; thermal - intact, reduced absent. The neuro/NST also serves to monitor for clinical safety and findings</description>
