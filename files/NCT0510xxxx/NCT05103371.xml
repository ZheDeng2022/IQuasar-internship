  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cluster-Randomized Clinical trial, which includes the development and activation of an&#xD;
      intervention program among young adolescents and their parents. Study hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      intervention program will yield improvement in adolescents whose parents participated in the&#xD;
      program, in comparison with the adolescents whose parents weren't involved in the&#xD;
      intervention. Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the&#xD;
      participants before, after, and three months after the completion of the program. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board. Parents of all&#xD;
      participants, in the intervention and in the control group, received information about the&#xD;
      program and the study and were asked to provide informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early adolescence (10-13 years) is characterized by hormonal changes and accelerated&#xD;
      physiological growth. Significant risk factors for the physical and mental health of children&#xD;
      and adolescents include, among others, harmful physical activity, self-esteem and low&#xD;
      self-esteem, and negative body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Milli - a special shield for daily resilience&quot; is a preventive intervention program. The&#xD;
      main goal of the program is to raise adolescents' self-confidence and prevent negative&#xD;
      self-image and body image as well as develop media literacy. In this study, the researchers&#xD;
      will focus on the &quot;Young Millie&quot; program, designed for ages 10-12, fifth and sixth grades,&#xD;
      and its core is the development of self-care. To increase the impact of the program on&#xD;
      adolescents, the researchers developed a program that will be delivered to parents via a&#xD;
      their adolescent children, as the 'agents of change'. Adloescents in the parent-component&#xD;
      group will be given assignments to complete together with their parents at home, in coherence&#xD;
      with the subject discussed in the weekly session of the school-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will first evaluate the influence of parents on the program, and then evaluate the&#xD;
      difference in adolescent outcomes from the program with or without this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the adolescents&#xD;
      before, after, and three months after the completion of the program. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities. Parents will fill out a&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire before and after the program. The study protocol was approved by&#xD;
      Tel Hai College institutional review board. Parents of all participants, in the intervention&#xD;
      and in the control group, received information about the program and the study and were asked&#xD;
      to provide informed consent.&#xD;

    <description>The Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (Schaefer et al., 2015). The investigators included the Media subscale, including 4 items. Items are rated on a 5-point scale: (1) always, (2) often, (3) sometimes, (4) rarely, (5) never. The total score is based on computing the average. A higher score indicates higher pressure from the media to change one's look.</description>

    <description>The Advertising scale contains 1 item- Identification of strategies used by media. This question is reflected as a protective factor. It contains 8 different strategies which participants choose from: higher number of strategies identified indicate better media literacy. (Golan et al., 2013).</description>
