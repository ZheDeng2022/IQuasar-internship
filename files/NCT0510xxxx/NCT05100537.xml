      Purpose: This research was planned to determine the effect of mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction program on reducing the stress level and emotion regulation of nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The research was planned as a pretest, posttest, follow-up and randomized controlled&#xD;
      study in order to determine the effect of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program on&#xD;
      the stress level and emotion regulation of nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: H1: The perceived stress level scores of nursing students in the intervention&#xD;
      group participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction program will decrease compared&#xD;
      to the nursing students in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: The perceived stress level of the nursing students in the intervention group&#xD;
      participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction program will decrease according to&#xD;
      their pretest scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Emotion regulation strategies of nursing students in the intervention group participating&#xD;
      in the mindfulness-based stress reduction program will differ from the nursing students in&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: The posttest and follow-up emotion regulation strategies of nursing students in the&#xD;
      intervention group participating in the mindfulness-based stress reduction program will&#xD;
      differ from the pretest.&#xD;

The total score from the scale indicates the stress level of the person. A score between 11-26 indicates a low stress level, a score between 27-41 indicates a medium stress level, and a score between 42-56 indicates a high stress level.</description>
