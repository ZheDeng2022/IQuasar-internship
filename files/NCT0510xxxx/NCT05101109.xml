    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose,&#xD;
      dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ABL501 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, MTD&#xD;
      and/or RP2D, PK, immunogenicity, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and the PD effect of ABL501&#xD;
      in subjects with any progressive locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
      This study included 2 parts; a dose-escalation part and a dose expansion part.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects has received prior anticancer monoclonal antibody treatment or&#xD;

             who has recovered (i.e., =&lt;Grade 1 or at baseline grade) from AEs due to previously&#xD;
             administered agent more than 14 days prior to ABL501 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks or targeted&#xD;
             small molecule therapy within 5 half-lives prior to the first administration of study&#xD;
             drug or has not recovered (i.e., =&lt;Grade 1 or at baseline grade) from AEs due to&#xD;
             previously administered agent more than 14 days prior to ABL501 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to any intolerable&#xD;
             immune-related AE(s) (irAEs) requiring systemic steroid treatment.&#xD;
