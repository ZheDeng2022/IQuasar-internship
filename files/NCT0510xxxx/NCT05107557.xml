      This study is a randomized and controlled phase IV clinical trial in children aged 3-5 years&#xD;
      old. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine (Vero cell), Inactivated co-administration with EV71 vaccine.The COVID-19 vaccine was&#xD;
      manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd and the EV71 vaccine was manufactured&#xD;
      by Sinovac Biotech Co.A total of 520 subjects aged 3-5 years old will be enrolled.Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into 2 groups in a ratio of 1:1.The experimental group is the&#xD;
      combined immunization group, which will receive the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and the&#xD;
      first dose of EV71 vaccine on day 0 and the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and EV71 vaccine&#xD;
      on day 28;Control group is the Non-combined immunization group , which will receive the first&#xD;
      dose of COVID-19 vaccine on day 0 ,the first dose of EV71 vaccine on day 14, the second dose&#xD;
      of COVID-19 vaccine on day 28 and the second dose of EV71 vaccine on day 42.&#xD;
