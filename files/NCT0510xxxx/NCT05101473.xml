  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate a 12-week exercise intervention in people&#xD;
      with an active diabetic foot ulcer through pre-defined research progression criteria&#xD;
      (participant recruitment and retention, duration of the collection of outcome measures,&#xD;
      adherence to the exercise programme, and adverse events), besides participant and&#xD;
      physiotherapist feedback, self-reported outcomes and objective measurements in preparation&#xD;
      for a potential future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that exercise therapy for people with an active diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcer will have high participant recruitment and adherence to treatment and that it does not&#xD;
      affect wound healing negatively.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>will be analysed by dividing number of included participants (n = 15) by the number of months it took to include them (calculated from study start until the 15th participant is recruited).</description>

    <measure>Exercise adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12-week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>will be evaluated using exercise logs completed at each session by the physiotherapist covering load and intensity. Adherence will be calculated by counting number of exercise sessions completed in the exercise log, divided by 24 planned sessions, presented in percentage.</description>

    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12-week follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed based on observed and patient-reported adverse events, and their relatedness to the index ulcer and to the exercise program.&#xD;
Minor adverse events will cover muscle soreness or post-exercise fatigue. Whereas serious adverse events will cover all negative events related to the foot ulcer, and cover life- threatening events, disability, or permanent damage</description>

    <description>Ulcer size measurement is assessed on digital images with standardized measuring tape from participants last to the outpatient clinic visit prior to baseline and from participants last to the outpatient clinic visit to last day of follow-up. The measurement is a standard measurement in the outpatient clinic at every participant visit</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to fill out the the Wound-QoL questionnaires in paper form at baseline and at the last day of follow-up&#xD;
The Wound-QoL consists of 17 items that can be combined into three individual multi-item domains: Body, Psyche and Everyday life as well as a single-item domain on Economy</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to fill out the Danish versions of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) EQ-5D-5L in paper form at baseline and at the last day of follow-up.&#xD;
The EQ-5D- 3L includes the European Quality of life visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) where the patient's own health 'today' is rated between 0 (worst imaginable health) and 100 (best imaginable health)</description>
