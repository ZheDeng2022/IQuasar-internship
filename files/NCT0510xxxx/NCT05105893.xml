      EFFECT OF DATE FRUIT CONSUMPTION IN LATER PREGNANCY ON LENGTH OF GESTATION LABOR AND DELIVERY&#xD;
      OF NULLIPAROUS WOMEN&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Gynecology and Obstetrics department&#xD;
      of Pak Emirates Military Hospital for Six months duration from Jan 2021 to June 2021. Ethical&#xD;
      consent for the study was taken from the Ethical Committee. All participants have signed the&#xD;
      written consent. Healthy primigravida's at more than 37 weeks of gestation with no prenatal&#xD;
      complications (low-risk pregnancies) or chronic diseases were invited to contribute in the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria of exclusion included all primigravida and non-primigravida with prenatal&#xD;
      problems. Prenatal complications included placenta praevia, rupture of membranes, multiple&#xD;
      pregnancies, diabetes, hypertension and additional health problems, fetal abnormalities,&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction or any contraindication to delivery by vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The females who met the eligibility criteria were contacted and provided information related&#xD;
      to the analysis. In the preliminary phase of contact with potential volunteers, the study was&#xD;
      presented as a participant's usage of dates to expedite delivery. The randomization&#xD;
      arrangement was performed by means of sealed envelopes numbered from 1 to 10, equally&#xD;
      allocated by randomization to the date-consumers and the group of control. Therefore, they&#xD;
      will be allocated to dates consumer or control group recipients.&#xD;
