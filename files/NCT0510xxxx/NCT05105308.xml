  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a disorder that affects toddlers,&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and adults. Individuals with ARFID are not able to consume an adequate&#xD;
      amount or variety of food to a degree that it affects their mental and/or physical health.&#xD;
      ARFID often begins in early childhood so it is important to treat children in early in life&#xD;
      as possible to prevent any negative consequences of poor nutrition. There are currently no&#xD;
      treatments for young children with ARFID. The investigators have developed two different&#xD;
      study programs and the purpose of this study is to test them out and see if they help&#xD;
      children with ARFID and to learn more about how these study programs work.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The design is a two-group (n=70 per group) randomized controlled trial. Primary outcomes including ARFID symptoms and secondary outcomes (e.g., responder status of weight gain) will be assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up, while abbreviated measures will be assessed every session.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in the number of clinically severe symptoms of Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) as measured by the PARDI (Pica, ARFID, and Rumination Diagnostic Interview)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Treatment (up to 30 weeks), 3-Months Post-Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The 17-item PARDI measures symptoms including body mass index, diet quality, dependence on supplement use for sufficient calories, and psychosocial impairment. Each item assesses a symptom on a 0 - 6 scale, with scores above 4 indicating that it is a clinically severe symptom.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutrition Quantity as measured by 3-day 24-hour dietary recalls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Nutrition Quantity is measured by two weekdays and one weekend day assisted dietary recall with the parent of the child. Using the Harris-Benedict equation to determine a child's nutritional needs, the following will be measured: 1) Child unable to meet daily energy requirements without supplement and/or 2) Child's dietary intake is below energy needs on all 3 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Psychosocial functioning is measured by items on the PARDI indicating that the child does not avoid social events due to eating/food and less than or equal to 1 indicating that the child is able to remain at the table and demonstrate age-appropriate behaviors.</description>

    <description>This is a 20-session intervention with a child and the child's parents that consists of 4 components: 1) psychoeducation of somatic body sensations and sensory features of foods using playful characters (e.g., Aftertaste Anthony); 2) in-session exercises that expose family members to different body and food sensations so they can learn something new about their body and food; 3) body brainstorm worksheets that help them generalize what they learn in session to outside of treatment; and 4) Decision-tree practice worksheets that help them map body sensations to meanings and actions and to track explorations with food.</description>
