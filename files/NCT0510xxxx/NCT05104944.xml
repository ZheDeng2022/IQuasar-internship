  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the use of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an&#xD;
      attempt to reduce the duration of immobilisation of the foot and thereby reduce the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with its routine management and reduce costs. The project will have two&#xD;
      components: a feasibility study and embedded within this a qualitative study of the patient's&#xD;
      perspective of the experience of being diagnosed with Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) and&#xD;
      undergoing treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of using serial magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) to reduce treatment times in Charcot in people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charcot is a devastating complication for people who develop it. There are over 4000 new&#xD;
      cases of Charcot diagnosed every year. If the inflammation goes on for long enough it can&#xD;
      cause fractures and dislocations within the foot, which left untreated can lead to foot&#xD;
      deformity and complications such as ulcerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of Charcot has been shown to reduce people's quality of life. People who have had&#xD;
      this condition die on average 14years younger than the general population. Every year about&#xD;
      50-100 people who have been diagnosed with Charcot neuroarthropathy undergo an amputation of&#xD;
      their leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charcot is treated by wearing a non-removable cast or boot. No-one knows how long this&#xD;
      treatment should last, some recommend 6 months, others more than a year. Early treatment has&#xD;
      been shown to lead to fewer complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some information from small studies that repeated assessment with MRI may prove&#xD;
      useful in helping clinicians decide when to stop treatment, and it may decrease treatment&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a feasibility study involving 60 people. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      hospital run Diabetic Foot Clinics. Patients will be randomised to either receive MRI at&#xD;
      baseline 3,6,9 and 12 months or to receive current usual care; repeated foot temperature&#xD;
      measurements and x-rays. If the study results indicate the study is feasible to do, the&#xD;
      information will be used to design a much larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients will also be asked to participate in an interview at the end of the study, to&#xD;
      gain insights into their experience of having Charcot and involvement in the study.&#xD;

In the intervention arm participants will receive additional MRIs at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Patients randomised to serial MRI will not undergo further MRI once remission has been diagnosed i.e. if remission is diagnosed at 6 months the MRI at 9 and 12 months will not occur.</description>

    <description>Immobilisation discontinued on the basis of clinical remission determined by skin temperature measurement and MRI. In the standard care arm participants will receive one additional MRI when the temperature measurements, X-ray and/or signs and symptoms indicate to the clinical team that the foot is in remission. A temperature difference of ≤ 2ºC which is maintained or improves on two separate consecutive occasions for a period of ≥4weeks will be the indicator to arrange the second MRI, to confirm the diagnosis of remission. If participants in either arm of the trial have not reached remission at the end of the 12 month active phase of the study they will exit the study. Ongoing standard care will be provided by their clinical team.</description>
