  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-coated balloon (DCB), as an implant-free treatment technique, has been widely used in&#xD;
      coronary interventional therapy, effectively solving the problem of restenosis caused by&#xD;
      traditional stent implantation, and providing a treatment option for patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease with high blood risk. However, in DCB treatment of coronary artery lesions, the&#xD;
      incidence of dissection is as high as 10-20% when the balloon is predilated, which often&#xD;
      requires salvage stent implantation, resulting in the treatment failure of DCB and bringing&#xD;
      great hidden dangers to patients. The main reason was that excessive balloon predilation was&#xD;
      caused by the standard of vascular anatomy (residual lumen stenosis less than 30%). The&#xD;
      resting full cycle ratio (RFR) is a reliable method for determining the presence of&#xD;
      functional ischemia in coronary artery lesions and enables immediate detection. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that RFR-guided stepped-balloon dilation could reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      dissection and increase the success rate of DCB treatment. Fifty patients who planned to&#xD;
      receive DCB treatment were randomly divided into balloon dilation alone (n=25) and RFR-guided&#xD;
      stepped-balloon dilation group (n=25). The primary endpoint was the success rate of DCB&#xD;
      treatment. This study will provide a functional evaluation based balloon predilation method&#xD;
      for DCB treatment, making DCB treatment for orthotopic coronary artery disease more safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the application of pre-treated lesions with DCB in the treatment of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in situ between the simple balloon dilation group and rFR-guided&#xD;
      stepped-balloon dilation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a single-center, open, prospective, randomized controlled study. Fifty patients with&#xD;
      symptoms of myocardial ischemia or relevant evidence for DCB treatment of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease in situ were enrolled and randomly divided into balloon dilation group alone (n=25)&#xD;
      and rFR-guided step balloon dilation group (n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the balloon dilation group, the optimal size of the semi-compliant balloon was determined&#xD;
      by the surgeon according to angiography (the ratio of balloon to blood vessel was 1.0), and&#xD;
      full predilation was performed to achieve residual stenosis. 30% vascular anatomy criteria,&#xD;
      and then a 1:1 DCB was selected for drug release; The step balloon expansion group guided by&#xD;
      RFR expanded from 2.0mm compliant balloon. After 8atm pressure expansion, the RFR value was&#xD;
      measured. If RFR≥0.93, the pre-expansion was stopped. 0.93, RFR value is measured after&#xD;
      pressure expansion of 16atm, if RFR&amp;lt is still; 0.93, then a 2.5mm compliant or&#xD;
      non-compliant balloon was used to expand the pressure of 8ATM, and the balloon diameter and&#xD;
      expansion pressure were continuously increased until RFR≥0.93, and then A DCB with the same&#xD;
      diameter as the pre-expanded balloon was selected for drug release. If c-type or higher&#xD;
      dissection or TIMI flow occurs &amp; LT; Grade 3 patients were given salvage stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect patient history and improve clinical examination; The occurrence and classification&#xD;
      of dissection, final pre-dilated balloon diameter, DCB diameter, incidence of salvage stent&#xD;
      implantation, residual stenosis, operation time, and radiation dose were recorded&#xD;
      intraoperatively. The incidence of revascularization and angina pectoris during&#xD;
      hospitalization were recorded. Minimum lumen diameter and diameter stenosis rate were&#xD;
      detected by coronary angiography 9 months after discharge. MACE events were observed 12&#xD;
      months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With residual lumens stenosis less than 30% as the criteria the pure balloon pre expansion of&#xD;
      coronary artery lesions in situ can result in up to 10-40% of the incidence of retrospective&#xD;
      stenting, limits the DCB in coronary artery lesions in situ treatment, the application of&#xD;
      quasi simple balloon expansion and pathological changes of RFR guiding ladder balloon&#xD;
      expansion of pretreatment in the DCB treatment of coronary artery lesions, the application of&#xD;
      in situ To verify that rFR-guided stepped-balloon dilation compared with balloon dilation&#xD;
      alone can increase the success rate of DCB in the treatment of orthotopic coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions, thus providing a new pre-dilation treatment method for DCB to be more effective and&#xD;
      safe in the application of orthotopic coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
