      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of treadmill training combined with&#xD;
      ankle weights on balance in spastic cerebral palsied children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy defined as a non-progressive, non-hereditary lesion of the cerebral cortex&#xD;
      resulting in postural and motion disturbances. Spastic cerebral palsied children have&#xD;
      deficits in the selection of appropriate sensory inputs for postural control. Balance is a&#xD;
      complex motor skill often referred to as postural control which is the ability to maintain&#xD;
      equilibrium in a gravitational field by keeping or returning the center of body mass over the&#xD;
      base of support. Treadmill gait training supporting the body weight which simulates walking&#xD;
      on flat land is prescribed in rehabilitation of spastic cerebral palsy to improve their&#xD;
      balance or to reduce their gait disturbance. Several studies support the use of ankle weights&#xD;
      during treadmill gait training to reinforce muscle strength and, improve the symmetry of gait&#xD;
      while, there is no research conducted on balance in spastic cerebral palsied children. Hence,&#xD;
      there is need to study the effect of treadmill training combined with ankle weights on&#xD;
      balance in spastic cerebral palsied children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourty children with spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsied children (based on power analysis)&#xD;
      from both sexes (6-9 years) will be recruited from different private pediatric physical&#xD;
      therapy clinics. They will be divided randomly into control group (20 children) and study&#xD;
      group (20 children). Control group will be participated in designed physical therapy program&#xD;
      in addition to gait training on treadmill with full weight bearing without using of ankle&#xD;
      weights. Study group will be participated in the same designed physical therapy program&#xD;
      received by the control group in addition to gait training on treadmill with ankle weights on&#xD;
      the affected side ankle.&#xD;
