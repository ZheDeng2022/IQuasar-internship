  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the clinical performance of AuraGain&#xD;
      including insertion time and success rate at first attempt, fiberoptic bronchoscopic view,&#xD;
      oropharyngeal leak pressure, the degree of ease of gastric tube insertion, and peri-operative&#xD;
      adverse effects in young children in supine, moderate lateral and extreme lateral position.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ambu® AuraGain, a relatively novel supraglottic airway device, has been introduced recently.&#xD;
      AuraGain has an inflatable cuff and a curved body. In addition, because the airway tube of&#xD;
      AuraGain is wide, it can be used as a conduit for tracheal intubation. However, only a&#xD;
      limited number of studies have been conducted on the performance of AuraGain in pediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the position of the head and neck alter the shape of the pharynx leading to&#xD;
      changes in the oropharyngeal leak pressure and the quality of ventilation through the LMA in&#xD;
      both the adult and pediatric population. Having a large occiput and a relatively cephalically&#xD;
      placed glottis, the ventilation in children is more compromised due to poor alignment of the&#xD;
      pharyngeal-laryngeal axes during flexion of the head and neck. Their hanging epiglottis&#xD;
      covers the laryngeal inlet during flexion and the cuff of the LMA compresses the narrow&#xD;
      laryngeal inlet both decreasing the delivered tidal volume. Different changes occur during&#xD;
      extension and lateral rotation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the clinical performance of the AuraGain would be expected to be high, or at least&#xD;
      non-inferior, to that of the widely used currently available SGAs, clinical trials are&#xD;
      required to verify its performance in head and neck positions other than the neutral position&#xD;
      (i.e flexion, extension and lateral rotation).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oropharyngeal leak pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative from 1 minute after insertion of the device as a baseline to 60 minutes after insertion of the device</time_frame>
    <description>Airway leak pressure will be determined by closing the adjustable expiratory pressure-limiting (APL) valve and setting the fresh gas flow rate to 3 L/min. The airway pressure at which an audible leak in the mouth is heard is recorded as the &quot;leak Pressure&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Ventilation score (grade 0, 1, 2 or 3),</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative from 1 minute after insertion of the device as baseline to 60 minutes after insertion of the device</time_frame>
    <description>the ventilation score which is scored from 0 to 3 based on three criteria: no leakage with an airway pressure of 15 cm H2O, bilateral chest excursions with a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cm of H2O, and a square wave capnogram, with each item scoring 0 or 1 point . Thus, if all three criteria are satisfied, the ventilation score is 3.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fiberoptic glottic view Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative from 1 minute after insertion of the device to 60 minutes after insertion of the device.</time_frame>
    <description>The fiberoptic images will be graded with a score from 1 to 5, which has been defined and proposed previously (20, 21); (grade 1-only larynx seen; grade 2-larynx and epiglottis posterior surface seen; grade 3-larynx and epiglottis tip of anterior surface seen, &lt;50%visual obstruction of epiglottis to larynx; grade 4-epiglottis down folded and its anterior surface seen, &gt;50%visual obstruction of epiglottis to larynx; and grade 5-epiglottis down folded and larynx cannot be seen directly). The images will be taken in the neutral position and in mid and extreme laterally rotated neck positions.</description>
