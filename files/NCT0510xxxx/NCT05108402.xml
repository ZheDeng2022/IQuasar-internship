  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous large-scale epidemiological studies have made it possible to establish a link&#xD;
      between the average consumption of table salt (sodium chloride) and blood pressure figures.&#xD;
      In France, according to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp;&#xD;
      Safety (ANSES), salt intakes could be estimated from 2 national food consumption surveys INCA&#xD;
      1 and INCA 2. This made it possible to take a photograph of food consumption habits and to&#xD;
      show that the average consumption of salt contained in food in France is 8.7g/day for men and&#xD;
      6.7g/day for women. To these contributions must also be added 1 to 2g of salt for the&#xD;
      resalting and the cooking water. According to the food consumption survey INCA 3, french&#xD;
      plate still contains a large part of processed foods and still a little too much salt (on&#xD;
      average 9g/day for men and 7g/day for women at compare with the objectives of the National&#xD;
      Health Nutrition Program of 8g/day and 6.5g/day respectively). In addition, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommends consuming less than 5g of salt per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, sodium intake through mineral water was also questioned. Both in terms of&#xD;
      basic and clinical research, the biological effects of dietary sodium chloride intake have&#xD;
      been the subject of a great deal of work for several decades. The mechanisms of transmission&#xD;
      in the induced or hemodynamic effects related to the absorption of Na multiple debates and&#xD;
      their impact on cardiovascular risks remain very uncertain. Work has shown that all subjects&#xD;
      do not react homogeneously to sodium chloride intakes, thus determining what are called&#xD;
      &quot;NaCl-sensitive&quot; people who in a situation of major sodium intake will show an increase of&#xD;
      peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in blood pressure, much more marked than in&#xD;
      subjects called &quot; NaCl resistant &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;NaCl-sensitive&quot; people represent 10 to 30% of the population, with notable differences&#xD;
      according to ethnic origins, regions and continents. A marked overrepresentation of this&#xD;
      phenotype is observed in patients with hypertension or with a family history of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, studies conducted on animals and humans show that sodium intake does not have&#xD;
      the same impact on the parameters mentioned above, depending on whether it is in the form of&#xD;
      chloride or bicarbonate salt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these elements, the investigators developed a clinical study protocol&#xD;
      intended to demonstrate a possible differential effect in the biological effects of the same&#xD;
      sodium orally intake (2.56g per day), depending on the salt origin.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized study, aim to determine the difference in absorption between&#xD;
      sodium depending on its nature: bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or chloride (NaCl), and the effect of&#xD;
      those types of sodium on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to realize it, 206 volunteers will be include to assess whether or not they are a&#xD;
      &quot;NaCl sensitive volunteer&quot; phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out on 34 of NaCl sensitive volunteer which will take the sodium&#xD;
      dietary supplements. The 2 dietary supplements are table salt (sachet) or bottled water. They&#xD;
      will be test in a cross-over design during 2 periods of 1 week separated from 1 week of a&#xD;
      washing-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to compare mean arterial pressure (MAP) resulting from daily&#xD;
      supplementation of 2.56 g of sodium (111 mmol), in addition to the food intake of a&#xD;
      low-sodium diet from V2 to the end of the study (&lt;5g of NaCl / day), for 7 days, either as&#xD;
      sodium chloride or as sodium bicarbonate in hypertensive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be separated in 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phenotyping (4 visits): to determine if the volunteer is &quot;NaCl sensitive volunteer&quot; or&#xD;
           not&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. V1 (day -28/D-28) = inclusion and beginning of phenotyping phase,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. V2 (day -21/D-21) = start of a low-sodium diet (&lt;5g of NaCl / day),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. V3 (day -14/D-14) = daily supplementation of sodium chloride for 7 days&#xD;
                (9.78g/day),&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. V4 (day -7/D-7) = &quot;NaCl sensitive volunteer&quot; assessment, end of study for &quot;NaCl&#xD;
                non-senstive volunteers&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period for &quot;NaCl sensitive volunteer&quot; with dietary supplement intake in a&#xD;
           cross-over design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. PC1 (day 0/D0) = beginning of treatment period 1,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. PC2 (day 3/D3) = volunteer contact to make sure he is all right,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. V5 (day 7/D7) = end treatment period 1,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. PC3 (day 14/D14) = beginning of treatment period 2,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. PC4 (day 17/D17) = volunteer contact to make sure he is all right,&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. V6 (day 21/D21) = end of treatment period 2 and of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes a total of 6 visits to PIC/CIC Inserm 1405 of the Clermont-Ferrand&#xD;
      University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration of the study will be of 7 weeks.&#xD;
