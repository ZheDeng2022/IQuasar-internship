  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spinal navigation trial (SPINAV) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the&#xD;
      use of computer-assisted navigation in surgery for spinal deformity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal deformity is a common reason for spinal surgery at youth. In addition, the incidence&#xD;
      of surgery for spinal deformity in older adults is increasing. Spinal deformity surgery is by&#xD;
      far the most complex spine surgery. One complexity lies in the correct placement of implants&#xD;
      in the severely deformed spine. Today, the most common surgical procedures for spinal&#xD;
      deformity involve placement of screws in the vertebral pedicle in the instrumented part of&#xD;
      the spine. This gives good bone purchase, which is important for deformity correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pedicle is narrow and misplaced pedicle screws can result in vascular, pulmonary or&#xD;
      neural injuries, or inadequate bone purchase. Compared to the conventional free-hand surgical&#xD;
      technique, which relies on the knowledge of anatomy, computer-assisted navigation using&#xD;
      intraoperative 3D imaging has been shown to improve screw placement accuracy and reduce&#xD;
      complications due to screw misplacements. As a consequence, navigation may also reduce the&#xD;
      frequency of postoperative revision surgery compared to free hand. However, navigation still&#xD;
      takes time, and is associated with higher intraoperative radiation than the free hand&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of yet, the majority of data in this area are based on retrospectively collected series,&#xD;
      and some prospectively collected series, while randomized controlled trials on spinal&#xD;
      deformity are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled trial the accuracy of pedicle screw placement using augmented&#xD;
      reality surgical navigation (ARSN), infra-red surgical navigation (IRSN) and conventional&#xD;
      free-hand technique will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of age 12 years and older with spinal deformities are randomized into one of the&#xD;
      three surgical techniques mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable is pedicle screw placement accuracy at 1st attempt assessed&#xD;
      using the Gertzbein scale.&#xD;
