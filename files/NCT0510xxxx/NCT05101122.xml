    <textblock>
      The SEED study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea&#xD;
      (OSA) of 3 escalating dose combinations of atomoxetine with AD313 compared to baseline and to&#xD;
      atomoxetine alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SEED study is an open-label, 4 consecutive period dose-escalation study of combinations&#xD;
      of AD313 vs. atomoxetine alone in participants with moderate- to severe OSA. A screening&#xD;
      polysomnogram (PSG) will be conducted to establish that each participant meets study&#xD;
      enrollment criteria and to serve as baseline. Each participant will then receive escalating&#xD;
      doses of AD313 with on-drug PSGs to be conducted on the final night of dosing.&#xD;
