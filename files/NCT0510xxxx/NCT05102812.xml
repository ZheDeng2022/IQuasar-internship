  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence shows that many people living with stroke experience major problems with&#xD;
      eating and drinking. We know that this can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, reduced muscle&#xD;
      strength and depression. It can also lead to longer stays in hospital, reduced ability to&#xD;
      participate in rehabilitation and in the long term poorer quality of life. People living with&#xD;
      stroke say the pleasure gained from eating and drinking changes after a stroke. They describe&#xD;
      feeling embarrassed and ashamed and report a loss of self-confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, being able to eat and drink independently is essential for health and well-being.&#xD;
      People with stroke welcome opportunities to address eating and drinking problems early in&#xD;
      their rehabilitation and would like more opportunities to practice the necessary skills&#xD;
      needed, to regain independence. Early rehabilitation interventions have the potential to&#xD;
      improve long-term outcomes by providing strategies, assistive devices and rehabilitation as&#xD;
      early as possible in stroke recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care professionals are using breakfast groups to provide opportunities to practice&#xD;
      preparation and consumption of food and drink with enabling support. Consultations with&#xD;
      patients and health care professionals have found that the processes involved in breakfast&#xD;
      group interventions lack rigour and multi-disciplinary team coordination, thus leading to&#xD;
      uncertainty about what outcomes are achieved for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This co-designed study aims to find out if it is possible to improve patient outcomes by&#xD;
      providing more intensive interventions in a breakfast group format delivered by a range of&#xD;
      health care professionals over five days of the week. The intervention will be co-designed&#xD;
      with a stakeholder group comprising of patients, carers and stroke unit health care&#xD;
      professionals supported by an advisory group, comprising of experts in the field. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered in three sites and it will include a tool kit to support the&#xD;
      integrated assessment, care plan and outcome measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will develop a breakfast group intervention for acute stroke services, followed by&#xD;
      an exploration of the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Feasibility studies are required to build the foundations for future research by&#xD;
      exploring the practicalities of intervention delivery and the acceptability from a recipient&#xD;
      perspective. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework definition for complex&#xD;
      interventions has been used to guide study design as breakfast groups are considered to be&#xD;
      complex, as they contain several complex interacting components and has a range of possible&#xD;
      outcomes which are variable due to the nature of stroke impairments. Purposive or commonly&#xD;
      known as selective sampling is an appropriate method for the study as there are only a&#xD;
      limited number of primary data sources who can contribute to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of sites involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-participant Observations Site - 1,2,3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview Sites - 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-design Site - 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention delivery sites - 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus groups sites - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size of sample Non-participant Observations (Pre-intervention) Site 1 = 10 patients and 7&#xD;
      staff members Interviews Site 1 (pre-intervention) = 2 patients and 2 staff members = 4&#xD;
      Interviews Site 2 and 3 (post intervention) = 6-8 patient across both sites Co-design site 1&#xD;
      = 10 participants in the stakeholder group Intervention delivery and non-participant&#xD;
      observations sites 1,2,3 = 15 across 3 sites Focus groups sites 2 and 3 = 6-8 staff members&#xD;
      across 2 sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total patients= 35 Total Stakeholders = 10 Total Health care professionals = 17 Total&#xD;
      participants = 62&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling technique Purposeful sampling is widely used in qualitative research for the&#xD;
      identification and selection of information-rich cases with limited resources, relevant to&#xD;
      the phenomenon of interest. This involves identifying and selecting individuals or groups of&#xD;
      individuals that are especially knowledgeable about or experienced with a phenomenon of&#xD;
      interest. Three acute stroke wards in South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Integrated Care System&#xD;
      (SYB ICS) will be included in the study therefore availability and willingness to&#xD;
      participate, and the ability to communicate experiences are important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods used in the study include in-depth interviews, non-participant observations,&#xD;
      co-design stakeholder workshops and focus groups. A strength of Co-design is that tools such&#xD;
      as prototypes can be used to engage stakeholders. A prototype intervention and tool-kit will&#xD;
      be developed and tested in three stroke wards in SYB ICS (Sheffield Teaching Hospitals FT,&#xD;
      Rotherham Hospitals FT and Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals FT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-design of Intervention A Stakeholder Group will be established with key stakeholders&#xD;
      including a stroke service manager, National Health Service (NHS) staff (Nurses,&#xD;
      Physiotherapists, Speech and Language Therapists, Dieticians, Psychologists, Occupational&#xD;
      Therapists, support workers) and two patient representatives. This group will design a&#xD;
      breakfast group intervention and co-create an actionable toolkit encompassing an assessment,&#xD;
      a personalised care plan and a range of outcomes measures. Frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      meetings will vary according to the stage of the project although it is anticipated there&#xD;
      will be up to 10, 1 hour meetings (virtual or in person). The stakeholder Group will be&#xD;
      recruited using an expression of interest advertisement via Sheffield Stroke Pathway and the&#xD;
      local Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Stroke Group. A Study&#xD;
      Steering Group will be established with key national and international experts and stroke&#xD;
      charities representatives to support study development by proving iterative feedback. The&#xD;
      Steering Group will support the study providing guidance and have oversight on the progress&#xD;
      of the study to ensure it is conducted rigorously in line with both, governance frameworks&#xD;
      and good clinical research practice. The group will meet at key stages during the study and&#xD;
      will inform strategic decisions. They will meet online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steering Group Participants Two patient representatives and NHS staff (including Occupational&#xD;
      Therapists, Physiotherapists, Speech and Language Therapists, Psychologists, Nurses and&#xD;
      support staff) will be invited to join ten 1 hour workshops where they will co-design a&#xD;
      breakfast group intervention and supporting tool-kit. The tool kit will comprise of an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary assessment for eating and drinking difficulties, a care plan with&#xD;
      goalsetting and clinical outcome measures. Participants will be recruited with informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stakeholder Group Activities Patient journey mapping will be used at the start of the project&#xD;
      to delve into the depths of the patient and staff experience. A short film (10 minutes) will&#xD;
      be co-created with NHS staff, patients and carers to convey how they experience the current&#xD;
      delivery of eating and drinking interventions and their priorities for change. Both patient&#xD;
      mapping and the 10-minute film are methods used in experienced-based co-design, a six staged&#xD;
      process that uses design thinking and co-design methods, bringing stakeholders together to&#xD;
      reflect on their experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video A short video of six patients and/or carer talking about their eating experiences will&#xD;
      be co-created by the researcher. A consent process will take place in accordance with NHS&#xD;
      policy. Each participant will be filmed for 30 minutes, and the videos will be edited&#xD;
      together in soundbites so that the patient's story is told, and Health Care Professional&#xD;
      (HCP) can understand the experience of the service user. Members of the stakeholder group and&#xD;
      advisory group will be invited to help in the editing processes. Using Video stories to help&#xD;
      others understand the patient experience is a methodology used to co-design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-participant Observations Breakfast interventions and how breakfast is delivered on a&#xD;
      stroke ward at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals will be observed on two occasions by the&#xD;
      researcher and one other observer from the stakeholder group. They will observe the routines&#xD;
      and rituals, how breakfasts are operationally managed, and the type of support provided for&#xD;
      patients to eat and drinking during the breakfast period. Patients and staff being observed&#xD;
      will have agreed to take part in an informed consent process and the observation will be&#xD;
      explicit. They will have been provided with a participant information sheet about the study&#xD;
      before informed consent was taken. Observations will be recorded on paper and combined&#xD;
      afterwards. Non-participant observations will provide insights into the culture of breakfast&#xD;
      on an acute stroke ward, the patterns of behaviours and the social interactions that occur&#xD;
      between patients and staff. The participants will be a purposive sample of patients on an&#xD;
      acute stroke ward and health care professionals delivering breakfast meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three methods of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe practice- Non-participant observations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask patients about their thoughts, experiences and feelings while observing through&#xD;
           informal conversations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the documentation of the breakfast processes and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher and accompanying stakeholder will keep field notes of observations, jotting&#xD;
      down thoughts and experiences making theoretical commentary. These will be used in the future&#xD;
      as a reminder of practical issues, solutions, and important issues for intervention design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews A semi-structured interview with pre-determined topics and open-ended questions be&#xD;
      developed by the stakeholder group. Two patients and two members of the stroke team will be&#xD;
      interviewed about their experiences of mealtimes on the unit, meal-time interventions and&#xD;
      experiences of eating and drinking difficulties. Interviews provide an opportunity to explore&#xD;
      the phenomenon of eating and drinking difficulties in-depth, exploring complexity from the&#xD;
      perspective of stroke survivors and health care professionals. These can be conducted in&#xD;
      person on online participants will be given a choice. Interviews will be recorded and&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim. The interviews will be flexible and interactive however a consistent&#xD;
      approach with an experienced researcher and a well-designed schedule will provide rigour. Two&#xD;
      patient and Two staff will be interview pre=intervention design (site 1) and six to eight&#xD;
      patients that have participated in the intervention pilot in sites 2 &amp; 3 will be interviewed&#xD;
      in-depth after the pilots are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention delivery/ Non-participant observations The breakfast group intervention will be&#xD;
      piloted in site 1 (Sheffield Teaching Hospitals) for 1-2 weeks. It will then be refined and&#xD;
      piloted in two further stroke wards (site 2 &amp; 3) for 2 weeks (Rotherham Hospitals NHS FT and&#xD;
      Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals FT). Non-participant structured observation will&#xD;
      occur when the first prototype intervention and tool kit is tested in site 1. To inform the&#xD;
      development of future data collection and the main study of the intervention structured&#xD;
      observations will provide data about interactions in the breakfast group between patients and&#xD;
      staff. Two complete observers (the researcher and a stakeholder) will observe the&#xD;
      intervention in action recording activities and interactions in a systematic approach using a&#xD;
      framework for data collection. This will be developed prior to the observations with the&#xD;
      stakeholder group. A framework will facilitate the collection of data in a systematic&#xD;
      approach and as far a possible limiting observer bias and subjectivity. A detailed&#xD;
      understanding of the intervention in action can contribute to the understanding of the&#xD;
      phenomena being investigated. Observations will be used to support data collected through the&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. Observations can help provide a means of recording what actually&#xD;
      happens as opposed to what people recall has happened or prevent bias by participants giving&#xD;
      socially acceptable responses. They can support self-report data and contribute to the&#xD;
      trustworthiness and rigour of a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Groups Following intervention pilots in site 2 (Rotherham Hospitals FT) &amp; 3 (Doncaster&#xD;
      and Bassetlaw FT)a focus group consisting of Health Care Professionals involved in the&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention will be conducted. Participants will be purposively sampled from&#xD;
      the NHS staff taking part in the intervention delivery. They will be recruited as part of the&#xD;
      intervention delivery team recruitment from sites 2 &amp; 3. Informed consent to take part will&#xD;
      be obtained. The group will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. If necessary due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 restrictions this group will be conducted online. A focus group will be used to&#xD;
      obtain views of the health care professionals delivering the intervention. A topic guide for&#xD;
      the focus group will be developed with the stakeholder group informed by the aims and&#xD;
      objectives of the study. Open-ended questions will be used to elicit views on the&#xD;
      intervention delivery, acceptability, and feasibility. Focus groups are a popular method of&#xD;
      enquiry in stroke research and will provide in-depth insights into how the health care&#xD;
      professionals think and feel about the intervention and toolkit.&#xD;
