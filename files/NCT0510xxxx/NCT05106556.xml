  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the possible effects of inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      (IMT) on respiratory functions, functional capacity, balance and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) include a heterogeneous group of progressive, acute and&#xD;
      chronic diseases that diffusely affect the lung and characterized by varying degrees of&#xD;
      inflammation and fibrosis in the lung parenchyma. The disease group usually shows a&#xD;
      restrictive pattern and progresses with gas exchange abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive lung fibrosis was first described in 1935. Over the years, more than 150 lung&#xD;
      disease characterized by acute or chronic pulmonary fibrosis of varying degrees with known or&#xD;
      unknown cause have been defined and these diseases were named interstitial lung disease (ILD)&#xD;
      in 1970s. Common symptoms in chronic interstitial lung diseases in general; dyspnea, dry&#xD;
      cough, exercise intolerance and fatigue. All these features of interstitial lung diseases&#xD;
      cause an increase in respiratory work and ventilatory deterioration in exercise. Apart from&#xD;
      these general features, muscle weakness and related exercise intolerance may occur in some&#xD;
      specific conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important factor limiting exercise capacity in these patients is circulatory&#xD;
      disorder, which cause exercise induced deterioration in gas exchange. Hypoxemia induced&#xD;
      exercise intolerance causes a decrease in health-related quality of life, limitation of&#xD;
      functional capacity and inactivity in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS)&#xD;
      respiratory rehabilitation guideline, although the data are not conclusive, inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle training is recommended as an adjunct to pulmonary rehabilitation, especially in&#xD;
      patients with suspected or confirmed respiratory muscle weakness. The effect of&#xD;
      well-structured and supervised inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on respiratory functions,&#xD;
      diaphragm weakness, functional capacity, balance and quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important that this research will be carried out in this area and because it has a&#xD;
      current subject.&#xD;

The three parts of the test are scored separately and the total score is calculated. Scores range from 0-100. A score of zero indicates normal and a score of 100 indicates maximum disability.</description>
