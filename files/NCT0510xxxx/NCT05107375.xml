      Overall design:An open experimental design was adopted in this study, and 300 subjects were&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled. To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) in combination with influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: one dose of influenza virus split vaccine and one dose of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) in the contralateral arm on day 0, the second dose of&#xD;
      recombinant Novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) on day 30, and the third dose of&#xD;
      recombinant Novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) on day 60 were given intramuscularly in the&#xD;
      upper arm deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: the first dose of recombinant Novel coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) was administered&#xD;
      on day 0, the second dose of recombinant Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) on day 30, the first&#xD;
      dose of influenza virus lysate vaccine on day 44, and the third dose of recombinant&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) on day 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) was administered at 0.5mL each&#xD;
      dose, containing 25μg nCP-RBD protein. Influenza virus lysis vaccine, one dose at a time,&#xD;
      each dose 0.5mL, containing each influenza virus strain hemagglutinin 15μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of immunogenicity In group A, about 5.0mL of venous blood was collected for&#xD;
      immunogenicity test before the first dose of vaccine, before the second dose of Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) and 14 days after the third dose of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B, about 5.0mL of venous blood was collected for immunogenicity test before the&#xD;
      first dose of vaccine and 14 days after the third dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus&#xD;
      vaccine (CHO cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE and SAE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events (AE), all AE at 30 min after each dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus&#xD;
      vaccine (CHO cells) and influenza vaccine, all AE at 0-7 days (both solicitation and&#xD;
      non-solicitation AE) and all AE at 8-30 days (non-solicitation AE) were collected; All SAE&#xD;
      were collected from the first dose to 1 month after full immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicitation AE[the following events occurring within 7 days after vaccination with&#xD;
      recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells)] :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inoculation site (local) AE: pain, swelling, induration, redness, rash, pruritus Vital signs:&#xD;
      fever Non-inoculated site (whole body) AE: headache, fatigue/fatigue, diarrhea, nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, muscle pain (non-inoculated site), acute allergic reaction, cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects shall have their axillary body temperature checked daily during the screening&#xD;
      period, before the subsequent dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells), and&#xD;
      within 7 days after each dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells); Subjects&#xD;
      in group B will have their armpit temperature measured before influenza vaccination (the day&#xD;
      of vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent physical examination (skin and cardiopulmonary auscultation) and blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test should be performed on women of childbearing age before each dose of&#xD;
      recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells); Women of childbearing age in group B&#xD;
      should have a urine pregnancy test prior to influenza vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy events occurring within 1 month from the first dose of vaccine to full immunization&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADE/VED risk monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      After vaccination (at least 1 dose of trial vaccine) (at each visit), subjects will be&#xD;
      reminded to contact the investigator in case of fever and/or respiratory symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      dyspnea, sore throat, etc.), suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurring during the&#xD;
      study period. If the subjects are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-COV-2&#xD;
      during the trial period, they should go to a local designated hospital for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. A detailed case-by-case investigation is required for confirmed cases. In the&#xD;
      event of severe COVID-19 infection or death, an expert meeting should be held to evaluate&#xD;
      ADE/VED.&#xD;
