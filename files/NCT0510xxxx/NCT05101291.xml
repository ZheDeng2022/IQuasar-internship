  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging and frailty make the elderly patients susceptible to hypotension following spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia. The systemic haemodynamic effects of spinal anaesthesia are not well known. In&#xD;
      this study, we examine the systemic haemodynamic effects of fractional spinal anaesthesia&#xD;
      following intermittent microdosing of a local anesthetic and an opioid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included 15 patients aged over 65 with considerable comorbidities, planned for emergency&#xD;
      hip fracture repair. Patients received a spinal catheter and cardiac output monitoring using&#xD;
      the LiDCOplus system. Invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index, systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance index, heart rate and stroke volume index were registered. Two doses of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 2,25 mg and fentanyl 15µg were administered with 25 minutes in between.&#xD;
      Hypotension was defined as a fall in MAP by &gt;30% or a MAP &lt;65 mmHg&#xD;

      We daily screened patients planned for hip fracture surgery and these were identified through&#xD;
      the theatre planning software (Orbit, TietoEVRY, Espoo, Finland). Nottingham Hip Fracture&#xD;
      Score was calculated. This scoring system includes objective factors like age, sex, dementia,&#xD;
      previous cancer, living facility and comorbidity. NHFS varies from 1-10 with higher numbers&#xD;
      correlated to higher 30-day mortality. ASA grade was also recorded after study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After arriving to the preoperative area, patients were given 5 liters of oxygen on a face&#xD;
      mask and ECG and pulse-oximetry monitoring were started. Oral premedication with standardized&#xD;
      doses of paracetamol and oxycodone was given orally, followed by the placement of a venous&#xD;
      18G cannula in an antecubital vein and a radial arterial catheter (20G). The patient was also&#xD;
      given a fascia iliaca compartment (FIC) block, or an ultrasound guided femoral nerve block&#xD;
      with ropivacaine 3.5mg/ml 20-40ml, to decrease discomfort when given the neuraxial block. In&#xD;
      addition, the LiDCOplus (LiDCO Group Plc, London, England) system was set up according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. The system was calibrated with 0.3-0.45 mmol lithium chloride&#xD;
      depending on body weight. After calibration and baseline parameter registration, the&#xD;
      LiDCOplus system provided cardiac output variables and based on these and the invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, haemodynamic variables could be derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following aseptic skin preparation of the lumbar area, a subarachnoid puncture by a 18G Tuohy&#xD;
      needle was performed either between the L2 - L3 or the L3 - L4 interspaces, preferably using&#xD;
      a mid-line approach. An intrathecal catheter 20G was then inserted 4-5 cm into the&#xD;
      intrathecal space. This technique of a continues spinal anaesthesia (CSA) was performed on&#xD;
      all patients by one physician (FO). A solution (10 ml) containing 1.5 mg/ml bupivacaine and&#xD;
      10 µg/ml fentanyl was prepared. Intrathecal anaesthesia was induced by giving 1,5 ml (2.25 mg&#xD;
      of bupivacaine and 15 µg of fentanyl) of the solution, followed by a second 1.5 ml injection&#xD;
      after 25 min (i.e., a total intrathecal dos of 4.5 mg of bupivacaine and 30 µg of fentanyl).&#xD;
      Sensory level was monitored by &quot;cold spray&quot;. Hemodynamic recordings were performed every 5&#xD;
      minutes up until 45 minutes after initial intrathecal dose when research monitoring was&#xD;
      terminated. The patient was then operated in the pre-planned time slot and was further&#xD;
      managed at the discretion of the attending anesthetist.&#xD;
