  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of single ascending doses of BT051 in healthy male or female volunteers aged 18&#xD;
      to &lt;50 years. A total of 50 subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of&#xD;
      BT051 or matching placebo in a ratio of 4 active:1 placebo in 5 ascending dose cohorts (10&#xD;
      subjects per cohort) at active dose levels of 100mg, 300mg, 700mg, 1500mg or 3500mg. The&#xD;
      study Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate if any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      occurred in a cohort through Day 3, as well as review cumulative safety data for all previous&#xD;
      cohorts and any available pharmacokinetic (PK) data before proceeding to dosing in the next&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT051-1-001 is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, single center, single-ascending-dose&#xD;
      study in which healthy subjects will receive a single oral dose of BT051 or placebo while&#xD;
      confined to the clinical unit. Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in 5 sequential,&#xD;
      ascending dose cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male and female adult subjects will be enrolled and screened for participation within&#xD;
      28 days before the scheduled administration of study drug. After written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained, the screening procedures will include: medical history, documentation of prior&#xD;
      medications (i.e., medications taken within 30 days before the scheduled dose of study drug),&#xD;
      viral serology tests, clinical laboratory testing, pregnancy testing (for women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential), 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements, and&#xD;
      physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, subjects eligible for randomization&#xD;
      will be admitted to the clinical unit 1 day before the scheduled administration of study drug&#xD;
      (Day -1) and will be confined in the clinical unit until the morning of Day 3. All subjects&#xD;
      will return to the clinical unit on Day 7 (-1 or +2 days) and for the last follow-up on Day&#xD;
      30 (Â±3 days) for study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 subjects will be randomized to receive BT051 or placebo (8 active:2 placebo) in&#xD;
      each of the following sequential dose escalating cohorts: 100mg, 300mg, 700mg. 1500mg and&#xD;
      3500mg. Administration of a single dose of study medication on Day 1 will occur under fasted&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., no food allowed overnight before dosing until at least 4 hours after&#xD;
      dosing). Except for approximately 240-480 mL of water given with study drug, no fluid will be&#xD;
      allowed from 1 hour before dosing until 1 hour postdose; water will be provided ad libitum at&#xD;
      all other times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate if any dose-limiting adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) through Day 3 occurred in a cohort before proceeding to dosing in the next cohort. In&#xD;
      addition, cumulative safety data will be reviewed for all previous cohorts along with any&#xD;
      available pharmacokinetic (PK) data. A lower dose may be explored in case dose-limiting AEs&#xD;
      are observed at a higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PK analyses, blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected from each subject. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected on Day 1 at predose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and&#xD;
      48 hours postdose. Urine samples will be collected at the following intervals (pooled for&#xD;
      each collection interval): 0-4, 4-8, 8-24, and 24-48 hours postdose. One stool sample will be&#xD;
      collected prior to dose (from Days -2 to Day 1). Following dosing on Day 1, all stool samples&#xD;
      will be collected through Day 3 (48 hours postdose) while the subject is confined to the&#xD;
      clinical unit. In addition, a stool sample will be collected on Day 7 (-1 or +2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, physical examinations, and ECGs at select time points for 30 days following the&#xD;
      dose of study drug. Potential systemic pharmacologic T-cell immunosuppressive activity will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
