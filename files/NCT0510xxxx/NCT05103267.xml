      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of the Tauropace to reduce major&#xD;
      cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections through 12-months post-procedure&#xD;
      following CIED in heart failure participants. The secondary endpoint is to prospectively&#xD;
      characterize the performance of Tauropace in participants whose CIED system includes a&#xD;
      transvenous RV defibrillation lead.&#xD;

      TRICE-HF is a prospective, multi-center, post-market, interventional clinical study. The main&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of the Tauropace to reduce major CIED&#xD;
      infections through 12-months post-procedure following CIED in heart failure patients. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is to prospectively characterize the performance of Tauropace in subjects&#xD;
      whose CIED system includes a transvenous RV defibrillation lead. These features include the&#xD;
      lead integrity alert (LIA), lead noise alert (LNA), RV pacing impedance, and high voltage&#xD;
      (HV) pacing impedance to detect events that affect a RV lead's pacing, sensing, or&#xD;
      defibrillation circuit lead system events (LSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 7 sites in Campania with up to 500 subjects&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment period is expected to start in November 2021 and to take approximately 12&#xD;
      months. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 12 months. Therefore, the anticipated&#xD;
      study duration is approximately 24 months and subjects may be followed for up to 24 months&#xD;
      depending on when they enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a nonrandomized registry; hence no formal control group will be used. In order&#xD;
      to compare our follow-up data, the investigators performed an electronic search of the PubMed&#xD;
      and Embase, including all RCTs, retrospective or prospective studied that resulted in CIED&#xD;
      infection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators excluded all studies that included patients with abdominal device implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No restrictions were imposed on the sample size of the studies. Incidence CIED infections&#xD;
      rate or Odds Ratio with 95% confidence intervals were presented as a summary statistic, with&#xD;
      the use of the random effects model postulated by DerSimonian and Laird.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-regression was performed to assess the relationship between the magnitude of the&#xD;
      treatment effect and different predictors. To estimate the CIED infections incidence in&#xD;
      subgroups with certain risk factors, the investigators used the percentage of patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, chronic renal failure, undergoing replacement/upgrade/revision procedure, and other&#xD;
      CIED infections risk factors, as continuous variables. The investigators predicted a&#xD;
      percentage of diabetes and Chronic renal failure patients in our population of 20% and 45 %&#xD;
      respectively, but will be able to modify the comparison parameters based on the real&#xD;
      percentage of risk factors in the enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed using the &quot;meta&quot; package, with &quot;metagen&quot;, &quot;metabin&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;metareg&quot; command, in R programming, R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22). Results were considered&#xD;
      statistically significant if the 2-sided P&lt;0,05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2-sample, 1-sided Fischer Exact test will be used to test the primary efficacy endpoint&#xD;
      versus the benchmark rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be compared using a Student t test for continuous variables or&#xD;
      a Fisher's exact/chi-square test for categorical variables. A Fisher's exact test will be&#xD;
      used for sparse data (i.e., np &lt;5 or nq &lt;5). CIED infection and mechanical complication data&#xD;
      among ICD and CRT subjects will be compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. A&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test will be used for sparse data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be considered successful at the first analysis in which the primary objective&#xD;
      is met.&#xD;

    <description>The primary study objective is to evaluate the rate of major CIED infections through 12-months post-procedure in high-risk patients.&#xD;
Major CIED infection will be defined as a device infection involving any part of the anatomy other than the incision or subcutaneous tissue, which was opened or manipulated during the CIED implantation operation, or as endocarditis defined according to the modified Duke Criteria, that resulted in CIED system removal, an invasive CIED procedure (e.g., pocket revision without removal), treatment with long-term antibiotic therapy (if the patient was not a candidate for system removal) with infection recurrence after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, or death. CIED infections that will not meet one or more of the criteria for major infection will be classified as minor CIED infections.</description>
