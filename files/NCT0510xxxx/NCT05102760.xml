  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are an important tool for treating pain due to orthopedic&#xD;
      injury in the ED. They provide long lasting, opioid-sparing pain relief that is generally&#xD;
      safe and well-tolerated by patients1. Elderly patients with hip fractures commonly present to&#xD;
      the ED, and their injury can be painful. Commonly used opioid pain regimens can have&#xD;
      deleterious side effects, especially in elderly patients, like somnolence, delirium,&#xD;
      hypotension and respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fascia iliaca compartment (FIC) block has become a familiar technique to emergency&#xD;
      physicians as a pain control treatment for hip fractures. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG)&#xD;
      block has recently been proposed as a novel method to treat pain due to hip, acetabular and&#xD;
      pelvic fracture by targeting the terminal sensory articular nerve branches of the femoral&#xD;
      nerve (FN), obturator nerve (ON), and accessory obturator nerve (AON). At this time there has&#xD;
      been no study comparing the efficacy of the two nerve blocks, PENG and FIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the PENG block (20mL of Bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.50%) to that of the FIC block (40mL of Bupivacaine 0.25%) for patients with hip fractures&#xD;
      in the ED. Our hypothesis is that PENG will demonstrate analgesia that is non-inferior to&#xD;
      FIC. Subjective pain scores on a scale of 0 to 10 will be assessed before and after the&#xD;
      block. All subjects will receive 4mg of morphine after consent and prior to the block.&#xD;

      Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are an important tool for treating pain due to orthopedic&#xD;
      injury in the ED. They provide long lasting, opioid-sparing pain relief that is generally&#xD;
      safe and well-tolerated by patients1. Elderly patients with hip fractures commonly present to&#xD;
      the ED, and their injury can be painful. Commonly used opioid pain regimens can have&#xD;
      deleterious side effects, especially in elderly patients, like somnolence, delirium,&#xD;
      hypotension and respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fascia iliaca compartment (FIC) block has become a familiar technique to emergency&#xD;
      physicians as a pain control treatment for hip fractures. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG)&#xD;
      block has recently been proposed as a novel method to treat pain due to hip, acetabular and&#xD;
      pelvic fracture by targeting the terminal sensory articular nerve branches of the femoral&#xD;
      nerve (FN), obturator nerve (ON), and accessory obturator nerve (AON). At this time there has&#xD;
      been no study comparing the efficacy of the two nerve blocks, PENG and FIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the PENG block (20mL of Bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.50%) to that of the FIC block (40mL of Bupivacaine 0.25%) for patients with hip fractures&#xD;
      in the ED. Our hypothesis is that PENG will demonstrate analgesia that is non-inferior to&#xD;
      FIC. Subjective pain scores on a scale of 0 to 10 will be assessed before and after the&#xD;
      block. All subjects will receive 4mg of morphine after consent and prior to the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to show that the PENG block is preferable to the FIC block because it does&#xD;
      not target motor nerves, thus preserving motor function allowing for an accurate neurological&#xD;
      exam and hopefully providing for earlier ambulation. Also, we aim to determine if PENG block&#xD;
      results in an significant reduction in amount of systemic pain medication needed for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centered, prospective, randomized, blinded study involving patients who&#xD;
      present to the ED with an isolated hip fracture. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      consented for the study and then randomized to receive either a FIC block or a PENG block.&#xD;
      Patients who are potentially to be enrolled in the study will receive standardized systemic&#xD;
      analgesia while awaiting x-rays. If needed, patients will be administered morphine for&#xD;
      breakthrough pain after the nerve blocks are placed. The exception to this standardization&#xD;
      will be patients with a morphine allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research associate will screen for patients and confirm with the attending physician that&#xD;
      the subject is eligible for enrollment and is able to give consent. The patient consented by&#xD;
      a member of the research team, who will assess the patient's pain score on a scale of 0 to 10&#xD;
      prior to the block. The patient will then be randomized to receive either the FIC block or&#xD;
      the PENG block to be performed by a member of the ultrasound faculty. The research associate&#xD;
      will be blinded to the type of block being performed by the ultrasound faculty member. The&#xD;
      research associate will then reassess the patient's pain score on the 0-10 scale at the 30&#xD;
      minute and 60-minute mark. They will also assess for any adverse events after the block is&#xD;
      performed. The research associate will note the motor function in the quadriceps muscle 30&#xD;
      min and 60 min after the nerve block is placed. Any rescue medication given after the nerve&#xD;
      block is placed in the ED will be recorded.&#xD;
