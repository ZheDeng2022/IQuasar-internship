      This study will target Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) school children ages 4-14&#xD;
      and staff who have not had a previous positive COVID-19 test within the past 3 months. It&#xD;
      will enroll children and adults for 1-3 days to explore whether serial &quot;at-home&quot; BinaxNOW&#xD;
      testing is feasible and non-inferior to &quot;at school&quot; single PCR testing for the evaluation of&#xD;
      symptomatic individuals with a negative initial BinaxNOW. It will also explore whether&#xD;
      lollipop swabs are more acceptable and perform as well as nasal swabs with polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) testing.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a quantitative community-based study, conducted in the K-12 setting&#xD;
      with school children 4-14 years old, teachers, and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant's initial at-school BinaxNOW test is positive, then they will only complete&#xD;
      the lollipop swab for PCR testing. They will NOT do the at-home BinaxNOW test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant's initial at-school BinaxNOW test is negative, then they will complete both&#xD;
      the lollipop swab for PCR testing AND an at-home BinaxNOW test approximately 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The investigators will test the hypothesis that serial at-home BinaxNOW testing will&#xD;
      be feasible and non-inferior to the single at-school PCR testing program. To do this, the&#xD;
      investigators will distribute over-the-counter BinaxNOW antigen tests to volunteer families,&#xD;
      and create a protocol to ensure families can perform and report test results accurately to&#xD;
      the school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is 'at-home' BinaxNOW testing feasible for families?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is serial 'at-home' BinaxNOW testing non-inferior to 'at-school' single PCR testing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The investigators will test the hypothesis that lollipop swabs are more acceptable to&#xD;
      individuals and PCR testing is non-inferior to performing PCR on nasal swabs. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, the investigators will work with MMSD schools to incorporate a lollipop swab for&#xD;
      PCR at the time a symptomatic student or staff receives a nasal swab for PCR that is part of&#xD;
      the Department of Health Services (DHS) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two key questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are lollipop swabs more acceptable to individuals when compared to nasal swabs?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will lollipop swabs perform as well as nasal swabs with PCR-based testing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1.1: &quot;At-home&quot; BinaxNOW testing will be feasible for families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1.2: Serial &quot;at-home&quot; BinaxNOW testing is non-inferior to &quot;at school&quot; single PCR&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2.1: Lollipop swabs are more acceptable to individuals than nasal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2.2: Lollipop swabs will perform as well as nasal swabs with PCR-based testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of BinaxNOW</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary diagnostic outcome measure will be the negative predictive value (NPV). The NPV of BinaxNow is ~91% in symptomatic subjects.&#xD;
The null hypothesis is that the negative predictive value of BinaxNOW is at least 91% (which is the reported rate in symptomatic subjects after a single test) versus the alternative hypothesis that the NPV is greater than 91%.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tabulated Results from Nasal vs Lollipop Swab-based PCR tests</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that the lollipop swab test will be non-inferior to the gold-standard PCR testing of nasal swabs. Concordance between the PCR test results will be evaluated by calculating the Kappa statistic which will be reported along with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval. The nonparametric bootstrap technique will be used to construct the confidence interval. A kappa statistic of &gt;0.95 will be considered as sufficient to define lollipop swab test non-inferior to the gold standard PCR testing of nasal swabs.</description>

    <description>To address the acceptability of lollipop swabs vs nasal swabs, the study team will ask participants a binary question: Are lollipop swabs more acceptable to participants when compared to nasal swabs? Yes/No.</description>

    <description>If a symptomatic participant's initial at-school BinaxNOW test was positive, then their study participation is complete after providing the lollipop swab for PCR testing.&#xD;
If a symptomatic participant's initial at-school BinaxNOW test was negative, then they will be asked to complete an at-home BinaxNOW test approximately 24 hours later.&#xD;
For the at-home BinaxNOW testing, the participant will schedule a follow-up virtual visit with the study coordinator. If they are unable to complete a virtual visit, they will schedule an in-person home visit. They will also be sent home with a BinaxNOW testing kit.</description>
