  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion is a common surgical procedure performed in children&#xD;
      for the delivery of nutritional support, medications, frequent blood draws or transfusions.&#xD;
      Maintaining hygienic conditions is absolutely necessary in order to avoid contamination of&#xD;
      the catheter and tubing to avoid bloodstream infections. Fractures in the tubing is a common&#xD;
      complication that places children at increased risk for infections. In order to help keep the&#xD;
      tubing stable to avoid fractures and dislodgements, a wearable device was created called&#xD;
      Ben-Guard. This pilot study is being undertaken to determine if the Ben-Guard device will&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and severity of adverse events in children requiring CVCs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Conduct a pragmatic pilot study of the Ben-Guard Catheter Safety Device in 40 pediatric&#xD;
      patients with central venous catheters (CVC). Participants will be issued 3-5 garments, which&#xD;
      are expected to be worn at all times. This study will be conducted over an 18 month period.&#xD;
      Participants are expected to wear the garment daily for the duration of the study (or&#xD;
      duration of their treatment if &lt;18 months). Data will be reviewed every 3 months to measure&#xD;
      the garment's acceptability and effect on the frequency of central line-associated&#xD;
      complications. Outcomes will be compared to a matched retrospective cohort. This study will&#xD;
      use the device consistent with the description as a registered FDA Class 1 device. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting this study to clinically and scientifically evaluate the&#xD;
      device's ability to change the frequency of CVC fractures and CVC complications in children.&#xD;
