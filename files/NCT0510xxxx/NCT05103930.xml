      Children with disabilities experience activities limitations and participation restrictions.&#xD;
      Facilitating the children with disabilities' independence while performing tasks is a key&#xD;
      stake to improve their successful participation and their development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Products and technology can prevent, compensate, relieve or neutralize disability or handicap&#xD;
      and help children and youth with disabilities to perform tasks that might otherwise be&#xD;
      difficult or impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was i) to identify the most frequent activity limitations and&#xD;
      participation restrictions for which assistive products and technology may be useful for&#xD;
      children and youth with disabilities, and ii) to highlight macroscopic trends related to&#xD;
      encountered difficulties and wished products and technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that difficulties would be particularly expected for certain life situations,&#xD;
      especially outside the home in an unfamiliar environment. We also hypothesized that products&#xD;
      and technology would be whished for those situations which should be defined as priority&#xD;
      subjects. Thanks to those results we wanted to highlight new processes to develop innovative&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;

      The study was conducted according to current French legislation (loi Jardé (n°2012-300).It&#xD;
      was a cross-sectional study with a convergent parallel mixed method design. It used an online&#xD;
      open survey following the STROBE and CHERRIES guidelines. A tailored survey with closed and&#xD;
      open questions was used to obtain complementarity data on the topic i.e. to identify the most&#xD;
      frequent life situations for children with disabilities for which a product or technology&#xD;
      could be useful and drill deeper in these situations with responders' personal experiences to&#xD;
      characterize those situations and identify whished solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey's development The survey was developed by a group involving three Physical Medicine&#xD;
      and Rehabilitation physicians and two occupational therapists. The conceptual framework of&#xD;
      the ICF which recognizes the role of environmental factors in the creation of disability was&#xD;
      used. The survey was pilot tested by two mothers of children with disabilities and an adult&#xD;
      who has had a disability since childhood. Comments were considered to improve the survey in a&#xD;
      second version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was developed using an online tool (google form). Three versions were developed targeting&#xD;
      the three participant profiles: persons with childhood onset disabilities, their relatives&#xD;
      and the professionals who work with them. Each version was composed of 14 to 16 questions (in&#xD;
      6 pages). Firstly, participants had access to a description of the study with a dedicated&#xD;
      picture so that making everyone aware of the project, and precising the general objective of&#xD;
      the study. Then, questions were asked on epidemiological data. In a second step, a closed&#xD;
      multiple-choice question was presented with a pre-established list of life situations of a&#xD;
      regular day. Responders had to select the life situations which they evaluated as the most&#xD;
      difficult for children with disabilities to be involved in. Respondents could tick as many&#xD;
      items as they wished. All items were extracted from validated scales (MHAVIE/ABILHAND/ABIL&#xD;
      LOCO KIDS/PEDI/ACTIVLIMB CP). The list was proposed in a chronological order in order to help&#xD;
      the responder think of his own life. Then, open questions invited the respondents to precise&#xD;
      the ticked items. The first open question proposed to precisely describe examples from the&#xD;
      respondents' own experience (hereinafter referred to as &quot;difficulties&quot;) in regular weekdays.&#xD;
      Then they had to describe wished strategies that could allow an improvement (hereinafter&#xD;
      referred to as &quot;solutions&quot;). Eventually, these last three questions were repeated but dealing&#xD;
      with weekend and holidays situations instead of regular weekday situations. The survey was&#xD;
      conceived to be short and take less than 10 minutes. Respondents could review and change&#xD;
      their answers. No completeness check was proposed. Responders could not be identified from&#xD;
      the survey (no identity data, no email or IP address), thus anonymity was guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey's distribution Participants were surveyed through convenience and snowball sampling to&#xD;
      obtain data from participants with a wide range of situations between March and December&#xD;
      2019. The survey was promoted in France through SFERHE (Société Francophone d'Etudes et de&#xD;
      Recherche sur les Handicaps de l'Enfance) and through the EACD (European Academy of Childhood&#xD;
      Disability). A leaflet was prepared to present the project. It was posted in hospitals and&#xD;
      distributed on social media (Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter), and by e-mail. To facilitate the&#xD;
      diffusion, the survey was addressed to families and patients' organisations (FFAIMC,&#xD;
      Fondation PC, AFM, PC), professional networks (réseaux maladies rares) and directly promoted&#xD;
      during professional events (e.g. EACD 2019 Paris, SOFMER 2019 Bordeaux). Participants&#xD;
      answered voluntarily, no incentive was proposed.&#xD;
