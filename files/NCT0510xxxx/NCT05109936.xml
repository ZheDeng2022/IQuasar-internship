  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gout, the most common inflammatory rheumatism in France, is a complication of chronic&#xD;
      hyperuricemia (&gt; 360umol / l). The resulting urate crystals are deposited in many tissues,&#xD;
      especially the skeletal or kidneys. It appears in the form of spontaneously regressive&#xD;
      inflammatory joint attacks in 5 to 7 days but recurrent. Gout turns into a chronic disease if&#xD;
      uric acidemia is not reduced, and is responsible for joint destruction. It becomes a vector&#xD;
      of renal failure and is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and a reduction in life&#xD;
      expectancy. It is cured if a long-term treatment such as febuxostat leading to the&#xD;
      normalization of the uric acidemia is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the frequency of this disease is increasing in industrialized or emerging countries.&#xD;
      The causes are numerous, particularly food, but also related to flaws in therapeutic care.&#xD;
      Studies show that this treatment is not taken in particular because, after the acute attack,&#xD;
      the patient who has become asymptomatic again no longer consults. Currently, in a traditional&#xD;
      way and according to European recommendations, it is not prescribed until several weeks after&#xD;
      the acute attack in order to avoid early relapses, which would then be more numerous.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, even if the hypouricemic agent is prescribed late , the attacks can be repeated&#xD;
      and become rare for several months after obtaining a uricemia below 360umol / l; they&#xD;
      eventually disappear. Lack of knowledge of this disease largely affects the hazards of&#xD;
      disease-modifying treatment, which alone can prevent the progression to chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disease and its cardiovascular and renal impact and on mortality. One of the causes of not&#xD;
      taking a hypouricemic agent is its delayed administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is proposed to assess the relevance of early initiation versus delayed&#xD;
      administration of such treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority study comparing immediate administration with 6 weeks delayed&#xD;
      administration of febuxostat at a dose of 80 mg / day. The methodology of non-inferiority is&#xD;
      what we want to show. Indeed, the immediate initiation of a hypo-uricemic agent is currently&#xD;
      considered as an aggravating factor with respect to the duration or the risks of early&#xD;
      relapse of the crisis, without this being supported by precise studies. The basic treatment&#xD;
      is beneficial in the long term: by normalizing uricemia, it controls gouty disease. We want&#xD;
      to show that the early introduction is as well tolerated as its abstention which is the&#xD;
      current recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of gout attack is based on recently established American-European criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the hyporuricemic molecule is febuxostat, on the one hand because of a greater&#xD;
      potency of action than allopurinol at the available dosages, which should make it possible to&#xD;
      obtain a clear reduction in uraemia (of approximately 40%) and on the other hand easy to use&#xD;
      - without dose adjustment - in patients with renal insufficiency with a creatinine clearance&#xD;
      greater than 30 ml / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients participating in the study is set at 128, which is higher than the&#xD;
      published prospective studies. Patients will be randomized (in order of succession when&#xD;
      entering the study) into 2 groups, the first receiving febuxostat immediately for 6 weeks,&#xD;
      the second receiving no immediate febuxostat treatment - which corresponds to current&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study covers several periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the first, lasting 6 weeks, will allow a direct comparison of febuxostat with no DMARD:&#xD;
           this is the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the second is an extension phase and runs from the 7th to the 12th week where each&#xD;
           patient in the context of routine care is treated with febuxostat: it makes it possible&#xD;
           to compare the immediate use of the febuxostat (phase S0-S1 of the group 1) to its&#xD;
           delayed administration (phase S6-S12 of group 2 with delayed administration) in terms of&#xD;
           recurrence of gouty attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the 3 ° of 3 months allows a later evaluation at 6 months of therapeutic maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations will take place at the end of the 2nd and 6th week (plus or minus 3 days) and&#xD;
      at the end of the 3rd and 6th month (plus or minus one week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are carried out by an assessor who does not know the treatment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are based on the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1- The number of days with gouty joint crisis, its location, reported by the patient in a&#xD;
      booklet filled out daily: the occurrence of a new attack according to the criteria evaluated&#xD;
      will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - Assessment by the patient of his condition (pain, asthenia, walking, overall condition)&#xD;
      by daily use of the VAS scale. Two functional indexes will be used and have been evaluated in&#xD;
      gout -: the SF 36 Physical Dimension is filled during the 6 ° and 12 ° week visits: this&#xD;
      index was chosen because it was not specific for a joint disease. and evaluate a period of 4&#xD;
      weeks; HAQ, developed for rheumatoid arthritis, evaluates a period of 2 weeks and provides a&#xD;
      correct estimate of overall physical function (locomotor status) in tophaceae gout, less in&#xD;
      the absence of tophus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 - Assessment by the doctor of the patient's clinical condition: joint and somatic&#xD;
      examination: arthritis (yes or no), presence of tophi, arterial pressure, cardiovascular and&#xD;
      skin examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 - Collection of drug intolerances. 5 - At W6 and W12, biological examinations will be&#xD;
      carried out, according to the recommendations: determination of uricemia, serum creatinine,&#xD;
      transaminases, CRP and determination of the CBC-platelets which makes it possible to control&#xD;
      the intake and the biological tolerance of the hypouricemic treatment, the level of&#xD;
      biological inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the crisis will respond to European recommendations and will be left to the&#xD;
      doctor's free initiative. This treatment will be immediately followed by a preventive&#xD;
      treatment for relapse at the recommended doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Febuxostat:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its indication will not refer to European recommendations but to French recommendations:&#xD;
      hypo-uricemic treatment is indicated as soon as the diagnosis of gout is retained. It will be&#xD;
      delivered at the same time as the treatment of the crisis, within 5 days maximum following&#xD;
      its diagnosis.&#xD;
