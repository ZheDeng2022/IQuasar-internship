  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates patients' perceptions of their doctor's or nurse's empathy during an&#xD;
      in-person interaction with the doctor or nurse wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)&#xD;
      compared to during a video interaction with the doctor or nurse without PPE. The goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to learn whether patients who visit the Acute Cancer Care Center at MD&#xD;
      Anderson believe they get better (more empathetic) care from doctors who visit them in person&#xD;
      wearing PPE or from doctors who visit them by video call and do not wear PPE.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether patients perceive their healthcare practitioner as more empathetic&#xD;
      during an in-person interaction with the practitioner wearing personal protective equipment&#xD;
      (PPE), or during a video interaction without the need for PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether certain physicians perform better with video whereas others perform&#xD;
      better in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize generational differences in patient perception of healthcare practitioner&#xD;
      empathy during an in person interaction with the practitioner wearing PPE, or during a video&#xD;
      interaction without the need for PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: After initial visit, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A (NO PPE): Patients receive standard of care via video call with treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B (WEARING PPE): Patients receive standard of care in-person physician visits.&#xD;
