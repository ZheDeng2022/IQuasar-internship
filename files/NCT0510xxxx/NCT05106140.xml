  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RELEARN trial is a a prospective longitudinal cohort study sampled by convenience. Stroke&#xD;
      survivors and healthy control individuals will be recruited to analyze motor learning in the&#xD;
      upper extremity and its neural basis in early stroke recovery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In stroke rehabilitation, clinicians guide the relearning of motor skills to promote recovery&#xD;
      and improve function. A common assumption is that motor learning interacts with processes&#xD;
      that are involved in tissue repair and helps to engage neuroplastic mechanisms that promote&#xD;
      recovery. One of the biggest roadblocks for advancing the treatment of motor deficits is that&#xD;
      we do not understand how motor learning changes after stroke, and critically, if poor&#xD;
      recovery is due to a loss in an individual's ability to adapt or learn. Existing clinical&#xD;
      tests do not directly assess motor learning. This means that therapists can profile stroke&#xD;
      impairments (motor, sensory, cognitive, etc.) but cannot directly measure a patient's ability&#xD;
      to learn, which is likely an important factor in recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RELEARN trial will pair robotics, an objective tool to assess post-stroke arm impairment,&#xD;
      with neuroimaging to link motor learning deficits with possible influencing factors (sensory,&#xD;
      motor, cognitive function) and damage in specific brain areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with stroke will undergo clinical and robotic evaluations at baseline (within&#xD;
      1-13 days post-stroke), at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and again at 26 weeks. An MRI assessment&#xD;
      will occur during week 6. Stroke participants will complete a 24hr retention assessment after&#xD;
      baseline visit and week 26 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control participants will undergo a single robotic evaluation and a 24hr retention&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The robotic assessment consists of a number of upper limb tests of neurologic function which have been validated against standard clinical measures. Tasks include: Visually Guided Reaching, Limb Position Matching, and Limb Kinesthesia. These assessments use z-scores, based on normal distributions, as a measure of performance. Scores within 1.96 standard deviations away from 0 are considered normal and scores beyond 1.96 standard deviations are considered impaired.</description>
