  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication and currently used to treat pain and&#xD;
      inflammation caused by osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      study the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the new nanoformed 20mg tablet formulation of&#xD;
      piroxicam in comparison with a reference 20mg piroxicam tablet formulation. The target of&#xD;
      nanoforming is to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs with low solubility,&#xD;
      potentially leading to the use of lower doses with concomitant improvements in safety and&#xD;
      tolerability. Piroxicam is an appropriate candidate to demonstrate the benefits of&#xD;
      nanoforming due to its physiochemical properties. The efficacy of the Nanoformed Piroxicam is&#xD;
      evaluated in comparison to the reference product Felden速 Tabs 20 mg. The study also is&#xD;
      conducted with a second reference product, Brexidol速 20 mg, or a nanoformed piroxicam tablet&#xD;
      of a different strength, or study the effect of food intake on the absorption of the&#xD;
      nanofomed piroxicam tablet. The study is conducted with healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, partly-randomised, part-cross-over up to three-period,&#xD;
      comparative bioavailability study in healthy male and female subjects, designed to&#xD;
      investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and safety of Nanoformed Piroxicam Immediate&#xD;
      Release (IR) Tablet, 5 - 20 mg and Felden速 (piroxicam) Tablets 20 mg (reference) with an&#xD;
      optional Brexidol速 (piroxicam) Tablets 20 mg (alternative reference; optional in Period 3.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive single oral doses of the investigational medicinal product across up to&#xD;
      3 treatment periods in either the fasted or fed state (optional in Period 3 only). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment sequences across Periods 1 and 2 which will be dosed&#xD;
      in the fasted state. Following completion of Period 2, there will be an interim analysis of&#xD;
      the PK and safety data generated from both previous periods to decide whether to proceed to&#xD;
      an optional Period 3 and, if progression is made, to dose the Nanoformed Piroxicam IR Tablet,&#xD;
      5 - 20 mg in the fed state, an alternative dose level of Nanoformed Piroxicam IR Tablet, 5 -&#xD;
      20 mg in the fasted state or an alternative reference product in the fasted state in Period 3&#xD;
      (optional). The maximum dose of piroxicam that will be administered in any period of the&#xD;
      study is 20 mg. For Period 3, if the Nanoformed Piroxicam IR Tablet, 5 - 20 mg formulation is&#xD;
      selected, the dose will be selected from a bracketing dose range of 5 to 20 mg. Each period&#xD;
      will follow the same study design. There will be a minimum washout of 12 days between each&#xD;
      product administration. It is expected that the study will be executed in a single group,&#xD;
      requiring a total of 3 study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is exploratory and no formal sample size calculation has been made. Based on&#xD;
      experience from previous studies of a similar design, a total of 12 subjects are to be&#xD;
      enrolled and a minimum of 8 evaluable subjects are considered sufficient.&#xD;
