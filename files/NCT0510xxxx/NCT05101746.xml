      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of nitric oxide by measuring glial fibrillary&#xD;
           acid protein (GFAP) before and after surgery. GFAP will be analyzed via an enzyme-linked&#xD;
           immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Patients will also be monitored post-operatively for&#xD;
           delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the renal protective effect of nitric oxide by measuring neutrophil&#xD;
           gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) before and after surgery. NGAL will also be&#xD;
           analyzed via an ELISA kit. Patient creatinine will be monitored post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate effect of nitric oxide on other ICU outcomes (invasive mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation, days to extubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and blood product&#xD;
           administration).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corrective cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) is associated with numerous postoperative complications including neural tissue&#xD;
      damage resulting in long-term neurocognitive deficits as well as acute kidney injury&#xD;
      impacting renal function. Non-cardiac organ complications result in an increased mortality&#xD;
      and length of hospital stay. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to play a protective role in a&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response, with administration of NO reducing damage to the liver,&#xD;
      lungs, kidney, and brain in experimental models. Recent studies have demonstrated that for&#xD;
      pediatric CHD patients undergoing corrective surgery administration of NO to the bypass&#xD;
      circuit resulted in myocardial protection, reduced incidence of low cardiac output syndrome,&#xD;
      and improved post-operative ICU course. NO in adult populations undergoing CPB has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated to decrease the incidence of acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though prior studies have shown wide ranging protective effects from NO during CPB, these&#xD;
      have not been fully characterized for neural and renal tissue for the pediatric population.&#xD;
      Due to NO's promise in protective effects for other end organ damage the investigators are&#xD;
      interested in investigating its potential to mitigate damage to neural and renal tissue. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that NO administration during CPB will be associated with reduced&#xD;
      acute neurologic insult, reduced acute kidney injury postoperatively, and increased&#xD;
      ventilator-free days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses the investigators propose a study where one group receives the&#xD;
      current standard of care at Vanderbilt (standard surgery and CPB) and the other group&#xD;
      receives NO administration during CPB in addition to standard surgery and CPB. The&#xD;
      investigators propose using validated biomarkers to determine the effect of NO on the brain&#xD;
      and kidney. GFAP is a biomarker for acute neurologic injury and NGAL is a biomarker of acute&#xD;
      kidney injury. The biomarkers will be analyzed from blood drawn prior to and during surgery&#xD;
      from existing lines in place as part of the procedure and will not necessitate additional&#xD;
      needle sticks. No devices will be evaluated in this study; the investigators will only be&#xD;
      measuring the effect of NO on neurological, renal and other ICU outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Daily prevalence of delirium will be monitored using the psCAM-ICU which is currently monitored daily in the pediatric ICU. The psCAM-ICU is designed to assess for delirium in critically ill children, with or without mechanical ventilation. The psCAM-ICU was designed with cognitive testing that is developmentally appropriate for infants-5 year olds.&#xD;
Patients are first assessed for arousal from -5 to +4 with -5 being unarousable to physical stimuli and +4 being combative. If arousal is greater than or equal to -3 than the patient is evaluated for the presence 4 features: 1) Acute change or fluctuating course of mental status, 2) Inattention, 3) Altered level of consciousness, 4) Disorganized thinking. Presence of 1 AND 2 AND either 3 OR 4 constitutes a positive result. The test results in the patient either being positive or negative for the presence of delirium.</description>

    <description>Organ dysfunctions will be tracked for up to 14 days during the Intervention Phase using the daily pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA) scoring tool that is based on continuous as well as established predefined age appropriate cut offs for each organ failure. The following measurements are included: a. Creatinine (kidney), b. arterial oxygen saturation or arterial oxygen partial pressure over the fraction of inspired oxygen (lung), c. Total bilirubin (hepatic), d. Platelet count (coagulation), e. Glasgow coma score (neurologic), and f. Hemodynamic indices with +/-need for vasopressor (cardiovascular). These each receive a score of 0 to 4 based on the severity of the lab findings abnormality, with 0 being normal and 4 being the most severe. These are used to calculate a total score of 0 to 24, with 24 indicating a high risk of poor outcomes.</description>

The FSS is a survey that tracks 6 domains (mental status, sensory, communication, motor function, feeding, respiratory) with a scoring from 1 to 5 each, with 1 being normal function and 5 being very severe dysfunction. Total scores will range from 6 to 30, with 6 being normal function and 30 being very severe dysfunction.</description>
