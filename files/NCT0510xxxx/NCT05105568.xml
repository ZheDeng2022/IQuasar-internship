  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to examine the effects of process-based therapy on 6 adult patients&#xD;
      presenting for treatment at a university community outpatient clinic using a nonconcurrent&#xD;
      multiple baseline design.&#xD;

      Process-based therapy (PBT) is a meta-theoretical model of evidence-based therapies that&#xD;
      organizes adaptive and maladaptive processes of change using complex and dynamic networks&#xD;
      based on an evolution science framework. Although papers and books have been written on PBT,&#xD;
      PBT has yet to be empirically tested as an intervention in a clinical setting. The proposed&#xD;
      study aims to examine the effects of PBT on 6 adult patients presenting for treatment at a&#xD;
      university community outpatient clinic using a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that network structures of patients will change in an adaptive direction over the&#xD;
      course of PBT and that these changes will be maintained at 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place remotely over HIPAA-compliant Zoom or in person at the Center for&#xD;
      Anxiety and Related Disorders (CARD), depending on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and&#xD;
      participants' preferences. Variables of interest include idiographic items specific to the&#xD;
      individual (e.g., treatment goals, problem behaviors, valued action, psychological phenomena,&#xD;
      contextual influences) and physiological data (e.g., physical activity, screen time).&#xD;
      Throughout the study until 1-month follow-up, participants will be randomly prompted 4 times&#xD;
      a day to rate idiographic items via Ethica, an app-based platform for smartphones that&#xD;
      collects questionnaire data and passive objective data from sensors. Physiological data will&#xD;
      be collected passively through Ethica. These variables will comprise the network used to&#xD;
      characterize each participant's presentation. In addition to examining network structures, we&#xD;
      will use the Process-Based Assessment Tool (PBAT; Ciarrochi, Hayes, Hofmann, 2021) as a&#xD;
      nomothetic measure of PBT-related improvement. The proposed study will provide a proof of&#xD;
      concept for PBT, evaluate its efficacy, and demonstrate how it can be applied in a real-world&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

    <description>Network models will be created using intensive longitudinal data collected four times daily. Variables to be measured will depend on the participant's presenting concern. For example, if Participant A reports struggling with avoiding work meetings related to fears about how they will be perceived by their supervisor and co-workers, then we might track percentage of work meetings attended (behavioral goal) and fear of social evaluation (source of distress). Where possible, these items will be assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 to 100 to ensure an adequate range of responding. Because items will be personalized to the participant's presenting concern, we will not be using a standardized scale or questionnaire. Rather, we will be developing idiographic items specific to the participant's presentation and assess variables relevant to the individual.</description>

    <description>The Process-Based Assessment Tool (PBAT) is a new measure that is currently being validated (Ciarrochi et al., 2021, in preparation). The PBAT has 9 subscales: affect, cognitive processes, attention, social/connection needs, motivation/autonomy needs, overt behavior/competence needs, health, variation, and retention.</description>

    <description>Process-based therapy (PBT) is a meta-theoretical model of evidence-based therapies that organizes adaptive and maladaptive processes of change using complex and dynamic networks based on an evolution science framework. Depending on the participant's presentation, PBT would be shaped by different evidence-based techniques. Examples of evidence-based procedures include: behavioral activation, exposures, mindfulness, self-compassion, values exploration, and contingency management.</description>

&#xD;
          5. Willingness to abstain from other psychotherapies for duration of study (up to 1-month&#xD;
             follow-up; this is so we can be more confident that changes observed during the study&#xD;
             are attributable to the study intervention rather than an external intervention;&#xD;
             clinically, it is also typically counterproductive for a patient to see multiple&#xD;
