  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines how head and neck cancer treatment affects quality of sleep over time and&#xD;
      factors that contribute to sleep quality. Sleep plays a critical role in healing and quality&#xD;
      of life, and recent studies investigating sleep disorders in head and neck cancer patients&#xD;
      reveal sleep quality is a major determinant of post-treatment outcomes. Information from this&#xD;
      study may help researchers better understand how treatment impacts sleep quality so that they&#xD;
      can make changes that may help improve patient sleep quality.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the five (5) components of sleep quality in head and neck patients under&#xD;
      different stages of post-op treatment and different environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of surgery, treatment and environment on the five (5) components&#xD;
      of sleep quality in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the association between the five (5) components of sleep quality and comorbid&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (STOP-BANG and Epworth Sleeping Scale) and depression (Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-2 [PHQ-2]), under different stages of post-op treatment and different&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the association between Fitbit actigraphy data (i.e. the 5th component of&#xD;
      sleep quality) and the first 4 components of sleep quality for inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the inpatient versus the outpatient responses on sleep hygiene at different&#xD;
      time points of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether survey results warrant additional counseling or patient education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1-TP1: Patients complete surveys over 20 minutes on post-op day 3 and on day of&#xD;
      discharge (or within 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1-TP2: Patients complete surveys over 15 minutes at all regularly scheduled follow-up&#xD;
      appointments (approximately 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients complete surveys over 15 minutes once.&#xD;
