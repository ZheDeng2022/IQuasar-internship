  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors theorize that periodontal flap surgery therapy with adjunctive DL therapy might&#xD;
      bring favourable therapy results (clinical and bacterial parameters) in patients with stage&#xD;
      3-grade C periodontitis. Therefore, the goal of this split-mouth randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of the treatment results for DL assisted&#xD;
      modified Widman Flap (MWF) surgery (test site) with MWF surgery alone (control site) in&#xD;
      periodontitis patients with stage 3-grade C by determining the changes in clinical parameters&#xD;
      and bacterial load of pathogens (P.g., T.d., Camplyobacter rectus (C.r.), Prevotella&#xD;
      intermedia (P.i.), T.f., A.a.) at preoperative and following MWF surgery at 6th week, 3rd and&#xD;
      6th months&#xD;

      A randomised control split-mouth study were performed at the Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry, Bülent Ecevit University, Zonguldak, Turkey, between January 2013 and&#xD;
      February 2016.After clinical evaluation, a total of 30 subjects, who showed signs of stage&#xD;
      3-grade C periodontitis, were enrolled to this study at baseline. These patients were&#xD;
      underwent a full mouth scaling and root planning (SRP). Six weeks after non surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy, periodontal assessment was performed to confirm the suitability of the&#xD;
      sites for periodontal surgery. This split-mouth study was conducted in 18 patients with stage&#xD;
      3 Grade C periodontitis aged between 22 and 35 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgery, the selected quadrants were randomly allocted (by the toss of a coin)&#xD;
      into test and control sites where the control site were treated with MWF+sham application of&#xD;
      DL and test sites were treated with MWF+ active DL. Clinical parameters including CAL, PD,&#xD;
      plaque index(PI), gingival index(GI), bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded and&#xD;
      microbiological sampling were obtained at preoperative and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. Pain scale assessment (visual analog scale, VAS), pain medication&#xD;
      consumption (PM), tissue edema (TE), and tissue color (TC) were evaluated one week following&#xD;
      surgery. Microbiological analysis was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for&#xD;
      detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Treponema denticola (T.d.), Tannerella&#xD;
      forsythia (T.f.), Camplyobacter rectus (C.r.), Prevotella intermedia (P.i.), Aggregatibacter&#xD;
      actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control sites were treated MWF with sham application of DL, while test sites were treated MWF&#xD;
      with the applying of active DL (810nm±5, Picasso-AMD, USA) to the inside of the MWF. The&#xD;
      interval between the two surgeries was 3 weeks. The modified Widman flap technique was&#xD;
      applied.DL with a wavelength of 810±5 nm and a power of 1 watt in continuous mode was applied&#xD;
      to the MWF at the test sites. A 400 micron diameter tip was used to remove all visible&#xD;
      epithelium on the inside of the flap from the free gingival edge to the lower apical aspect&#xD;
      of the flap (both labial and lingual / palatal). The tip was started using a blue&#xD;
      articulating paper. DL irradiation performed at a 45o angle to the soft tissue flap to avoid&#xD;
      any laser (810nm±5) contact to the root surface or the alveolar bone . DL therapy was carried&#xD;
      out to soft tissue from the coronal to the apical aspect in parallel paths for 10seconds.&#xD;
      When irradiation exceeded 10 seconds in time, laser (810nm) emission was be interrupted for&#xD;
      30 seconds. The resultant char layer was be totally removed with moist gauze prior to&#xD;
      replacing the flaps. A second laser application with the same laser (810nm±5) was performed&#xD;
      on all the surfaces of the flap in continuous mode at 0.1 watts. All surfaces of the flap,&#xD;
      inner and outer, exposed bone and exposed root structures involved in the surgery were&#xD;
      irradiated, leading to a total dosage of 4 J/cm2 per surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were prescribed 200 mg Ibuprofen (up to 3 tablets) every 8 hours to reduce pain.&#xD;
      The subjects were instructed not to eat solid food using the treated area and to not brush&#xD;
      the teeth in the treated area. They were told to rinse their mouth with chlorhexidine&#xD;
      digluconate (0.2%, CHX) twice a day for 1 min during one week after surgery The sutures were&#xD;
      removed at first week . After 1 weeks, the subject started brushing their teeth and oral&#xD;
      hygiene training was repeated. Oral hygiene instructions were provided at each postoperative&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
