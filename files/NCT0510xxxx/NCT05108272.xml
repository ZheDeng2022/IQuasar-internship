  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic scars and keloids are frequently encountered in plastic surgery OPD. due to any&#xD;
      reason, the normal wound healing is impaired, hypertrophic scars or keloids occur. These are&#xD;
      thickened, wide and raised scars. Many treatment options are presented over time, but most of&#xD;
      the treatments remain insufficient. Treatment options include massage therapy, silicone&#xD;
      sheet, occlusive dressings, pressure garments, adhesive tape, intra-lesional steroid&#xD;
      injections, laser therapy, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, interferons, bleomycin,&#xD;
      imiquimod 5%cream, tranilast, botulin toxin and surgical excision. In this Study outcomes of&#xD;
      treatment with silicone sheeting and microneedling will be compaired.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic scars and keloids are one of difficult conditions to treat. Prevention of&#xD;
      abnormal scaring is more effective than treatment, so avoiding unnecessary wounds in patients&#xD;
      is a solution but flawed one. Many treatment options are presented over time, but most of the&#xD;
      treatments remain insufficient. Treatment options include massage therapy, silicone sheet,&#xD;
      occlusive dressings, pressure garments, adhesive tape, intra-lesional steroid injections,&#xD;
      laser therapy, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, interferons, bleomycin, imiquimod&#xD;
      5%cream, tranilast, botulin toxin and surgical excision. Silicone sheeting is considered&#xD;
      first line therapy of hypertrophic scar. It works by maintaining hydration and occlusion at&#xD;
      scar site. But silicone sheeting is expensive and need 12 to 24 hours of constant application&#xD;
      daily for at least 2 months for desired results. Level 1, 2 and 3 evidences show newer&#xD;
      technique 'percutaneous collagen induction(micro-needling)', shows significant improvement in&#xD;
      hypertrophic scars. Micro-needling causes controlled dermal injury to initiate inflammatory&#xD;
      and healing reaction, which in turn leads to remodelling of collagen and stimulate&#xD;
      regeneration of scared skin. Silicone sheets is an expensive treatment requiring multiple&#xD;
      applications and are often difficult to use in hot and humid environment. These reasons often&#xD;
      lead to poor patient compliance. Keeping these issues in mind we planned to study an&#xD;
      alternative option i.e. micro-needling, which is relatively of low cost and better patient&#xD;
      acceptability. When doing the literature review the investigator found scanty evidence so the&#xD;
      investigator decided to perform this RCT.&#xD;

    <description>It will be assessed using, Vancouver scar scale at time of presentation and at 3 months after the intervention. Pre and post intervention ratings will be compared and percentage increase or decrease in the rating will be documented. Vancouver Scar Scale is a 13 points scale and includes four parameters, pigmentation, vascularity pliability and height of scar.13 It is an objective scale and examining doctor will assess and record score out of 13. Lesser the score better is the scar.</description>

    <measure>Itching at scar site</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed at the time of presentation and at 3 months after the intervention using severity of pruritus scale. It is 4 point rating scale from 0 (no itch) to 3(severe itch disturbing the sleep) assessing severity of pruritus within 24-hours recall period. Pre and post intervention ratings will be compared and percentage increase or decrease in the rating will be documented.</description>

    <measure>Pain At scar Site</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will be asked to rate his/her current, best and worst pain level over past 24 hours on scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Pain at scar site will be assessed at time of presentation and then at 3 months after start of the treatment. Pre and post intervention ratings will be compared and percentage increase or decrease in the rating will be documented. This scale is chosen due to its high feasibility and good compliance.</description>

    <description>After explaining and taking consent from the patient about the intervention, pre intervention assessment will be made. Silicone gel sheet (Rystoraº) will be used at scar wound for 16 hours every day for 3 months. After 3 months post intervention assessment will be made.</description>

    <description>After explaining and taking consent from the patient about the intervention, pre- intervention assessment will be made. Derma pen (Dr.Pen auto Microneedle system Ultima-A6) with 36 needles per cm2 will be used with adjustable depth of 0.5mm to 2mm. Micro-needling will be performed in 3 axis,1st in vertical, then horizontal and then oblique direction to the point of uniform petechial bleed. Four sessions at 3 weekly intervals will be performed. Final assessment will be made after 3 months of first intervention</description>
