      This study is designed as a phase I clinical trial of multi-center, open, dose escalation,&#xD;
      and extended research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study mainly evaluates the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics of BAT6026&#xD;
      injection in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors, explores the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, and provides a basis for the recommended dose of&#xD;
      subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is divided into 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage: dose escalation study. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of BAT6026 were explored using rapid titration and the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation&#xD;
      rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the clinical efficacy benefit of a single drug may be limited, from the ethical point&#xD;
      of view of exposing fewer subjects to invalid doses, this dose escalation study uses rapid&#xD;
      titration and the &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation rule to explore the safe dose range . A total of 7&#xD;
      (or 8) dose groups are set up, namely the 0.01 mg/kg group, 0.03mg/kg group, 0.1mg/kg group,&#xD;
      0.3mg/kg group, 1mg/kg group, 3mg/kg group, 6mg/kg Group and 10mg/kg group (optional). Among&#xD;
      them, the 0.01mg/kg group and the 0.03mg/kg group use accelerated titration Method to&#xD;
      increase the dose; 0.1mg/kg group, 0.3mg/kg group, 1mg/kg group, 3mg/kg group, The 6mg/kg&#xD;
      group and the 10mg/kg group were studied in dose escalation according to the standard &quot;3+3&quot;&#xD;
      rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group/Ascending Method Dose (mg/kg) Group Number of People A/single subject 0.01 1, or 3~6&#xD;
      B/single subject 0.03 1, or 3~6 C/&quot;Standard 3+3&quot; 0.1 3~6 D/&quot;Standard 3+3&quot; 0.3 3~6 E/&quot;Standard&#xD;
      3+3&quot; 1 3~6 F/&quot;Standard 3+3&quot; 3 3~6 G*/&quot;Standard 3+3&quot; 6 3~6 H*/&quot;Standard 3+3&quot; 10 3~6 *Remarks:&#xD;
      After the completion of the dose escalation study of groups A to G, after comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of safety and other factors, it may be considered as appropriate whether to add a&#xD;
      10 mg/kg dose group for further tolerability exploration; it can also be discussed with the&#xD;
      investigator according to the specific situation. A new dose is selected between the dose&#xD;
      that stops climbing and the previous lower dose group, and the experiment is conducted&#xD;
      according to the above rules to determine the more accurate maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation rules are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two dose groups A and B adopt an accelerated titration dose escalation plan, that&#xD;
      is, cohort size=1. First, one case of group A is included. If no ≥ 2 grade toxic reaction&#xD;
      related to the study drug is observed, they can directly enter group B for dose escalation.&#xD;
      By analogy with this rule (&quot;1+1&quot;), the increase will be accelerated to Group C. If during the&#xD;
      accelerated escalation process, once a group has observed a ≥2 level toxic reaction related&#xD;
      to the study drug, the accelerated titration dose escalation should be stopped, and two more&#xD;
      subjects need to be included in the dose group to be converted to the standard &quot;3+ 3&quot; dose&#xD;
      escalation (ie, cohort size=3) mode until MTD or MAD is reached. Starting from Group C, it is&#xD;
      adjusted to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; rule of dose increasing mode, the increasing mode is shown in&#xD;
      the following table:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of people with DLT/number of people in current dose group Decision of dose increase or&#xD;
      decrease 0/3 3 new subjects receive the next high-dose group trial 1/3 The current dose group&#xD;
      was added to the group with 3 new subjects 1/3 and 0/3 (ie 1/6) 3 new subjects receive the&#xD;
      next high-dose group trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥2/3 or ≥2/6 indicates that the dose has exceeded the MTD, and the dose escalation should be&#xD;
      stopped. If there are 6 people in the previous dose group, use the previous lower dose group&#xD;
      as MTD. If there are only 3 people in the previous dose group, 3 people will be added to the&#xD;
      previous dose group. After 3 additional people, if there are ≥ 2 DLTs in the previous dose&#xD;
      group, the MTD will continue to decrease. If MTD is explored, the sponsor can discuss with&#xD;
      the investigator according to the specific situation and select MTD or a dose lower than MTD&#xD;
      as the phase II clinical study Recommended dosage. If the MTD is not reached, the sponsor may&#xD;
      also discuss with the investigator based on the specific situation, and select a dose of MAD&#xD;
      or a dose group below MAD as the recommended dose for the phase II clinical study as&#xD;
      appropriate. As the research progresses, the DLT definition can be revised as appropriate&#xD;
      based on new clinical findings. Although the adverse events that meet the DLT criteria or&#xD;
      other adverse safety information deemed by the researcher to be meaningful outside the DLT&#xD;
      evaluation period do not directly affect the dose escalation decision, they need to be taken&#xD;
      into account in the final decision on RP2D. The sponsor and investigator will Before the dose&#xD;
      is increased, the existing safety, PK (if any), effectiveness and other information should be&#xD;
      used to discuss and comprehensively evaluate the decision-making of dose increase or&#xD;
      decrease. When tolerability is explored according to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation rule,&#xD;
      all subjects in the previous dose group must complete a 21-day DLT observation before the&#xD;
      next dose group is enrolled in the cohort. In the dose escalation study, a maximum of 2&#xD;
      subjects in each group are allowed to be in the DLT observation period at the same time.&#xD;
      Within each dose group, There must be a time interval of at least 24 hours between the&#xD;
      administration of the first enrolled subject and the subsequent enrolled subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjustments for dose reduction are not allowed. The dose is allowed to be increased as&#xD;
      appropriate, but extreme caution is required, and at least it needs to be met at the same&#xD;
      time: ①The subject has received at least 4 cycles of study drug treatment; ②After discussion&#xD;
      between the sponsor and the investigator, it is deemed that the subject has received a higher&#xD;
      first-level dose The treatment of the current dose group will bring more clinical benefits;&#xD;
      ③The higher-level dose group has passed the follow-up dose escalation study and proved to&#xD;
      have not reached the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage: Dose extension study. Based on the preliminary safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      results of the dose escalation study, the investigator and the sponsor decide whether to&#xD;
      choose an appropriate dose group for the extended study, further study the safety and&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of BAT6026, and provide a basis for subsequent clinical studies. A&#xD;
      study of 2 dose cohorts is planned, and each cohort has no less than 6 subjects for PK study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall research cycle is roughly divided into the screening period, the treatment&#xD;
      period, and the follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period: -28d~0d, that is, after signing the informed consent form, the screening&#xD;
      evaluation can be completed within 28 days; Treatment period: every 3 weeks is a dosing&#xD;
      cycle. The study drug is given on the first day of each cycle. Starting from the second&#xD;
      cycle, the dosing time window can be ±3 days, but within 72 hours before each dosing, except&#xD;
      In addition to imaging examinations, subjects must complete various examinations including&#xD;
      vital signs, laboratory examinations, and physical status scoring. The test subjects also&#xD;
      need to complete the clinical tumor imaging evaluation (evaluation The method is consistent,&#xD;
      CT or MRI). Study drug treatment should continue until emergence: disease progression/death,&#xD;
      or withdrawal due to intolerable toxicity, or acceptance of new anti-tumor therapy due to no&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit, or withdrawal of informed consent and voluntary withdrawal for other&#xD;
      reasons, or up to 17 Cycles (approximately 1 year), whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT evaluation period is defined as the first treatment cycle, that is, from the first&#xD;
      administration to 21 days after the administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period: If the subject stops using study medication, the treatment period will be&#xD;
      deemed to be over(End of Therapy, EOT). All subjects, including those who discontinued&#xD;
      treatment for any reason (except for loss of follow-up, death,withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent), will arrange an EOT visit in a timely manner within 21 + 7 days after receiving the&#xD;
      last study drug or before receiving subsequent new anti-tumor treatments . The EOT visit&#xD;
      should include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, clinical tumor&#xD;
      imaging evaluation (CT or MRI) and other examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up: After receiving the last dose of study drug, the subjects are required to&#xD;
      be at 21 + 7 days,A safety visit was conducted on days and 90 days (±7 days), including&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events (irAE), until 90 days or the subject received new anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy. Safety visits must be conducted at the research center, and various examinations&#xD;
      such as vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory examinations should be performed&#xD;
      to evaluate AEs, concomitant medications, and concomitant treatments. Until the adverse event&#xD;
      related to the study drug disappears (or drops to ≤1 level), if the adverse event still&#xD;
      exists after the subject stops treatment, the investigator has the discretion to determine&#xD;
      the frequency of follow-up according to the actual clinical situation until the investigator&#xD;
      considers it undesirable The outcome of the event is returning to normal, stable at an&#xD;
      acceptable level, or no further improvement. Survival follow-up: After the safety follow-up,&#xD;
      the subjects were followed up for survival every 12 weeks (±14 days), followed by telephone&#xD;
      until death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent, observation for 1 year or&#xD;
      termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed that the sponsor will not provide additional study drugs after&#xD;
      completion/discontinuation of study drugs. If necessary, the subjects are recommended to&#xD;
      return to the research center, and the investigator and the sponsor will discuss and&#xD;
      formulate a new study medication treatment plan for the subjects.&#xD;
