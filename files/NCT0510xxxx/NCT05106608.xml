  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Photobiomodulation therapy could have positive effects on quality of life and oral health&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer survivors post-radiotherapy. The improvement in quality of life will&#xD;
      be maintained after a follow-up period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many experts advocate the use of Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy in patients with cancer and&#xD;
      demand studies of higher methodological quality such as randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials. However, there is no consensus on the most effective dosimetry that allows us to&#xD;
      establish an effective and safe approach to treat radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in head and&#xD;
      neck cancer survivors. Finally, recent reviews highlight the importance of determining&#xD;
      whether or not the effects of Photobiomodulation therapy are maintained after a follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the three study groups using a random number generation program (EPIDAT 4.2, Xunta de Galicia). The randomization sequence will be prepared by a member external to the investigation to respect the masking in terms of randomization of the participants, thus reducing the risk of bias during the evaluations. Therefore both patients and evaluator will be masked.</masking_description>
