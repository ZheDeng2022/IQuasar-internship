      A Phase 2 multi-center open-label basket trial of ABI-009 (nab sirolimus) for adult and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study TSC-007 is a prospective phase 2, open-label, multi-institutional basket trial to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety profile of ABI-009 administered to patients with pathogenic&#xD;
      inactivating alterations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes. Patients will be treated with single agent&#xD;
      IV nab-sirolimus until disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, or until in the opinion&#xD;
      of the investigator the patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at patient&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;

             ongoing or completed ≤14 days prior to enrollment (except for uncomplicated urinary&#xD;
             tract infection or upper respiratory tract infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric conditions or&#xD;
             other conditions that could affect their participation including:&#xD;

                  cord compression, untreated brain metastases or symptomatic or unstable brain&#xD;
                  metastases. Note: Patients with stable brain metastases (defined as asymptomatic&#xD;
                  or no requirement for high-dose [defined as dexamethasone 10 mg daily or higher]&#xD;
                  or increasing dose of systemic corticosteroids) and without imminent need of&#xD;
                  radiation therapy are eligible. If applicable, patients must have completed brain&#xD;
                  radiation therapy and recovered adequately from any associated toxicity and/or&#xD;
                  complications prior to eligibility assessment. For patients who have received&#xD;
                  prior radiation therapy, post-treatment MRI scan should show no increase in brain&#xD;
                  lesion size/volume.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  clinically significant cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pre-existing severely impaired lung function. If a patient has a pre-existing&#xD;
                  pulmonary condition, eligible patients should have a spirometry and diffusing&#xD;
                  capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) that is &gt;50% of the normal predicted value&#xD;
                  and/or O2 saturation that is &gt;88% at rest on room air (Note: spirometry and&#xD;
                  pulmonary function tests [PFTs] not required to be performed unless clinically&#xD;
                  indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be&#xD;

                  non-melanoma skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, resected incidental&#xD;
                  prostate cancer, or other adequately treated carcinoma-in-situ may be eligible,&#xD;
                  after documented discussion with Aadi / the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg and/or diastolic&#xD;

                  pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Individuals with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are excluded&#xD;
                  from this study as combination antiretroviral therapy could potentially result in&#xD;
                  significant pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, these individuals are at&#xD;
                  increased risk of serious infections due to the immunosuppressive effects of mTOR&#xD;
                  inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C, with detectable viral load. Note: A detailed&#xD;
                  assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done at&#xD;
                  screening for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Regarding concomitant medications with significant CYP3A4 and P-gp interactions,&#xD;
             discontinuation of strong inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,&#xD;
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and others), strong inducers (eg,&#xD;
             rifampin, rifabutin), and known CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window&#xD;
             (eg, fentanyl, alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, pimozide,&#xD;
             quinidine, or terfenadine) is required at least 5 half lives prior to receiving the&#xD;
             first dose of ABI-009, whichever is longer.&#xD;
