  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by severe and recurrent headaches. Children&#xD;
      and adolescents with migraine often present to the emergency department (ED) with acute&#xD;
      attacks, where migraine accounts for up to ~30% of all pediatric ED visits for headache.&#xD;
      Based on the limited evidence, many centers have adopted protocols whereby children and&#xD;
      adolescents who visit the ED with acute attacks of migraine are treated with an IV&#xD;
      neuroleptic (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) and an IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      (ketorolac). This combination of interventions is largely considered to be standard of care&#xD;
      despite no rigorous evidence to support this practice. Side effect rates with the&#xD;
      neuroleptics (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) are considerable, and IV catheters are&#xD;
      associated with high adverse event and failure rates in children and adolescents. Therefore,&#xD;
      the current standard of care for managing children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute&#xD;
      attacks of migraine poses concern to patients and is associated with significant pain and&#xD;
      frequent side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging neuromodulation devices show promise for expanding acute treatment options. Over the&#xD;
      past few years, there has been a growth in research investigating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      non-invasive neuromodulation, which delivers electrical or magnetic stimulation to nerves or&#xD;
      neural tissue, for the management of acute attacks of migraine. At present, there are 3&#xD;
      commercially available, non-invasive neuromodulation devices that effectively and safely&#xD;
      treat acute attacks of migraine in adults. Because none of these devices have a high level&#xD;
      evidence in children, adolescents, nor in the ED setting, there is clinical equipoise as to&#xD;
      which device would be most appropriate to study for treating children and adolescents&#xD;
      visiting the ED with acute attacks. Throughout our patient engagement work, children and&#xD;
      adolescents with migraine have identified that they are interested in trying remote&#xD;
      electrical neuromodulation for treating migraine attacks in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of executing a phase III RCT, in which children and adolescents&#xD;
      visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to REN or standard of care&#xD;
      IV treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in ten Canadian children and adolescents suffer from migraine, and visits to the&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department (ED) for acute attacks are common, with over 2,500 annual&#xD;
      visits in Alberta alone. Evidence-based acute management options for children and adolescents&#xD;
      presenting to the ED with acute attacks of migraine are limited. The current standard of&#xD;
      care, which comprises a combination of a neuroleptic (metoclopramide) and a non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory (ketorolac), has a low level of evidence and is administered through an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) cannula. However, at least half of children and adolescents presenting to&#xD;
      the ED with acute attacks of migraine would prefer to avoid an IV, and these standard of care&#xD;
      migraine interventions have substantial side effects and costs. The Nerivio remote electrical&#xD;
      neuromodulation (REN) device is a novel, non-invasive, wearable REN device that is applied to&#xD;
      the arm using an armband and wirelessly controlled by a smartphone software application. REN&#xD;
      has established efficacy and safety for the treatment of acute attacks of migraine in adults,&#xD;
      and preliminary open-label efficacy and safety data for use in adolescents. Through user&#xD;
      engagement efforts, the investigators have identified that children and adolescents with&#xD;
      migraine and ED providers are interested in trying REN to treat refractory acute attacks in&#xD;
      the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will aim to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a phase III RCT, in which&#xD;
      children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to&#xD;
      REN, or to standard of care IV treatment in a double-dummy design. The objectives of the&#xD;
      investigators are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of comparing REN to the standard of care IV intervention&#xD;
           (i.e., a combination of metoclopramide and ketorolac) for the treatment of children and&#xD;
           adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the acceptability of the study design and of using REN to treat children&#xD;
           and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To gather preliminary efficacy and safety data on the use of REN to treat children and&#xD;
           adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to carry out a pilot RCT to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of implementing a double-dummy, parallel-group RCT protocol. In this pilot&#xD;
      study, children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be&#xD;
      randomized to REN, or to standard of care IV treatment (i.e. a combination of metoclopramide&#xD;
      and ketorolac). Each group will also receive a blinded control (either normal saline through&#xD;
      the IV for the REN group, or sham stimulation for the standard of care IV group). Consenting&#xD;
      participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either REN or standard of care IV&#xD;
      treatment. The allocation sequence will be sent to the research pharmacy and will not be&#xD;
      accessible to anyone involved in the study or patient care. The REN group will receive active&#xD;
      stimulation and normal saline placebo that will appear identical in appearance and volume to&#xD;
      the medications given to the comparison group. The comparison group will receive a&#xD;
      combination of pharmaceutical interventions that are considered to be the standard of care&#xD;
      for treating children and adolescents visiting the ED with migraine: IV metoclopramide and IV&#xD;
      ketorolac. The comparison group will also receive sham stimulation that will be low enough&#xD;
      that it cannot induce conditioned pain modulation, the mechanism of action of REN, but it&#xD;
      will be perceptible and similar to the sensation induced by the REN device. Stimulation for&#xD;
      both groups occurs over 45 minutes. Efficacy and safety outcomes will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, and 48 hours post-intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The REN device is a battery-powered, wirelessly controlled neuromodulation device that attaches via armband to the upper arm. The REN device is controlled by a smartphone application and administers electrical stimulation to the local C and Aδ nociceptive sensory nerves of the upper arm. This stimulation is achieved using a symmetrical, biphasic, square pulse, modulated at a frequency between 100-120 Hz. Each pulse has a width of 400 µs and the user, via the smartphone application, can adjust the output current to apply a maximum of 40 mA. Each stimulation session occurs over 45 minutes and each device can administer up to 12 stimulation sessions.</description>

        shown that removing criterion A increases the sensitivity of these criteria in the ED. The&#xD;
        patient and their caregiver will also be required to understand spoken and written English.&#xD;
        In addition, potential participants will be required to have an upper arm circumference of&#xD;
        at least 20 cm to ensure optimal device fit and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria include the following: allergy or contraindication to metoclopramide,&#xD;
        ketorolac, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories; implanted electrical device, febrile at&#xD;
