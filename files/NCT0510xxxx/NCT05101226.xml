  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to research the effect of a 8-week long worksite yoga intervention on the&#xD;
      perceived health of the University of Bern employees. Furthermore, in light of the current&#xD;
      transition to online options, this study will compare the effects of yoga classes attended in&#xD;
      person to those attended online.&#xD;

      After giving informed consent, the participants of the study will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention or waiting list control group. The intervention group will take part in a 8-week&#xD;
      long yoga program before the christmas break, while the waiting list control group will&#xD;
      receive the same intervention at the beginning of the new year. For both time periods the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to the in person or the online group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four measurement times when all the participants will be asked to fill out an&#xD;
      online questionnaire before and after both implementations of the intervention. The&#xD;
      questionnaires include demographic data, perceived health (SF-8), perceived stress (PSS),&#xD;
      well-being (BIT), physical activity questionaire (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire)&#xD;
      as well as a questionnaire concerning the satisfaction of the intervention after the&#xD;
      participants have actively taken part in the yoga intervention.&#xD;
