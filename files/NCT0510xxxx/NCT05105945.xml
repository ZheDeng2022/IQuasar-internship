      We previously developed a novel non-trans thoracic esophagectomy, the single-port inflatable&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for the radical esophagectomy of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer.This study is evaluating the feasibility and safety of radical resection of&#xD;
      single-port inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal&#xD;
      carcinoma, as well as the clinical value of the radical resection of single-port inflatable&#xD;
      mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma as a new minimally&#xD;
      invasive operation for esophageal carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To reduce postoperative pulmonary complications, considerable efforts have been made to&#xD;
      develop the nontransthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. For instance, esophageal&#xD;
      stripping and transhiatal esophagectomy are the nontransthoracic operations developed for&#xD;
      treatment for esophageal cancer. These methods possess several advantages, including&#xD;
      non-thoracotomy, less postoperative pain, less postoperative cardiac and pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, and safer for elderly patients. However, these two methods are limited with&#xD;
      the poor surgical view, poor mediastinal lymph node dissection (especially upper mediastinal&#xD;
      lymph nodes), and high risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015 and 2016, Prof. Fujiwara has developed novel surgical methods on the dissection of&#xD;
      upper mediastinal lymph nodes using single-port mediastinoscopy through the cervical incision&#xD;
      and the lower mediastinal lymph nodes (including the subcarinal lymph nodes) by laparoscopy,&#xD;
      respectively.For the first time, non-transthoracic radical resection of esophageal cancer&#xD;
      could be achieved along with the dissection of all the mediastinal lymph nodes. Based on the&#xD;
      Fujiwara's method, we further improved this surgical method to the&quot;single-port inflatable&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for the radical treatment of esophageal cancer&quot;and&#xD;
      has successfully performed this novel surgical method for the first case in March 2016. We&#xD;
      have completed over 200 cases of radical resection of esophageal carcinoma using this novel&#xD;
      surgical technique from May 2016 to August 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open clinical study in which 1164 patients (including 10%&#xD;
      drop-off rate) who require surgical treatment are scheduled to be included in the study.&#xD;
      Prior to any screening process, each subject / legal guardian should sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Screening tests are used to determine whether each subject is eligible for the&#xD;
      study. Eligible subjects who meet the standard will be treated with radical resection of&#xD;
      single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal&#xD;
      carcinoma and followed up until 5 years postoperatively. Primary study outcome are the&#xD;
      prioperative complication rate and the number of intraoperative lymph node dissection.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Logrank method was used to compare the difference in survival time between the two groups of patients. According to previous literature data, it is estimated that the DFS of the control group is 18 months. Assuming that the DFS of the test group can be extended to 21.6 months (corresponding HR=1.20), the test requires 1048 patients (524 in each group) to achieve α=0.05 This difference can be detected with 80% confidence at the (two-sided) significance level. The trial plans to enroll for 48 months, follow up for 60 months, and conduct a final analysis when 944 patients have tumor progression (recurrence or metastasis). It is estimated that the drop-off rate of patients in the experimental group and the control group is 10%, so 1164 (524×2÷0.9=1164) patients need to be enrolled in the final group.&#xD;
