  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors leading this study hope to learn about the safety and effectiveness of combining&#xD;
      medications HB-201 and HB-202 (also known as TheraT® vectors) with chemotherapy using&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in the beginning of the study (induction) and if combining these&#xD;
      medications can increase tumor shrinkage after therapy and reduce the amount of radiotherapy&#xD;
      and chemotherapy that will later be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study is looking at ways to reduce side effects overall using robotic&#xD;
      surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone. Your participation in this&#xD;
      research will last about 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While HB-201 and HB-202 are FDA-approved for various conditions, the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of these drugs with chemotherapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of your condition, and therefore this can only be given in a research study.&#xD;

             instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study&#xD;
             drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unequivocal demonstration of distant metastatic disease (M1 disease).&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Prior surgical therapy other than incisional/excisional biopsy or organ-sparing&#xD;
             procedures such as debulking of airway-compromising tumors. Residual measurable tumor&#xD;

             without active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
