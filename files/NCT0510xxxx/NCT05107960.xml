  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check for side effects from treatment with azilsartan and&#xD;
      how well azilsartan controls blood pressure in children from 6 to less than 16 years old with&#xD;
      high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sponsor will not be involved in how the participants are treated but will provide&#xD;
      instructions on how the clinics will record what happens during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants with high blood pressure will take azilsartan tablets or&#xD;
      azilsartan granules once a day according to their clinic's standard practice. The study&#xD;
      doctors will check for side effects from azilsartan for 12 months after treatment starts.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. It does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product (including an investigational product for a new indication in Japan), whether or not related to the pharmaceutical product. For regenerative medicine products, any failure report is also handled as an adverse event.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>
