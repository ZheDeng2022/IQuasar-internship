  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention used worldwide. Despite this, critically&#xD;
      ill patients who undergo mechanical ventilation commonly develop muscle weakness; this&#xD;
      includes limb muscle weakness and diaphragmatic weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy interventions on critically ill patients include; mobilisation to improve limb&#xD;
      muscle strength and function, and inspiratory muscle training which aims to target the&#xD;
      diaphragm and accessory inspiratory muscles with the goal of improving endurance and&#xD;
      strength. Whilst these interventions are standard practice in intensive care, little is known&#xD;
      about the physiological load imposed on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      (measured using the Beacon Caresystem) to measure the metabolic cost (oxygen consumption&#xD;
      [VO2] and carbon dioxide production [VCO2]) of inspiratory muscle training and physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an initial cross-sectional study using a non-randomised convenience sample. Patients&#xD;
      will be studied during either rehabilitation or Inspiratory Muscle Training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (PImax) measured every 5 days.&#xD;
      Baseline measurements of VO2 and VCO2 at rest on their baseline ventilation will be measured&#xD;
      using the Beacon Caresystem for 1 hour before Inspiratory Muscle Training or physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory muscle training will will performed using a resistive device (Philips Respironics&#xD;
      ® Threshold PEP device) which is inserted into the participants ventilator tubing 30 minutes&#xD;
      before starting inspiratory muscle training. At this point, the device will be set to its&#xD;
      lowest setting; the resistance will be overcome by support delivered through the ventilator&#xD;
      meaning no additional effort for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then perform 12 breaths of inspiratory muscle training at 4cmH20, and at&#xD;
      30%, 50% and 80% PImax with a 30 second rest every 6 breaths and a 10-20 minute rest every 12&#xD;
      breaths&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory muscle training will normally occur five days per a week. The Beacon Caresystem&#xD;
      will be connected for analysis up to 2 days per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive usual physiotherapy exercise. These will be prescribed by the&#xD;
      patient's physiotherapist and may include assisted mobilisation and / or upper and lower limb&#xD;
      exercises to help strengthen muscles. Exercises performed will be categorised for analysis in&#xD;
      the study according to a scale called the intensive care mobility scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When physical rehabilitation begins (i.e when the patient starts to move with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist); a time stamp will be activated on the Beacon Caresystem. When physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation has ended the time stamp will be deactivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after exercise the patient will be asked to rate their exertion using a simple&#xD;
      scale designed to measure physical effort, called the BORG rating scale of perceived&#xD;
      exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical rehabilitation will normally occur six days per a week. The Beacon Caresystem will&#xD;
      be connected for analysis up to 4 days per week.&#xD;
