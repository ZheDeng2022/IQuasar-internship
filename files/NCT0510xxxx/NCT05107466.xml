  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine whether a test that measures a &quot;Visual Evoked&#xD;
      Potential&quot; can be used in a new way for individuals that have hearing loss. This test&#xD;
      measures the participant's brain's response (so called &quot;brain waves&quot;) to specific visual&#xD;
      images. This study will help the investigators determine whether this test could be used to&#xD;
      improve treatments for patients with hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Visual Evoked Potential&quot; measurement test is already used in the investigator's&#xD;
      Neurology clinic at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center for various conditions to measure&#xD;
      &quot;early&quot; brain responses that occur in the first 1-2 seconds after a new cue. Our research&#xD;
      aims to explore your brain's response just after that early 1-2 second period by looking at a&#xD;
      specific response called the &quot;P300&quot;. The P300 wave is a brain response to new or different&#xD;
      images or sounds. A visual evoked P300 has not been studied in individuals with hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also compare the results of this test to standard hearing tests and to&#xD;
      a similar P300 response to different sounds. Finally, the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      results of those tests to a test that uses augmented reality to assess the participant's&#xD;
      hearing function. This includes wearing a headset (like a heavy pair of glasses), and&#xD;
      indicating what the participants heard by pointing to different options simply by looking at&#xD;
      the target.&#xD;

      After being consented to participate in this study, participants will schedule a time,&#xD;
      convenient to the participant, to come to the testing clinic to complete the Visually evoked&#xD;
      potential (VEP) and Auditory evoked potential testing (AEP). If the participant hasn't had a&#xD;
      hearing test in the last 6 months one will be scheduled as well. Participant's vision will be&#xD;
      tested by looking a chart on a wall and identifying appropriate letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the VEP portion of the testing, participants will sit in a comfortable chair and have&#xD;
      electrodes placed at several locations on the participant's scalp. Electrodes are stickers&#xD;
      that connect to a wire that connects to a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrodes do not break the skin or commonly cause any discomfort or harm. Participants will&#xD;
      sit for approximately 30 minutes and watch images presented to the participant on a computer&#xD;
      screen while the participant's brain's response (visual) is measured using a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the AEP testing participants will listen while presented with different sounds. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure participant's brain response's for approximately 30 minutes&#xD;
      (auditory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The augmented reality testing starts with participants seated comfortably. Participants will&#xD;
      listen to auditory prompts and respond to sentences by looking at the correct target response&#xD;
      displayed in front of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a battery of tests in the Audiology clinic that involve&#xD;
      listening and responding to different sounds and patterns. While participants are at the&#xD;
      clinic for testing participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires that ask&#xD;
      about participant's mood and thought processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a survey either via email or in the mail shortly after completing&#xD;
      testing in our clinic. Participants can complete this survey at home and return it to the&#xD;
      investigating team via email or pre-paid mail.&#xD;
