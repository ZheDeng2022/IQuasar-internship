      This study was designed to examine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the&#xD;
      Children Participation Assessment Scale. Translation and cultural adaptation of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be designed according to an appropriate procedure. The original English&#xD;
      version of the questionnaire is fluent in English; It will be translated into Turkish by two&#xD;
      people, one a physiotherapist and the other a linguist. Translators will come together and&#xD;
      combine the questionnaires translated into Turkish into a single translation. The&#xD;
      questionnaire translated into Turkish will then be translated back into English by two sworn&#xD;
      translators whose mother tongue is English and who know Turkish well. The questionnaire,&#xD;
      which was translated from Turkish to English again, will be synthesized by the translation&#xD;
      team and turned into a single translation and its compatibility with the original will be&#xD;
      evaluated. 250 children between the ages of 6 and 12 with physical disabilities and their&#xD;
      parents will be included in this study. Children and parents with serious visual and auditory&#xD;
      problems and who do not volunteer to participate in the study will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. While examining the validity of the scale in children, it was planned to use the Child&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire scale, which had previously been shown to be reliable and valid in&#xD;
      healthy children with different disability levels. The questions in the data collection form&#xD;
      will be asked to the parents in the form of face-to-face interviews.&#xD;
