      This study aims to address evidence gaps regarding the safety, reactogenicity and immune&#xD;
      responses of a heterologous boost of a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (half or full dose) at&#xD;
      pre-specified time intervals in recipients who are documented to have received either 1-dose&#xD;
      or 2-doses (primary series completion) of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, Sinovac and/or&#xD;
      Sinopharm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observer-blind Phase 1/2 adaptive study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S in adults â‰¥ 18&#xD;
      years of age in Study Part A and Part B. A total of 690 participants will be recruited. The&#xD;
      Study is divided into 2 Parts: Part A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Part A is a prospective, multi-center, observer-masked, Phase 1/2 study assessing&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S as a booster dose after primary vaccination series is completed with either&#xD;
      Sinovac or Sinopharm inactivated COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who fulfill eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either full dose&#xD;
      (5 x 10^10 vp) or half dose (2.5 x 10^10 vp) of Ad26.COV2.S as an IM injection in the deltoid&#xD;
      muscle at Visit 1 (V1) and will be followed to Visit 7 (V7) at 336 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Part B is a prospective, multi-center, open label, Phase 2 study assessing&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S in a heterologous primary schedule as the 2nd dose vaccination after the 1st dose&#xD;
      of either Sinovac or Sinopharm inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. Adults who fulfill eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will receive a full dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5 x 10^10 vp) as an IM injection at V1 and&#xD;
      will be followed to V7 at 336 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs) will be systematically collected at all clinic visits. Solicited AEs&#xD;
      will be assessed in all subjects immediately (30 minutes) after injection. Subjects will&#xD;
      record solicited AEs daily in the Diary Card for the seven days following injection. If a&#xD;
      solicited AE is ongoing at a 7-day post-injection follow-up visit (Visit 2), or occurs after&#xD;
      7 days post-injection, the event will be recorded as AE and continued to be followed as per&#xD;
      AE monitoring requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, that are&#xD;
      related to study procedures or that are related to non-investigational sponsor products will&#xD;
      be reported from the time a signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) is obtained until&#xD;
      the end of the study/early withdrawal. All other unsolicited AEs will be reported from the&#xD;
      time of vaccination until completion of the participant's last study-related procedure. All&#xD;
      AESIs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study (regardless of the causal&#xD;
      relationship) are to be reported from the moment of vaccination until completion of the&#xD;
      participant's last study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For immunological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the IgG immune response against the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at Days 28, 84,&#xD;
           and 168 (interim analyses) and Day 336 (final analysis) following Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess, in a subset, the functional (neutralizing) humoral immune response measured by&#xD;
           pseudovirus neutralization assay (pNA), microneutralisation Assay (mNA), , cellular&#xD;
           immune responses at baseline, 28, 84, 168 and 336 days following Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Data Management System, including eCRFs, statistical analysis and data archival&#xD;
      are under the responsibility of the center of excellence for Biomedical and Public Health&#xD;
      Informatics (BIOPHICS), the center of data management for clinical research at the Faculty of&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the final protocol of the study, a comprehensive set of CRFs/eCRFs will be prepared&#xD;
      to capture all the relevant data required for analysis and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about COVID-19 disease, correlates of immunity, safety, and local epidemiology&#xD;
      and public health context regarding the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are rapidly evolving during the&#xD;
      pandemic. Therefore, it is critical to recognize that the approach outlined in this document&#xD;
      may be adapted as new data, expert consensus and public health policies evolve.&#xD;
