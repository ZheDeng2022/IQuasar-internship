  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries,&#xD;
      representing approximately 30% of all adult leukemias. There is a large difference in&#xD;
      proportion of malignant lymphoma between the United States (US) and Japan was seen in&#xD;
      CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (Japan, 3.2%; US, 24.1%). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess how well venetoclax works in combination with obinutuzumab (V+G, Cohort 1) or with&#xD;
      ibrutinib (V+I, Cohort 2) in Japanese participants with previously untreated CLL/Small&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an approved drug for the treatment of CLL and SLL. Study doctors put the&#xD;
      participants in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms, based on variable alternating&#xD;
      assignment. Approximately 20 adult participants with previously untreated CLL/SLL will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study in approximately 20 sites in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in group 1 will receive oral venetoclax + intravenous (IV) obinutuzumab (V+G) in&#xD;
      28-day cycles for a total of 12 cycles, and participants in group 2 will receive oral&#xD;
      venetoclax + oral ibrutinib (V+I) in 28-day cycles for a total of 15 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, and&#xD;
      checking for side effects.&#xD;
