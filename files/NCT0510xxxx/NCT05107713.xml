      Nasogastric (NG) and orogastric (OG) feeding tubes have a high incidence of malpositioning,&#xD;
      occurring in up to 59% of preterm infants (Lopes 2019). Ideally, the tip of the feeding tube&#xD;
      (including the orifices) should be located within the body of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malpositioning of the feeding tube can be classified as (i) being &quot;too far out&quot; where the tip&#xD;
      of the catheter is located in the esophagus above the gastro-esophageal junction, potentially&#xD;
      resulting in reflux, aspiration, apnea or (ii) being inserted &quot;too far in&quot; where the tip is&#xD;
      located in the pylorus or the duodenum, leading to malabsorption of nutrients, diarrhea, and&#xD;
      poor weight gain. Feeding tubes can also be found &quot;curled up&quot; inside the stomach (Quandt&#xD;
      2009) as much as 35% of the time. As well, one cannot ignore the risk of perforation, where&#xD;
      the incidence has been reported to be 1.1% in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants&#xD;
      (&lt;1000g) (n = 7/646) (Thanhaeuser M, 2019); of note: perforations occurred on the third day&#xD;
      of life (range days 2-14) not during initial feeding tube placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, a modified feeding tube was introduced to the market (Maquet Critical Care AB),&#xD;
      which contains sensors placed in its wall, 13 mm above the feeding orifices, used for&#xD;
      measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) during spontaneous breathing. The&#xD;
      Edi signal is then used to neurally control mechanical ventilation, or for neural monitoring&#xD;
      of the breathing pattern (Sinderby 1999; Beck 2016). The so-called &quot;Edi catheter&quot; comes with&#xD;
      the manufacturer's recommended insertion measurements and verification window. In the&#xD;
      Servo-I, the insertion distance is provided by a formula on the catheter packaging. In the&#xD;
      Servo-U and Servo-n, the calculation for predicted insertion is provided by a tool in the&#xD;
      ventilator. There is no available, published data upon which the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations were based. It is possible that obtaining appropriate positioning of the Edi&#xD;
      catheter - based on a pattern of electrical signals from the sensors - could reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of malposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is observational, and non-interventional. The purpose is to verify the&#xD;
      position of a neurally guided, clinically-placed, Edi catheter using radiography (Ellett&#xD;
      2011). We will also record physical measurements and weights of the babies in order to&#xD;
      validate previously described methods of predicting insertion length. The x-rays will be&#xD;
      taken with &quot;near-simultaneous&quot; screenshots of the Edi catheter positioning window.&#xD;

&#xD;
      We plan on studying a convenience sample of 65 premature babies of varying weights, from 9&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if optimal positioning of the Edi catheter results in feeding holes in the&#xD;
      stomach in neonates. The aim is to capture a screenshot of the Edi catheter positioning along&#xD;
      with one radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Once the subject is enrolled, if not already inserted, the Edi catheter will be placed&#xD;
           as guided by routine clinical practice and fixed in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection form will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When the placement of the Edi catheter is deemed satisfactory (or may have already been&#xD;
           in place), a screenshot or photograph of the catheter positioning window is taken.&#xD;
           Clinicians should make an effort to capture a screenshot just prior to or immediately&#xD;
           after the radiograph is done, taking effort to maintain the same patient positioning to&#xD;
           prevent inadvertent migration of the Edi catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Radiograph taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Send all info to J Beck: package would include de-identified data: Data collection form,&#xD;
           screen shot, radiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. De-identified data will be initially sent to a secure server at Neurovent Research Inc,&#xD;
           for then transfer to St-Michael's Hospital (lead site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs will be analyzed after-the-fact, by Dr. Kay North, without having information on&#xD;
      the catheter positioning window. The location of the tip of the catheter will be classified&#xD;
      into one of four categories: 1. Tube tip in esophagus. 2 Tube tip in the region of the GEJ.&#xD;
      3. Tube tip in the stomach. 4. Tube tip in the pylorus. Any other comments would be noted&#xD;
      (e.g. curled up catheter, catheter tip impinging on the lateral gastric wall), (Quandt 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screenshot of positioning window. Two independent analysts from St-Michael's Hospital will&#xD;
      determine diaphragm position on the array. With the 6 mm IED catheter we have a resolution of&#xD;
      12 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements on the data collection form about NEX, NEMU and ARHB will be correlated to&#xD;
      catheter insertion distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data will be used for anthropometric information&#xD;

        Our goal is to study a minimum of 65 babies. We will try to obtain data from the following&#xD;
        (6) weight categories with a minimum of 10 babies in each category, except the smallest&#xD;
        group where we anticipate positioning to be more challenging, based on anatomical&#xD;
        modelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        400-750g (n= 15 babies) 750-1000g (n = 10 babies) 1000-1250g (n = 10 babies) 1250-1500g (n&#xD;
        = 10 babies) 1500-1750g (n = 10 babies) 1750-2000g (n = 10 babies). The investigators are&#xD;
        aware that not all centres use Edi catheters in all the different weight groups.&#xD;
