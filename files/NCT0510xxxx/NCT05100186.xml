      To assess the safety and effectiveness of treatment with an intracanalicular dexamethasone&#xD;

      (IOL) compared to insertion 1-day post-op.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment&#xD;
      with an intracanalicular dexamethasone (0.4mg) insert in the operating room following&#xD;
      cataract surgery/intraocular lens implant (IOL) compared to insertion 1-day post-op.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 50 eyes with two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (up to 10 eyes) will receive the insert in the lower punctum on the day of surgery in&#xD;
      the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (up to 40 eyes) will receive the insert in the lower punctum on the day after surgery&#xD;
      in the HOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject's participation is expected to last for approximately 1 month and will be&#xD;
      required to complete five scheduled visits over the course of the study period: Baseline&#xD;
      (Screening Visit), Operative Visit/Insertion Day (Day 0), Day 1, Day 7 and Day 30.&#xD;
