  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this observational study is early diagnosis of FD using real-world data for&#xD;
      the development of advanced natural language processing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To develop the predictive algorithm and measure how many participants the algorithm&#xD;
      proposes as potential FD participants according to medical expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To measure the proportion of participants with confirmed FD in relation to the total&#xD;
      number of enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting data from hospital Electronic Health Record database to&#xD;
      describe the ranking of participants with FD using multilevel likelihood ratios. No&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product or device tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from a period up to 12 months and clinic visits will be&#xD;
      required as part of participation in this study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part A: Percentage of Participants With Positive Predictive Value (PPV) at Different Cut-off Values (top 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to End of the study (approximately 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PPV is a clinically relevant statistical measure that indicates how likely participants that screen positive are to be affected by the condition assessed. Thus, the PPV can be considered as the percentage of participants which are identified as FD candidates by the ranking algorithm who are indeed FD participants. As FD predictive algorithm, we will use (multilevel) likelihood ratios (LRs) as this method permits a good use of clinical test results to establish diagnoses for the individual participant. LR is calculated, defined as the probability of a patient who has FD to present with this feature divided by the probability of a participant who not has FD to present with the feature: Likelihood ratio= features the participant/Fabry divided by features the participant/not Fabry. Positive predictive value of the algorithm at several cutoffs (top 10, top 20, top 50, top 100, top 200) will be reported.</description>
