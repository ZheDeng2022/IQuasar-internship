      The purpose of this this study, to evaluate the quality of sexual life of patients treated&#xD;
      for anal cancer treated by radiotherapy, during their treatment, then 3 months after&#xD;
      treatment and, finally, 2 years after treatment. cancer diagnosis.&#xD;

      Sexual health is defined by WHO in 2011 as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social&#xD;
      well-being in relation to sexuality. It is an integral part of health, well-being and quality&#xD;
      of life and is recognized as a right of everyone.Alteration of sexuality after cancer impacts&#xD;
      all phases of the sexual response. It is multifactorial: psychological (ie, anxiety linked to&#xD;
      the disease, fear of death, or impairment of body image) and physiological (ie, alteration of&#xD;
      the sexual reaction which may be linked, in part, to direct sequelae generated by irradiation&#xD;
      of the genitals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal cancer remains fairly rare, affecting around 2,200 people each year in France, with a&#xD;
      predominance of women (60 to 70% of patients), However, its incidence has been growing&#xD;
      strongly for 30 years, in Europe and the United States where it is has increased by 70% over&#xD;
      the last 10 years alone, in both men and women, with an increasingly younger population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is linked, in more than 90% of cases, to a carcinogenic virus, the Human PapillomaVirus&#xD;
      (HPV), a late consequence of an infection, most often asymptomatic, transmitted by the sexual&#xD;
      route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of sexuality after cancer remains, in fact, very little addressed by doctors who&#xD;
      express a lack of training. Patients, for their part, often do not dare to raise the issue&#xD;
      with caregivers, out of modesty, or thinking that the teams do not have the time. Discussions&#xD;
      with patients therefore generally always remain focused on oncological management, from the&#xD;
      initial consultation to the follow-up consultations. The hope of recovery awaited on each of&#xD;
      the assessments and the fear of relapse often obscure more global and equally essential&#xD;
      questions: whether it is about the quality of life, the after-effects, or even more, the&#xD;
      quality. of sex life. For these reasons, this study will collect the information provided to&#xD;
      patients on the impact of this treatment on their sexual health, whether it is medical&#xD;
      information recorded in the file, or information perceived and retained by patients.&#xD;

        This project is a descriptive study without formal calculation of the number of subjects&#xD;
        required. The sample size will be based on the ability to recruit at the ICM over a&#xD;
        30-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The active queue of patients at the ICM is about 3 to 4 patients per month, with an&#xD;
        estimate of the proportion of refusals expected at 50% in these patients still on the shock&#xD;
        of the announcement of cancer, where the theme of sexuality does not always appear&#xD;
        essential at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recruiting 50 patients would make it possible to have an estimate (for descriptive&#xD;
        purposes) of the mean scores after treatment (visit 3 months after treatment) on the EORTC&#xD;
        SHQ-C22 quality of sexual life questionnaire (the range of which goes from 0 to 100 ), with&#xD;
        a level of precision of 12.25 (amplitude of the confidence interval) for a two-sided 95%&#xD;
        confidence interval and a standard deviation of 22.&#xD;
