  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressants are effective in functional dyspepsia (FD) patients, however, the stigma&#xD;
      related with FD and antidepressants could possibly affect treatment adherence and efficacy.&#xD;
      Zhi Zhu Kuan Zhong capsules (ZZKZs), a kind of herbal medicine, showed therapeutic potential&#xD;
      for FD. The study was designed to investigate whether ZZKZs could alleviate stigma in FD and&#xD;
      obtain identical effects in patients with FD overlapping mild anxiety/depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dyspepsia have poor quality of life and emotional distress. The pathophysiology&#xD;
      of FD is complex and multifactorial, including factors related to central nervous system and&#xD;
      peripheral sensory system. Abundant drugs have been trialed to treat FD patients, but the&#xD;
      treatment options remain limited. Antidepressants were beneficial in the treatment of FD. But&#xD;
      the antidepressant prescriptions often aggravate the stigma of patients with FD, hinder&#xD;
      doctor-patient communication, and reduce treatment compliance. Stigma related with&#xD;
      antidepressants could ultimately affect the efficacy of FD. Zhizhu Kuanzhong (ZZKZ), a&#xD;
      commonly used Chinese medicine formula, had been shown effective in relieving dyspepsia&#xD;
      syndrome.The study was designed whether the ZZKZ capsules could overcome stigma of&#xD;
      antidepressants and obtain identical effects in patients with FD, therefore provide a new&#xD;
      insight in the treatment of FD.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) scores at 4 weeks from baseline were obtained to assess the dyspepsia condition after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LDQ scores of 0-4 were classified as very mild dyspepsia, 5-8 as mild dyspepsia, 9-15 as moderate dyspepsia, and &gt;15 as severe or very severe dyspepsia.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores at 4 weeks from baseline were obtained to assess the depression condition after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 scores of 0-4 were classified as none or minimal depression, 5-9 as mild, 10-14 as moderate, 15-19 as moderately severe, and ≥20 as severe depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7) scores at 4 weeks from baseline were obtained to assess the anxiety condition after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 scores of 0-4 were classified as the absence of anxiety, 5-9 as mild, 10-14 as moderate, and ≥15 as severe.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Internalized stigma scale (ISS) scores at 4 weeks from baseline were obtained to assess the internalized stigma of patients after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Internalized stigma scale (ISS) is a 24-item self-report questionnaire with items ranked on a 4-point Likert scale (strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 4 points). The ISS scores are calculated by summing the values for each item and dividing by the number of questions answered for each scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of ISS. The ISS scores of 1-2 were classifies as minimal, 2-2.5 as mild, 2.5-3 as moderate, 3-4 as severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Perceived stigma scale (PSS) scores at 4 weeks from baseline were obtained to assess the perceived stigma of patients after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived stigma scale (PSS) is a 10-item questionnaire with items ranked on a 5-point Likert scale (seldom = 1 to always = 5 points). The scores are calculated by summing the values for each item and dividing by the number of questions answered for each scale. Minimum to maximum score is 1 to 5 points. Higher scores indicate higher levels of PSS. The PSS scores of 1-2 were classifies as minimal, 2-3 as mild, 3-4 as moderate, 4-5 as severe.</description>
