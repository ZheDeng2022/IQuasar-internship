      This study is a single-center propsective clinical trial to assess the ability of&#xD;
      fluorescence techniques to mark high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias including&#xD;
      high-grade vulvar squamous intraepithelial lesions and differentiated vulvar intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasias following 3 hours Metvixia application.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of the success of the photodynamic diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients for whom the procedure successfully demonstrated high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias in fluorescence confirmed by biopsy.&#xD;
A patient will be considered successful if the presence or absence of fluorescence is consistent with the anatomo-pathological result, that means if her sample in the fluorescent area is positive in pathology and her sample in the non-fluorescent area is negative in anatomo-pathology.&#xD;
For a patient with no fluorescent labeling, the pathological results of her two samples must be negative for the patient to be considered successful. For a patient where the entire area fluoresces, the anatomo-pathological result of her two samples must be positive for the patient to be considered successful.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity of the photodynamic diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>The sensitivity will correspond to the number of fluorescent zones among the positive zones in anatomopathology.</description>

    <measure>Specifity of the photodynamic diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days (+/- 4 days) after the photodiagnosis</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of flurescence evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>The day of the photo analysis with a specific software</time_frame>
    <description>The fluorescence intensity will be measured by the signal to noise ratio, also called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) on photographie</description>

    <measure>Tolerance evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion, after applying the cream for 3 hours, before and immediately after the blue light exposition and at and the final study visite (14 days +/- 4 after the photodiagnosis)</time_frame>
    <description>The tolerance of the application will be assessed by the number of grade 3 to 5 toxicity. The toxicity will be evaluated using the CTCAE v5 scale (Common Terminology for Adverse Events). The different grade on this scale is 1 to 5 (1 correspond to a asymptomatic or mild symptome, 2 to moderate toxicity, 3 to severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening toxicity, 4 to life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated and 5 to the death related to the toxicity.</description>

    <description>Pain will be assessed using a numerical scale from 0 to 10 (0 corresponds to no pain and 10 to maximum pain)</description>

    <intervention_name>Metvixia Topical Cream</intervention_name>
    <description>Metvixia is applied with a spatula, in a thick layer, to clinically visible lesions and all over the vulva. After applying the cream, the area will be covered with a bandage which should remain in place for 3 hours. After 3 hours of application, the bandage and the cream will be carefully removed. The application area will be cleaned and then immediately exposed to a continuous spectrum of light at a wavelength of 405 nm by a xenon lamp.&#xD;
The most fluorescent areas will be identified. Then in white light, the practitioner will perform at least two biopsies under non-topical local anesthesia in the area of application of Metvixia®: one in the fluorescent area and one in the non-fluorescent area.&#xD;
If there is no fluorescent labeling, two samples will be taken from two different non-fluorescent areas. In the event that all the zone is fluorescent , two samples will be taken from two different fluorescent zones.</description>
