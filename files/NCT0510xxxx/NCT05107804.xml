    <textblock>
      A growing body of epidemiological and biological evidence strongly suggests that physical&#xD;
      activity may reduce the risk of breast cancer. Although the mechanism remains unclear,&#xD;
      possible links between reduced risk and exercise include favorable alterations in body&#xD;
      composition and positive changes in the hormonal milieu. One hormonal biomarker of breast&#xD;
      cancer, circulating estrogen, is postulated to be reduced by chronic physical activity,&#xD;
      presumably due to disruptive effects of exercise upon menstrual cyclicity, and the potential&#xD;
      for loss of body fat with subsequent reductions in the peripheral biosynthesis of circulating&#xD;
      estrogens. Although studies have shown that chronic exercise can reduce circulating estrogen,&#xD;
      we know little about the magnitude and duration of exposure to an energy deficit required for&#xD;
      these changes. Additionally, no studies have addressed the degree to which peripheral&#xD;
      production of estrone, versus the ovarian production of estradiol, is altered with exercise&#xD;
      that promotes weight/fat loss. A second biomarker of breast cancer, insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-1 (IGF-1), is presumably increased with exercise but reduced with exercise if energy&#xD;
      balance is negative. No prospective studies have addressed whether a moderate aerobic&#xD;
      exercise program that results in weight loss will lead to significant changes in IGF-I&#xD;
      levels, particularly in individuals of differing initial energy stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic energy availability is an important contributing factor in the development of&#xD;
      reproductive cancers. However, current methods for assessing energy availability, which&#xD;
      include anthropometric measures, calculations of energy balance, evaluation of various serum&#xD;
      and urinary biomarkers are prone to measurement error, not sensitive to alterations in energy&#xD;
      availability, and are sometimes affected by disease states. The current project includes the&#xD;
      introduction of a novel approach to estimating energy status by measuring metabolic hormones&#xD;
      in plasma: insulin, IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tested whether a program of moderate aerobic exercise that is combined with a&#xD;
      moderate level of dietary restriction would result in significant decreases in two biomarkers&#xD;
      of breast cancer, circulating estrogens and IGF-I.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study used a randomized prospective design (block; 3:1 allocation) to test the effects&#xD;
      of a four month (four menstrual cycles) intervention of moderate aerobic exercise (4 times&#xD;
      per week, 60 minutes/session) combined with caloric restriction designed to produce a weekly&#xD;
      energy deficit of -20%. The aims of the study were: 1) To test the hypothesis that a moderate&#xD;
      level of low energy availability created through a combination of exercise and caloric&#xD;
      restriction will lower circulating estrogens and IGF-I; 2) To test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      exercise-induced decreases in body fat will contribute substantially to the lowering of&#xD;
      circulating estrogens changes with training; 3) To validate a novel method of assessing&#xD;
      energy status that represents an improvement of existing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eumenorrheic, untrained women between 25-40 years (n=47) were randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      treatments groups: exercise with caloric-restriction (EX+CR; n=36) or light conditioning&#xD;
      reference (LC; n=11) groups. To determine treatment effects on circulating estrogens,&#xD;
      reproductive function and IGF-I, both serum and urinary levels of hormones were monitored for&#xD;
      a control period of 2 months (2 menstrual cycles), i.e., Screening and Baseline, followed the&#xD;
      4 month (4 menstrual cycles: intervention 1-4) experimental period. The exercise/diet&#xD;
      intervention began on the first day of the third month (menstrual cycle) and continue for&#xD;
      four menstrual cycles thereafter (intervention 1, 2, 3, and 4). A post-study measurement was&#xD;
      taken during cycles days 1-7 of the seventh menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline energy needs were assessed during the baseline cycle. Resting metabolic rate and&#xD;
      non-exercise physical activity were added to determine a caloric need for the day. Caloric&#xD;
      intake was supervised throughout the entire study, and meals were comprised of 55%&#xD;
      carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 15% protein. Exercise training was supervised, and maximal&#xD;
      aerobic capacity (VO2max) was calculated. Menstrual status was assessed through analysis of&#xD;
      daily urinary metabolites of estrone-1-glucuronide (E1G), pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG), and&#xD;
      midcycle luteinizing hormone (LH). Underwater weighing and a digital scale were used to&#xD;
      assess body composition, and fasting blood samples were collected to assess metabolic&#xD;
      hormones.&#xD;
