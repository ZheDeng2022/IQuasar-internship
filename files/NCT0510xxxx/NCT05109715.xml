      The goal of the proposed pilot study is to determine which method can detect myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia at the predefined timepoints during endo-CABG. Additionally, we want to examine the&#xD;
      influence of mechanical ventilation on the occurrence of myocardial ischemia in patients&#xD;
      undergoing endo-CABG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CABG is the most effective therapy for patients suffering from coronary artery disease, a&#xD;
      condition which annually affects 126 million people worldwide. During this surgery,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) takes over the function of the heart and lungs. As a result of&#xD;
      the emergence of minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) (e.g. endoscopic-CABG), peripheral&#xD;
      CPB with femoral arterial cannulation became the most commonly utilized strategy. However,&#xD;
      the use of retrograde arterial perfusion is not without risk. It may result in the upper body&#xD;
      and coronary arteries being perfused with deoxygenated blood. The hypoxemia will induce&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia and this can harm the cardiac myocytes. A solution for this inconvenience&#xD;
      is still lacking. Literature reports that establishing adequate ventilation support should&#xD;
      help overcome this phenomenon. However, this approach has not yet been investigated in a&#xD;
      clinical trial. In general, this phenomenon is not well recognized in the typical surgical&#xD;
      setting, and limited research has been done.&#xD;

    <description>In both groups, blood samples and arterial blood gas measurements (partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), oxygen (pO2) and the pH) will be taken at predefined timepoints during and after surgery. The blood samples are used to measure Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (hFABP), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), Cardiac troponin (cTn-T) and Creatine Kinase Myocardial Band (CK-MB) levels, four markers to assess myocardial ischemia. ROS measurements include a malondialdehyde assay to assess the lipid peroxidation, an Oxystat test to analyse the total peroxide levels and a protein carbonyl assay to assess the protein damage due to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. With the blood gas measurements, we can determine the oxygen saturation for the detection of hypoxemia. Additionally a biopsy will be taken to analyze ROS (pro- and anti-oxidants).</description>
