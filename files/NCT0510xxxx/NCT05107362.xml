  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Checkable Medical At-Home Strep A Test is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the&#xD;
      qualitative detection of Group A Strep (GAS) antigens from throat swabs. The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the investigational device (i.e.,&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV) when used by untrained lay persons to detect the&#xD;
      presence of Group A Streptococcal antigens in throat swab specimens from individuals five&#xD;
      years of age and older with signs and symptoms of pharyngitis, such as fever and sore throat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, consecutive, non-interventional multicenter study to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical performance of the Checkable Medical At-Home Strep A Test when the test is performed&#xD;
      by non-trained adult lay users.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients or parents/legal guardians of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of&#xD;
           pharyngeal GAS infections will be recruited at primary care or urgent care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Informed consent will be obtained from adult subjects and from the parents/guardians of&#xD;
           pediatric subjects. Pediatric subjects 7 years of age or greater will be asked for their&#xD;
           assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The lay user will be provided with a Checkable Medical At-Home Strep A Test kit. The&#xD;
           user and patient will be provided with a quiet, private space where the user can collect&#xD;
           the throat swab specimen and perform the investigational test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once the lay user has collected the swab sample for the Checkable Medical At-Home Strep&#xD;
           A Test and performed the test, she/he will document the test result. The Checkable&#xD;
           Medical At-Home Strep A Test result is not to be shared with members of the site team&#xD;
           who are providing healthcare to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. When all sample collection, testing and interpretation activities related to the&#xD;
           investigational test are completed, a healthcare provider at the study site will collect&#xD;
           two additional swab samples. One of these samples will be sent to a central lab where it&#xD;
           will be cultured for GAS. An additional sample will be tested using the organization's&#xD;
           standard of care (SOC) rapid Strep A test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects will be diagnosed and treated in accordance with routine SOC which may include&#xD;
           an FDA-cleared rapid GAS test. The Checkable Medical At-Home Strep A Test will not be&#xD;
           used to diagnose or treat study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. This study will take place in at least six sites in at least three different regions of&#xD;
           the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The results from the Checkable Medical At-Home Strep A Test will be used to compare with&#xD;
           the diagnostic truth obtained through culture to compute diagnostic accuracy parameters&#xD;
           including sensitivity, NPV, specificity and PPV.&#xD;
