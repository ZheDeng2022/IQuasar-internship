    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most serologically and clinically diverse&#xD;
      autoimmune disease. Immune dysregulation leads to excess production of autoantibodies and&#xD;
      immune complexes. excess complement activation, and insidious tissue inflammation in patients&#xD;
      with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLE is characterized by multisystem involvement commonly affecting the skin, renal, and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal systems .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus nephritis is an important cause of both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      that can result in end-stage renal disease. Its pathogenic mechanisms are characterized by&#xD;
      aberrant activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, dysregulation of&#xD;
      inflammatory signaling pathways, and increased cytokines production .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic sclerosis (SSC) is an autoimmune disease with characteristic vascular damage and&#xD;
      fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Diagnosis of SSC is mainly based on the clinical&#xD;
      course and features in addition to laboratory findings including autoantibody profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Slit2, as a member of the Slit family, is secreted glycoprotein. Slit2 functions by binding&#xD;
      to its transmembrane receptor Robo. Robo has four isoforms (Robo14). Slit2-Robo regulates&#xD;
      cell functions, such as regulating leukocytes in chemotaxis and promoting endothelial cell&#xD;
      migration and tube formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slit2 might promote the pathogenesis of LN by affecting various cell dysfunction in addition&#xD;
      to leukocyte infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In SSC, vascular involvement is a primary event characterized by vascular tone dysfunction&#xD;
      and microcirculatory abnormalities. Many classes of guidance molecules, such as members of&#xD;
      the secreted glycoproteins Slits and their Roundabout (Robo) receptors, play critical roles&#xD;
      in angiogenesis. Among these, Robo1 and Robo4 are expressed in endothelial cells. .&#xD;
