    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to assess effects of iron and folic acid supplementation and&#xD;
      multiple micronutrient supplementation on anemia status and school performance/attendance&#xD;
      among in-school adolescents in Zanzibar, Tanzania.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study aims to implement and evaluate micronutrient supplementation interventions to&#xD;
      improve adolescent nutrition, health and education in Zanzibar. Findings from this study will&#xD;
      clarify the optimal supplementation strategy (iron and folic acid alone or adding other&#xD;
      essential nutrients) and provide a basis for scale up of national micronutrient&#xD;
      supplementation programs to benefit the adolescent population as a whole in Zanzibar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cluster randomized study with 3 arms. At the beginning of the academic year,&#xD;
      42 schools will be enrolled (14 schools per arm) to receive either 1) supplementation with&#xD;
      weekly iron and folic acid (IFA); 2) supplementation with daily multiple micronutrient&#xD;
      supplements (MMS) (including iron and folic acid as components); or 3) to serve as controls.&#xD;
      Students in intervention schools will receive supplementation and students in control schools&#xD;
      will receive the usual care (which does not include supplementation but does include existing&#xD;
      curriculum on nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene [WASH]). The program will be&#xD;
      evaluated at the end of year 1, comparing effects of weekly IFA and daily MMS on anemia&#xD;
      status and school attendance/performance. The more effective strategy (MMS or IFA) will be&#xD;
      scaled up to all the study schools for year 2 of the intervention, and the outcomes will be&#xD;
      re-assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Schools will be randomly assigned to weekly iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation, daily multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS), or control. Supplementation will be conducted continuously over the course of the first year. Baseline and end-line surveys will be conducted to collect demographic information and assess outcomes. In the second year of the study, the more effective supplementation strategy (IFA or MMS) will be scaled up to all study schools and the outcomes will be re-assessed.</intervention_model_description>
