  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators address the question: whether treatment with IVIG is&#xD;
      superior to treatment using plasmapheresis for functional recovery of patients with GBS?&#xD;
      Recovery was quantified using: The changes in the A-Clinical grading scale MRC ( medial&#xD;
      research council sum score ) and B-overall neuropathy limitations scale as the primary&#xD;
      outcome and the changes in Neurophysiological study 3 months after treatment as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This information will be used to evaluate which treatment is more beneficial to GBS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory disease of the PNS and is the most common&#xD;
      cause of acute flaccid paralysis, with an annual global incidence of approximately 1-2 per&#xD;
      100,000 person-years. Patients with GBS typically present with weakness and sensory signs in&#xD;
      the legs that progress to the arms and cranial muscles, although the clinical presentation of&#xD;
      the disease is heterogeneous and several distinct clinical variants exist. Diagnosis of GBS&#xD;
      is based on the patient's history and neurological, electrophysiological, and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (CSF) examinations. Electrophysiological studies: provide evidence of peripheral&#xD;
      nervous system (PNS) dysfunction and can distinguish between the subtypes of GBS: acute&#xD;
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy&#xD;
      (AMAN), and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Disease progression can be rapid,&#xD;
      and most patients with GBS reach their maximum disability within 2 weeks. About 20% of&#xD;
      patients with GBS develop respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation. Cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias and blood pressure instability can occur owing to the involvement of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system. Immunomodulatory therapy should be started if patients are unable&#xD;
      to walk independently for 10 m. Evidence on treatment efficacy in patients who can still walk&#xD;
      independently is limited, but treatment should be considered, especially if these patients&#xD;
      display rapidly progressive weakness or other severe symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction,&#xD;
      bulbar failure, or respiratory insufficiency. Clinical trials have demonstrated a treatment&#xD;
      effect for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) when started within 2 weeks of the onset of&#xD;
      weakness and for plasma exchange when started within 4 weeks.&#xD;
