  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅲ, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, multicenter&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of subcutaneous&#xD;
      Tildrakizumab in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was divided into two parts: the base study (Week 0- Week 12) and the extension&#xD;
      study (Week 13- Week 54).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Base Study： 220 subjects were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio into the trial, and the treatment&#xD;
      group received 100 mg subcutaneous Tildrakizumab at Week 0 and Week 4, 100 mg subcutaneous&#xD;
      placebo at Week 12, while the placebo group received 100 mg subcutaneous placebo at Week 0&#xD;
      and Week 4, and 100 mg subcutaneous Tildrakizumab at Week 12, and subjects will be evaluated&#xD;
      for efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity as specified in this protocol. At the&#xD;
      end of the base study, procedures such as data cleaning, locking and unblinding of base study&#xD;
      data were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Study： Subjects entered the extension study after completion of the base study and&#xD;
      will receive 100 mg subcutaneous Tildrakizumab at Week 16, 28, 40, and 52, and will be&#xD;
      evaluated for efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity by the investigator&#xD;
      according to the regulations of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the extension study, all data from the extension study will be entered into the&#xD;
      database, after the data is reviewed, cleaned, and locked, the entire trial will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects with at least 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at Week 12 from baseline in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects in each group with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;minimal&quot; and at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline at Week 4, 8, and 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is used to determine the overall severity of a participant's psoriasis lesions at a given time point. Overall lesions will be graded for thickness, erythema, and scaling on a scale from 0 to 5. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain the PGA score. PGA is assessed as: 0= Cleared, except for residual discoloration. 1= Minimal, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 1. 2 =Mild, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 2. 3= Moderate, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 3. 4= Marked, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 4. 5= Severe, majority of lesions have individual scores that average 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at Week 12 in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI questionnaire consists of 10 questions, where each question is scored from 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The DLQI score is the sum of the 10 individual question scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in PASI 75, 90, and 100 responses over time from Week 0 to Week 12 in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of lesions (each graded on a 0-4 scale), weighed by the area of involvement. Calculated PASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher score indicating more severe disease status.</description>
