      The purpose of this study is to provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with&#xD;
      buprenorphine and naloxone, or bup/nx, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention,&#xD;
      and/or hepatitis C treatment for persons who inject opioids accessing syringe services&#xD;
      programs (SSPs), as part of a comprehensive harm reduction program, and assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of using telemedicine to implement the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit will be conducted in person or remotely via telemedicine given COVID-19&#xD;
      protocols at the SSP site in Greensboro, North Carolina (NC); follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      conducted via telemedicine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with&#xD;
      buprenorphine and naloxone, or bup/nx, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention&#xD;
      and/or hepatitis C treatment for persons who inject opioids accessing syringe services&#xD;
      programs (SSPs), as part of a comprehensive harm reduction program, and assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of using telemedicine to implement the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess uptake and persistence to bup/nx, PrEP, and hepatitis C treatment as part of a&#xD;
      comprehensive telemedicine-based harm reduction program among people who inject drugs using&#xD;
      SSPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess feasibility and acceptability of implementing a telemedicine-based care harm&#xD;
      reduction program among program implementers To assess feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      participating in a telemedicine-based harm reduction program among users&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is people who inject drugs, specifically opioids, and who access&#xD;
      services at an SSP in Greensboro, NC. The study team will enroll 30 people who inject drugs&#xD;
      accessing the participating SSP. Participants will be enrolled in the study for 6 months. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, they will be referred to MOUD and PrEP providers identified in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will administer a baseline survey to collect demographics, HIV risk&#xD;
      behaviors, and substance use history. Participants will undergo laboratory testing at the SSP&#xD;
      to determine eligibility and enrolled participants will be prescribed bup/nx and PrEP free of&#xD;
      charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be conducted via telemedicine at the SSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on any combination of treatment including MOUD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first month (Month 1), telemedicine visits will be weekly with each to ensure that&#xD;
      participants are stable on the appropriate bup/nx dose. Starting at Month 2, the telemedicine&#xD;
      visits will take place monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on any combination of treatment NOT including MOUD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend telemedicine follow up visits at month 3 and month 6 to check in and&#xD;
      provide labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire at Month 3 and Month 6 which&#xD;
      include questions on HIV risk and drug use, as well as adherence evaluation. All participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to participate in qualitative interviews on their experiences with the&#xD;
      program at month 1 and month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of the study, we hope to determine the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of persons who demonstrate no or minimal opioid use 1a. Defined as&#xD;
           completing Month 3 and Month 6 visits with self-reported opioid use on ≤4 days in the&#xD;
           past month and/or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of persons who remain HIV negative. 2a.Measured via negative HIV test at&#xD;
           Month 3 and Month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Among participants who undergo hepatitis C treatment, the hepatitis C cure rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Retention or persistence in care 4a. Defined as the proportion who remain on treatment&#xD;
           (all or any combination of MOUD, PrEP, and hepatitis C treatment) at Month 3 and Month 6&#xD;
           4b. We will also examine whether participants are more apt to remain on paired/combined&#xD;
           therapy compared to individual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Organizational facilitators and barriers to establishing a telehealth program in an SSP&#xD;
           5a. We will iteratively collect programmatic data and document challenges and&#xD;
           problem-solving that occurs throughout the implementation period of providing bup/nx,&#xD;
           PrEP, and/or hepatitis C treatment. We will identify and describe organizational factors&#xD;
           using the framework of the Implementation Research Logic Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient perspectives on telehealth delivery of PrEP, MOUD, and/or hepatitis C treatment&#xD;
           via SSP 6a. Analysis of interview data at Month 1 and Month 6 to measure attitudes&#xD;
           toward PrEP, MOUD, and hepatitis C treatment in general, and on delivery of treatment&#xD;
           via telehealth and at the SSP 6b. Analysis of questionnaire data at baseline, Month 3,&#xD;
           and Month 6&#xD;
