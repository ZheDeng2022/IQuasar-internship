      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect that uninstalling work email&#xD;
      applications from mobile devices during leisure time has on health care worker stress levels.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burnout is more common in physicians than in the general population. The recent COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has increased burnout and stress levels among health care workers, leading to a peak&#xD;
      of 34% of health care workers experiencing burnout symptoms. But even before the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, the prevalence of burnout symptoms among health care workers was trending upwards.&#xD;
      In fact, most health care workers experience burnout to some degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Managing email inboxes and working with electronic health records (EHR) can increase screen&#xD;
      time levels for health care workers who use them. High amounts of screen time have been&#xD;
      linked to depression and stress in teenagers and adults. EHR digital work is a noted burden&#xD;
      on physicians, and inbox management has been linked to physician stress and burnout. A study&#xD;
      that measured physician stress during electronic health record inbox work found that&#xD;
      accessing and responding to EHR inbox outside of work hours increased stress levels in&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of an intervention that lowers screen time usage in health care workers during&#xD;
      leisure time has not been measured. Determining this effect can influence new protocols on&#xD;
      inbox and work email management during leisure time for health care workers. This can benefit&#xD;
      organizations by improving employee performance, employees by reducing stress and burnout&#xD;
      levels, and patients by providing more refreshed patient care. This study aims to determine&#xD;
      the effect that uninstalling email from mobile devices during leisure time has on health care&#xD;
      worker stress levels.&#xD;
