      evaluate the efficacy of Chest Physical Therapy (CPT) performed during the pre-transplant&#xD;
      period on spirometric values as well as Respiratory Muscle Strength (RMS) in patients waiting&#xD;

      patients scheduled for HSCT at the bone marrow transplant will randomly be assigned into two&#xD;
      groups; one will receive Chest Physical Therapy in addition to routine medical treatment and&#xD;
      the control group will receive routine medical treatment only. Outcomes will be a pulmonary&#xD;
      function that will be measured by spirometry and respiratory muscle strength measure by&#xD;
      Respiratory Pressure Meter. Measurements will be before three weeks before then at the end of&#xD;
      treatment immediately before Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and the last assessment&#xD;
      at three weeks after hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for all measured variables.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in group A will receive CPT program daily for three weeks before HSCT (hospital stay for allogeneic-HCT). The program consists of postural drainage, diaphragmatic breathing exercises, coughing, huffing, percussion, shaking, and exercise training using an incentive spirometer in addition to routine medical treatment. The total duration of each CPT session ranged from 45-60 minutes according to patient tolerance. The choice of airway clearance method that will be applied depends on two factors; patient preference and the individual response of the patient to treatment.</description>
