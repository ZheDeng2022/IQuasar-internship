  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although many children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) make significant&#xD;
      progress in learning and their cognitive skills improve with applied behavior analysis (ABA),&#xD;
      there are a significant number of children who show an absence or a plateau in various&#xD;
      skills. Deficits in executive functioning are likely to be involved in many of these&#xD;
      cognitive and learning disabilities due to poor functioning of the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
      Currently, the use of biological methods for improving learning and cognition is largely&#xD;
      unexplored in research and practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in&#xD;
      combination with ABA to improve the acquisition of educational programs for students with&#xD;
      ASD. tDCS is a low-level electrical neurostimulation and is most effective when used in&#xD;
      combination with an active training or teaching, facilitating the neuronal circuits used for&#xD;
      that task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS has been used for various indications over a couple of decades and has been shown to be&#xD;
      very safe and has been well-tolerated by children with ASD. The mechanism of tDCS is not&#xD;
      clear, however animal studies show that tDCS can stimulate the flow of calcium ions through&#xD;
      channels in the astrocytes, activating them, and facilitating their role in synapse formation&#xD;
      and therefore learning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with ASD experience a wide range of outcomes, and not all children respond&#xD;
      effectively to behavioral interventions. This study uses a novel biologic intervention that&#xD;
      combines electrical brain stimulation with ABA treatment to target some of the cognitive&#xD;
      deficits in ASD that until now have been relatively refractory to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is accumulating evidence of tDCS being effective in treating the comorbidities as well&#xD;
      as the core symptoms of ASD. tDCS is most effective when used simultaneously with an active&#xD;
      intervention. In this study, the effects of tDCS alone and in combination with ABA on the&#xD;
      executive functioning skills and the core symptoms of ASD will be examined and monitored&#xD;
      using an objective neurophysiological test (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, sham-controlled crossover study involving 20 participants. tDCS will&#xD;
      be administered while ABA therapy is being implemented. Programs aimed at language and other&#xD;
      cognitive functions will be emphasized. tDCS will be applied bi-frontally with the anode at&#xD;
      F3 and the cathode at F4. Forty stimulation sessions will be done (20 active, 20 sham)&#xD;
      lasting 20 minutes per session, at 1 milliampere.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will use a randomized double-blind controlled placebo (sham vs. active tDCS) crossover design. The study will involve 5 total months of participation. Participants will be randomized into one of the two groups:&#xD;
Group A) 20 active tDCS stimulation followed by 20 sham stimulation; or&#xD;
Group B) 20 sham stimulation followed by 20 active tDCS stimulation</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Study investigators will utilize the generated randomization schedule to provide active tDCS and sham stimulation codes that will be entered into the tDCS device (by the caregiver) prior to each session. These numeric codes will be random numbers and not distinct to the study group assignment, protecting the blind. One of the study investigators who will program the tDCS device will remain unblinded and will not be involved in any treatment outcome assessments. All other study staff, including the PI and the co-PIs remain blind. Parents, participants, and ABA providers will also remain blind.</masking_description>

&#xD;
          4. Able to tolerate wearing tDCS as determined during a week-long daily desensitization&#xD;
             training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any implanted metal device (heart pacemaker, cochlear implant, surgical clips, etc.)&#xD;

          6. Medication that might affect tDCS: There have been a few studies concerning the effect&#xD;
             of various medications on tDCS. Some may block and others may enhance the effects&#xD;
             depending on many factors. The assay used to test these medications was its effect on&#xD;
             the motor cortex after stimulation and this may not apply to our montages, however, in&#xD;
             order to minimize the chances of having medication affect our results, participants&#xD;
