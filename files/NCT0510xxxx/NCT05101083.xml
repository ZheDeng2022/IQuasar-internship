  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is designed to compare audiological performance (i.e.,&#xD;
      measurements of sound quality and speech understanding) between Starkey's new&#xD;
      receiver-in-canal device and a commercially available legacy receiver-in-canal device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Starkey is investigating a new hearing aid with several new audiological features. These&#xD;
      features have been assessed for benefit, individually, but this clinical investigation will&#xD;
      serve as a test for safety and efficacy with all hearing aid features, together. The design&#xD;
      of this study is a single-blinded, crossover design and will be conducted at Starkey's&#xD;
      headquarters in Eden Prairie, MN.&#xD;

    <measure>Speech intelligibility (% words repeated back correctly) in quiet and noise for new vs. legacy hearing aids</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IEEE sentences will be presented to the research participants in quiet and in background noise. The percent words repeated back correctly will be scored and serve as the reported result of this outcome measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>First fit ratings of sound quality on subjective questionnaires for the new vs. legacy hearing aids</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This data will be collected through lab testing following the first fit of the hearing aids. Participants will answer questionnaire items related to their impressions of sound quality. Results will be collected using a 7-point Likert scale, and ratings (1-7) will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Statistical measures for repeated measurements will be used to understand any differences between hearing aid conditions.</description>
