  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) is the most accurate staging method to&#xD;
      assess the presence of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. The&#xD;
      therapeutic value, however remains unclear. Prospective randomized trials to address this&#xD;
      void are lacking. Since in intermediate and a proportion of high risk PCa the risk of nodal&#xD;
      metastases is generally below 25%, the vast majority of men undergo a procedure that has no&#xD;
      oncological benefit, but is not without toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the oncologic outcomes of intermediate- and&#xD;
      high-risk PCa patients with an estimated risk of lymph node invasion of 5-20% undergoing a&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without an ePLND.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The role of an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in patients undergoing radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RP) remains controversial. An ePLND is the most accurate staging method to&#xD;
      assess the presence of lymph node metastases. Lymph node involvement is associated with a&#xD;
      significantly worse prognosis and may require immediate or delayed adjuvant therapy. However,&#xD;
      an ePLND is associated with an increased risk of complications such as lymphoceles,&#xD;
      thromboses and lymphedema, and prolongs surgery and patient recovery. Thus, the diagnostic&#xD;
      advantage of PLND should be weighed against the potential morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic value of an ePLND remains especially unclear in PCa patients with an&#xD;
      estimated risk of lymph node invasion (LNI) ≤ 20%, where only a minority of patients will&#xD;
      have nodes harbouring metastases. Prospective trials to address this issue are still lacking.&#xD;
