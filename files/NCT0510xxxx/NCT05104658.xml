  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, 50 % of cardiac patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation due difficulties&#xD;
      in navigating and accessing rehabilitation activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeRTA is a partnership project involving Center for Clinical Research and Prevention (CCRP),&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospital, Rehabilitation Center Albertslund and Copenhagen (municipalities), the&#xD;
      Danish Heart Association, and local sports associations. A patient advisory board participate&#xD;
      throughout the project to ensure a continued focus on patient interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of HeRTA is to develop and test the feasibility of a new, sustainable model&#xD;
      for rehabilitation supporting patients to take part in rehabilitation and promoting life-long&#xD;
      activity for all patients with heart disease. To ensure equal access to rehabilitation some&#xD;
      activities are open to all patients, while others are tailored specifically to patients with&#xD;
      vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project unfolds in three phases: Development (1. January 1. 2020 - 14. November 2021):&#xD;
      Partners and patients co-create content and procedures; Feasibility (15. November 2021 - 31.&#xD;
      July 2023): The feasibility of the model is tested, and promising components are identified;&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up and implementation (1. August 2023 - 31. December 2025): Long term&#xD;
      effects are investigated and promising components are tested in new settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the feasibility phase the investigators will examine whether the intervention&#xD;
      activities are feasible, acceptable, and may have positive effects for patients with heart&#xD;
      disease. The investigators use qualitative data on implementation and acceptability of&#xD;
      intervention among partners and patients. An randomisered controlled trial (RCT) component&#xD;
      will assess effects on patient participation rates, health, physical activity level, and life&#xD;
      quality. Data is collected from practitioners and patients through focus groups,&#xD;
      observations, field notes, questionnaires, and interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will point to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  innovative ways to organize integrated rehabilitation pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  approaches to ensuring rehabilitation targeted at patient needs.&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeRTA is a partnership project conducted in close collaboration between hospital,&#xD;
      municipality, patient organisation and local sports associations. A patient advisory board is&#xD;
      involved throughout the project to ensure patient involvement including that decisions&#xD;
      continuously focus on patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of HeRTA is to develop and test the feasibility of a new, sustainable model&#xD;
      for rehabilitation supporting vulnerable patients to take part in rehabilitation and&#xD;
      promoting life-long activity for all patients with heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically our goal is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  test if combined activities across sectors can increase the proportion of cardiac&#xD;
           patients' participating in rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  test if the model improves the maintenance of lifestyle changes and enhances physical&#xD;
           and mental functioning, quality of life, and self-care capacity among cardiac patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is organized in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An ongoing development phase, where all partners including the patient advisory board&#xD;
           participate in a partnership and co-creation process to develop model content and&#xD;
           collaboration procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A feasibility phase with a small scale RCT-component, where the investigators examine&#xD;
           whether the intervention activities are feasible, acceptable, and may have positive&#xD;
           effects for patients with heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A long-term follow-up and implementation phase, in which sustainability of the&#xD;
           intervention on patient activity is assessed and promising components are further&#xD;
           tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Background Half a million Danes suffer from heart diseases. According to national&#xD;
      guidelines rehabilitation should be offered to minimize consequences and prevent new cardiac&#xD;
      episodes. Solid evidence exists on the benefits of multifaceted cardiac rehabilitation on&#xD;
      patients' cardiovascular function, functional level, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, half of cardiac patients do not participate in rehabilitation. Structural barriers&#xD;
      during the transition between hospital and municipality make it difficult to navigate&#xD;
      rehabilitation activities. Additionally, the probability of being offered rehabilitation is&#xD;
      lower if patients live alone, are unemployed, have a short education, a low income or suffer&#xD;
      from several chronic conditions. Other barriers to participation are a poor financial&#xD;
      situation, weak social relationships, logistic challenges, language difficulties, and&#xD;
      cultural considerations. Even after having participated in rehabilitation programs, many&#xD;
      patients struggle to maintain new lifestyle habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite health professionals' intentions to address vulnerability, vulnerable patients are&#xD;
      overrepresented among those who do not receive a referral to rehabilitation, who do not&#xD;
      participate in rehabilitation, and who do not complete rehabilitation activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Feasibility phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the development phase, partners and a patient advisory board has developed a model of&#xD;
      combined activities aimed at creating a coherent rehabilitation course addressing needs among&#xD;
      all patients with a special focus on patients with vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, materials, and methods The investigators use qualitative data on implementation and&#xD;
      acceptability of intervention among partners and patients. An RCT component will assess&#xD;
      potential effects on patient participation rates, health, and life quality. The process&#xD;
      evaluation will be guided by Normalization Process Theory and the Consolidated Framework for&#xD;
      Implementation Research (CFIR). To ensure successful implementation and sustainability,&#xD;
      partners will meet quarterly to evaluate experiences. In the initial three months, meetings&#xD;
      are more frequent to allow for relevant adjustments. In the remaining inclusion period,&#xD;
      strong rationale for changes should be provided to protect the potential of the study's RCT&#xD;
      component. All changes in activities or procedures throughout the feasibility phase -&#xD;
      including the rationale for adjustments - will be registered in field notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of participation and sustainability Partners register patients' participation in&#xD;
      all activities to monitor participation rates across sectors. Data from self-reported patient&#xD;
      questionnaires are collected at baseline (background, and outcomes) and 3, and 6 months&#xD;
      (outcomes, and participation in rehabilitation activities). At 12 and 24 months physical&#xD;
      activity is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data on patient experiences The research team conducts qualitative&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with 15-20 patients to uncover their experience of the overall&#xD;
      process, contact with health care professionals, the match between activities and&#xD;
      rehabilitation needs, patient involvement, and intersectoral coordination. Patients will be&#xD;
      selected based on criteria for maximum variation. Both patients with high and low levels of&#xD;
      participation will be selected for interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data on implementation among professionals Organizational characteristics and&#xD;
      individual approaches among professionals will shape the implementation of activities. Field&#xD;
      notes on adjustments in the intervention content, procedures, and changes in the context&#xD;
      (e.g. organizational changes, changes in management/employees) will provide knowledge on the&#xD;
      setting and the processes affecting the potential for the effect of the rehabilitation model.&#xD;
      Observations and/or recordings of rehabilitation activities in hospital, municipality and&#xD;
      Danish Heart Association will provide insight into the actual content of the activities and&#xD;
      the fidelity of the implementation. Focus groups with involved partners will uncover the&#xD;
      professional's experiences and reflections on screening and referral procedures, information&#xD;
      exchange, intersectoral collaboration, and rehabilitation activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses of the effect sizes The investigators will perform descriptive analyses&#xD;
      of baseline characteristics. The primary outcome will be a) analyzed according to the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle, b) sensitivity analyses of changes within/between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups will be carried out. If the power of data allows -&#xD;
      explorative subgroup analyses will be carried out on those screened to be vulnerable.&#xD;
      Estimated effect sizes will be calculated to inform future assessment of sample sizes in&#xD;
      RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative evaluations All data from workshops, interviews, and focus groups will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcriptions and field notes will be&#xD;
      analyzed using systematic text condensation described by Malterud. The analytical process&#xD;
      will be inspired by principles from Collaborative Data Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' experiences from the intervention The analysis will assess whether patients&#xD;
      experience their treatment and rehabilitation course as an integrated and coordinated effort&#xD;
      helping them to live with their heart disease. The analysis will nuance the quantitative&#xD;
      analysis and assess whether the model succeeds in tailoring rehabilitation activities to&#xD;
      individual needs. The full rehabilitation package is not necessary or relevant for all&#xD;
      patients with heart disease. Patients with vulnerabilities may need elaborate support, while&#xD;
      patients with resources may need less assistance. Rather they may need to be supported in&#xD;
      using their local area and network to return to everyday life. In this analysis, gaps in the&#xD;
      match between activities and patient needs will also be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation processes The analyses of organizational experiences will focus on the fit&#xD;
      between the varying partnering institutions and the developed rehabilitation activities and&#xD;
      collaboration procedures. Reach and fidelity of implementation will be assessed to provide&#xD;
      relevant knowledge for interpreting and drawing conclusions on the potential of each&#xD;
      intervention component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analyses A simple cost-effectiveness analyses will be carried out. This&#xD;
      will be done by calculating a ratio where the denominator is the health gains measured by&#xD;
      quality adjusted years of life (SF-12/SF-6D) and the numerator is the cost associated with&#xD;
      the health gain obtained from the intervention, which will be the total cost of the&#xD;
      intervention including resources used by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Project organization - A partnership&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeRTA is anchored in the Intersectoral Prevention Laboratory (IPL) with expertise in&#xD;
      supporting intersectoral partnerships and intervention development and execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeRTA is a partnership between researchers at CCRP, the IPL, the cardiac outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospital, Rehabilitation Center Albertslund and Copenhagen, and the Danish Heart&#xD;
      Association. Local sports associations are part of the project at a collaborative level. The&#xD;
      project receives sparring from an expert group and a patient advisory board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at CCRP are Michaela Louise Schiøtz, Head of Section for Intersectoral Health&#xD;
      Services Research; Hanne Birke, Ph.D., Postdoc with expertise in chronic disease (project&#xD;
      manager); Karin Burns, a clinical coordinator with experience in supporting research in&#xD;
      practice; Ida Foxvig, a research assistant with experience in partnerships and co-creation;&#xD;
      Louise Meinertz Jakobsen, Ph.D., with expertise in interventions and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert group provides professional feedback to the choice of research methods, outcome&#xD;
      measurements, data collection, and analyses. Members are experts from Steno Diabetes Center&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Hvidovre Hospital, Rigshospitalet, and the Immigrant Medical Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Ethics approval A data handling plan has been accepted by the Knowledge Center for Data&#xD;
      Reviews, the Capital Region of Denmark (journal-nr.: P-2020-905). The National Committee of&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics has approved the project (FSP 20035947).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Deliverables from the HeRTA feasibility study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following deliverables are tangible outcomes of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collaboration model across hospital, municipality, patient organization and local sports&#xD;
           associations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasible patient-targeted rehabilitation activities across sectors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of promising components to increase participation in rehabilitation and&#xD;
           physical activity in local sports associations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tools to engage patients with vulnerability in rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication plan The investigators provide an evidence-based contribution to the debate on&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation and social inequalities in health and healthcare. The target groups&#xD;
      for our communication are the research community; health professionals across sectors&#xD;
      including leaders and key persons; civil society (e.g. patient organizations); and cardiac&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will be presented in meetings, conferences, and written material, such as fact&#xD;
      sheets and articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and popular science journals and&#xD;
      channels. The investigators will communicate through the Heart Foundation (Magazine and&#xD;
      conference(s)) targeting cardiac patients and health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Results from HeRTA will point to a model that is feasible and sustainable within&#xD;
      the Danish healthcare system and forms a coherent rehabilitation pathway for people with&#xD;
      cardiac disease. The model can be adjusted locally to fit the context in other rehabilitation&#xD;
      locations and to ensure local stakeholder engagement. Our preliminary economic evaluation of&#xD;
      financial cost and use of resources will operationalize the sustainability of the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeRTA can form the basis for further targeted rehabilitation studies: a) rigorous RCT studies&#xD;
      dissecting the effect of specific elements of the intervention that shows the greatest&#xD;
      potential for positive benefits, and b) studies that test the generalizability across&#xD;
      contexts to ensure transferability of results.&#xD;
