    <textblock>
      This study sought to develop an algorithm by collecting echocardiographic image information&#xD;
      and related clinical information capable of quantitatively evaluating changes of the&#xD;
      myocardium through machine learning. Moreover, the researchers investigate the usefulness of&#xD;
      an algorithm for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of infiltrative cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

      1. Study Design: Multicenter Retrospective Observational Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study method: If the above selection criteria are met, the index visit echocardiographic&#xD;
           images which were performed immediately before or closest to the time of hospitalization&#xD;
           for final diagnosis, echocardiographic images of the pre-visit and post-visit from the&#xD;
           final diagnosis, and clinical information will be obtained. Chest X-ray,&#xD;
           electrocardiogram, and echocardiography images are extracted in raw DICOM format and&#xD;
           then analyzed in the core lab (Severance hospital). The characteristics of patients with&#xD;
           infiltrative cardiomyopathy are identified through the collection of relevant clinical&#xD;
           information, and a method for non-invasive early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of&#xD;
           infiltrative cardiomyopathy is developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantative analysis of echocardiographic images using Radiomics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiomics is a method of extracting a large number of quantitative image features&#xD;
                (300-500 features such as shape, entropy, volume, etc.) from non-invasive medical&#xD;
                images (CT, MRI, etc.) and statistically analyzing the features. Its value has been&#xD;
                demonstrated through the studies for prediction of breast cancer recurrence and&#xD;
                lesion classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Using the open source platform PyRadiomics19, we extract the radiomic&#xD;
                characteristics for brightness (Energy, Entropy, Mean, Median, etc.) and texture&#xD;
                (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix Contrast, Difference Variance, Maximal Correlation&#xD;
                Coefficient, etc.) from the set region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The differences between infiltrative cardiomyopathy and normal control are&#xD;
                identified using clinical information and radiomics features extracted from&#xD;
                echocardiography at the time of the diagnosis visit. The algorithms to distinguish&#xD;
                the disease will be developed using machine learning methods such as support vector&#xD;
                machine classifier.&#xD;

        It is important to obtain as large image data as possible to develop an algorithm capable&#xD;
        of diagnosing various infiltrative myocardial diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infiltrative cardiomyopathy is a rare disease, and it was reported that the prevalence of&#xD;
        cardiac amyloidosis in Korea was 1.91 per 100,000 in 2015.2 In the case of other diseases,&#xD;
        there has been no report of the prevalence in Korea, but reports from an overseas report&#xD;
        that cardiac sarcoidosis is 2.2 per 100,000, 8 and Fabry disease is 0.9 to 2.5 per 100,000.&#xD;
        9,10 Securing enough data that can be learned to improve machine learning accuracy is not&#xD;
        easy because of the scarcity of invasive cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, it is difficult to&#xD;
        confirm the disease. Therefore, it is necessary to review and obtain clinical information&#xD;
        and echocardiographic image data of as many confirmed patients as possible. This study is a&#xD;
        retrospective observational study, and the expected number of target subjects is about 500.&#xD;
