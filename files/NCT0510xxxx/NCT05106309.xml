      A 2-part, crossover design, open-label treatment trial with 4 periods, 4 sequences (Part A)&#xD;
      to evaluate MR formulations of CVL-231 and a 2 periods, 2 sequences (Part B) to understand&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CVL-231 is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activator that selectively binds to&#xD;
      the M4 muscarinic receptor subtype (M4 mAChR) and is being developed for treatment of&#xD;
      psychosis in schizophrenia. Part A of this 2-part trial will investigate the PK of CVL-231 in&#xD;
      healthy participants following a single oral dose of CVL-231 as 3 modified-release (MR)&#xD;
      formulations with different release rates and an immediate-release (IR) formulation under&#xD;
      fasted conditions. Upon selection of an MR formulation with appropriate PK characteristics,&#xD;
      the effect of food on the PK of CVL-231 and its metabolite following single oral doses of the&#xD;
      selected MR formulation may be evaluated in Part B.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Part A is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-sequence, crossover design to investigate the PK, relative bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of single doses of CVL-231 IR/MR formulations in healthy participants. The following treatments, administered under fasted conditions are: 1) 10mg CVL-231 as IR formulation, 2) 30mg CVL-231 as slow release MR formulation, 3) 30mg CVL-231 as medium release MR formulation, 4) 30mg CVL-231 as fast release MR formulation.&#xD;
Part B is an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover design to investigate the effect of food on CVL-231 PK following a single dose of the CVL-231 MR formulation in healthy participants. After completion of Part A, a target release formulation (MR formulation with acceptable PK characteristics) may be selected and effect of food on CVL-231 PK from the target release formulation may be evaluated. Based on Part A data, if a target release formulation cannot be selected, Part B of the trial may be canceled.</intervention_model_description>
