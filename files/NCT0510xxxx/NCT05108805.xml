  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hope to demonstrate that YESCARTA can be safely administered in the outpatient setting if&#xD;
      we closely monitor subjects with physical exams, wearable devices, and telemedicine visits&#xD;
      and only admit those who meet specified criteria&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the feasibility of treating subjects with YESCARTA in the outpatient setting&#xD;
           and guide the development of a subsequent, larger study that will determine the&#xD;
           tolerability and safety profile of YESCARTA in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the time to specific interventions post infusion and the number of subjects&#xD;
           who remain outpatient through 72 hours, 7, 14, and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify risk factors that preclude outpatient administration, and to obtain clinical&#xD;
           data that will guide the development of guidelines by which YESCARTA treatment in the&#xD;
           outpatient setting can be done safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of close monitoring with telemedicine and twice-daily physical exam on&#xD;
           specific outcomes including CRS and ICANS in subjects treated with YESCARTA in the&#xD;
           outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative steroid exposure within 28 days post YESCARTA infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the estimated cost of YESCARTA administered in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from YESCARTA infusion to the following: fever, fever with neutropenia, fever&#xD;
           without neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from fever to Tocilizumab, fever to ICU admission, fever to low BP, fever to IV&#xD;
           Fluid, fever to vasopressor, fever to onset to arrhythmias and fever to hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate modified Neutropenic Fever Symptom Burden (NFSB) score for days 1-3 for each&#xD;
           subject. Appendix D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain subject reported outcomes measured by Subject-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
           Information System (PROMIS; Appendix F) [16, 17]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of using wearable devices to monitor vital signs in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
           Data collected are for research only&#xD;
