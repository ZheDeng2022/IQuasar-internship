  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this voluntary research study is to determine if calibrated formula feeding&#xD;
      recommendations can promote optimal growth for the first 6 months after birth for mothers&#xD;
      with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of 25 or more.&#xD;

      This pilot study seeks to determine if formula feeding recommendations that are calibrated&#xD;
      using age and weight specific caloric intake recommendations can prevent excessive infant&#xD;
      weight gain and reduce overweight in the first 6 months after birth among infants born to&#xD;
      mothers with overweight prior to pregnancy electing to exclusively formula feed their&#xD;
      infants. Calibrated formula feeding refers to adjusting the recommended daily caloric formula&#xD;
      intake to account for weight status. A cohort of 60 infants will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
      2-3 weeks after birth to an intervention arm characterized by calibrated formula feeding&#xD;
      recommendations or a control group with ad lib feeds as per usual care. Intervention group&#xD;
      parents will also be given written instructions on infant hunger and satiety cues as well as&#xD;
      copies of videos with guidance on bottle feeding and how to soothe fussy infants without&#xD;
      feeding. The investigators hypothesize that the calibrated formula intake intervention will&#xD;
      reduce rapid infant gain and overweight during infancy resulting in lower weight-for-length&#xD;
      at age 6 months.&#xD;
