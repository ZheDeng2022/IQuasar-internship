  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial studies the effects of personalized home-based aerobic and resistance exercises on&#xD;
      quality of life, changes in physical activity levels, and the change in inflammatory myokines&#xD;
      with the exercise intervention in Interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive Protein (CRP), Leptin,&#xD;
      Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and Interferon (INF) gamma.&#xD;
