  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a cardiovascular disease manifesting from systemic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis that blocks the leg arteries and results in insufficient blood flow to the&#xD;
      lower extremities. Limb ischemia from PAD is the most common disorder treated within the&#xD;
      vascular surgical service of the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PAD also accounts for&#xD;
      one-third of the operations performed in the VA Medical Centers nationwide. The risk of&#xD;
      mortality of Veterans with PAD is substantial; nearly 30% of Veterans with PAD died within&#xD;
      3.8 years of diagnosis. This project aims to establish the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      specially designed assistive shoes in patients with PAD and to determine if there are any&#xD;
      potential benefits of using these shoes over standard shoes. These assistive shoes may enable&#xD;
      patients to carry out desired activities of daily living with less pain and more physical&#xD;
      activity. Increasing physical activity will decrease morbidity and mortality. If proven&#xD;
      beneficial, the findings will lead to a novel and conservative rehabilitation protocol that&#xD;
      directly benefits Veterans nationwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to improve mobility, functional independence, and&#xD;
      quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) by using specially designed&#xD;
      assistive shoes. PAD is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis producing blockages in&#xD;
      the leg arteries, resulting in insufficient blood flow to the lower extremities. Limb&#xD;
      ischemia from PAD is the most common disorder treated within the vascular surgical service of&#xD;
      the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PAD also accounts for one-third of the operations&#xD;
      performed nationwide in the VA. Walking induced muscle pain known as intermittent&#xD;
      claudication is the most common PAD symptom. Claudicating patients with PAD walk slower, have&#xD;
      reduced quality of life and lose independence in performing activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      investigators have identified consistent deficits of the ankle plantarflexors to effectively&#xD;
      push-off during walking. Currently, there is a critical treatment gap for patients whose&#xD;
      disease presentation does not warrant an operative approach, but who desire to restore their&#xD;
      functional independence and walking ability. Specially designed assistive shoes (carbon&#xD;
      fiber: CF; spring-loaded: SL) with specific mechanical properties to absorb and release&#xD;
      energy, have been shown to promote push-off efficiency in walkers and runners. These shoes&#xD;
      may lead to improved push-off in populations with reduced ankle push-off capacity, but this&#xD;
      has not been tested yet. This work proposes to evaluate patient preferences in terms of using&#xD;
      assistive shoes and whether these shoes improve walking performance in claudicating patients&#xD;
      with PAD. The investigators hypothesize that assistive shoes (CF and SL) will lead to&#xD;
      improved walking performance in patients with PAD as compared to standard shoes. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that subject reported preference of assistive shoes (CF and&#xD;
      SL) will be positive based on comfort, fatigue, ease of walking, and feasibility. These&#xD;
      hypotheses will be tested by the following three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the acute improvement in walking performance (claudication walking&#xD;
      distances, vertical ground reaction force, and muscle oxygenation) in patients with PAD while&#xD;
      using their standard shoes versus the assistive shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the subject-reported preference of assistive shoes. Aim 3: Determine the&#xD;
      progressive improvements in physical activity, quality of life, and walking distance after a&#xD;
      three-month assistive shoe intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with PAD will be recruited for Aims 1 and 2. For Aim 1, each subject will&#xD;
      walk on a pressure instrumented treadmill while performing a progressive treadmill test with&#xD;
      a near infrared spectroscopy sensor on the calf for each shoe condition: i) standard, ii) CF,&#xD;
      and iii) SL. Walking performance will be evaluated in terms of claudication walking&#xD;
      distances, vertical ground reaction force, and muscle oxygenation. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared across these three types of shoes. Aim 2 will primarily focus on qualitative&#xD;
      measurements of subject reported preference to identify whether assistive shoes are feasible&#xD;
      for patients with PAD to use. Visual-analog scales, rate of perceived exertion, and&#xD;
      interviews will be used to assess comfort, fatigue, intensity, and feasibility after each&#xD;
      condition of Aim 1. Five patients from Aims 1 and 2 who are satisfied with CL and another&#xD;
      five who are satisfied with SL, will be recruited for Aim 3. Patients will wear the assistive&#xD;
      shoes of their choice for regular daily use for three months as a conservative intervention.&#xD;
      Physical activity, quality of life, and walking distances will be assessed prior to the start&#xD;
      of the intervention and after three months of intervention. Overall, the aims will&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of assistive shoes in patients with PAD. Results&#xD;
      will support a full clinical trial, and guide necessary intervention length and potential&#xD;
      rehabilitation recommendations.&#xD;
