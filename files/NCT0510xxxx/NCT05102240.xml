      Retrospective study utilizing patient data to develop and validate Machine Learning&#xD;
      application. Available imaging data sets of patients who have completed treatment will be&#xD;
      used to develop Normal tissue complication probability and Tumour control probability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Integrating existing radiation treatment information, quantitative imaging and&#xD;
      patient outcome data from completed and ongoing clinical trials will allow development of&#xD;
      knowledge based systems for efficient treatment delivery and allow selection of patients for&#xD;
      intensified treatment approaches in cervix cancer.&#xD;

      For Aim 1. Automatic delineation of complex tumour targets for cervical cancer for the Gross&#xD;
      Tumour Volume (GTV) at baseline and at brachytherapy and High Risk Clinical Target&#xD;
      Volume(CTV) at baseline and brachytherapy will be done on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following structures will be processed for automation on CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low Risk Clinical Target Volume (Low Risk CTV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GTV: Nodal&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elective Nodal Pelvic Target Volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elective Nodal Pelvic and Paraaortic Volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bladder&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sigmoid&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Bowel&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Bone Marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2. we intend to employ machine learning for developing more robust normal tissue&#xD;
      toxicity prediction models. Further advanced techniques like texture analysis of radiation&#xD;
      dose maps and follow up tissue density will also be performed to develop predictive models of&#xD;
      toxicity. By using our patient datasets, we want to create a library of proton beam plans&#xD;
      with the proton planning systems that will be available in department of radiation oncology&#xD;
      and using the developed normal tissue complication plots available the information of&#xD;
      achievable doses through protons can help in identifying patients who will benefit from&#xD;
      proton therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 3. Within this project we intend to integrate staging, pathology and quantitative&#xD;
      imaging texture features for response prediction and identification of &quot;high risk cohort&quot; in&#xD;
      cervix cancer. Images and clinical data from patients that have MRI at baseline will be&#xD;
      included The texture features can be used to categorise &quot;good&quot; and &quot;poor responders&quot; after&#xD;
      chemoradiation. For the same cohort of patients we also have tissue available including&#xD;
      results of additional biomarkers (like AKT,LICAM, PDL1,CD4 and CD8). We intend to first&#xD;
      correlate difference in texture features and see if there is a pattern of different molecular&#xD;
      features. In the second step imaging and molecular features could be integrated for&#xD;
      developing&quot; risk prediction models&quot;. GTV and HRCTV delineated on 150 data sets at baseline&#xD;
      and brachytherapy within Aim 1 will be utilised to categorise responders and non-responders&#xD;
      and validate another 150 patient data sets.&#xD;
