  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an anonymous needs assessment survey of the population of an Irish urban town. We&#xD;
      plan to collect anonymous survey data in order to better understand residents needs and to&#xD;
      determine the desired functionality of a new coach-led wellness app operated by our partners.&#xD;
      This platform is currently trialled for health care professionals working in the RCSI&#xD;
      Hospital Group. The survey will collect information on participants demographics, their&#xD;
      lifestyle (including sleep, exercise, food, relationships, meaning and purpose, substance use&#xD;
      and stress management). We will also ask participants about their use of wellness apps to&#xD;
      support healthy choices related to their lifestyle. We also plan to conduct a qualitative&#xD;
      assessment to further explore needs related to lifestyle health in specific cohorts, namely,&#xD;
      older people (65 years and older), recent migrants, members of the travelling community,&#xD;
      perinatal women, lone-parents, individuals with physical disabilities, secondary school&#xD;
      students and remote workers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been an increase in lifestyle related diseases worldwide (World Health&#xD;
      Organisation, 2018b). Living a healthy lifestyle is important to prevent lifestyle-related&#xD;
      diseases such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, mental health issues, certain cancers,&#xD;
      autoimmunity and gastro-intestinal disease. The economic impact of these lifestyle-related&#xD;
      diseases in Europe alone is set to exceed â‚¬200 billion by 2030. Worldwide, one in five people&#xD;
      are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19, mostly as a result of underlying&#xD;
      lifestyle-related diseases. Additionally, global efforts to manage COVID-19 infection have&#xD;
      disrupted regular care required by those with these issues. Dealing with this requires that&#xD;
      people better manage their own health and address lifestyle related factors that increase the&#xD;
      risk associated with such diseases, including inactivity, substance abuse and unhealthy diet&#xD;
      (Ng et al. 2020). These risk factors are modifiable and can be reduced by health&#xD;
      interventions and tools to support a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic caused prolonged feelings of fear, uncertainty and isolation among the&#xD;
      general population (Ghebreyesus, 2020). This is likely to impact vulnerable members of&#xD;
      society, such as young people, elderly people and those in ethnic minority communities in&#xD;
      greater proportions. Children and adolescents are experiencing increased adverse mental&#xD;
      health effects such as social isolation, loneliness, depression and anxiety, during the&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic (O'Sullivan et al. 2021; Loades et al. 2020). Irish adults aged 70 and over&#xD;
      have reported worse mental health and increased feelings of loneliness due to cocooning&#xD;
      throughout the pandemic (Bailey et al. 2021; Ward et al. 2020). This social isolation and&#xD;
      loneliness puts them at increased risk of cognitive and cardiovascular decline (Fried et al.&#xD;
      2020; Valtorta et al. 2016). It is important that we prioritise the development of strategies&#xD;
      to maintain social engagement, manage loneliness and encourage continued physical activity&#xD;
      among older people (Bailey et al. 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work habits are currently changing at a rapid pace. Significant sections of our workforces&#xD;
      are now working from home and at least 50% are expected to remain at home, even after the&#xD;
      current pandemic has resolved. Reports indicate that a significant proportion of this&#xD;
      workforce is experiencing issues with disconnection and mental health. As a result,&#xD;
      understanding the impact of remote and flexible working arrangements on employee health and&#xD;
      mental wellbeing has been included as a research priority within psychological science&#xD;
      (O'Connor et al. 2020). While there is evidence that remote working has positive effects on&#xD;
      well-being, these effects are not consistent. Remote working may also lead to greater levels&#xD;
      of professional isolation, reduced work-life balance, increase work-related fatigue and have&#xD;
      negative impacts on well-being (O'Connor et al., 2020; Palumbo, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to better understand people's needs in relation to living a&#xD;
      healthier lifestyle. We aim to conduct a needs assessment the population of one Irish urban&#xD;
      town. We want to check how a new coach-led wellness app could help people make healthy&#xD;
      choices related to their lifestyle. In order to better understand the populations' needs&#xD;
      around a healthy lifestyle, we will ask questions about participants background, lifestyle&#xD;
      and their use of digital technology for health, including smart phone apps. We will also ask&#xD;
      questions about what participants would like to see in a perfect smart phone app; an app that&#xD;
      would help them make healthy choices related to their lifestyle. Qualitative interviews will&#xD;
      also be conducted to further explore individuals needs related to lifestyle health in&#xD;
      specific cohorts, namely, older people (65 years and older), recent migrants, members of the&#xD;
      travelling community, perinatal women, lone-parents, individuals with physical disabilities,&#xD;
      and remote workers.&#xD;
