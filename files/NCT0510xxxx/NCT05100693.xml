      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability to prenatally deflate and to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of the Smart-TO device for fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) in&#xD;
      fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and moderate to severe pulmonary hypoplasia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect characterized by impaired closure of&#xD;
      the diaphragm. This enables abdominal viscera to herniate into the thoracic cavity, leading&#xD;
      to hypoplastic lungs and impaired lung vasculature. Fetal lung growth may be stimulated by&#xD;
      Fetoscopic Endoluminal Tracheal Occlusion (FETO). For left-sided CDH, there is now level I&#xD;
      evidence that it significantly improves survival in severe cases; the effect in moderate&#xD;
      cases is much less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its benefits, the current procedure has many disadvantages. First, there is the need&#xD;
      for prenatal reversal of the balloon, which is invasive. In utero balloon removal&#xD;
      re-establishes airway patency. This can be done electively at 34 weeks or earlier if&#xD;
      required, but preferentially at least 24 hours before birth. &quot;Unplugging&quot; requires a second&#xD;
      procedure and a specialist team familiar with the procedure, which is available at all times.&#xD;
      In the most extensive series published thus far, 28% of balloon removals were in an emergency&#xD;
      setting. The only neonatal deaths were caused by complications when balloon reversal was&#xD;
      attempted in centers without experience or unprepared. In utero reversal of the occlusion is&#xD;
      also an invasive procedure because it requires ultrasound-guided puncture or fetoscopy. The&#xD;
      second procedure adds both to the fetal and maternal risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balloon removal is a difficult procedure that needs expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prenatal balloon removal procedure can fail in 3.4% even in experienced centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balloon removal is not feasible in utero in 12.6 to 24.7% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balloon removal is performed in an emergency setting in 28% of the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balloon removal can lead to neonatal death in none well-trained centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In utero balloon removal may induce delivery within one week in 25% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are requested to stay close to a FETO center for the entire duration of the&#xD;
           tracheal occlusion, which is a burden on the family, limiting the acceptability of FETO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smart-TO balloon allows remotely controlled non-invasive reversal of the occlusion.&#xD;
      Around the balloon neck, there is a metallic cylinder and inside a magnetic ball, which acts&#xD;
      as a valve. Deflation occurs under a strong magnetic field, as generated by a clinical MRI&#xD;
      machine. For that, it is sufficient for the pregnant woman to walk around a clinical MRI&#xD;
      machine. The opening of the valve induces the deflation of the balloon, which is then washed&#xD;
      out by the fluid coming out from the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have completed the translational research that proved the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of this balloon for FETO and want to use this medical device for the first time in&#xD;
      humans. The purpose of this first in-woman study is to demonstrate the ability to prenatally&#xD;
      deflate and to evaluate the safety of the Smart-TO device for FETO in fetuses with congenital&#xD;
      diaphragmatic hernia and moderate to severe pulmonary hypoplasia. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FETO with Smart-TO balloon will be performed between 27 and 31wks + 6 days depending on the&#xD;
      severity of pulmonary hypoplasia, according to the same technique used with the balloon&#xD;
      usually used for the FETO procedure. Reversal of the tracheal occlusion will be performed&#xD;
      between 34 and 34wks + 6 days or earlier if necessary. In the unlikely event of a patient&#xD;
      with imminent signs of delivery, balloon removal will be done on placental circulation or&#xD;
      postnatally. This will ensure the patient's safety. The patient will be asked to walk around&#xD;
      the MR scanner to open the magnetic valve and induce the deflation of the balloon.&#xD;
      Afterwards, an ultrasound will be performed by two experienced sonographers to assess balloon&#xD;
      deflation. In the case of deflation failure, a second and -if necessary- a third MRI exposure&#xD;
      will be attempted following ultrasound confirmation to ensure balloon deflation. In the case&#xD;
      of balloon failure to deflate or any doubt about deflation, an MRI with image acquisition&#xD;
      will be performed to (1) attempt deflation and (2) assess the airway patency. In the case of&#xD;
      failure to deflate, balloon removal will be done by fetoscopy, placental circulation, or&#xD;
      postnatally (depending on the clinical scenario). Within 24 hours after balloon deflation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An MRI (with image acquisition) will be performed to locate the deflated balloon and as a&#xD;
      second safety measure to ensure the patency of the airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be allowed to return to her tertiary centre of preference once the airways'&#xD;
      patency is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery does not differ from the standard care protocol for children with CDH. In the case&#xD;
      of MRI deflation protocol, the following will be done to locate the balloon:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inspection and search of any amniotic fluid, membranes, and the placenta*&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard X-ray of the newborn, which is standard, to assess lungs, airways, intubation,&#xD;
           and location of the stomach and nasogastric tube; on that the balloon may be visible,&#xD;
           e.g., in the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An ultrasound of the postpartum uterus will be done to demonstrate that the uterine&#xD;
           cavity is empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up and management of the newborn will be according to the standardized management&#xD;
      protocol of the CDH EURO Consortium. Data collection will be stopped at the moment the child&#xD;
      is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
