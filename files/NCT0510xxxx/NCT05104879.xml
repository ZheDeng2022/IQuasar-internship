  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our investigation was a prospective cross-sectional survey evaluating the patient experience&#xD;
      to new patients that presented to an outpatient private practice specialized in total joint&#xD;
      reconstruction. New patients seeing a PA during their initial visit were randomized to&#xD;
      intervention and control groups and all were given a descriptive survey at checkout.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria (1) new patient (2) English speaking (3) appointment with PA. There was no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Eligible patients were randomized to the intervention group (received&#xD;
      biosketch card) or the control group (no card) using random number generator. Patients within&#xD;
      the intervention group received a biosketch card during rooming, pre-clinician encounter, and&#xD;
      were not informed about involvement. Both groups received standard care that was independent&#xD;
      of the study. To blind the outcome measure, the research assistant did not explain the reason&#xD;
      for the card upon rooming. The provider PA was not informed which patient received the card.&#xD;
      Upon discharge, the patient completed a five-question survey regarding the clinic visit.&#xD;
