  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip or knee replacement is an important and cost-effective surgical intervention to&#xD;
      relieve pain and improve independence and function in patients with osteoarthritis. The&#xD;
      number of people waiting for elective surgeries has spiked in the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to&#xD;
      COVID-19, up to 40% of patients receiving joint replacement were frail and this number is&#xD;
      rapidly increasing with longer wait-times and deconditioning associated with COVID-19&#xD;
      physical distancing. There is an urgent need to be responsive to the evolving challenges of&#xD;
      healthcare. The proposed study is the first multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      examine whether a multimodal frailty reduction intervention before surgery will improve&#xD;
      postsurgical outcomes for this population. The COVID-19 adapted hybrid model includes a&#xD;
      multimodal frailty intervention that may be implemented either in person or virtually and is&#xD;
      aligned with international consensus guidelines on frailty reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To utilize the FitJoints multimodal frailty intervention to build resilience of patients&#xD;
      undergoing joint replacement surgery to improve post-operative outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize the FitJoints multimodal frailty intervention, with exercise, nutrition and&#xD;
      medication optimization, will reduce frailty and pain while improving function and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building upon the success of the FitJoints feasibility study (n=69) in Hamilton, Ontario, in&#xD;
      the proposed multi-site RCT (n=192), older adults (â‰¥60 years) undergoing hip or knee joint&#xD;
      replacement surgery who are frail will be randomized to either the 3 to 6-months of&#xD;
      multimodal intervention or usual care until the date of their surgery at multiple sites&#xD;
      (Hamilton Health Sciences &amp; St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, ON; London Health Science&#xD;
      Centre, London, ON; Foothills Hospital, Calgary, AB),The FitJoints evidence-based, multimodal&#xD;
      intervention includes a hybrid model that can be implemented either in person or virtually:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiotherapist supported multi-component exercise program&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutrition and protein optimization including dietary counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Medication review with prescribing recommendations&#xD;

4-meter walk test (walking speed): measured in seconds, scored 0 to 4&#xD;
