    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of a consumer trial conducted&#xD;
      by Rae Wellness. The trial took place between October 15, 2020 and December 30, 2020 and&#xD;
      involved 1350 U.S. women who used in-home use tests (IHUT) of various Cannabidiol (CBD)&#xD;
      products. Participants were randomized to one of 9 groups: 8 groups received one of 8&#xD;
      different CBD products in the mail, and one group served as the control and did not consume&#xD;
      any CBD product. The CBD products varied by method of delivery, concentration of&#xD;
      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and dosage of CBD. Participants were asked to use the product&#xD;
      once daily for 60 day and to complete health questionnaires at baseline, 30 days and 60 days.&#xD;

      Between October 1-7, 2020, women from across the US were recruited by Rae Wellness to&#xD;
      participate in a 60-day in-home use test (IHUT) of various Cannabidiol (CBD) products. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were: women; between the ages of 24-44; reported symptoms associated with&#xD;
      at least 4 out of 6 health issues (stress; anxiety; pain; sleep issues; digestive issues; low&#xD;
      libido). Individuals were excluded if they were pregnant or breastfeeding. 1,350 women were&#xD;
      randomly selected to participate in the study. The participants were randomized to one of 9&#xD;
      groups in the IHUT (150 in each group): 8 groups received one of 8 different CBD products in&#xD;
      the mail, and one group served as the control and did not consume any CBD product. The CBD&#xD;
      products varied by method of delivery (oil or capsule), concentration of Tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
      (THC; less than 0.3% THC or 0% THC), and dosage of CBD (15, 20, 25 and 30 mg). Participants&#xD;
      were asked to use the product once daily every day for 60 consecutive days, and to complete a&#xD;
      health questionnaire online on 3 occasions: before initiating the product (baseline), 30 days&#xD;
      after initiating the product, and 60 days after initiating the product. Those in the control&#xD;
      group were also asked to complete the health questionnaire at each time point but did not&#xD;
      receive nor consume any CBD product. The health questionnaire assessed anxiety, physical&#xD;
      health, digestive health, sleep patterns, general wellness and sexual satisfaction using&#xD;
      questions drawn from validated health indices.&#xD;
