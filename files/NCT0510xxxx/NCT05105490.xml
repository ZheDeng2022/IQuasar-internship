  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PerQdisc PMCF1 is a post-market clinical follow-up observational trial to follow subjects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, open-label, multi-center post-market observational study&#xD;
      including 72 patients that will collect additional safety and efficacy data for the Spinal&#xD;
      Stabilization Technologies PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement System. Primary endpoints will be&#xD;
      used to assess the safety and efficacy of the PerQdisc device.&#xD;

          -  Patient has adequate disc height (6mm) at the level to be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not responsive to conservative, non-surgical treatment for back pain.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has less than 6 mm of disc height.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had prior lumbar spine surgery (nucleoplasty at non-index level is&#xD;
             considered acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had spinal fusion in the lumbar or thoracic intervertebral spaces.&#xD;
             Cervical fusion is allowed as long as there are no neurologic deficits in the lower&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has spondyloarthropathy or other spondylolisthesis greater than 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has congenital moderate or severe spinal stenosis or epidural lipomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has significant facet disease. Significant is defined as pain improvement of&#xD;
             80% or more following image-guided medial branch blocks of the target level according&#xD;
             to Spine Intervention Society (SIS) guidelines (diagnostic, contrast controlled).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any known active malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has previously undergone or currently on immunosuppressive therapy. Steroids&#xD;
             used to treat inflammation are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has active or local systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been diagnosed with hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus,&#xD;

             related Complex (ARC), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) requiring daily insulin management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has osteopenia of the spine (T-score of -1.0 or lower). A Bone Densiometry&#xD;
             (DEXA) scan should be performed to rule out patients considered at risk for&#xD;
             osteopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has morbid obesity defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) more than 40 or a weight&#xD;
             of more than 45 kg (100 lbs.) over ideal body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a known allergy to silicone or barium sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a significant disc herniation at the level to be treated. Significant is&#xD;
             defined as a large extruded herniation that creates a risk for expulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a significant Schmorl's node in the level to be treated. Significant is&#xD;
             defined as a large, rectangular or irregular shaped node that has an associated active&#xD;
             inflammatory process (Modic I changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has motion of less than 3 degrees on pre-operative lateral flexion/extension&#xD;
             radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Protrusion of the 20A Imaging Balloon up to or beyond the outer margin of the vertebra&#xD;
             during the imaging steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a violated endplate as determined by imaging balloons during fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a disc space that is too narrow for implantation.&#xD;
