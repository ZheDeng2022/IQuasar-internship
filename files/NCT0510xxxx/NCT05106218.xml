      The aim of this study is to evaluate standard urological surgeries using the 270Surgical&#xD;
      system vs same procedures using the standard scope&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tremendous popularity of the laparoscopic surgeries is balanced with its tradeoffs - the&#xD;
      needs for an excellent intracavitary visualization along with a surgeon skill set capable of&#xD;
      performing these, often more technically challenging procedures. Image quality has improved,&#xD;
      but there are still various restrictions to images captured by the lens at the tip of a long&#xD;
      tubular laparoscope. 270Surgical developed a 270 degree angle scope to overcome these unmet&#xD;
      needs and improve the image quantity and extent during laparoscopy. The study will compare&#xD;
      the use of the 270Surgical system (The &quot;SurroundScope&quot;) to standard laparoscope during&#xD;
      partial nephrectomy and nephrectomy urilogical surgeries;&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>For laparoscopic camera system to be used in urological surgeries, the SurroundScope, 270-degree angle videoscope (270Surgical, Israel) is used. This will be compared to the standard laparoscopic system use.&#xD;
The study will evaluate standard urological surgeries using the 270Surgical system vs same procedures using the standard scope. The procedure will be performed according to the institution's standard of care, using the SurroundScope or the standard scope for visualization. Each surgery will be captured on video.</intervention_model_description>
