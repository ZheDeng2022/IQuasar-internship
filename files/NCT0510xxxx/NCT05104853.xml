  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2a First-in-Human (FIH) clinical trial to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of multiple ascending doses of CNP-104. The&#xD;
      study consists of a 120 day primary study followed by a 20 month long-term safety and&#xD;
      durability of response follow-up period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects ages 18-75 with primary biliary cholangitis will be screened up to 14 days prior to&#xD;
      enrollment into the study. Screening will be completed to assess eligibility, obtain vital&#xD;
      signs, collect laboratory samples and PD measurements, and to receive a FibroScan for liver&#xD;
      fibrosis. Subjects will additionally complete an initial PBC-40 assessment and begin an Itch&#xD;
      Diary, a questionnaire and scoring system to be completed by the patient every morning and&#xD;
      evening through Day 120 and then monthly through end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria after completing the screening&#xD;
      visit will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either CNP-104 or Placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride USP) by intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered CNP-104 or Placebo on Day 1 and on Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain in the clinic on Day 1 and Day 8 from the time of admission (prior to&#xD;
      administration of CNP-104 or Placebo) through the final procedure conducted 4 hours post-dose&#xD;
      that same day unless an infusion reaction, or other adverse event, requires an extended&#xD;
      duration of monitoring. Subjects will be discharged if safety parameters are acceptable to&#xD;
      the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after the second administration of CNP-104 or Placebo, subjects must return to the&#xD;
      clinic for collection of safety labs, PD measurements, and assessment of AEs and medication&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to be followed for safety, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity during&#xD;
      the Post-Dosing period.&#xD;
