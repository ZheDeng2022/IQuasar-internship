  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS/e-cigarettes/vaping) are increasingly popular&#xD;
      among teenagers around the world. The safety and potential adverse effects of ENDS in this&#xD;
      population are largely unknown. While the aerosol, that users inhale, appears safe under&#xD;
      laboratory conditions, there are still open questions, which have not yet been assessed.&#xD;
      These cover (a) differences in exposure to chemicals (such as metabolites of Volatile Organic&#xD;
      Compounds (VOCs) and metabolites of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)) between healthy&#xD;
      teenagers using ENDS and healthy teenagers not vaping, (b) effects of exposure to such&#xD;
      chemicals on the body (measured by lung health indicators: airway symptoms such as coughing;&#xD;
      lung function and lung structure tests; immune response of airway cells exposed to vapor;&#xD;
      markers of oxidative stress), and (c) the role of nicotine metabolism. It is unknown which&#xD;
      lung health indicator/s is/are most relevant to assess the effect of ENDS on lung health in&#xD;
      teenagers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that there will be differences in exposure to&#xD;
      chemicals, resulting in more or more severe airway symptoms in vaping teenagers compared to&#xD;
      their non-vaping peers. While there might not yet exist any differences regarding lung&#xD;
      function or structure, we expect already visible effects of vaping on the local immune&#xD;
      response of primary cells isolated from airways in vaping teenagers as compared to non-vaping&#xD;
      peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants of the Bern Basel Infant Lung Development (BILD) cohort, a birth&#xD;
      cohort of healthy term-born infants and their follow-up, will serve as healthy, non-vaping&#xD;
      controls.1 Vaping teenagers will be recruited independently from the BILD study through&#xD;
      advertisements and visits to Bernese schools. Both populations combined represent the study&#xD;
      population of the e-BILD study. All e-BILD study participants will undergo the same&#xD;
      investigations. While these are currently planned for once in a time (so-called&#xD;
      cross-sectional design) to compare results from non-vaping BILD study participants to&#xD;
      otherwise healthy but vaping teenagers, repeated measures might follow, depending on the&#xD;
      findings of the first phase.&#xD;
