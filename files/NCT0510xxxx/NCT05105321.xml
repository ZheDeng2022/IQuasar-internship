  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome population is at high-risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&#xD;
      How to effectively control the risk factors of this population is the key to primary&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in China. This study aims to explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of an intervention strategy with berberine that can effectively treat a&#xD;
      variety of risk factors (hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a condition with multiple abnormal metabolic components, including&#xD;
      obesity, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension. The components of metabolic syndrome are&#xD;
      major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is&#xD;
      the primary cause of death and disease burden in China. This study aims to explore an&#xD;
      intervention drug that can effectively control a variety of risk factors (hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, hypertension), so as to improve the effectiveness and practical feasibility of&#xD;
      primary prevention. Berberine is a drug with multiple function. Basic studies and previous&#xD;
      clinical studies suggest that it has definite regulatory effects on blood glucose, lipid&#xD;
      levels and blood pressure with few adverse reactions. This study selected pleiotropic&#xD;
      Berberine as a means of intervention. It would provide new thought and high-level evidence&#xD;
      for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Chinese population.&#xD;
