  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib and&#xD;
      methotrexate based on prednisone therapy in patients with Takayasu arteritis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu's arteritis (TAK), a chronic large vessel vasculitis, involves the aorta and its&#xD;
      main branches. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      are common agents for TAK treatment. However, their effects for remission induction and&#xD;
      relapse prevention are not satisfied. More effective agents for TAK treatment remain to be&#xD;
      investigated. Tofacitinib (TOF) is a Jak inhibitor, which has been proved to be effective in&#xD;
      multiple autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Our preliminary real-world study&#xD;
      also demonstrated a promising treatment effect of TOF in patients with TAK. But its efficacy&#xD;
      and safety needs further verification. The present randomized controlled trial aimes to&#xD;
      compare efficacy between methotrexate and tofacitinib in TAK treatment.&#xD;
