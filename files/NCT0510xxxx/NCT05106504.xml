  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical cannabis (MC) is a standard treatment in Israel to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients&#xD;
      suffering from pain. Nevertheless, it is not known about MC effectiveness for other non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease. Our aim is to prospectively observe patients with PD before and&#xD;
      after initiation of MC, for non-motor symptoms effect. In specific, relying of data from&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis patients and basic science showing cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is&#xD;
      abundantly expressed in the sub epithelial layer of the bladder, we will explore the impact&#xD;
      of MC on bladder function and urinary symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, observational study. Patients with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) receiving licensure from Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) for using medical cannabis&#xD;
      (MC) for PD related symptoms and pain, being followed up in the Movement Disorders Institute&#xD;
      (MDI) at SHEBA Medical Center (SMC) will be eligible to participate. Assessment regarding&#xD;
      patient demographic, disease characteristics (Hoehn and Yahr, disease duration, disease first&#xD;
      symptom etc.) will be collected at baseline along with designated questionnaires to evaluate&#xD;
      the non-motor symptoms (NMSS, PDSS, Kings PD pain scale, PDQ8) and urinary function (Bladder&#xD;
      over activity, International prostate symptom score (IPSS) and nocturia questionnaires).&#xD;
      after MC initiation, patients will be observed and evaluated for the impact of MC 4-8 weeks&#xD;
      following treatment initiation. Also, for each patient, MC being used will be analyzed in&#xD;
      order to expose relationship between phyto-cannabinoid content and efficacy or side effects.&#xD;
