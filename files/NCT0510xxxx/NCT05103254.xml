  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Major congenital malformations (MCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An abnormality of body structure or function that is present at birth, is of prenatal origin (i.e., birth defect), has significant medical, social, or cosmetic consequences for the affected individual, and typically requires medical intervention (CDC 2019a). MCMs will be defined and coded with criteria specified by US CDC Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minor congenital malformation</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An anomaly or abnormality of body structure that is present at birth, is of prenatal origin (i.e., birth defect), poses no significant health problem in the neonatal period, and tends to have limited social or cosmetic consequences for the affected individual (CDC 2019a). The surveillance program defines and codes minor congenital malformations with criteria specified as defined by CDC (CDC 2017).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spontaneous abortion</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of conception up to birth</time_frame>
    <description>An involuntary fetal loss or the expulsion of the products of conception occurring at &lt; 20 gestational weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stillbirth</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of conception up to birth</time_frame>
    <description>As defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an involuntary fetal loss occurring at ≥ 20 gestational weeks or, if gestational age is unknown, a fetus weighing ≥ 350 g.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Elective termination</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of conception up to birth</time_frame>
    <description>A voluntary fetal loss or interruption of pregnancy, including pregnancy termination that occurs electively, to preserve maternal health or due to fetal abnormalities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preterm birth</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of conception up to birth</time_frame>
    <description>A live birth occurring at &lt; 37 gestational weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Small for gestational age (SGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weight at birth in &lt; 10th percentile for sex and gestational age using standard growth charts for full and preterm live-born infants (Battaglia 1967). For the determination of SGA, the surveillance program will utilize the sex-specific international growth reference standards from the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st Century (INTERGROWTH-21st) for those born between 240/7 and 426/7 gestational weeks (Villar 2014; Villar 2016). The INTERGROWTH-21st standards are the latest available global reference standards, representing contemporary information from an international, multiethnic, diverse population, and have been specifically developed for modern research.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postnatal growth deficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weight in &lt; 10th percentile for sex and chronological age using standard growth charts. Postnatal growth deficiency will be evaluated at 4 and 12 months of infant age. For the determination of postnatal growth deficiency, the surveillance program will utilize the sex-specific international growth reference standards from the World Health Organization for children ages 0 to 24 months. The World Health Organization growth standards are recommended for use in the US for infants and children 0 to 2 years of age (CDC 2010).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant development deficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Failure to achieve the developmental milestones for chronological age, as defined by the CDC (CDC 2019b). Infant developmental deficiency will be evaluated at 4 and 12 months of infant age for each CDC-defined category (social/emotional, language/communication, cognitive, and movement/physical development), separately.</description>
