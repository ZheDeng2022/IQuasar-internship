  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the metabolic, appetite, energy intake, and perceptual responses to a&#xD;
      bout of exercise completed in the evening after after a low-carbohydrate lunch meal (&lt;10%&#xD;
      carbohydrate content / 0.2 g/kg carbohydrate; LO-CHO), with the responses to exercise&#xD;
      performed after a lunch meal containing a high carbohydrate content (~60% carbohydrate&#xD;
      content / 2.2 g/kg carbohydrate; HI-CHO), and after skipping lunch and fasting for 8 hours&#xD;
      since breakfast (FAST).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is known to be a successful strategy for improving several facets of health&#xD;
      and maintaining body weight. However, many people are not engaging in enough exercise, and&#xD;
      some may not be achieving maximum benefits from the exercise that they already do. Performing&#xD;
      exercise in the overnight fasted state has been shown to reduce energy intake over the course&#xD;
      of a single day, without any compensatory reductions in free-living energy expenditure.&#xD;
      Despite these promising findings, it is likely that not every member of the population is&#xD;
      logistically able to perform exercise in the morning due to various work, family and social&#xD;
      commitments, and exercise in the evening may be a logical alternative for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have found that exercise performed after an overnight fast may incur superior&#xD;
      improvements in insulin sensitivity in lean individuals (Van Proeyen et al., 2010), and&#xD;
      individuals with overweight or obesity (Edinburgh et al., 2020), compared to exercising after&#xD;
      breakfast. These superior improvements may be mediated, in part, by an increased mobilisation&#xD;
      and oxidation of endogenous lipid stores. Additionally, overnight fasted exercise may result&#xD;
      in a more negative energy balance than exercising after breakfast (Bachman et al., 2016;&#xD;
      Edinburgh et al., 2019). We recently examined whether exercise performed in the evening&#xD;
      following an extended period of fasting (7 h) would induce similar responses to overnight&#xD;
      fasted exercise regarding substrate oxidation patterns and subsequent energy intake&#xD;
      (manuscript in preparation - NCT04742530). This research question was important, as we&#xD;
      speculate that a large proportion of the population are likely unable to perform exercise in&#xD;
      the morning after an overnight fast due to various logistical barriers. Therefore fasting&#xD;
      prior to evening exercise could act as an alternative for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We found that compared to consuming a carbohydrate-containing meal 2 h prior, fasting before&#xD;
      evening exercise resulted in elevated fat oxidation rates during exercise, but was&#xD;
      accompanied by compensatory eating at dinner. Additionally, participants reported that&#xD;
      fasting throughout the afternoon was difficult. The long-term efficacy of fasted evening&#xD;
      exercise may, therefore, be limited by increased hunger and compensatory energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consuming a meal lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and/or fat can increase rates of&#xD;
      fat oxidation during exercise (Rowlands &amp; Hopkins, 2002; Oliviera et al., 2021). Protein is&#xD;
      also the most satiating macronutrient, and high-protein diets are associated with reductions&#xD;
      in energy intake. Consuming a high-protein pre-exercise meal compared to a typical&#xD;
      high-carbohydrate meal also led to greater exercise-induced elevations in hormones typically&#xD;
      associated with increased satiety and reduced hunger: peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (Oliviera et al., 2021). Therefore, consuming a meal with a&#xD;
      low carbohydrate content and higher protein content before exercise, rather than completely&#xD;
      fasting, could be utilised to enhance the metabolic responses to exercise, whilst&#xD;
      simultaneously managing appetite and subsequent energy intake. Further research is needed to&#xD;
      fully understand the metabolic and appetite-related effects of a low-carbohydrate,&#xD;
      higher-protein meal prior to exercise in the evening, compared to a typically consumed&#xD;
      higher-carbohydrate meal and complete fasting.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the obvious differences between fasting and consuming food, participants will be aware of when they have been assigned to the fasted condition. However, the low- and high-carbohydrate content lunch meals will be closely matched for taste, with carbohydrate content being manipulated within a drink. Participants will not be informed that the carbohydrate content of the lunch meals is being manipulated, and will therefore, be blinded to this element of the study.</masking_description>
