  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single-center clinical trial comparing normal saline and&#xD;
      bacteriostatic saline subcutaneous injection within a single subject. While both normal&#xD;
      saline and bacteriostatic saline can be administered intravenously, this study aims to&#xD;
      investigate their effects following subcutaneous injection. While benzyl alcohol (the&#xD;
      bacteriostatic component of bacteriostatic saline) is known to have local anesthetic&#xD;
      properties, it also is an irritant and can cause inflammation at the injection site. Based on&#xD;
      clinical experience investigators anticipate that a normal saline injection will cause a mild&#xD;
      stinging sensation and no subsequent inflammation. In contrast, subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      bacteriostatic saline will not cause stinging but will cause a mild degree of inflammation&#xD;
      which is manifested as mild tenderness and mild ecchymosis at the site of injection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both normal saline and bacteriostatic saline are often used as vehicles for the injection of&#xD;
      therapeutic drugs. However, their properties differ slightly as a result of the 0.9% benzyl&#xD;
      alcohol component of BS. While benzyl alcohol is known to have local anesthetic properties,&#xD;
      it also is an irritant and can cause inflammation at the injection site. In acidic&#xD;
      conditions, benzyl alcohol is converted to benzoic acid and benzaldehyde. Objective and&#xD;
      prospective data are needed to confirm these characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol calls for random allocation of subcutaneous injections of 10 mL of NS&#xD;
      into one anterior thigh and 10 mL of BS into the contralateral anterior thigh. Based on the&#xD;
      verified safety of up to 30 mL of 0.9% bacteriostatic saline, this volume of saline solution&#xD;
      poses little to no risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each thigh will receive one subcutaneous injection of either NS or BS, which will be&#xD;
      determined by random allocation. Clinical follow-up examination will be done at 24 hours, 48&#xD;
      hours, and 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that by day seven, all signs of inflammation or bruising will have resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both NS and BS are FDA-approved for subcutaneous injection and are commonly utilized daily by&#xD;
      many physicians. A study documenting the benefits and disadvantages of NS and BS has never&#xD;
      been done to the investigators' knowledge and will be helpful for medical professionals in&#xD;
      determining which type of solution to use in certain circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study is 32 subjects with a stopping point for analysis after 16&#xD;
      subjects. The sample size must be a multiple of four to satisfy the randomization in groups&#xD;
      of four criteria. Investigators are analyzing the t-statistics at a level of alpha = 0.01,&#xD;
      considering the Bonferroni correction. If after 16 subjects, statistical significance showing&#xD;
      a difference between NS and BS has not been reached, investigators will continue with 16 more&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenderness, soreness, and pruritis NPS will be evaluated by paired t-tests to determine if&#xD;
      the effects of injection by NS vs. BS differ at each of the four evaluation times.&#xD;
      Investigators will do the same for the quantitative data gathered for bruising and redness&#xD;
      surface area. This quantitative analysis will result in t-statistics and corresponding&#xD;
      P-values which will be evaluated with an alpha = 0.01, considering the Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
      For the categorical data for the intensity of bruising and redness/inflammation,&#xD;
      investigators will create the categories of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and intense (3)&#xD;
      and use this data to perform t-tests for significance.&#xD;
