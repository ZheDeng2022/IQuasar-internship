      To evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of &quot;BR1016C&quot; and &quot;BR1016D&quot; in healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,&#xD;
      maximum, etc.) will be presented for continuous data, and the number (N) and percentage (%)&#xD;
      of subjects for each category will be summarized and presented for categorical data. For&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data, the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (primary endpoint only), median, minimum, and maximum will be presented by&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Demographic information statistical analysis&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed on basic data including demographic&#xD;
           information (gender, age, height, weight, BMI, etc.) of all randomized subjects&#xD;
           (Intention-To-Treat).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous data will be compared and tested between sequence groups by summarizing&#xD;
           descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,&#xD;
           maximum, etc.), and by testing whether the data are normally distributed using the&#xD;
           independent t-test or Wilcoxon's rank sum test. For categorical data, the number (N) and&#xD;
           percentage (%) of subjects for each category will be summarized and compared between the&#xD;
           order groups using a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Pharmacokinetic statistical analysis&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetic assessment will be analyzed in subjects who can complete all&#xD;
           scheduled blood sampling for pharmacokinetic assessment after administration of the&#xD;
           investigational product according to the protocol and can be assessed for&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics, and there are no major protocol violations that may affect the&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetic assessment will be conducted in accordance with Article 17 of the&#xD;
           &quot;Drug Equivalence Test Criteria&quot; and the pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated&#xD;
           using a noncompartmental method using the software 'Phoenix® Winnonlin® Ver.8.3 (or&#xD;
           higher) (Certara L.P.)'. When calculating pharmacokinetic parameters, the actual&#xD;
           sampling time will be used for the sampling time for each subject, and the linear&#xD;
           trapezoidal method will be used for the calculation of AUCt. Pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
           will be summarized and presented descriptively by subject and treatment group. For&#xD;
           statistical analysis for equivalence assessment, analysis of variance will be performed&#xD;
           for log-transformed values of AUCt and Cmax at a significance level of 0.05. If the 90%&#xD;
           confidence interval of the difference between the control drug and the mean value of the&#xD;
           study drug is within log 0.8 to log 1.25, the control drug and the study drug will be&#xD;
           assessed as equivalent. Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group, and&#xD;
           they will be compared between treatment groups if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis of variance will test the administration period (period), sequence group&#xD;
           (sequence), and treatment group (treatment) as fixed effects, and the difference between&#xD;
           individuals as linear mixed effect model considering random effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Safety statistical analysis&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis set for safety assessment includes all subjects who received the&#xD;
           investigational product at least once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events will be assessed based on the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)&#xD;
           that occur after the administration of the investigational product in Period 1. For&#xD;
           TEAEs that occurred during the washout period, hospital admission date, and prior to&#xD;
           administration, it will be determined as a TEAE of the investigational product that was&#xD;
           administered previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event names will be standardized by SOC (System Organ Class) and PT (Preferred Term)&#xD;
      terms using the MedDRA (version 24.0 or higher) classification system, and the analysis of&#xD;
      adverse events will be presented as the number of subjects who experienced adverse events,&#xD;
      incidence (%), and number of occurrences based on TEAEs. The severity, seriousness, and&#xD;
      causal relationship to the investigational product of adverse events will be summarized by&#xD;
      treatment group. If necessary, the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or McNemar's test&#xD;
      will be conducted to test for inter-group differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of concomitant medications will be standardized using the WHO ATC (2021 or&#xD;
           later) classification system, and subjects who received concomitant medications during&#xD;
           the clinical study will be listed. In case of concomitant medications taken during the&#xD;
           washout period, hospital admission date, or before the administration, it shall be&#xD;
           determined as the concomitant medication of the investigational product that was&#xD;
           administered previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For other observation and test items of the subjects such as clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
           vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG), and physical examinations, descriptive&#xD;
           statistical analysis will be performed.&#xD;
