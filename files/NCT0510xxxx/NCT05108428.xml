             this study involves agents that have known or potential genotoxic or mutagenic and&#xD;
             teratogenic effects: Pregnant women, Nursing women who are unwilling to discontinue&#xD;
             nursing, Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate&#xD;
             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the&#xD;
             duration of study treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS-related illnesses) or known&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid illnesses or other concurrent disease that, in the judgement of the&#xD;
             clinician obtaining informed consent, would make the patient inappropriate for entry&#xD;
             into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and&#xD;
             toxicity of the prescribed regimens or prevent required follow-up.&#xD;
