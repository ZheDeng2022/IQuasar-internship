      Clinical Trial: Cause and Treatment of High Opioid Tone Autism Key Words: autism,&#xD;
      neurobiological systems engineering, opioid tone, cold pressor time, clinical trial Abstract&#xD;
      Introduction: Neurobiological systems engineering models are useful for treating patients. We&#xD;
      show a model of &quot;high opioid tone&quot; autism and present a hypothesis about how autism is caused&#xD;
      by administration of opioids during childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Symptoms: Clinical diagnosis of autism in a 25 year old man was confirmed by a Social&#xD;
      Responsiveness Scale (SRS) self - rating of 79, severe, and a Social Communications&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SCQ - 2) by the patient's father scoring 27. Cold pressor time is a measure of&#xD;
      pain tolerance obtained by having the subject submerge their normal forearm in a painful ice&#xD;
      water bath. Cold pressor time (CPT) was 190 seconds - unusually long, consonant with the high&#xD;
      pain tolerance of autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Intervention and Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure is the Cold Pressor Time (CPT). At naltrexone 50 mg/day CPT fell to&#xD;
      28, repeat 39 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Social Communications&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SCQ-2). SRS fell to 54 and SCQ - 2 to 9; both non - significant for autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in relatedness was experienced ambivalently, understood as feelings never before&#xD;
      experienced - causing pain. Non - compliance with naltrexone was followed by cutting open his&#xD;
      palm and drinking alcoholically. Transference focused psychotherapy has helped him remain&#xD;
      naltrexone - compliant while he works on issues of identity and relatedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The model suggests studies that could be conducted to both prevent and treat this&#xD;
      form of autism.&#xD;
