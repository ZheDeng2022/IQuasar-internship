      Purpose: In this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of motivational interview on daily&#xD;
      living activities on physical adaptation and quality of life in elderly people who underwent&#xD;
      total knee replacement.it was aimed to examine the effect of motivational interview on daily&#xD;
      living activities on physical adaptation and quality of life in elderly people who underwent&#xD;
      total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The research was planned as a pretest, posttest, randomized controlled study in order&#xD;
      to determine the effect of the motivational interviews on the life quality and physical&#xD;
      activity of old patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: After total knee replacement, the target for daily living activities is higher than the&#xD;
      patients who applied the hand and those who did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Patients with targeted daily living activities with total knee replacement begin to get&#xD;
      used to it and begin earlier than those who do not.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The SF-36 Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>For 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Quality of Life Scale consists of 8 subgroups and 36 questions. The fourth and fifth questions of the SF-36 scale are yes/no, the other questions are likert type (3, 5 and 6). Items 1, 6, 7, 8, 9a, 9d, 9e, 9h, 11b, 11d in the scale are calculated by reversing them. The physical and mental summary value of the scale is obtained by adding the weighted scores of the questions containing the sub-scales of the SF-36 quality of life scale. There is no total score. The scores obtained range from zero to one hundred. Zero indicates poor health and 100 indicates good health.</description>

    <description>The Functional Evaluation Form consists of 8 sections, including maximum walking distance, use of walking aids, getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, working status, daily tasks, transportation and lower extremity care, and each section is self-contained (first four sections are out of 15 points, the remaining four sections are out of 10 points). The highest total score is 100. An increase in the score indicates functional improvement.</description>
