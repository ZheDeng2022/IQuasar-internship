  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a test or control group and will receive an active or sham&#xD;
      VibratoSleeve respectively, with identical instructions for use provided to all clinicians&#xD;
      and subjects. All the initial 30 treatments will be scheduled within a 45-day window. At the&#xD;
      final part of the 30th treatment visit, each subject's randomization assignment will be&#xD;
      revealed, regardless of randomization group. Those who had received the activated (test)&#xD;
      device will merely await a 1-month follow up visit for assessments. Those originally treated&#xD;
      with the inactive (sham) device will have the option of crossing over to the test protocol to&#xD;
      receive 30 treatments with an activated device.&#xD;

      Screening procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will be recruited for participation and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained after all information is presented and all questions are answered to the patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction. Once informed consent is obtained, the study team will confirm that the patient&#xD;
      meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of all baseline assessments and tests that are required during the&#xD;
      screening visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics, vital signs and other clinical assessments, calf sizing, medical&#xD;
           and drug history, and Rutherford Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle Brachial Index and Toe Brachial Index (ABI/TBNI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography and Perfusion Imaging of Foot will be undertaken prior to, during, and&#xD;
           after application (treatment) of the VibratoSleeve TUS device. All patients will undergo&#xD;
           arterial duplex ultrasound at the level of the calf, ankle and/or foot to document&#xD;
           baseline vessel diameter, vessel velocity and volume flow. In addition, perfusion&#xD;
           imaging of the foot will be performed, using non-invasive methods like Flowmet by&#xD;
           Medtronic, Inc. or Clarifi system by Modulim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial treatment sessions will be undertaken in a clinical research center.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by a computer-based program and treatment assignments for&#xD;
      each subject will be known to the device operator and unknown to the subject, investigator,&#xD;
      and research staff. Sham and test devices will appear identical and appear to be operated in&#xD;
      the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to active or sham treatments. The device will be fitted and operated by Vibrato&#xD;
      team members while accompanied by site study staff. Study related imaging will be performed&#xD;
      by licensed vascular ultrasound technicians employed by the investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-treatment imaging, Vibrato staff will fit the device to the posterior calf and&#xD;
      couple it to skin with ultrasound gel. For subjects assigned to treatment with an active&#xD;
      device, therapy will be initiated using a Vibrato generator, gradually increasing acoustic&#xD;
      output over the first 5 minutes of therapy to a nominal goal peak negative pressure of up to&#xD;
      -3.6 MPa, while assessing subject comfort. For subjects assigned to a sham device, control&#xD;
      treatment will be initiated in the same manner except that no acoustic output will be&#xD;
      initiated by the generator. During the first 90-minute active or sham session, ABI, TBI,&#xD;
      ultrasonography and perfusion imaging of foot will be performed pre-treatment, during the 90&#xD;
      minutes of treatment, and immediately after the end of treatment. Adverse events (if any)&#xD;
      will be recorded and assessed. After each test/control treatment and measurements are&#xD;
      completed, subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their experience&#xD;
      during and after each therapeutic session. The feedback obtained may be used in developing&#xD;
      future design enhancements of the VibratoSleeve device and/or a future pivotal trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first of the 30 planned active/sham treatment sessions is completed, the subsequent&#xD;
      28 sessions will be done at either the clinic or a subject's home, based upon a subject's&#xD;
      convenience and preference. A Vibrato's representative will be present for all treatments to&#xD;
      ensure proper operation and protocol compliance. No diagnostic/perfusion measurements will be&#xD;
      taken during these treatments. The last session (number 30) will be carried out in the exact&#xD;
      manner of the Day 1 procedures in the clinic, including all perfusion measurements. At the&#xD;
      end of this last session, each subject's randomization assignment will be revealed. Test&#xD;
      subjects will surrender their active VibratoSleeve device to the Sponsor's representative and&#xD;
      await their 1-month follow-up visit; whereas control subjects will crossover (described&#xD;
      below) to the test arm for an additional 30-session regimen with an activated VibratoSleeve&#xD;
      TUS device. Upon completion of the 30-day treatment regimen with an activated device,&#xD;
      crossover subjects will have a one-month follow up visit to assess the durability of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-month follow up visit for each subject will include the same diagnostic and perfusion&#xD;
      measurements as during the treatment/sham sessions: ABI &amp; TBI; Ultrasonography at calf level;&#xD;
      and perfusion Imaging of foot. Adverse events (if any) will also be identified, recorded and&#xD;
      assessed at every clinic or home visit.&#xD;
