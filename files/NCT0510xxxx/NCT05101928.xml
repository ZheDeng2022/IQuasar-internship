  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of OZURDEX® (dexamethasone intravitreal&#xD;
      implants; DEX, Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA) as monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious&#xD;
      intermediate-, posterior- or panuveitis. This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial taking place at the University of Ottawa Eye Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and&#xD;
      other possible centers in Canada. Consecutive consenting subjects who meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be selected to participate in this study. The subjects must&#xD;
      have either non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis. The subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly chosen to be part of one of two groups; one group will receive DEX as monotherapy&#xD;
      and the other group will receive oral prednisone. Approximately 84 eyes (42 per arm) will&#xD;
      take part in study. The primary outcome will measure the proportion of eyes with a vitreous&#xD;
      haze score of 0 six months post initial treatment. Secondary measures will include best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT) measured by spectral-domain&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), time to vitreous haze resolution and time to failure&#xD;
      defined at number of months with DEX implant until an adjunct therapy is indicated. Baseline&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded within 1 month prior to treatment in both groups, with follow&#xD;
      up measurements collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months post-operatively.&#xD;

    <description>This score (using NEI/SUN criteria) is used to grade intraocular inflammation based on vitreous cells and protein exudation. A lower score is indicative of less inflammation which is the goal when using either Ozurdex implant or a oral prednisone.</description>

    <measure>Anterior chamber cells/flare from baseline to various time points</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements obtained at: 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using SUN grading criteria, the proportion of patients with cells grade 0, 0.5+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ and flare grade of 0, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+ will be determined at Month 6.</description>

    <time_frame>Measurements obtained at: 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This score will be used to assess anatomical changes (e.g. cystoid macular edema) with treatment</description>

    <measure>Change in central average volume (in mm3) from baseline to various time points</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements obtained at: 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>

The initial dose is expected to range between 40 to 60mg of oral prednisone per day, with gradual tapering to the lowest dose that controls inflammation and eventually transitioning to a maintenance dose. Maintenance dose will be gradually lowered as per standard of care if remission is achieved for 6 to 12 months.</description>
