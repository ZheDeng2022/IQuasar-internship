  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to provide preliminary data that will enable the conduct of a larger&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) on the impact of bilingual Prescription Medication Labels&#xD;
      (PMLs) on 3 medication-related outcomes - medication adherence, medication management&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and PML understanding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 40 patients to Pilot Trial A or Pilot Trial B. Those in&#xD;
      Pilot Trial A will be further randomized to Bilingual PMLs (intervention arm) or English PMLs&#xD;
      (usual care arm) at 2 weeks post-recruitment, after assessing baseline level of the 3&#xD;
      medication-related outcomes; trial outcomes: difference in change, from baseline to 2 weeks&#xD;
      post-randomization, in the 3 medication-related outcomes between the 2 arms. Those in Pilot&#xD;
      Trial B will be further randomized to Bilingual PMLs or English PMLs immediately&#xD;
      post-recruitment; trial outcomes: difference, at 2 weeks post-randomization, in the 3&#xD;
      medication-related outcomes between the 2 arms. This formative study will (1) assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of administering the intervention, (2) refine protocols for study participant&#xD;
      recruitment, engagement and retention, and (3) gain experience with and refine measurement of&#xD;
      the outcomes for evaluating the intervention. The conduct of 2 pilot trials will allow us to&#xD;
      choose the optimal trial design and determine variability.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 2 and Week 4 of Pilot Trial A</time_frame>
    <description>ARMS is a validated self-reported medication-adherence scale intended for patients with chronic diseases.&#xD;
Its 12 questions consist of 2 subscales - adherence to refilling prescriptions and adherence with taking medications. Each item is structured using the Likert scale, with the following response options and corresponding scores: &quot;none&quot; (score of 1), &quot;some&quot; (score of 2), &quot;most&quot; (score of 3 ), or &quot;all of the time&quot; (score of 4). The range of possible total scores is 12 to 48. Lower scores indicate better adherence.</description>

    <description>MedTake Assessment is a self-reported measure for pharmacy staff when providing pharmaceutical care services, assessing patient adherence and knowledge to dose, dosage, indication, food or water co-ingestion, and regimen. A composite score (0-100%); higher ~ better) summarizes patient's ability to take medicine safely.</description>
