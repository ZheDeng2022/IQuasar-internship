  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, millions of children in preschools, schools, and in afterschool continue to&#xD;
      receive breakfast, lunch, snacks and supper through these programs. Thanks to federal&#xD;
      nutrition standards and reimbursements, school meals are generally healthier than meals from&#xD;
      home, particularly for students from low-income households. Participation in these programs,&#xD;
      beginning in the earliest years, reduces food insecurity and improves child health and&#xD;
      academic performance. Despite USDA administrative flexibilities issued during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, participation in school nutrition programs has decreased. This trial will examine&#xD;
      whether an intervention that focuses on communicating the benefits of child nutrition&#xD;
      programs and establishes a feasible and sustainable strategy for parents to provide ongoing&#xD;
      feedback to improve the appeal, cultural relevance, and quality of school meals will increase&#xD;
      school meal participation to reduce food insecurity and promote child health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood food insecurity, is associated with anemia, obesity, and diabetes, as well as poor&#xD;
      academic performance. In the U.S., food insecurity rates are higher among low-income&#xD;
      households of color. During COVID-19, food insecurity has rapidly increased due to&#xD;
      unprecedented rates of unemployment. While 15% of U.S. households with children reported food&#xD;
      insecurity before the pandemic, this rose to 35% in April 2020. Even as early as 1946, when&#xD;
      the National School Lunch Program was developed, high-quality nutrition was recognized as&#xD;
      essential for children to be healthy, to perform well in school, and to go on to lead&#xD;
      productive lives. Moreover, free and reduced-price meals provide vital income support for&#xD;
      low-income households. Thanks to USDA administrative flexibilities issued during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, most U.S. children are eligible to pick up free meals at local schools. Despite&#xD;
      this, participation in school nutrition programs is less than one third of that prior to the&#xD;
      pandemic, resulting in a 2.1 billion dollar loss in revenue for school meal programs.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even prior to the pandemic, participation in school nutrition programs by&#xD;
      eligible children is much lower than it should be, particularly for school breakfast programs&#xD;
      and during the summer. Parents are critical to facilitating and encouraging their children's&#xD;
      participation in school meals. Despite this, few U.S. studies examine parents' perceptions of&#xD;
      school meals. Studies that do exist suggest that when parents perceive school meals&#xD;
      negatively, it deters participation in the programs. Previous research indicates that parents&#xD;
      may not know that school meals must meet strict nutrition standards. Moreover, parents also&#xD;
      lack a vehicle for sharing ideas for improving meals with districts, further hindering&#xD;
      participation in nutrition programs. Therefore, in order to increase participation in these&#xD;
      programs, it is important to develop strategies for communicating with parents about the&#xD;
      health, economic, and academic benefits of school meals and to provide a mechanism for&#xD;
      parents to provide input and implement changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's central hypothesis is that an intervention that focuses on communicating the&#xD;
      benefits of child nutrition programs and establishes a feasible and sustainable strategy for&#xD;
      parents to provide ongoing feedback to improve the appeal, cultural relevance, and quality of&#xD;
      school meals will increase school meal participation to reduce food insecurity and promote&#xD;
      child health, well-being, and educational outcomes. This will be tested through a cluster&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in 6 schools in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV), which is&#xD;
      largely rural, and home to many low-income, Latino, agricultural-worker families. SJV's rates&#xD;
      of poverty, food insecurity, and diet-related diseases are some of the highest in the state.&#xD;
      Given the immense need, it is particularly unfortunate that the school nutrition programs are&#xD;
      not more fully utilized, particularly during the pandemic. Marketing and communication&#xD;
      options developed by a group of research and marketing experts, parents, school nutrition&#xD;
      staff, and other school stakeholders will include Promotion strategies for communicating with&#xD;
      parents about the benefits of school meals and Product strategies for improving the branding,&#xD;
      design, packaging, quality, cultural appeal, and variety of school meals. Specific&#xD;
      intervention examples could include (1) communicating information about school nutrition&#xD;
      standards and the importance of meals for health and learning, (2) designing more&#xD;
      environmentally friendly packaging, perhaps including positive messaging, to replace&#xD;
      distribution in plastic wrappings, or (3) emphasizing meals' local, sustainable and cultural&#xD;
      appropriateness. Researchers will conduct surveys at baseline and 9 months to assess 1)&#xD;
      parents' satisfaction of meals, 2) household food insecurity using the 18-item US Household&#xD;
      Food Security Survey Module, and 3) school food nutrition staff's practices surrounding&#xD;
      school meal participation. Data on school-meal participation throughout the study period will&#xD;
      be obtained from school food service directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, the model can support policy advocacy nationally and also be promoted to and&#xD;
      adapted by other schools, as this is a ubiquitous problem. To date, there is little work on&#xD;
      this topic.&#xD;
