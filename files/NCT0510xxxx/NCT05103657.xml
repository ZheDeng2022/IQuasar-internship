  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to people aged 18 to 65 who have post-traumatic stress disorder. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called BI 1358894 improves symptoms&#xD;
      in people with post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. Participants take BI&#xD;
      1358894 or placebo as tablets every day for 2 months. Placebo tablets look like BI 1358894&#xD;
      tablets but do not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 3 months. During this time, they visit the study site&#xD;
      about 8 times and get about 4 phone calls from the trial staff. During the study,&#xD;
      participants answer questions in interviews and complete questionnaires so the doctors can&#xD;
      check whether their symptoms change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.&#xD;

    <description>CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview. In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization). Each of the 20 symptom items is rated on a 5-point severity rating scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating) CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is yield by summing individual item scores. The total severity score ranges from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating higher symptom severity.</description>

    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item patient-reported assessment designed to measure the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. The PCL-5 is intended to assess patient symptoms in the past month. Each item is rated on a fivepoint Likert scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A total severity score can be yield by summing up individual item scores, and ranges from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating higher severity.</description>
