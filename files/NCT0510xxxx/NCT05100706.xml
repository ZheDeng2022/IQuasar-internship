  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a frequent performed surgery. Many institutions are&#xD;
      implementing outpatient programs for this surgery and adequate pain management is an&#xD;
      important feature. Analgesic duration of single shot nerve blocks is limited to no more than&#xD;
      24h. Conversely, the use of continuous nerve block (CNB) through a perineural catheter and&#xD;
      infusion of local anesthetic may increase duration of analgesia and provide better outcomes.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of using CNB in patients&#xD;
      undergoing ambulatory TKA, and its effects on patients' quality of recovery. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that continuous adductor canal block would lead to a better quality of recovery in patients&#xD;
      undergoing outpatient TKA.&#xD;

      Objectives: Evaluate effectiveness and safety of using continuous adductor canal block (CACB)&#xD;
      in patients undergoing ambulatory total knee arthroplasty (TKA), in comparison to single shot&#xD;
      adductor canal block (SACB). Primary objective is assess the quality of recovery of those&#xD;
      patients (using the 15-item quality of recovery scale - QoR-15) at predetermined time points&#xD;
      postoperatively. Secondary objectives are to evaluate postoperative pain scores,&#xD;
      postoperative use of opioid, opioid-induced adverse effects (measured via validated opioid&#xD;
      symptom distress scale), postoperative functional status, complications relating to the&#xD;
      perineural catheter and readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Continuous adductor canal block would lead to a better quality of recovery in&#xD;
      patients undergoing outpatient TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized controlled prospective trial, blinded for patient and evaluator, in&#xD;
      patients undergoing outpatient primary TKA at Sinai Health. After Hospital's Ethics in&#xD;
      Research Board approval, the recruitment will begin. Patients will be assessed about their&#xD;
      eligibility for participating and after plain clear information about the study interventions&#xD;
      they will or will not authorize their inclusion and data collection, through the signature of&#xD;
      a written consent. The subjects will have their surgeries booked in advance and they will be&#xD;
      submitted to the pre anesthesia consult at the Pre Admission Unit a few days before the&#xD;
      surgery. The study proposal will be explained to the patients in that occasion. They will&#xD;
      receive a booklet with information about the study and the Consent Form that they will bring&#xD;
      home with them. They will have the time between the pre anesthesia assessment and the surgery&#xD;
      (at least two days) to review and consent to the study. Patients will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      the two groups using a computer-generated random numbers table. The randomization will be&#xD;
      done before the beginning of the study and will define which study number is going to be&#xD;
      managed as interventional group (continuous adductor canal block - CACB) or control group&#xD;
      (sham continuous adductor canal block - ShACB). Each patient will receive a study number&#xD;
      following the order of their entrance on the study. The elastomeric pumps to be used&#xD;
      connected to the catheter will be previously prepared by hospital pharmacy, accordingly to&#xD;
      the randomization made and the subject study number, with no identification of the content&#xD;
      (NaCl 0.9% or Ropivacaine 0.2%). Hospital pharmacy will not be blinded for which study number&#xD;
      and elastomeric pump will be linked to the study group. Research coordinator, professional&#xD;
      who performs the adductor canal catheter insertion and researcher who collects the data will&#xD;
      be blinded to which group each patient was randomized. After accordance to participate on the&#xD;
      study, the patient will be randomized to one of the two studies groups: continuous adductor&#xD;
      canal block (CACB) or sham continuous adductor canal block (ShACB). All patients will receive&#xD;
      the same perioperative management. The only difference will be the postoperative continuous&#xD;
      perineural infusion: the CACB group will receive an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine 5mL/h and&#xD;
      ShACB group will receive an infusion of NaCl 0.9% 5mL/h. Patients will initially be brought&#xD;
      to a dedicated block room where a safety checklist will be performed by the block room team.&#xD;
      Standard Canadian Anesthesia Society monitoring will be provided. Mild sedation with&#xD;
      Midazolam 0.5-2mg and Fentanyl 25-100mcg might be administered for anxiolysis and analgesia.&#xD;
      After proper cleaning of the ipsilateral thigh, under sterile technique and ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance (Sonosite Edge II ultrasound machine), an adductor canal block (injection of 15 mL&#xD;
      of Ropivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000) and an IPACK block (injection of 15 mL of&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200,000) will be performed. Cumulative local anesthetic&#xD;
      doses will be preemptively calculated to avoid a total Ropivacaine dose of &gt; 3mg/kg. After&#xD;
      the peripheral nerve blocks, all patients will receive standard spinal or general anesthesia.&#xD;
      All intraoperative opioids administered will be recorded. In the intra-operative period, each&#xD;
      patient will receive IV Cefazolin 2g, Tranexamic acid 20mg/kg, Dexamethasone 0.1mg/kg, and&#xD;
      Ondansetron 4mg. At the end of the procedure the surgeons will infiltrate the surgical site&#xD;
      with 200 mg of Ropivacaine 0.2%. After surgery, the patient will be taken to the Post&#xD;
      Anesthesia Care Unit. At this moment, an Arrow® (StimuCath® Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block&#xD;
      Catheter) continuous adductor canal block catheter will be inserted using a Sonosite Edge II&#xD;
      ultrasound machine. A bolus of 5-10mL of saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) with epinephrine&#xD;
      1:200,000 will be given, after negative aspiration, following adductor canal catheter&#xD;
      insertion and the patient will be monitored for any heart rate change in order to rule out&#xD;
      intravascular catheter placement. The catheter will be well secured with an adhesive fixation&#xD;
      device to avoid displacement. Following catheter placement, the catheter will be aspirated to&#xD;
      check for blood to ensure there is no intravascular placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter will be aspirated prior to any injection including at the time of saline&#xD;
      injection during catheter placement. The peripheral nerve catheter will be connected to a&#xD;
      Baxter elastomeric pump. Depending on which group the patient is randomized to, the solution&#xD;
      will be Ropivacaine 0.2% or Saline 0.9%. Infusion rate will be of 5mL/h. The patient will be&#xD;
      discharged to home after achieving the discharge criteria, keeping the peripheral nerve&#xD;
      catheter with the same infusion rate for the planed time. The adductor canal catheter will&#xD;
      infuse for 48 hours. Prior to going home, patients will receive education and written&#xD;
      information (educational pamphlet) regarding monitoring for local anesthetic systemic&#xD;
      toxicity symptoms, possible CABC associated complications including potential transient&#xD;
      muscle weakness, and instructions on patient removal of the catheter after 48 hours. This&#xD;
      pamphlet will contain contact information for research team or Acute Pain Service, in case of&#xD;
      any events, adverse effects or questions the patients may have about the peripheral nerve&#xD;
      catheter. A phone number to contact each patient at home will collected before. Standard oral&#xD;
      analgesic scheme will be prescribed to every patient (Acetaminophen 650mg QID, Celecoxib&#xD;
      200mg BID, Hydromorphone 1-2mg PRN Q4Hs).&#xD;
