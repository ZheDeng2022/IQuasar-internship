  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standardized behavioural approach based on mindfulness delivered mainly by a specific APP&#xD;
      on android will be developed and applied for patients with chronic pain conditions, as&#xD;
      migraine and neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pilot study to enforce the application of a Home-program for&#xD;
      patients with different pain conditions, to learn mindfulness practice, added to a regular&#xD;
      mindfulness guided face-to-face program, by using the technology with android to receive&#xD;
      mindfulness sessions for daily practice and to assess the feasibility and the effectiveness&#xD;
      of behavioural approach base on mindfulness delivered with this modality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and significance Different clinical experiences confirmed the effectiveness of&#xD;
      interventions based on the application of standardized behavioural approaches to support&#xD;
      pharmacological traditional treatments for pain conditions in the last decades. Also,&#xD;
      different clinical experiences were performed by using electronic devices to deliver&#xD;
      home-sessions of behavioral approach (mindfulness) to patients that can practice regularly&#xD;
      and supported by mindfulness recorded sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aspect of feasibility of these treatments is not reported in published studies, but it&#xD;
      can be estimated that standardized behavioural therapies are used in helping patients to&#xD;
      obtain a better outcome for pain management&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the use of technology to deliver behavioral exercises to patients suffering&#xD;
      from different pain conditions, as neuropathic pain and migraine, have been reported in the&#xD;
      literature of the last decades. Exercise-based on telemedicine and smartphone applications&#xD;
      seem appropriate, as they have been recently tested in the management of chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions to reinforce the efficacy of pharmacological therapies and to teach patients to&#xD;
      manage their pain and to be more conscious about their clinical condition and about the use&#xD;
      of drugs.&#xD;
