    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, Vildagliptin and&#xD;
      Placebo-Controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of 100 mg&#xD;
      of PB-201 in the morning and evening in treatmentnaive patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening period of up to 2 weeks, a 4-week single-blind run-in&#xD;
      period, a 24-week double-blinded treatment period, a 28-week extended treatment period, and a&#xD;
      2-week safety follow-up period.Eligible subjects will be enrolled in a 4-week single-blind&#xD;
      run-in period with daily oral administration of 1 tablet of PB-201 matched placebo and 1&#xD;
      Vildagliptin matched placebo in the morning and evening respectively.After the end of the&#xD;
      single-blind run-in period, subjects who meet the protocol enrollment requirements will be&#xD;
      randomized in the proportion of 2:1:1 to receive double-blinded treatment for 24 weeks in&#xD;
      three different treatment groups (test arm, Vildagliptin arm, or placebo arm).&#xD;
