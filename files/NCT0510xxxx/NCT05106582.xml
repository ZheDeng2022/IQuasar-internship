  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total thoracoscopic mitral valve plasty (MVP) is characterized by minimal trauma, minimal&#xD;
      bleeding, and short postoperative recovery time. The learning curve of any new procedure&#xD;
      needs to be evaluated for learning and replication.Using Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time&#xD;
      and Aortic clamping (AC) time as evaluation variables, we visualized the learning curve for&#xD;
      total thoracoscopic MVP using Cumulative sum analysis. We also analyzed important&#xD;
      postoperative variables such as postoperative drainage, duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      ICU stay and postoperative hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective study comprised 150 consecutive patients who underwent total thoracoscopic&#xD;
      MVP from October 2017 to July 2021.&#xD;

    <description>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was used as the main variables for evaluation and visualization of the total thoracoscopic mitral valve plasty (MVP) learning curve using Cumulative sum.Cumulative sum (CUSUM) is a statistical method that focuses on results rather than on the process of performing a program skills, it generates graphs that allow for quick detection of deviations from pre-established standards and is an alternative tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of individual program. CUSUM can be generated based on set acceptable and unacceptable failure rates and the degree to which type 1(α) and type 2(β) errors (false positive and false negative errors) will be tolerated. CUSUM was defined as Sn = ∑(Xi -p0), where Xi = 0 for success and Xi = 1 for failure, p0 is the target reference.</description>
