  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Higher-weight individuals face pervasive weight-related stigma and discrimination in their&#xD;
      daily lives. There is conceptual and empirical evidence to suggest that weight stigma&#xD;
      contributes to worse physical and psychological health outcomes, mediated by the deleterious&#xD;
      psychobiological responses to psychosocial stress. Activating self-soothing emotional states&#xD;
      (such as self-compassion) may protect against this psychobiological cascade, conferring&#xD;
      resilience to negative social evaluation (such as weight stigma). This proof-of-concept study&#xD;
      aims to establish the feasibility of an experimental protocol testing whether an acute&#xD;
      self-compassion intervention can attenuate the psychobiological stress response to induced&#xD;
      weight-based social-evaluative threat. Participants will be randomized into either&#xD;
      self-compassion intervention or rest control groups. A standard body composition assessment&#xD;
      will be used to induce weight stigma among young women who self-identify as &quot;higher-weight.&quot;&#xD;
      Stress-sensitive biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortisol and heart-rate variability) along with&#xD;
      psychological indices of self-conscious emotions will be used to quantify the&#xD;
      psychobiological stress response. This novel pilot study will contribute to efforts to&#xD;
      understand the psychobiological processes by which self-compassion facilitates adaptive&#xD;
      responding to acute stress, and will help inform future tests of interventions focused on&#xD;
      mitigating the harmful health effects of social stigma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized proof-of-concept experiment with two conditions: self-compassion&#xD;
      intervention and no-intervention (i.e., quiet rest) control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and establish&#xD;
      parameter estimates for a laboratory protocol to quantify the psychobiological responses to a&#xD;
      lab-based weight stigma induction. Feasibility will include process assessments (i.e.,&#xD;
      examine acceptability of both the self-compassion intervention and weight stigma induction to&#xD;
      participants, establish feasibility of recruitment goals and examine participant demand),&#xD;
      resource assessment (i.e., test the practicality of the proposed experimental protocol),&#xD;
      management assessment (i.e., test research group's ability to implement experimental protocol&#xD;
      including self-compassion intervention, weight-based social-evaluative induction and&#xD;
      biological biomarker collection), and scientific assessment (i.e., establish parameter&#xD;
      estimates for psychological and biological responses to self-compassion intervention and&#xD;
      social-evaluative threat induction). Due to the unpredictable nature of the COVID context for&#xD;
      biological sample collection, no a prior criteria for feasibility are established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to perform limited-efficacy testing of the self-compassion&#xD;
      intervention in reducing the psychobiological stress response relative to control condition.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by comparing pre/post manipulation biological (i.e., cortisol,&#xD;
      heart rate variability) and psychological (i.e., state shame, guilt, distress, internalized&#xD;
      weight bias) indices between conditions (i.e., self-compassion intervention, rest control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      N=60 young adult cis-gender women who perceive themselves to be &quot;heavier-weight&quot; will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate. After a brief telephone pre-screening interview to determine&#xD;
      eligibility, participants will book two lab visits to complete a baseline assessment and&#xD;
      experimental manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first in-lab session will comprise of the informed consent process and computerized&#xD;
      surveys to collect demographic and psychological baseline measures. This session will also&#xD;
      serve as acclimatization to the lab environment, to minimize anticipatory anxiety and/or&#xD;
      novel environment effects that may confound psychobiological stress measures during the&#xD;
      experimental manipulation. After providing written informed consent, participants will&#xD;
      complete a computerized survey consisting of demographic and baseline psychological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experimental sessions will take place between 1 pm and 5 pm to control for diurnal&#xD;
      variation in cortisol and will be conducted in a light- and temperature-controlled&#xD;
      laboratory. Participants will fill out a computerized survey to assess baseline psychological&#xD;
      indices, and will provide a 5-minute baseline heart-rate variability measurement and saliva&#xD;
      sample (#1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of two experimental conditions: acute&#xD;
      self-compassion intervention or rest control. Over the next 30 minutes, participants who were&#xD;
      randomized into the self-compassion condition will be guided through a multi-modal&#xD;
      behavioural self-compassion intervention. Participants in the no-intervention (resting)&#xD;
      control group will be asked to sit quietly for 30 minutes. Immediately after the&#xD;
      self-compassion induction (or control), participants will complete a measure of state&#xD;
      self-compassion as a manipulation check and will repeat state psychological measures taken at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anthropometric assessment including a standard three-site (triceps, iliac crest, thigh)&#xD;
      skinfold body composition assessment, height and weight measurements will be performed by two&#xD;
      thin researchers to induce weight stigma. Participants will undergo the assessment while&#xD;
      wearing a physically revealing outfit (i.e., sports bra and spandex shorts) which they will&#xD;
      be asked to change into at the beginning of the weight-stigma induction. This paradigm has&#xD;
      been shown to successfully induce social evaluative threat in young women, eliciting cortisol&#xD;
      and body shame responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the weight stigma induction, participants will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      survey assessing psychological outcome measures and to provide a saliva sample (#2). Then,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to wait quietly for a 35-minute minute recovery phase, during&#xD;
      which saliva samples will again be collected at 10 (#3), 20 (#4) and 35-minutes (#5)&#xD;
      post-stressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the recovery session is over, participants will be asked to respond to open-ended&#xD;
      funnel debriefing questions to assess the believability of the cover story and the success of&#xD;
      deception. Participants will also be asked questions related to the acceptability of the&#xD;
      experimental protocol and social-evaluative induction. Finally, participants will be fully&#xD;
      debriefed.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Acute Self-Compassion Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will be guided through a 30-minute behavioural self-compassion intervention that seeks to mitigate their psychobiological responses to the subsequent weight stigma induction. The intervention is intended to induce a flexible self-compassionate mindset that will facilitate more adaptive psychological responding to stress and activate affiliative/self-soothing physiological systems that can dampen psychobiological stress reactivity. This acute self-compassion intervention will employ a multimodal, experiential approach that is regularly utilized in self-compassion training, drawing from approaches developed in Compassion-Focused Therapy and Mindful Self-Compassion.</description>
