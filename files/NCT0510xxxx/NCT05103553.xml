  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex multisystem rheumatic autoimmune disease. Currently,&#xD;
      evidence based guidelines for frequency and intensity of follow-up of SSc patients are not&#xD;
      available. Based on expert consensus annual extensive evaluation is recommended. To provide&#xD;
      comprehensive multidisciplinary care integrated with evaluation of organ involvement and as&#xD;
      such, reducing health care utilization while improving the quality of care for the patient,&#xD;
      the &quot;Leiden Combined Care in SSc (CCISS) pathway&quot; was started in 2009. Data collected on&#xD;
      disease progression in the patients that participate in this care pathway show that 50% of&#xD;
      the patients have relatively mild disease, without any disease progression over time.&#xD;
      Therefore there is a need for tailor made care in SSc patients in accordance to disease&#xD;
      activity. To enable this, a prediction model was developed that can identify patients with&#xD;
      low risk for disease progression.&#xD;

      Objectives: To evaluate in SSc patients with low risk for disease progression 1) whether&#xD;
      assessment in an outpatient clinic setting is an acceptable alternative for evaluation in the&#xD;
      Care Pathway. Outcome parameters we will evaluate include 1) health care utilization, 2)&#xD;
      patients' perception of the disease and delivery of care, 3) health-related quality of life&#xD;
      and 4) disease progression. Health care utilization as primary outcome is defined as number&#xD;
      of contacts with heath care providers during 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of SSc that participated in the Combined&#xD;
      Care in Systemic Sclerosis cohort from Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), or in the&#xD;
      comparable care pathway of the Haga hospital and Haaglanden Medical Center (HMC), and that&#xD;
      have had at least two care pathway evaluations are eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;

    <description>comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. each dimension has 5 levels varying from no problems until extreme problems. Each answer results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.The EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's judgement.</description>
