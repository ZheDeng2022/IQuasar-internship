  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study tests the hypothesis that Stulln eyedrops improve accommodative functions&#xD;
      by improving the short term facility of ciliary muscles that can be transferred into&#xD;
      long-term adaptation. To test this, the investigators propose to conduct a prospective&#xD;
      randomized control trials where participants with accommodative dysfunctions are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to four groups: control, Stulln only and Stulln plus vision training. The&#xD;
      investigators' theory predicts that the efficacy of Stulln will be augmented by vision&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accommodation is the process of adjusting focal distance to achieve a clear retinal vision by&#xD;
      altering the shape of human crystalline lens in the eye. Accommodative responses are composed&#xD;
      of two parts, phasic and tonic. The adequate phasic accommodation is needed to form a clear&#xD;
      retinal image of near stimuli. The proper tonic accommodation is needed to maintain clear&#xD;
      retinal vision after the initial phasic response. The phasic and tonic accommodative&#xD;
      responses are mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Accommodative accuracy&#xD;
      and endurance is achieved by modifying the neuromuscular connection through repetitive&#xD;
      learning and adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision training has been shown effective to increase accommodative amplitude and endurance.&#xD;
      Its efficacy is achieved by gradually increasing the difficulty of tasks that require&#xD;
      patients to attentively process visual cues to adapt their accommodative responses. Its end&#xD;
      goal is to induce effective and permanent adaptations to the visual environment. The process&#xD;
      of vision training has been theorized as a bioengineering model in which the neuromuscular&#xD;
      signal is altered through visuomotor feedback. The increase in accommodative accuracy is&#xD;
      thought to reflect the gain of accommodative responses and the increase of accommodative&#xD;
      endurance is the result of maintained tonic neural output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empirical studies have shown the Digitalisglycosides (DGS) can enhance muscular contraction&#xD;
      and Esculin improves micro vascular circulation. Stulln eyedrops include these active&#xD;
      ingredients and have been approved to treat visual discomfort and retinal macular diseases in&#xD;
      Europe and China. It also has a very good safety record, without any report of adverse&#xD;
      effects to human body for the millions of users each year. The efficacy of Stulln in treating&#xD;
      visual discomfort might have resulted from the improved microcirculation of blood and wastes,&#xD;
      leading to better ciliary functions. Indeed, empirical studies have shown Stulln application&#xD;
      can improve accommodative amplitude, facility and endurance. However, Stullen itself might&#xD;
      not produce long-term changes in neuromuscular innervation, as its ingredients can be removed&#xD;
      from the human body within an day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study tests the hypothesis that Stulln eyedrops improve accommodative functions&#xD;
      by improving the short term accommodative facility and endurance. To test this, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized control trials where participants&#xD;
      with accommodative dysfunctions are randomly assigned to three groups: control, Stulln only&#xD;
      and Stulln plus vision training. The investigators' theory predicts that the efficacy of&#xD;
      Stulln will be augmented by vision training.&#xD;
