  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder,&#xD;
      usually leading to death from respiratory failure in 3-5 years. Riluzole, the only drug&#xD;
      currently available, only modestly prolongs survival and does not improve muscle strength or&#xD;
      function. In ALS, loss of functional motor neurons is initially compensated for by collateral&#xD;
      reinnervation and strength is preserved. In the majority of ALS patients, as the disease&#xD;
      progresses, compensation fails leading to progressive muscle weakness. Conversely, in&#xD;
      long-term ALS survivors, slow functional decline is correlated with their ability to maintain&#xD;
      a successful compensatory response to denervation over time. Compensatory collateral&#xD;
      reinnervation is thus essential for functional motor preservation and survival, and&#xD;
      elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved is crucial to help identify new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets. Energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis modifications also influence disease&#xD;
      clinical course but the mechanisms by which they contribute to the progression of ALS are&#xD;
      unknown. Weight loss is an independent negative prognostic factor for survival and, by&#xD;
      contrast, ALS risk and progression are decreased in individuals with high body mass index and&#xD;
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin shares many common steps in its signaling&#xD;
      pathways with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and is thus at the interface between&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis regulation and maintenance of muscle mass. However, the contribution of&#xD;
      insulin signaling to preservation of muscle innervation and function in ALS has never been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we aim to determine the role of insulin signaling pathways in maintenance of&#xD;
      collateral reinnervation and muscle function in ALS. We will also investigate the link with&#xD;
      the disease-modifying effect of metabolic and glucose homeostasis perturbations, by&#xD;
      identifying the contribution of metabolic profiles to preservation of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      innervation and motor function in patients with ALS. For this purpose, we will determine the&#xD;
      whole-body and skeletal muscle metabolic profiles of 20 patients with ALS and correlate these&#xD;
      results to collateral reinnervation ability quantified on muscle biopsy specimens. For each&#xD;
      patient, we will use both clinical and electrophysiological methods to evaluate motor&#xD;
      function and motor neuron loss over time. Body composition, insulin secretion, insulin&#xD;
      resistance level and serum concentrations of IGF-1 axis components will be determined. A&#xD;
      motor point muscle biopsy will be performed for morphological analysis of neuromuscular&#xD;
      junctions and quantification of innervation by confocal microscopy. Activation of&#xD;
      insulin/IGF-1 canonical signaling pathways and metabolic pathways of glucose homeostasis will&#xD;
      be quantified in muscle specimens. Skeletal muscle and whole-body metabolic parameters will&#xD;
      be analyzed together and correlated with clinical assessment of motor function,&#xD;
      electrophysiological data, and innervation quantification results. For comparison, 10 healthy&#xD;
      subjects of similar age and 10 patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy - a slowly&#xD;
      progressive motor neuron disorder with maintenance of effective collateral reinnervation -&#xD;
      will be used as controls. This study will be the first to address the question of the&#xD;
      contribution of insulin signaling pathways and metabolic profiles in maintenance of muscle&#xD;
      reinnervation and function in ALS patients. The molecular mechanisms identified will be new&#xD;
      targets for future treatments promoting compensatory reinnervation and slowing disease&#xD;
      progression in ALS. Ultimately, this translational project could have a significant&#xD;
      therapeutic impact in disorders with muscle denervation and collateral reinnervation as a&#xD;
      compensatory mechanism, such as spinal muscle atrophy or peripheral neuropathies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), loss of functional motor neurons is initially&#xD;
      compensated for by collateral reinnervation but, as the disease progresses, compensation&#xD;
      usually fails leading to progressive muscle weakness. Conversely, in long-term ALS survivors,&#xD;
      slow functional decline is correlated with their ability to maintain a successful&#xD;
      compensatory response to denervation over time. The molecular mechanisms by which&#xD;
      compensatory reinnervation, a crucial process for function and survival, is maintained over&#xD;
      time remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that muscle factors may be involved&#xD;
      in maintenance of muscle innervation and function in ALS long-term survivors (Bruneteau et&#xD;
      al.,2013). Energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis modifications also influence disease&#xD;
      clinical course but the mechanisms by which they contribute to ALS progression are unknown.&#xD;
      Insulin signaling cascades share many common steps with Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1)&#xD;
      signaling pathways, and link maintenance of muscle mass with glucose and energy metabolism&#xD;
      which are both connected to ALS progression. Our working hypothesis is that insulin signaling&#xD;
      pathways play a major role in maintaining collateral reinnervation and muscle function in&#xD;
      ALS. To comfort this hypothesis, we will quantify innervation in muscle specimens obtained&#xD;
      from ALS patients and correlate these results to the level of activation of insulin main&#xD;
      signaling pathways and expression of key determinants of glucose metabolism. These data will&#xD;
      be analyzed together with evaluation of motor function and motor neuron loss over time, to&#xD;
      understand how insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis influence disease progression. To&#xD;
      decipher how energy and glucose metabolism are involved in preservation of a high level of&#xD;
      collateral reinnervation over time, results obtained in ALS patients will be compared to&#xD;
      those of normal subjects of similar age and patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy&#xD;
      (SBMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characteristics of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient characteristics will be reviewed at the time of inclusion: personal or&#xD;
                familial history of medical conditions, age at onset, localization of onset (limb&#xD;
                or bulbar), concomitant medications including riluzole.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disease evaluation will be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Functional impairment will be assessed using the revised ALS Functional Rating&#xD;
                Scale (ALSFRS-R), a 12-item scale that rates the performance of activities of daily&#xD;
                living. Signs and symptoms range from 4 (normal function) to 0 (unable to attempt&#xD;
                the task) (Cedarbaum et al.,1999). Twelve functions are listed, including: speech,&#xD;
                salivation and swallowing for bulbar involvement; writing, feeding, dressing,&#xD;
                turning in bed, walking and climbing stairs for upper and lower limbs involvement;&#xD;
                respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Muscle strength will be measured on 28 muscles by manual muscle testing according&#xD;
                to the grading system of the Medical Research Council.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The routine biological tests, including platelet count and coagulation test will be&#xD;
                performed at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For all patients, genetic screening of all major ALS-associated genes will be&#xD;
                performed at the time of inclusion (including C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, UBQLN2,&#xD;
                TBK1 genes to date and any novel major ALS-linked gene that could be discovered).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory function will be assessed at baseline, M6 and M12 as part of the&#xD;
                routine follow-up procedure in the ALS center, including vital capacity expressed&#xD;
                as a percentage of the predicted normal vital capacity, arterial blood gas analysis&#xD;
                for determination of partial pressure of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide, and&#xD;
                nocturnal pulse oximetry (oxyhemoglobin saturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surface EMG procedure and motor unit number index (MUNIX) measurement Surface EMG&#xD;
           evaluation of neuromuscular function will be performed in all patients at baseline. The&#xD;
           standardized EMG protocol will include motor nerve conduction studies of upper and lower&#xD;
           limbs, and repetitive nerve stimulation studies for assessment of neuromuscular&#xD;
           transmission on the spinal accessory nerve, the axillary nerve, the ulnar nerve and the&#xD;
           radial nerve of both upper limbs. MUNIX measurement will be performed on deltoid and&#xD;
           biceps brachii muscles, at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of nutritional status and general metabolic profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of nutritional status and general metabolic profile will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      for the two groups of patients and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection for weight, height, BMI determination, waist and hip circumference&#xD;
           (waist/hip ratio calculation), nutrient intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of body composition with whole body Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of insulin secretion and insulin resistance with measurement of glucose and&#xD;
           insulin levels before and 30 mn after ingestion of a standardized liquid meal test.&#xD;
           Insulin resistance and insulin secretion will be evaluated by calculation of HOMA-IR&#xD;
           (insulin resistance index) and insulin secretion will be evaluated by calculation of&#xD;
           HOMA-B (insulin secretion index) and insulinogenic index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of serum concentrations of IGF-1 axis components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOTOR-POINT MUSCLE BIOPSY PROCEDURE For all patients, muscle samples will be removed from the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle by open biopsy under local anaesthesia for all patients. The region containing&#xD;
      NMJs will be determined by the small twitch provoked by the tip of the scalpel on the surface&#xD;
      of the muscle fascicles. For healthy control subjects, biopsy specimens of deltoid muscle&#xD;
      will be obtained during shoulder surgery for joint or bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of NMJs on a longitudinal strip of the biopsy specimen will be confirmed using&#xD;
      the classic Koelle method revealing cholinesterase activity (Koelle and Friedenwald ,1949).&#xD;
      Each biopsy specimen will be sub-divided into several muscle fragments. For confocal imaging&#xD;
      study of the morphology of NMJs, muscle samples will be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For&#xD;
      electron microscopy study of NMJ ultrastructure, thin strips of muscle from the sample will&#xD;
      be fixed in a mixture of paraformaldehyde 2% and glutaraldehyde 2.5%. Several muscle&#xD;
      fragments will be fresh frozen in isopentane for histological, biochemical, and molecular&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
