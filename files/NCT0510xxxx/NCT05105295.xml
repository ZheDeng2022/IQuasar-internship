      The subjects aged ≥18 years with HIV infected who have completed the schedule of two doses&#xD;
      for 3 months recruited to receive a third dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected 3 times: before the third dose of vaccinatioin，28 days and 6&#xD;
      months after the third dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any local or systemic adverse events that occurred within 21 days after vaccination will be&#xD;
