  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical treatment of digestive tract tumor patients often need chemotherapy before and after&#xD;
      operation, most chemotherapy drugs will cause harm to patients, prone to leakage, leading to&#xD;
      tissue necrosis. The construction of deep venous channels can protect the blood vessels of&#xD;
      patients and reduce their pain. PICC and PORT have become a new clinical treatment&#xD;
      technology, and have become the mainstream mode of long-term intravenous indwelling. Although&#xD;
      the central venous catheterization technology has many advantages, it also has some&#xD;
      limitations. Because of its long-term existence, periodic nursing needs to be carried out,&#xD;
      such as correct flushing, sealing, replacement of film and so on. Incorrect care or failure&#xD;
      to come to the hospital on time may lead to abnormal use of the catheter or shortening of&#xD;
      service life, resulting in some unexpected pain. Under the influence of COVID-19 's epidemic&#xD;
      situation, it becomes more difficult and unrealistic for patients to come to hospital&#xD;
      regularly for nursing. During the epidemic, patients need more safe and effective care at&#xD;
      home. In order to help patients with good central venous catheter nursing at home, this study&#xD;
      intends to apply remote professional real-time guidance technology to home nursing care of&#xD;
      PICC and PORT tumor patients. Through on-site practical operation training, video explanation&#xD;
      materials of long-distance on-line decomposition steps and real-time telephone audio&#xD;
      connection guidance are provided to enable patients' families to quickly learn to master&#xD;
      nursing techniques, so as to achieve safe and effective self-care at home.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From January 2022 to October 2022, 200 patients with digestive tract tumors with indwelling&#xD;
      PICC or PORT in the inpatient department of oncology surgery in our hospital were randomly&#xD;
      divided into control group (hospital nursing mode) and experimental group (family&#xD;
      self-nursing mode) . The specific methods were as follows: 2-1 the control group adopted&#xD;
      regular nursing mode after catheterization. The patients were mainly given on-site&#xD;
      catheterization nursing by specialist nurses, and health consultation and guidance were&#xD;
      carried out during the period of catheterization. 2-2 the experimental group adopted the&#xD;
      family self-nursing mode, mainly by the patients' family members to observe the catheter and&#xD;
      do regular nursing, and the specialist nurses provided remote real-time online guidance to&#xD;
      monitor the family nursing of central venous catheter. The specific operation procedures are&#xD;
      as follows: (1) make nursing videos recorded and reviewed by central venous catheter&#xD;
      specialist nurses (video production is carried out separately for different central venous&#xD;
      access devices from different manufacturers, as well as follow-up training steps). (2)&#xD;
      evaluate the nursing operation ability of the patients' family members and carry out relevant&#xD;
      training and health education, including hand washing, aseptic concept, matters needing&#xD;
      attention in removing the film, flushing and sealing techniques, and local observation points&#xD;
      at the puncture point, etc., repeatedly strengthen the training of key links and conduct&#xD;
      assessment until they are qualified; (3) distribute nursing guidance prescriptions and&#xD;
      maintenance manuals for central venous catheters. (4) provide online simulated realistic&#xD;
      nursing video materials, nursing video materials are decomposed in detailed steps, each step&#xD;
      is equipped with detailed language explanation and explanation, and the key links are&#xD;
      reminders or warnings. It is convenient for patients' families to learn and master quickly;&#xD;
      (5) provide real-time telephone audio and video connection to complete remote nursing&#xD;
      guidance. (6) set up a home nursing volunteer service group, which is composed of nursing&#xD;
      team members led by central venous catheter specialist nurses, establish a doctor-patient&#xD;
      exchange group by using Wechat and other media, and provide nursing outpatient information of&#xD;
      each central venous catheter in the area. Improve family nursing failure remedial measures,&#xD;
      provide necessary guidance and help, and timely feedback. The normal service life of the&#xD;
      catheter, the infection rate of the catheter puncture point, the catheter occlusion rate, the&#xD;
      nursing experience and satisfaction of the patients and their families were compared between&#xD;
      the two groups. Statistical processing: the data were analyzed by SPSS22.0 software. The&#xD;
      measurement data are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation, t-test is used, counting data is&#xD;
      expressed as rate (%), and 2 test or Fisher exact probability method is used.&#xD;
