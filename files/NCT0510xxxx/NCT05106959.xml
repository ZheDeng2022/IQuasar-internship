  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the shame resilience theory in a pilot context to&#xD;
      assess its feasibility in a potential full scale clinical trial. Shame resilience was&#xD;
      developed through qualitative methods but currently has little quantitative backing.&#xD;
      Continued research is needed to assess shame-resilience as a potential intervention for shame&#xD;
      which little is known to combat prevalent negative health outcomes associated with shame.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shame is an emotion that can have significant negative impacts on health outcomes, including&#xD;
      engagement in care. Feelings of shame are commonly experienced with stigmatized behaviors,&#xD;
      such as substance misuse, and may be particularly strong among pregnant women who misuse&#xD;
      substances. Rates of opioid misuse during pregnancy are dramatically rising, particularly in&#xD;
      New Mexico, leading to negative health outcomes for mothers and fetuses. Shame has been found&#xD;
      to decrease these patients' willingness to attend and engage in care. Although a theoretical&#xD;
      model is available to guide interventions to reduce shame, it has not been tested&#xD;
      empirically. In the current study, investigators seek to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness and feasibility of a brief Shame Resilience Intervention among women seeking&#xD;
      care in UNM's Milagro program, a prenatal medical clinic for opioid using pregnant women.&#xD;
      This research has the potential to significantly improve public health by generating a tool&#xD;
      to reduce barriers to care.&#xD;

    <description>In this arm participants will complete a variety of baseline assessments then participate in 15-20 minute conversation based on motivational interviewing principles in which they are trained in shame resilience. Follow-ups will be conducted a month later. Assessments will be repeated and then participants will engage in a qualitative interview regarding the training.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing Informed Shame Resilience Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Shame resilience involves four elements. Understating shame, normalizing shame thoughts, reaching out, and speaking shame. Motivational interviewing will be used to elicit and guide participants through these four elements.</description>
