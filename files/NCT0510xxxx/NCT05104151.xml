  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to measure the efficacy of a nutritive bar, in the&#xD;
      reduction of weight, body fat and the control of appetite, in patients with overweight and&#xD;
      obesity. It will be a randomized single-blind design conducted in 40 subjects.&#xD;

      Primary objective and outcome: Difference in body fat percentage and summation of the&#xD;
      absolute value of 7 body folds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize demographically and clinically the population participating in the research&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the differences in body weight between the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the median of minutes of appetite onset in each of the groups. Design: The&#xD;
           proposed study is a randomized, single-blind, paralell, single center study. Number of&#xD;
           subjects: The number of subjects will be 40. At the start of the study, subjects will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to 2 different groups. All participants will have a evaluation with a&#xD;
           nutritionist for an anthropometric assessment that includes the measurement of&#xD;
           percentage of fat, sum of body folds, weight, height and Body Mass Index. All&#xD;
           participants will receive a nutritional intervention providing a caloric deficit of 500&#xD;
           calories, depending on their daily requirements,and they will be prescribed moderate&#xD;
           physical activity from 60 to 90 minutes daily. Participants will then be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to gruop A: the nutritional bar group or group B: Control. Participants in&#xD;
           group A will be instructed to consume the nutritional bar as an integral part of the&#xD;
           previously established caloric regimen so as not to increase the number of prescribed&#xD;
           calories and will be instructed to consume the product twice a day during the whole&#xD;
           study, approximately 2 to 4 hours after breakfast and 2 to 4 hours after lunch, without&#xD;
           additions of other foods or beverages, during consumption, may only be accompanied with&#xD;
           water. Participants in group B will be instructed to consume a nutritious snack&#xD;
           corresponding to the amount of calories provided by the bar, 2 to 4 hours after&#xD;
           breakfast and 2 to 4 hours after lunch. The nutritional intervention will be carried out&#xD;
           for 8 weeks for both groups, during the forth week and during the eight week of the&#xD;
           intervention, a new nutritional assessment will be carried out with the same protocol of&#xD;
           the first evaluation, by a nutritionist to all participants.&#xD;

    <description>The difference in changes of corporal body fat will be measured by calculating the percentage of body fat and the summation of the absolute value of 7 body folds. The percentage of body fat will be determined by using the Siri equation (% Fat = 4.95 / Dc) - 4.50 x 100), the calculation of the body density by the Jackson and Pollock anthropometric equation Dc = 1.10938 - 0.0008267 (sum of three folds) + 0.0000016 (sum of three folds) 2 - 0.0002574 years), the body folds for this outcome will be performed according to the International Society for the Advancement of Cineanthropometry (ISAK) protocol, with the body adipometer Harpenden (In women: Triceps, supraspinal and anterior thigh) (in men: pectoral, abdomen and thigh).</description>

    <description>The level of appetite after consumption of the food will be evaluated using an analogue visual scale (AVE). The AVE for appetite ranges from &quot;0&quot; (least appetite) to 10 (maximum appetite or hunger) and will be printed on sheets that will be delivered to the participants on the day of their nutritional evaluation and also by email, in case the lose Participants will be asked to either consume the product for group A or the isocaloric food recommended by the nutritionist for group B for two moments in the day (mid-morning or second feeding of the day and during the mid-afternoon or the fourth meal of the day), the subjects will be asked to write in the format the time of food intake, then the subjects must complete the EVA appetite scale every half hour for 2 hours. write by text message to the researchers the time of food consumption, so that they remind participants to fill out the form every 30 minutes.</description>
