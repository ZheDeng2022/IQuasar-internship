  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, this piot study with 6 participants shown that recombinant human growth hormone&#xD;
      (rhGH) has a positive effect on the treatment with PMS. In addition, This study indicated&#xD;
      that rhGH can improve PMS symptoms via increase the level of serum insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). RhGH may be low&#xD;
      cost, more accessible, alternative treatment for PMS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Compared with the placebo, rhGH treatment significantly decreased the total scores and&#xD;
      subscale scores of GDS (P &lt;0.05), while the total scores and subscale scores of SC-ABC&#xD;
      significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) following three-months rhGH treatment. The similar results&#xD;
      were also observed in comparison with baseline. Compared with the baseline, the level of&#xD;
      serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) following three-months rhGH&#xD;
      treatment, while the placebo group had no significant impact on serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (P &gt;&#xD;
      0.05). One participant developed skin allergy the day after the first rhGH treatment, which&#xD;
      were resolved later.&#xD;

    <measure>Chinese version of the Gesell Development Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure neuropsychological development. The development quotient (DQ) in the GDS was used to quantify neurodevelopment, which can indicate the level of neurodevelopment and is interpreted as follows: DQ=86 as normal, DQ 76 to 85 as marginally delayed, DQ at 55-75 as slightly delayed, DQ at 40 to 54 as moderately delayed, and DQâ©½39 as severely delayed.</description>

    <measure>Simplified Chinese version of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (SC-ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Different from its English version that created by Krug in 1980 , SC-ABC was based on the study of Krug in 2009, in which proved ABC can be used in 14 months children, then it was translated into Simplified Chinese by the researchers of Peking University Sixth Hospital. To date, the SC-ABC scale has been verified and widely used for more than 10 years to assess the changes of symptoms in Chinese children aged from 14 months to 14 years old with behavioral problems.&#xD;
This checklist includes 57 items and five subscales: sensory behavior, social relating, body and object use, language and communication skills, and social and adaptive skills. Each item was scored from 0 to 3,with higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>
