  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic viral hepatitis C is a public health problem and several management recommendations&#xD;
      are available. According to the French High Authority of Health, hepatitis C screening&#xD;
      consists of a targeted screening of people at risk of infection by the virus, in particular&#xD;
      drug users, people from countries with a high prevalence of the virus or who have received&#xD;
      care in those countries, people transfused before 1992, or people who are or have&#xD;
      beenincarcerated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      French government recommendations aim to achieve elimination of hepatitis C virus HCV (as&#xD;
      early as 2025) and since April 2018 the European Hospital Marseille is engaged in this battle&#xD;
      and organizes every year &quot;the day without hepatitis&quot; in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2017, direct-acting antiviral treatments have become available in France to all&#xD;
      patients infected with HCV, regardless of the degree of severity of their disease. These&#xD;
      treatments are effective in more than 95% of cases and, in 2019, 18,000 people were cured. As&#xD;
      of today, it is estimated that there are still 110,000 people likely to be treated in France.&#xD;
      Among them, 75,000 are unaware of being HCV positive, people who need to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With one of the largest volumes of digestive endoscopic examinations in France, the European&#xD;
      Hospital Marseille may be a significant source of screening for hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study proposes to evaluate hepatitis C screening in consenting patients hospitalized in&#xD;
      the endoscopy department at the European Hospital Marseille.&#xD;
