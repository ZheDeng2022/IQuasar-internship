  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a leading cause of disability among US adults, and can drive opioid use and&#xD;
      associated poor outcomes. The Veterans Health Administration (VA) considers low back pain a&#xD;
      significant problem. Yoga is recommended as a front-line treatment for low back pain,&#xD;
      however, Veteran participation in yoga is low. One potential barrier to adoption among&#xD;
      Veterans may be their perceptions of yoga. In an effort to increase Veteran use of yoga, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop and test an alternative yoga program that may better meet Veteran&#xD;
      preferences and interests. The investigators call this yoga program, Rage Against the Pain&#xD;
      (RAP) 'High Intensity Stretching'. The RAP program will promote yoga as less of a meditative,&#xD;
      introspective activity done to quiet calming music and more of an expressive, active practice&#xD;
      set to music commonly enjoyed among many Veterans (e.g., rock, metal). The goal of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to develop and evaluate the RAP program, including Veteran perceptions of and&#xD;
      experiences with the program and how it may impact yoga participation, among Veterans with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Low back pain is a leading cause of disability among US adults, and can drive&#xD;
      opioid use and associated adverse outcomes. VA considers low back pain a significant problem&#xD;
      and is highly motivated to take action to improve Veteran engagement in pain care (including&#xD;
      complementary and integrative health (CIH) programs). Yoga is recommended as a front-line&#xD;
      treatment for low back pain, however, yoga adoption among Veterans is low. One potential&#xD;
      barrier to adoption among Veterans may be their perceptions of yoga, which for some,&#xD;
      encompass long-held but often inaccurate beliefs of what engaging in yoga entails and how&#xD;
      their participation will be viewed by others. To facilitate uptake and sustained use of yoga,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to offer Veterans a different yoga experience that imparts the same&#xD;
      pain management benefits but may better align with their preferences and resonate more with&#xD;
      their interests. The investigators call this yoga program, Rage Against the Pain (RAP) 'High&#xD;
      Intensity Stretching'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: If this study finds that RAP is feasible and acceptable to Veterans who&#xD;
      experience chronic low back pain, it will provide an innovative approach to address a top&#xD;
      priority of the VA - using CIH programs for pain management and opioid use reduction. The&#xD;
      long-term goal is to develop a scalable and sustainable alternative yoga program to help&#xD;
      Veterans with chronic pain who may not find other available pain management options to be&#xD;
      appealing or effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: The investigators' proposed RAP program promotes yoga as less of a meditative,&#xD;
      introspective activity done to quiet calming music and more of an expressive, active practice&#xD;
      set to music commonly enjoyed among many Veterans (e.g., rock, metal). The development of RAP&#xD;
      (and the program name) reflects direct Veteran feedback, and was inspired by &quot;rage yoga.&quot; The&#xD;
      investigators will draw upon and tailor the aspects of rage yoga that make the most sense for&#xD;
      Veteran health needs, adopting the beneficial aspects of the concept (e.g., traditional yoga&#xD;
      poses, alternative music, outward self-expression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The overall goal is to develop and evaluate the RAP program, intended to&#xD;
      improve Veteran participation in yoga and by extension, outcomes among Veterans with chronic&#xD;
      low back pain. Specific Aims are to: (1) Develop the RAP program, which will encompass&#xD;
      finalizing the program curriculum, including music play-lists, cues for self-expression, and&#xD;
      sets of yoga movements known to alleviate low back pain; (2) Examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of offering RAP for Veterans with chronic low back pain, and; (3) Gather&#xD;
      preliminary data to provide the foundation for process, sample size and power considerations&#xD;
      for a future clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of RAP on Veterans' outcomes and&#xD;
      medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Veterans who experience chronic low back pain will be invited to participate;&#xD;
      eligible participants will be randomized into RAP or a Hatha yoga program. Classes will be&#xD;
      held once a week for 12 weeks. A comprehensive safety plan will be instituted. Program&#xD;
      initiation and attrition will be tracked and compared between groups. Baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      data on outcomes (pain intensity; pain behavior; function; quality of life; sleep;&#xD;
      depression; stress; use of pain medication and other pain management strategies) will be&#xD;
      collected via survey. Veterans' experiences with and perceptions of the programs will be&#xD;
      assessed through qualitative semi-structured interviews. Expected Results: The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate RAP will be well-received by Veterans, and expect that participation in RAP will&#xD;
      be greater (and attrition lower) than a traditional yoga program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: The investigators intend to test the effectiveness of RAP in a&#xD;
      larger multi-site trial and study issues associated with its implementation in these&#xD;
      different settings.&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale, a valid and reliable numeric rating scale that asks individuals to report the average intensity of their low back pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) for the previous 7 days.</description>

    <description>Pain interference (how much the individual's pain has interfered with all aspects of their life in the prior 7 days) will be measured using the validated, reliable Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 8-item pain interference short form. PROMIS scores are standardized to reflect the general adult US population, such that a mean score of 50 reflects average pain experience; t-scores range from 40.7-77, and higher scores indicate greater levels of pain interference.</description>

    <description>Back pain-related function will be measured using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), a valid and reliable scale of physical disability resulting from chronic low back pain. The RMDQ asks individuals to read 24 items noting back pain-related functional impairments and mark those that describe them. All marked items are summed for a total score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 24 (maximum impairment).</description>

    <description>Sleep will be measured using the Insomnia Severity Index, which is a valid and reliable 7-item scale that produces a composite score of an individual's level of sleep disturbance during the past 14 days. Item responses are added to obtain a total scale score (range: 0-28); greater scores indicate more disturbed sleep and cut-points are provided by the scale developers that map to levels of clinical severity of sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention follow-up (within approximately 1 week of when the 12-week yoga or RAP programs are finished)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression severity will be measured using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), a valid and reliable measure that assesses individual's depression severity by asking them to evaluate 8 items that reflect symptoms of depression and indicate how often they have experienced each in the prior two weeks on a scale of 0 to 3 (not at all - nearly every day). Scores range from 0 (no depression symptomology) to 24 (most severe symptomology); scores can also be classified into mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe categories using cut-scores defined by the scale developers.</description>

The PSS is comprised of 4 questions and produces a composite score of perceived stress (range: 0-16; higher scores indicate higher perceptions of stress).</description>
