  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first phase of this study will be a parallel, 12-week treatment, Phase 2, double-blind, 4&#xD;
      arm study to assess the safety and effectiveness of 3 oral doses of SAR444671&#xD;
      (rilzabrutinib), i.e. dose A, B and C, compared with placebo for decreasing the frequency and&#xD;
      severity of itch and urticaria in male and female participants aged 18 years inclusive or&#xD;
      older with CSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the double-blind phase of the study, participants will be given the&#xD;
      option of enrolling in the 40-week open label extension (OLE) phase of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will receive open-label rilzabrutinib at dose C (the dose may be modified based&#xD;
      on the 12-week safety and efficacy data). Due to the fact that some participants may be&#xD;
      receiving rilzabrutinib for the first time, all participants will be monitored at Week 16,&#xD;
      Week 20, and Week 24. Afterwards, participants will be monitored at Week 36 and Week 52.&#xD;
