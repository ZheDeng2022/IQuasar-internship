  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether early video capsule endoscopy (VCE)&#xD;
      immediately after a negative gastroscopy in the setting of suspected upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding (UGIB) improves patient outcomes as compared to the standard approach which&#xD;
      typically involves performing colonoscopy prior to small bowel investigations. We aim to&#xD;
      examine the differences in diagnostic yield, total number of procedures, length of&#xD;
      hospitalization, mortality rates, and healthcare cost between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UGIB is common medical emergency with an annual hospitalization rate of 67 cases per 100,000&#xD;
      and costing in excess of 1 billion dollars in the US.1 In Alberta, Canada, annual incidence&#xD;
      of UGIB due to peptic ulcers alone is between 35.4 to 41.2 cases per 100,000 with an overall&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality rate of 8.5%.2 The presentation of acute UGIB are variable, but most&#xD;
      have visible signs of bleeding such as hematemesis, coffee-ground-emesis or melena.3&#xD;
      Clinically, these findings are used to guide management plans. For instance, a patient with&#xD;
      suspected UGIB based on clinical presentation will typically undergo gastroscopy as the&#xD;
      initial diagnostic test.4,5 However, it is becoming increasingly clear that clinical signs of&#xD;
      bleeding do not always correlate with location of bleeds. Despite melena being the most&#xD;
      common presenting symptom for UGIB, more than 10% of melena arise from the small bowel or&#xD;
      right colon.3,4 Similarly, 15% of hematochezia, which are thought to be signs of colonic&#xD;
      bleeding, in fact have bleeding sources in the upper GI tract.6 In essence, bleeding can be&#xD;
      anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract regardless of patient's presentation. This poses a&#xD;
      significant challenge for clinicians in determining which investigations to pursue in&#xD;
      patients with suspected UGIB after a negative gastroscopy. Currently, there are no clear&#xD;
      guidelines on this subject matter.4,5 In clinical practice, such patients often undergo&#xD;
      colonoscopy to rule out colonic sources of bleed, before small bowel investigations with&#xD;
      cross-sectional imaging and VCE. This is a time-consuming approach that requires multiple&#xD;
      invasive procedures, leading to patient discomfort, prolonged hospitalization, and increased&#xD;
      cost. The utility of colonoscopy in suspected UGIB have also been questioned by previous&#xD;
      study that reported a diagnostic yield of less than 5%.7 Furthermore, proceeding with&#xD;
      colonoscopy first will cause delays in small bowel investigation which may lower the&#xD;
      detection rate of small bowel lesions.8 With these in mind, we propose the study of an&#xD;
      alternative diagnostic approach which prioritizes small bowel investigation over colonic&#xD;
      investigation. We propose early VCE following negative gastroscopy instead of colonoscopy.&#xD;
      VCE is a pill shaped camera that is well tolerated, non-invasive, and offers superior mucosal&#xD;
      imaging of the small bowel compared to cross-sectional imaging in the setting of GI&#xD;
      bleeding.9 This approach would likely have higher diagnostic yield than the traditional&#xD;
      approach of conducting colonoscopy first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present, patients with suspected UGIB and negative gastroscopy pose significant&#xD;
      diagnostic challenges for clinicians. This study aims to help determine the importance of&#xD;
      prioritizing small bowel investigation in this clinical setting. If this study can&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the early small bowel investigation, the results will&#xD;
      fundamentally change the approach and management of patients with acute GI bleeding,&#xD;
      potentially leading to better patient outcomes, reduced hospitalization, and healthcare&#xD;
      savings.&#xD;
