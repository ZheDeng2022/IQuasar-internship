    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of video-based coaching on Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology residents' efficiency, proficiency, and confidence in performing laparoscopic&#xD;
      salpingectomy.&#xD;

      University of Texas Southwestern PGY-1 and PGY-2 Obstetrics and Gynecology residents will be&#xD;
      scheduled to complete a 4-week gynecology rotation at Parkland Memorial Hospital. After&#xD;
      completing the pre-survey, trainees will be randomized into either the control or&#xD;
      experimental group (video coached group) stratified by PGY (Post-Graduate Year) level.&#xD;
      Minimum group sample sizes of 9 and 9 to achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 5.0 in a&#xD;
      design with 3 repeated measurements having a Simple covariance structure when the standard&#xD;
      deviation is 5.4 and the alpha level is 0.05. The control group will be video recorded&#xD;
      performing three laparoscopic salpingectomy procedures as scheduled during the 4-week block.&#xD;
      The control group will not participate in video coaching sessions. The experimental group&#xD;
      will be video recorded performing three laparoscopic salpingectomy procedures as scheduled&#xD;
      during the block. After the first and second laparoscopic salpingectomy, the experimental&#xD;
      group of residents will review their video recording and receive a video coaching session by&#xD;
      a minimally invasive gynecologic surgery (MIGS) attending physician prior to the next&#xD;
      surgery. All three video recordings for each participant (control and experimental group)&#xD;
      will be graded using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) and Objective&#xD;
      Structured Assessment of Laparoscopic Salpingectomy (OSA-LS) criteria by two attending&#xD;
      physicians not involved in the surgeries or coaching. Each surgery will be blinded to the&#xD;
      group allocation and the week definition. Participants will not be given the assessment score&#xD;
      and the score will not affect evaluations. After the third laparoscopic salpingectomy,&#xD;
      trainees will fill out a post-course survey to determine if the video-based coaching course&#xD;
      improved their proficiency and confidence in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. They will also&#xD;
      watch their own laparoscopic salpingectomy video recording and self-grade their skills using&#xD;
      the GOALS and OSA-LS criteria that will be provided in the post-survey.&#xD;
