  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several treatment options for depression, including Internet-delivered&#xD;
      psychotherapy. While a majority of this research is based on cognitive behavior therapy&#xD;
      (ICBT), there are also several recent studies investigating Internet-delivered psychodynamic&#xD;
      therapy (IPDT). Importantly though, these treatments have never been directly compared in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we aim to include 350 patients with depression randomized to ten weeks of&#xD;
      IPDT (N=150), ICBT in the form of behavioral activation (N=150) or waiting list (N=50). After&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period, patients on the waiting list will also be offered treatment.&#xD;
      A secure web platform (KI eHealth Core Facility) will be used to provide treatment via the&#xD;
      Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of depression will be measured weekly and the effect will be evaluated by comparing&#xD;
      the change in the treatment groups with each other and with the change in the waiting list&#xD;
      group. Treatment effects and predictors of treatment response will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this project is an important step in the continued evaluation of internet-based&#xD;
      psychological treatments for depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a widespread problem in Sweden and the world. The condition causes great&#xD;
      suffering for the affected individual and his or her family, and involves major costs for&#xD;
      society. There is promising support for psychological treatment of depression in the form of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic therapy, among others, also as self-help&#xD;
      treatment in an internet-based format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet psychodynamic therapy (IPDT) has shown significant effects in the treatment of both&#xD;
      depression and anxiety disorders, but also in the treatment of somatic problems. The effects&#xD;
      also appear to have improved from end of treatment to follow-up in most studies, with&#xD;
      subjects largely completing the full treatment programme. In conclusion, the results for this&#xD;
      form of treatment are very promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, internet-based psychodynamic therapy for depression has never been compared with&#xD;
      Internet-based CBT (ICBT) in a randomised controlled trial. This is not only an important&#xD;
      issue from the perspective of comparing efficacy. Such a comparative study could also provide&#xD;
      a basis for gathering information on predictors of treatment response. Based on the&#xD;
      psychotherapy literature, there is reason to believe that different patients respond to&#xD;
      different treatments. Thus, a comparative study between ICBT and IPDT may also provide a&#xD;
      basis for answering the question &quot;Which works for whom?&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we aim to include 350 patients with depression randomized to ten weeks of&#xD;
      IPDT (N=150), ICBT in the form of behavioral activation (N=150) or waiting list (N=50). After&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period, patients on the waiting list will also be offered treatment.&#xD;
      A secure web platform (KI eHealth Core Facility) will be used to provide treatment via the&#xD;
      Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of depression will be measured weekly and the effect will be evaluated by comparing&#xD;
      the change in the treatment groups with each other and with the change in the waiting list&#xD;
      group. Treatment effects and predictors of treatment response will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this project is an important step in the continued evaluation of internet-based&#xD;
      psychological treatments for depression.&#xD;
