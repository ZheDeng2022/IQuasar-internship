      -  To evaluate the change in M. abscessus cfu/g in induced sputum samples from baseline to&#xD;
           the end of treatment with RESP301 in patients with cystic fibrosis who have&#xD;
           treatment-naïve or treatment-refractory M. abscessus-pulmonary disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of RESP301 during treatment (28 days) and follow&#xD;
           up (84 days) in patients with cystic fibrosis who have treatment naïve or treatment&#xD;
           refractory M. abscessus-pulmonary disease&#xD;

      Investigators will undertake an eighteen-week single centre, open label study in participants&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis infected with Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus)-pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (-PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will treat particpants with cystic fibrosis (CF) attending the Adult Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis Centre at the Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom. Participants will&#xD;
      be consented and screened for the RESP301-003 study to enable approximately 12 participants&#xD;
      to commence treatment with RESP301.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have M abscessus-PD as defined by the ATS/IDSA, specifically: (i) two or&#xD;
      more positive sputum cultures for M. abscessus; (ii) radiological change consistent with&#xD;
      NTM-PD; and (iii) symptoms consistent with NTM-PD, after exclusion of other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited who (1) have not commenced antibiotic treatment for M.&#xD;
      abscessus-PD or (2) have treatment refractory M. abscessus-PD (defined as remaining sputum&#xD;
      culture positive after 6 months or more of treatment). Treatment-refractory participants will&#xD;
      be suitable for enrolment in the study if date of first dosing is at least 2 months since a&#xD;
      change in M. abscessus treatment (or 4 months since change of Clofazimine).&#xD;
