  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hearts in Rhythm Organization (HiRO) is a national network of Canadian&#xD;
      researchers/clinicians, working towards a better understanding of the rare genetic causes of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death (SCD). The HiRO Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy registry, biobank and&#xD;
      imaging data repository (HiRO-HCM) is a multicenter study that will prospectively enroll&#xD;
      patients with HCM as well as those carrying sarcomeric gene variants predisposing to HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of HiRO-HCM are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to better understand the natural history of the disease and identify clinical markers&#xD;
           and biomarkers for adverse outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to derive and validate risk prediction models for disease expression, complications and&#xD;
           response to therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to better define the genetic architecture of sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric HCM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PATIENT ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be included from HiRO sites or collaborating centres. Patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by the local investigator or a research coordinator. Willing individuals will be&#xD;
      interviewed by the research coordinator and given information about HiRO-HCM. The consent&#xD;
      form will be reviewed and discussed with the coordinator. The investigators will also be&#xD;
      available for any questions that the coordinator is unable to answer. Potential participants&#xD;
      will have sufficient time to consider participating in HiRO-HCM. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from eligible patients or legal guardians. Participants will be able to&#xD;
      withdraw their participation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from willing/consented registry participants. All demographic&#xD;
      and medical information pertaining to the cardiac history and comorbidities of eligible&#xD;
      patients will be collected at baseline, including clinical information, diagnostic test&#xD;
      results, genetic testing results, family history and ethnicity, as well as current and&#xD;
      previous treatments. Healthcare information will be coded in compliance with Canada's&#xD;
      Tri-Council Policy Statement criteria: direct identifiers will be removed and replaced with a&#xD;
      unique study code that does not use personal information such as the participant's health&#xD;
      number, social insurance number or name. The coded data will be transferred into the clinical&#xD;
      research database using a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF), using REDcap. The&#xD;
      clinical research database will be managed by the Montreal Health Innovations Coordinating&#xD;
      Center (MHICC; mhicc.org). Study participants will be identified by subject number only&#xD;
      (research HiRO-HCM ID). The research ID uniquely identifying each subject eCRF within the&#xD;
      database will be attributed in REDcap but the master list of registry participants with their&#xD;
      study identifiers will be kept separately from the clinical research database. This master&#xD;
      list will be stored in an encrypted file within the research office of each site&#xD;
      investigators under their supervision. Only the site investigators and their local research&#xD;
      staff will have access to this list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participants will undergo biosampling at enrollment for the primary purpose of DNA&#xD;
      isolation and genetic studies. The preferred biosampling method is blood sampling using a&#xD;
      standard venipuncture. Blood sampling allows for high quality DNA extraction as well as&#xD;
      collection of plasma for future circulating biomarkers studies. As an alternative to blood&#xD;
      sampling, collection of saliva using DNA genotek kits, or equivalent, is allowed in the&#xD;
      following contexts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient enrollment is performed remotely. This is particularly relevant in the context&#xD;
           of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where physical distancing is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is a child &lt;14 years old without planned clinically indicated blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for which saliva collection is chosen should be made aware of the possibility to&#xD;
      request a blood sample in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HiRO-HCM biobank will be directed by the Beaulieu-Saucier Pharmacogenomics Center (PGx;&#xD;
      http://www.pharmacogenomics.ca), operating under Good Laboratory/Clinical Practices (GLP/GCP)&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA isolation and long-term storage will be done at PGx, while long-term storage of plasma&#xD;
      samples will be done at the MHI research center, in dedicated freezers located in a room with&#xD;
      restricted access. Samples of subjects that withdraw their participation will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGING DATA TRANSFER:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all consented participants, de-identified transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data will be transferred to the Montreal Heart&#xD;
      Institute imaging core-lab for central interpretation and long term storage. At minimum, the&#xD;
      following imaging studies are requested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First available TTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. First available CMR, preferably with gadolinium injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Last available TTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Last available CMR, preferably with gadolinium injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients that underwent alcohol septal ablation, surgical myectomy and/or cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation, the last available TTE and CMR studies prior to all these interventions&#xD;
      should also be transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) imaging data will be de-identified&#xD;
      prior to transfer. De-identification will be performed at each site, by removing the&#xD;
      patient's name and replacing the clinical identification number with the research HiRO-HCM&#xD;
      ID. DICOM data will be stored using the Canadian Imaging network infrastructure&#xD;
      (canadianimagingnetwork.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT FOLLOW-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a clinical diagnosis of HCM are expected to undergo yearly clinic visits,&#xD;
      as per standard care. Participants without yearly clinic visits will be contacted by phone.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will assess for living status, functional class, as well as for arrhythmic,&#xD;
      heart failure and thromboembolic events. Follow-up data will be entered by the local&#xD;
      investigator and/or research coordinator into an eCRF managed by the MHICC. De-identified&#xD;
      documentation of clinical events including ECG, intracardiac tracing, clinical notes, imaging&#xD;
      reports, and procedural reports will be uploaded to the database for centralized ad-hoc event&#xD;
      adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified DICOM images of TTE and CMR studies performed clinically during follow-up will&#xD;
      be uploaded to the MHI imaging core-lab similarly as for baseline imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants that will undergo septal myectomy for drug-refractory obstructive HCM, or&#xD;
      cardiac transplantation, surgical tissue samples will be collected using the Qiagen PAXgene&#xD;
      tissue preservation system or equivalent, allowing for future somatic DNA, RNA and proteomic&#xD;
      analyses. The samples will be stored at the MHI research center.&#xD;
