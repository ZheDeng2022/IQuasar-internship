      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ⅱ study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Patients enrolled in this study will receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride&#xD;
      liposome injection every 3 weeks (q3w, a cycle) until disease progression, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, death, or withdrawal by investigator or patient decision (a maximum of 8 cycles).&#xD;
