      The aim of this study is to translate the original English version POMA scale into Urdu and&#xD;
      also determine cultural adaptation to establish its validity and reliability. This study also&#xD;
      aims to correlate Performance oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) scales with time up and go&#xD;
      test in elderly population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among older persons, age-related impairments cause loss of postural control and balance that&#xD;
      result in pain, independency and disability. One of the most common geriatric syndromes and&#xD;
      most serious health issue threatening the independency of older persons is fall. The impact&#xD;
      of these fall-related injuries on older person, families and societies and its fruitful&#xD;
      intervention has made this issue important worldwide. Approximately 28-35% of people aged 65&#xD;
      years and 32-42% of aged 70 years' experience falls annually and 10% suffer serious injury&#xD;
      such as, fracture, severe head trauma and joint dislocation. The incidence rate of fall is&#xD;
      higher in hospitalized and residents of nursing home. It rises from middle age and peaks in&#xD;
      person above 80 years. The risk factors associated with falls are, lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      weakness, gait or balance deficits, use of an assistive device, cognitive impairment, visual&#xD;
      deficit, arthritis and impaired activities of daily living . Different scales and tests are&#xD;
      used for risk factors for falls, balance and mobility such as Berg Balance Scale, Time up and&#xD;
      go test and dynamic gait index and Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale. One of these scales&#xD;
      Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) scale. POMA scale has acceptable reliability&#xD;
      and validity as compared to FRT and TUG in elderly. The advantages of this scale are;&#xD;
      applicability, low cost, easy to administer, no equipment is needed other than a standard&#xD;
      chair and stopwatch, evaluates functional activities and assesses both balance (POMA-B) and&#xD;
      gait components (POMA-G)Originally POMA scale was used to assess risk of fall in&#xD;
      institutionalized populations but later on used as an assessment tool for mobility and&#xD;
      determine effects of interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POMA has found to be widely used in patients who have dynamic and reactive balance&#xD;
      deficits. It comprises 16 items (9 balance and 7 gait related). Total time taken for&#xD;
      administration is approximately 10 minutes and total score is 28; 16 is balance and 12 is&#xD;
      gait score. Some Items are scored dichotomously (can/cannot perform) and others are scored 0,&#xD;
      1 or 2 points for quality of performance. The higher scores show low fall risk and better&#xD;
      balance while lower score predicts poorer balance and greater risk of fall. The score&#xD;
      19-24/28 indicates moderate risk for falling while score &lt;19 indicates a &quot;high&quot; risk for&#xD;
      falling.&#xD;
