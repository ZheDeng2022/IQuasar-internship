    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) in kidney transplant recipients previously treated with REGN5459 or REGN5458 in&#xD;
      the R5459-RT-1944 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate each of the following in kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients previously treated with REGN5459 or REGN5458:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates and classification of antibody-mediated and T-cell-mediated kidney allograft&#xD;
           rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allograft function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delayed allograft function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloantibody levels and calculated panel-reactive&#xD;
           antibody (cPRA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergence of de novo donor-specific antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating immunoglobulin (Ig) classes (isotypes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN5459 or REGN5458&#xD;
