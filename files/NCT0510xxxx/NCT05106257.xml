    <textblock>
      Although self-management treatment improves quality of life among individuals with COPD,&#xD;
      there is limited understanding of which elements of treatment are most effective. The&#xD;
      proposed research will test the feasibility of using an engineering-inspired study design to&#xD;
      identify effective COPD self-management treatment components. The long-term goal of this line&#xD;
      of research is to optimize the effectiveness of COPD self-management treatment, and improve&#xD;
      quality of life for individuals with COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an increasingly prevalent and costly chronic&#xD;
      health condition, and is the third major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      States. Self-management treatment programs for COPD are shown to improve health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and prevent COPD-related hospitalizations. Despite their clinical benefits,&#xD;
      these programs are typically multi-component and time- and resource-intensive. To date, no&#xD;
      study has been conducted to isolate the role of individual self-management treatment&#xD;
      components in contributing to improved COPD outcomes. The proposed research will establish&#xD;
      the feasibility of using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to optimize&#xD;
      COPD self-management treatment delivered by the American Lung Association (ALA) Helpline.&#xD;
      Treatment components to be evaluated include duration of self-management education,&#xD;
      ground-based walking training, inhaler training, and caregiver support. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is health-related quality of life, with secondary outcomes of COPD symptom burden,&#xD;
      self-management behaviors, and hospitalization. Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Design a factorial experiment and develop operational procedures. The investigators&#xD;
      will design a factorial experiment with the same number of experimental conditions and length&#xD;
      of follow-up as the planned optimization trial. In collaboration with the ALA COPD Helpline,&#xD;
      the investigators will develop operational procedures (i.e., recruitment, screening,&#xD;
      randomization, and database management) for successful implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Establish feasibility and acceptability by pilot testing the study design. The&#xD;
      investigators will deliver treatment to three participants per experimental condition (N=48)&#xD;
      with good fidelity, and will remotely assess baseline, mediator, and outcome variables. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct qualitative interviews at end-of-treatment with 15-20&#xD;
      participants. Resulting values will provide estimates of recruitment and retention rates,&#xD;
      treatment fidelity, acceptability of treatment components, and outcome measure variability to&#xD;
      inform a subsequent, fully-powered optimization trial. The primary outcome is health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, with secondary outcomes of COPD symptom burden, self-management behaviors,&#xD;
      and hospitalization.&#xD;

    <description>The self-management education condition is based on the Living Well with COPD program. The program consists of a mailed booklet and structured phone counseling delivered by certified COPD educators. Topics include disease information, breathing retraining, action planning, medication use, energy conservation, and following good health habits.

    <description>Participants randomized to this condition will identify an informal caregiver who is involved in their healthcare (i.e., spouse, family member, or friend), who will receive a mailed copy of the Respiratory Health Association's COPD Caregiver's Toolkit, a comprehensive informational resource to support the care of the person living with COPD. Caregivers will receive two brief (10-15 minute) check-in calls from a trained staff member. The structured content of these sessions will include providing an overview of toolkit content, identifying goals for sections(s) to review and incorporate into caregiving activities, and addressing any questions.</description>
