  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to investigate if the responsiveness to chronic resistance&#xD;
      training is dependent on the muscle typology. In a second aim we will investigate the most&#xD;
      optimal training frequency for slow-twitchers and fast-twitchers. For the latter we&#xD;
      hypothesize that slow-twitchers might cope better with higher frequencies and higher volumes&#xD;
      compared to fast-twitchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female adult participants (18-45y) will be recruited. The subjects' muscle typology&#xD;
      will be non-invasively estimated in the leg muscles by measurement of muscle carnosine using&#xD;
      H-MRS. In total 21 subjects (11 slow and 10 fast subjects) will participate. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assigned to a whole-body resistance training exercise protocol of 9 weeks in wich arm A and&#xD;
      leg A will train 3 times per week and arm B and leg B will train 2 times per week. Before and&#xD;
      following the training period, subjects will be subjected to different measurements (fitness&#xD;
      level, muscle volume, strength tests, blood sampling, muscle biopsies).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive the same training intervention but the subjects are divided into two groups based on an inherent physiological characteristic: the muscle typology. A slow typology group (people with a lot of slow muscle fibers) and a fast typology group (people with a lot of fast muscle fibers). Each participant will train their legs and arms unilateral and one arm and one leg will train two times per week, while the other arm and leg will train three times per week for 9 weeks. The assignment of the limbs to the 3x/week condition and the 2x/week condition is randomized. The training outcomes of the two groups will be compared as well as the within subject differences between training two times per week or training 3 times per week.</intervention_model_description>
