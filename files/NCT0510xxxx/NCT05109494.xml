    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to find out if radiation therapy treatment prior to surgery&#xD;
      is safe and effective to treat soft tissue sarcomas. 30 participants with soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for soft tissue sarcomas is a combination of radiation therapy and&#xD;
      surgery. Radiation therapy is usually done prior to the surgical removal of the tumor. Most&#xD;
      commonly, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is used for soft tissue sarcomas, in which&#xD;
      radiation therapy is given over 25 treatments in a time period of approximately 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is radiation treatment that is delivered over the&#xD;
      course of several days; typically divided into doses that are delivered each weekday over a&#xD;
      set number of weeks. Each radiation treatment is called a &quot;dose fraction&quot;, thus the name&#xD;
      &quot;fractionated&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionated radiotherapy is a technique in which a higher dose of radiation is given&#xD;
      over a fewer number of treatments. Early studies have suggested that hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be safe and effective for pre-operative treatment of soft tissue sarcomas.&#xD;
      However, because this disease is rare, there are different kinds of soft tissue sarcomas,&#xD;
      these tumors can occur anywhere in the body, and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
      remains standard, more study is needed to find out if hypofractionated radiotherapy is a safe&#xD;
      and effective treatment for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan to compare patients treated with conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy over 25 treatments in a time period of 5 weeks to patients treated&#xD;
      with hypofractionated radiotherapy over 5 treatments in a time period of 1-2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize hypofractionated radiotherapy in the pre-operative treatment of&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcomas can effectively treat soft tissue sarcomas while minimizing side effects&#xD;
      and minimizing the time between diagnosis and surgical resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate soft tissue sarcoma tumor response to neoadjuvant hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate soft tissue sarcoma tumor response to neoadjuvant hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate acute wound healing complications after neoadjuvant hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate late toxicity in patients undergoing neoadjuvant hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate local tumor control and progression-free survival after hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate surgically resected tissue for markers of tumor cell susceptibility to immune&#xD;
           response, immune infiltration, and anti-tumor immune response following neoadjuvant&#xD;
           hypofractionated compared to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate quality of life in patients undergoing neoadjuvant hypofractionated versus&#xD;
           conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
