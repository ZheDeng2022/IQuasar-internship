  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborns who are born premature or suffer brain injury at birth are at risk for motor&#xD;
      problems that may cause weakness in reaching and grasping on one side of the body. In older&#xD;
      children, therapists may use a hand mitt and restraint for the stronger arm, to encourage use&#xD;
      of the weaker side, called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). Even with the high&#xD;
      intensity therapy of CIMT, it typically takes between 40-120 hours total treatment time for&#xD;
      most children to improve their motor skills. A non-invasive form of nerve stimulation,&#xD;
      transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), stimulates a nerve by the ear that&#xD;
      enhances learning motor skills. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of taVNS to improve motor skills when paired with CIMT in infants with&#xD;
      one-sided weakness at 6-18months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent pioneering studies have used neuromodulation combined with intensive motor therapies&#xD;
      in adults after stroke. Few studies have investigated combining neuromodulation and&#xD;
      evidence-based pediatric intensive therapies such as CIMT, and then only in older children&#xD;
      with CP to enhance neuroplasticity and improve functional outcomes. The investigators are the&#xD;
      first to use non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) paired&#xD;
      with a motor task of bottle-feeding in infants with feeding failure. taVNS paired with motor&#xD;
      feeding activity was safe and over 50% infants attained full oral feeds who were slated to&#xD;
      receive a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). With the unique collaboration of experts in brain&#xD;
      stimulation, pediatric translational clinical science and pediatric occupational therapy in&#xD;
      this pilot project, the investigators propose to expand the paradigm of pairing&#xD;
      neuromodulation with motor training in at-risk infants by exploring the safety, feasibility,&#xD;
      and effectiveness of delivering taVNS concurrently with CIMT. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      combining taVNS with intensive CIMT may boost neuroplasticity, allowing for delivery of&#xD;
      infant therapy at a minimally effective dosage while improving infant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine the feasibility and safety of taVNS in at-risk infants&#xD;
      6-18mo undergoing CIMT therapy in open label pilot trial and assess both infant tolerability&#xD;
      and the therapist's ability to deliver high-quality CIMT along with taVNS.&#xD;
