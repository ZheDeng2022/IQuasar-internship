  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation will investigate whether Hypotension Decision Assist (HDA) is a&#xD;
      feasible, safe and effective patient clinical decision support system to enhance an&#xD;
      anaesthetist's ability to manage a patient's cardiovascular system when undergoing surgery.&#xD;
      If successful, this study will provide evidence that the use of HDA facilitates beneficial&#xD;
      outcomes for patients who have this device used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study participants who are due to undergo elective major surgery and have an arterial&#xD;
      line as part of their standard care will be invited to have the additional monitoring device&#xD;
      (HDA) included as part of their care. Agreeing participants will have demographic, contact&#xD;
      and medical history information necessary to conduct the study recorded, including a record&#xD;
      of their intraoperative arterial line measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the consent process participants will receive intraoperative monitoring with&#xD;
      Hypotension Decision Assist in addition to their standard care. The HDA monitor will be&#xD;
      attached to the patient vital signs monitor, which will in turn be attached to the blood&#xD;
      pressure transducer. All sampled arterial line data collected by the patient vital signs&#xD;
      monitored will be automatically transmitted in real time to the HDA device via a serial cable&#xD;
      attached to a digital export port of the vital signs monitor. HDA will process this input&#xD;
      data to display, in graphical and numeric format, vital signs data and physiological&#xD;
      parameters derived from the arterial wave form data including: Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP),&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and changes in heart rate, cardiac output&#xD;
      and systemic vascular resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The output from the study will be compared to the primary and secondary outcomes to evaluate&#xD;
      the performance and safety of the device and to evaluate whether HDA improves control of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system from the anaesthetists' perspective.&#xD;
