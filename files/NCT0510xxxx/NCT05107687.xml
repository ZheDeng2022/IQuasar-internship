  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research efforts are needed to increase tobacco cessation support and to improve tobacco&#xD;
      cessation efficacy. In addition, strategies must be identified to increase access to smoking&#xD;
      cessation support and to develop processes to integrate smoking cessation into treatment&#xD;
      plans for cancer patients.&#xD;

      The Cancer Patient Tobacco Questionnaire (C-TUQ) survey tool will be used to address the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures. This tool is publicly available on the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institutes Grid-Enabled Measures website and was developed by NCI and the American&#xD;
      Association for Cancer Research. This tool is a 22-item self-report survey designed to&#xD;
      capture information about tobacco use by cancer patients and cancer survivors. Comparisons&#xD;
      will be made for those patients that enroll in the structured smoking cessation program&#xD;
      versus those patients that have opted to quit on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of an intensive structured smoking cessation program&#xD;
      (education and support) provided by a tobacco cessation trained specialist versus unassisted&#xD;
      smoking cessation quitting methods (no support, patients have opted to stop on their own) in&#xD;
      cancer patients seen in a community health care system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up in patients&#xD;
           participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients that have&#xD;
           quit smoking with professional support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up in&#xD;
           patients participating in a structured smoking cessation program versus those patients&#xD;
           that have quit smoking without professional support, participants choosing to stop&#xD;
           smoking on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of implementing a system level smoking cessation program into the&#xD;
           ongoing management of our cancer patients who smoke.&#xD;
