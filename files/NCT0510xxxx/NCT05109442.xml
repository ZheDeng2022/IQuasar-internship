  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AFM24-102 is a Phase 1/2a open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose escalation, and&#xD;
      expansion study evaluating AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with selected&#xD;
      EGRF-expressing advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed after treatment with&#xD;
      previous anticancer therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 2 parts in this study: a dose escalation phase (phase 1) and an expansion phase&#xD;
      (phase 2a). Patients will qualify to receive the investigational drugs (AFM24 + atezolizumab)&#xD;
      in the dose escalation phase or the expansion phase only if they are deemed eligible&#xD;
      following the safety lead-in phase. Seven days before the planned first combination&#xD;
      treatment, patients will receive a single dose of AFM24 and will be observed for any adverse&#xD;
      events for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the dose escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation phase will be followed by the expansion phase once the MTD/RP2D of AFM24&#xD;
      in combination with atezolizumab has been determined. The expansion phase of the study is&#xD;
      intended to collect preliminary evidence of efficacy and to further confirm the safety of&#xD;
      AFM24 in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor types planned to be studied in the AFM24/atezolizumab combination study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR-WT), with disease progression after chemotherapy and&#xD;
           PD1/PD-L1 targeted therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric/GEJ cancer if intolerant to or with disease progression after standard&#xD;
           platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreatic/hepatocellular/biliary tract cancer with disease progression after standard&#xD;
           of care (SOC) therapy or if there is no appropriate SOC available for their condition&#xD;
