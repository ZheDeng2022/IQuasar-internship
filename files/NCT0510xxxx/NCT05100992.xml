    <textblock>
      Coronary bifurcation lesions are lesions (or blockages) that occur at or near the&#xD;
      intersection of a major coronary artery and one of the arteries' side branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous techniques and devices have been developed to treat coronary bifurcations; however,&#xD;
      these types of lesions remain some of the most challenging, both in terms of procedural&#xD;
      success and outcome. This study is designed as an observational, multi-center registry that&#xD;
      will collect information on treatment strategies and outcomes of consecutive patients&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in coronary bifurcations among various&#xD;
      participating centers, in order to determine the frequency of bifurcation PCI, the procedural&#xD;
      strategies utilized, and the procedural outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Numerous techniques and devices have been developed to treat coronary bifurcations; however,&#xD;
      these types of lesions remain some of the most challenging, both in terms of procedural&#xD;
      success and outcome. Several techniques are currently being utilized to treat coronary&#xD;
      bifurcation lesions, including a 1-stent provisional stenting technique. Various 2-stent&#xD;
      techniques are also performed, including: double kiss crush (DK crush4), culotte, T and&#xD;
      protrusion (TAP), crush, mini-crush, reverse crush and V-stenting. The optimal technique for&#xD;
      bifurcation stenting when two stents are required remains controversial; however, the DK&#xD;
      crush technique appears to have stronger data, especially for left main bifurcations.&#xD;
      However, DK crush can be challenging to perform, requiring several steps and frequent&#xD;
      troubleshooting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adoption of DK crush and other 2-stent bifurcation strategies, as well as the rigor of&#xD;
      implementation, have received limited study. This study is designed as an observational,&#xD;
      multi-center registry that will collect information on treatment strategies and outcomes of&#xD;
      consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in coronary&#xD;
      bifurcations among various participating centers, in order to determine the frequency of&#xD;
      bifurcation PCI, the procedural strategies utilized,&#xD;
