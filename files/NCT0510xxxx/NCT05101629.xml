    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced HCC, refractory to atezolizumab and bevacizumab will be treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. Efficacy of the combination therapy will be assessed by&#xD;
      objective reposnse rate, progression free survival, overal survival, safety/tolerability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label phase II trial investigating the clinical&#xD;
      activity of a second-line therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab (200 mg IV, q3w)&#xD;
      and the multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lenvatinib (8 mg for BW &lt; 60 kg /&#xD;
      12 mg for BW ≥ 60 kg p.o. QD) in advanced HCC patients who are refractory to atezolizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy by objective response rate (ORR) according to&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine efficacy in terms of progression free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) as well as safety and toxicity (acc. to NCI-CTC V5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, tissue and serum samples (optional) will be analyzed for molecular biomarkers&#xD;
      predictive for ORR, PFS and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      32 patients will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;

             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the&#xD;
             participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best&#xD;
             interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Have known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
