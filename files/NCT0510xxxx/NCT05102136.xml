      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses&#xD;
      of REGN9933 in healthy participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effects of single doses of REGN9933 on intrinsic/common pathway coagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effects of single doses of REGN9933 on extrinsic/common pathway coagulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the drug concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic (PK) following single&#xD;
           escalating doses of REGN9933&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the concentration profiles of total FXI following single escalating doses&#xD;
           of REGN9933&#xD;
