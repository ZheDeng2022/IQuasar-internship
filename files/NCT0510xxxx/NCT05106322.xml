  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to have a small spectrometer (pocket size) , reliable and rapid tool that can be&#xD;
      used during liver harvesting, which enables macrosteatosis to be evaluated reproducibly and&#xD;
      selectively, at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool must be minimally invasive, inexpensive and without significantly impacting the&#xD;
      general organization of multi-organ harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, the surgeon will perform an intraoperative spectrometer scan (five&#xD;
      scans on the left lobe) before clamping the aorta. The surgeon will not be informed of the&#xD;
      results of the spectrometer, and will carry out (or not) the biopsy. The spectrometers'&#xD;
      results will be compared with definitive histological findings.&#xD;
