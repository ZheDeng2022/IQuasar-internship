  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess whether a digital crowdsourced intervention can reduce HIV stigma&#xD;
      and promote HIV self-testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA). NIH has emphasized the&#xD;
      need for research on interventions to reduce HIV-associated stigma and its impact on the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, particularly in low and middle income countries&#xD;
      (LMICs). The proposed study has the highest public health significance: it uses a&#xD;
      community-based participatory approach to engage local AYA to develop a digital crowdsourced&#xD;
      HIV stigma reduction and self-testing intervention to reduce HIV stigma and increase HIV&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 1: To develop a crowdsourced digital HIV stigma reduction and self-testing&#xD;
      intervention targeting AYA in Kazakhstan. Using a community-based participatory approach that&#xD;
      engages local adolescents and young adults (AYA) and youth organizations, we will launch a&#xD;
      national crowdsourcing contest in which AYA will design multimedia content to reduce HIV&#xD;
      stigma in order to promote HIV testing among peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 2: To pilot test this crowdsourced HIV stigma reduction and self-testing&#xD;
      intervention in a preliminary efficacy trial. We will assess the intervention's feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability and obtain preliminary estimates of its effects on decreasing HIV stigma&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and increasing HIV testing (secondary outcome) among AYA in Kazakhstan who&#xD;
      received the intervention compared to individuals who did not. Participants (n=168) will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to: 1) receive the winning multimedia crowdsourced HIV stigma reduction&#xD;
      content and a link for HIV self-testing, or 2) receive standard Kazakhstan Ministry of Health&#xD;
      HIV informational materials and a link for HIV self-testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess whether a digital crowdsourced intervention can reduce HIV stigma&#xD;
      and promote HIV self-testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Globally AYA are at&#xD;
      increased risk for HIV acquisition. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), new HIV&#xD;
      infections among 15-24 year old AYA are expected to increase 28% by 2030. In Kazakhstan, one&#xD;
      in four HIV infections occur among AYA. Despite the growing HIV burden among AYA in&#xD;
      Kazakhstan, this population has some of the lowest HIV testing rates in the country, largely&#xD;
      due to stigma. Yet few efforts in Kazakhstan address HIV stigma and the role it plays as a&#xD;
      barrier to HIV testing. Digital technologies and crowdsourcing campaigns (i.e., engaging&#xD;
      groups of AYA online to address public health challenges and share solutions) are scalable,&#xD;
      cost-effective tools that can increase HIV testing services and reduce HIV stigma in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries (LMICs) and other resource- constrained settings. Crowdsourcing may&#xD;
      be particularly successful among AYA, given their high levels of social media use and&#xD;
      technological literacy. Complementing the crowdsourcing approach, mailing HIV rapid test kits&#xD;
      can enable AYA to avoid the stigma associated with attending the AIDS Center and overcome&#xD;
      transportation barriers.&#xD;
