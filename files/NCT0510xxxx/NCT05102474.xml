  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Getting enough sleep is important for maximizing health and well-being. When it comes to&#xD;
      health, sleep is as vital as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet. Not getting enough&#xD;
      sleep can lead to health problems like heart attacks, diabetes, and even cancer. Since people&#xD;
      with psoriasis have these same health problems, getting better sleep may help to keep them&#xD;
      happier and healthier. This study will look at how people with psoriasis sleep and if their&#xD;
      sleep is different than people without psoriasis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A growing body of literature has revealed that patients with psoriasis are more likely to&#xD;
      report sleep disturbance when compared to the general population. The cross-sectional study&#xD;
      presented here will allow us to objectively and rigorously measure sleep architecture in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients and compare it to healthy controls, If sleep dysfunction is confirmed in&#xD;
      this population, then clinical interventions such as screening for sleep disturbance or&#xD;
      promoting sleep hygiene could lead to meaningful improvements in patients' health, longevity,&#xD;
      and overall quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>PSG is the gold standard for objectively measuring sleep in the laboratory setting. The procedure consists of electrodes measuring brain activity (electroencephalography, EEG), eye movements (electrooculography, EOG), muscle activity (electromyography, EMG), respiratory events, snoring activity, blood oxygen saturation, and body position. Video surveillance during the sleep study can also monitor for itching events that occur during the night.</description>

             OSA as calculated by the STOP-BANG questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have used the following treatments for psoriasis: phototherapy (UVB) in&#xD;
