    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymic&#xD;
      epithelial tumors (TETs). However, more than half of these patients experience disease&#xD;
      recurrence and require second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no approved drugs for treatment of recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma and new&#xD;
      therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease progression on or after&#xD;
      platinum-containing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PT-112, a first-in-class metallo-pyrophosphate conjugate, offers a unique set of properties&#xD;
      of both cellular interaction and molecular antitumor mechanisms, including resistance to DNA&#xD;
      repair pathways and induction of immunogenic cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PT-112 has been clinically proven to be safe and tolerable and has demonstrated efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST criteria v1.1 to PT-112 in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory TETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &gt;= age 18 years with histologically confirmed, unresectable thymoma or thymic&#xD;
      carcinoma who have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen or must have refused cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must have progressive and measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-arm, open-label study with two cohorts (cohort 1: thymoma; cohort 2:&#xD;
      thymic carcinoma) to determine the clinical activity and safety of PT-112 in participants&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory TETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PT-112 will be administered intravenously on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle at a dose of&#xD;
      360 mg/m2 until disease progression or development of intolerable adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who develop intolerable toxicity at a dose of 360 mg/m2, two dose reductions&#xD;
      will be permitted to 300 mg/m2 or 250 mg/m2 after resolution of adverse events to &lt; grade 1&#xD;
      or baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE, version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed after completion of every other cycle (8 weeks) using RECIST&#xD;
      criteria, version 1.1. Additionally, for participants with pleural dissemination tumor&#xD;
      response will be assessed using International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG)&#xD;
      modified RECIST criteria.&#xD;

             potential (FOCBP). NOTE: FOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche&#xD;
             and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization or who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Absence of pregnancy must be demonstrated unless there is proven&#xD;

             hormone profile, or surgical castration) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must not become pregnant or start breast feeding during the study.&#xD;
             Breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with PT-112.&#xD;

             above) and male participants with a sexual partner of childbearing potential must use&#xD;
             medically effective contraception during the study and for 6 months after the last&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PT-112. Since there is no definitive list of compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to PT-112, the principal investigator if in doubt,&#xD;
             will report known allergies to the pharmacist to make a determination as to whether it&#xD;
             is safe to enroll a participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents within 14 days (or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of a drug, whichever is shorter) before initiation of study therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy or significant acute or chronic infections&#xD;
             including, among others:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening&#xD;
                  (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
                  syndrome with a detectable viral load. However, participants with HIV who have an&#xD;

                  Therapy (HAART) can be screened for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 5 Grade &gt; 1) with the&#xD;
