  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent lab-based discoveries suggest that IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) and BTK (Bruton's&#xD;
      tyrosine Kinase) form a closely linked metabolic checkpoint in tumor-associated&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells. The central clinical hypothesis for the GCC2020 study is that&#xD;
      combining ibrutinib (BTK-inhibitor) with indoximod (IDO-inhibitor) during chemotherapy will&#xD;
      synergistically enhance anti-tumor immune responses, leading to improvement in clinical&#xD;
      response with manageable overlapping toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCC2020 is a prospective open-label phase 1 trial to determine the best safe dose of&#xD;
      ibrutinib to use in combination with a previously studied chemo-immunotherapy regimen,&#xD;
      comprised of the IDO-inhibitor indoximod plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and etoposide&#xD;
      (4-drug combination) for participants, age 12 to 25 years, with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      ependymoma, medulloblastoma/PNET, or glioblastoma that progressed after previous treatment&#xD;
      with indoximod plus temozolomide. Those previously treated with indoximod plus temozolomide&#xD;
      are eligible, including prior treatment via the on-going phase 2 indoximod study (GCC1949,&#xD;
      NCT04049669), the now closed phase 1 study (NLG2105, NCT02502708), or expanded access&#xD;
      protocols. A dose-escalation cohort will determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib for the&#xD;
      4-drug combination. This will be followed by an expansion cohort, using ibrutinib at the best&#xD;
      safe dose in the 4-drug combination, to allow assessment of preliminary evidence of efficacy.&#xD;
