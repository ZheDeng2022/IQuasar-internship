      Comparison between Dynamic Cervical Implant as a recently introduced technique in our&#xD;
      department and the conventional Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion in management of&#xD;
      single-level cervical disc prolapse.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is considered to be a highly successful&#xD;
      surgical technique for cervical spondylosis associated with brachialgia and/or myelopathy.&#xD;
      Non-union accounts for more than two-thirds of failures in ACDF surgeries and iliac bone&#xD;
      graft morbidity is also reported in about one-third of multilevel fusion operations. There&#xD;
      are many types of cages used to avoid the complications associated with iliac bone&#xD;
      grafting.These problems include persistent donor-site pain, infection, hematoma formation,&#xD;
      iliac crest fracture, and neuralgia parasthetica.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in spite of being successful for many years, ACDF has its own complications in the&#xD;
      form of non-union, implant failure, and adjacent level disease which occurs due to the&#xD;
      excessive motion observed at the levels immediately above and/or below the index level. It&#xD;
      has been proven to provide clinical stability after decompression.. However, although it&#xD;
      achieves long-term success, ACDF is not without complications as there have been reports of&#xD;
      pseudoarthrosis, implant failure, and adjacent level disease which occurs due to the&#xD;
      significant amount of increased motion observed at the levels immediately above and below the&#xD;
      fusion. However, greater compensation occurred at the inferior segments compared to the&#xD;
      superior segments for the lower level fusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic cervical Implant (DCI) is a titanium implant, originally invented in 2002 by Dr. Guy&#xD;
      Matgé, Luxembourg. It was introduced in clinical use, in 2004. The design was modified to&#xD;
      better accommodate the normal disc anatomy. The DCI implant with its motion preservation&#xD;
      characters is unique implant. It stabilizes the cervical spine while still offering a&#xD;
      limited, controlled flexion and extension movements allowing the spine to dynamically perform&#xD;
      its function. It also acts as a shock absorber, preventing accelerated degeneration in&#xD;
      adjacent segments. Thus, the DCI implant aims at combining the advantages of the gold&#xD;
      standard &quot;fusion&quot; with a motion preservation philosophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of ACDF versus DCI in patients with&#xD;
           degenerative cervical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy operated upon at Assiut University&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give the effective treatment, pain control and can detect the best method could be used&#xD;
           in such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Improve the outcome of these patients and decease rate of recurrence and complications&#xD;
