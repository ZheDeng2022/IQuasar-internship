  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of shortening the primary and nodal&#xD;
      adjuvant radiation therapy course from 2 Gy x 25 fractions to 3.6 Gy x 10 fractions in merkel&#xD;
      cell carcinoma patients who may or may not be receiving immunotherapy.&#xD;

      -  To estimate the 2-year local control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the&#xD;
           primary tumor bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the 2-year nodal control rate for adjuvant hypofractionated RT to the&#xD;
           primary draining nodal basin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine MCC disease outcomes including:time to non-nodal locoregional recurrence,&#xD;
           time to nodal recurrence, time to distant mestasis, disease-free-survival and&#xD;
           disease-specific survival for patients receiving hypofractionated adjuvant RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess acute and late RT associated toxicity within or neighboring the radiated&#xD;
           field.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed MCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no evidence of distant metastasis as determined by clinical&#xD;
             examination and any form of imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If planned for adjuvant primary tumor radiation therapy a patient should have had&#xD;
             surgical excision of a primary MCC tumor within 4 months of starting RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If planned for adjuvant nodal radiation therapy a patient should have had:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior positive sentinel lymph node biopsy with any degree of nodal involvement&#xD;
                  within 4 months of starting RT and no completion nodal dissection, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lymph node dissection within 4 months of starting RT and high risk nodal disease&#xD;
                  (receipt of neoadjuvant immunotherapy, ECE, &gt;1 involved node, &gt;1 cm nodal&#xD;
                  disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunotherapy is permitted at any time and may specifically be administered prior to&#xD;
             RT, concurrent with RT or after RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years because MCC is extremely rare in patients &lt;18 years of age and RT is&#xD;
             considered high risk in this population due to risk of secondary malignancy and&#xD;
             potentially growing tissues that may be adversely impacted by RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RT is a known teratogen. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. (refer&#xD;
             to MDA Policy CLN 1114) This includes all female patients, between the onset of menses&#xD;
             and 55 years unless the patient presents with an applicable exclusionary factor which&#xD;
             may be one of the following: • Postmenopausal (no menses in greater than or equal to&#xD;
             12 consecutive months). • History of hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.&#xD;
             • Ovarian failure (Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Estradiol in menopausal range, who&#xD;
             have received Whole Pelvic Radiation Therapy). • History of bilateral tubal ligation&#xD;
             or another surgical sterilization procedure. Approved methods of birth control are as&#xD;
             follows: Hormonal contraception (i.e. birth control pills, injection, implant,&#xD;
             transdermal patch, vaginal ring), Intrauterine device (IUD), Tubal Ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy, Subject/Partner post vasectomy, Implantable or injectable&#xD;
             contraceptives, and condoms plus spermicide. Not engaging in sexual activity for the&#xD;
             total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice;&#xD;
             however periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of birth control. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after&#xD;
             completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous radiation therapy to the site of planned primary or nodal radiation treatment&#xD;
             such that the prior site of treatment would be encompassed by the radiation field&#xD;
             needed to treat the current cancer. In other words, treatment on this trial would&#xD;
             require re-irradiation of tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RT is a known teratogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are less than 18 years of age becase RT is extremely rare in this&#xD;
             population and the treatment agent is a known carcinogen.&#xD;
