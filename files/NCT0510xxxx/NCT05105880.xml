  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted this retrospective study in a large single center with an annual&#xD;
      birth of more than 20,000 newborns, from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, to confirm the&#xD;
      applicability and accuracy of pulse oximetry (POX) combined cardio-auscultation to screen&#xD;
      congenital heart disease for neonates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive newborn babies were eligible, irrespective of gestational age, NICU&#xD;
      admission, symptom presence or prenatal diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by institutional ethical review board of Linyi Maternal and Child&#xD;
      Healthcare Hospital. Spoken informed consent was obtained from the participating babies'&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians from departments of neonatal medicine and developmental medicine undertake&#xD;
      auscultation screening. When abnormal murmur occurred, an echocardiography would be requested&#xD;
      to confirm if the newborn has CHD or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians from obstetrics department and nursing staff from neonatal department undertake&#xD;
      POX measurement. If a positive POX occurred, an echocardiography would be requested to&#xD;
      confirm if the newborn has CHD or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians from department of ultrasonography undertake echocardiography confirmation for&#xD;
      newborns deemed positive by auscultation or POX.&#xD;
