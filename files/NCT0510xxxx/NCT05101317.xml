  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMI-115 compared to placebo&#xD;
      over a 12 weeks period on subjects with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMI-115 versus a placebo in&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women with moderate to severe Endometriosis associated pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study will determine the safety and efficacy of HMI 115 at 3 dose levels. Part&#xD;
      2 will detect a higher dose and might be conducted after Part 1.&#xD;
