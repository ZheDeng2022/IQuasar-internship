  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interest of journeys to high altitude regions for recreational or professional purposes&#xD;
      is increasing, also among potentially vulnerable groups including patients with chronic&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). In Switzerland and many other&#xD;
      regions worldwide, many settlements and alpine resorts are at altitudes above 1500m and&#xD;
      alpine tourism is an important social and economic sector. However, the hypoxic environment&#xD;
      at altitude may induce altitude related adverse health effects (ARAHE), including hypoxemia,&#xD;
      symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS), reduces exercise capacity and increases the&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure, which is of particular relevance for patients with chronic&#xD;
      hypoxemic respiratory diseases including PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, advances in disease-targeted medical combination therapies renders PH to&#xD;
      the chronic disease groups with many patients surviving for many years with a relatively good&#xD;
      quality of live, exercise capacity and low symptom burden. However, data on ARAHE and the&#xD;
      exercise capacity of patients with pre-existing PH at altitude is scarce, so that current&#xD;
      expert-based guidelines discourage altitude travel for patients with PH. However, we&#xD;
      previously showed that the majority of stable PH-patients tolerates normobaric hypoxia or a&#xD;
      short trip to 2500m well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we aim to get profound clinical and pathophysiological insights into the&#xD;
      effects of the hypobaric hypoxic environment at altitude during an overnight stay up to 30&#xD;
      hours on the incidence of ARAHE needing oxygen therapy, exercise capacity, pulmonary&#xD;
      hemodynamics and sleep in patients with precapillary PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this new valuable data will provide a basis to better counsel PH-patients for&#xD;
      potential risk of altitude sojourns.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precapillary PH is defined by right heart catheterization as mean PAP (mPAP) &gt;20 mmHg,&#xD;
      pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ⩽15 mmHg along with a pulmonary vascular resistance&#xD;
      (PVR) ⩾3 wood units (WU). PH is classified into five major groups according to the clinical&#xD;
      presentation and response to vasodilator therapies. In the absence of predominant lung&#xD;
      disease, the major precapillary PH forms are pulmonary arterial and chronic thromboembolic PH&#xD;
      that are the main pulmonary vascular diseases and hereafter summarized as PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leading symptom in PH is dyspnoea on exertion, impaired exercise performance, daily&#xD;
      activity and quality of life.With progression of the disease, worsening hemodynamics may lead&#xD;
      to gas exchange disturbances associated with hypoxemia, particularly during exercise and&#xD;
      sleep. For a long time, the occurrence of PH was associated with a dismal prognosis&#xD;
      progressively leading to right heart failure and death within months to a few years. Although&#xD;
      PH is still incurable, recent therapeutic advances including medical or interventional&#xD;
      therapies have improved the life expectancy, physical performance and quality of life of&#xD;
      PH-patients and many patients seen in our daily practice wish to near-normally participate in&#xD;
      professional work and recreational activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, leisure time and professional activities at high altitude become increasingly&#xD;
      popular exposing millions of people to hypobaric hypoxia annually. The alpine tourism in&#xD;
      Europe and in other regions worldwide has a long lasting tradition and a relevant number of&#xD;
      people have chosen their resident above 1500m above sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Travel to high altitude and altitude-related adverse health effects (ARAHE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many Swiss villages and tourist resorts are located at altitudes between 1000 - 2500 m. In&#xD;
      America, Asia and Africa, even large settlements are located at these or even higher&#xD;
      altitudes and it is estimated that more than 50 million people permanently live above 2500 m.&#xD;
      Accordingly, worldwide, millions of people travel regularly to mountain areas for business or&#xD;
      recreation and expose themselves to hypobaric hypoxia during days to weeks or even longer. In&#xD;
      addition, traveling by airplane, which has become extremely popular, further increased the&#xD;
      number of people that are exposed to a hypoxic environment, as the minimally allowed cabin&#xD;
      pressure in commercial air travel is equivalent to 2430 m (8000 ft) of altitude and this is&#xD;
      often reached in intercontinental flights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, altitude exposure acutely induces hyperventilation by hypoxic&#xD;
      chemoreceptor stimulation. This mitigates hypoxemia but promotes sleep disturbing&#xD;
      high-altitude periodic breathing. About 50% of lowlanders ascending rapidly to &gt;3000 m suffer&#xD;
      from acute mountain sickness (AMS) causing headache, loss of appetite, weakness, fatigue and&#xD;
      general discomfort. If AMS is not treated by descent, oxygen or medication, it may progress&#xD;
      to life-threatening high altitude cerebral oedema. Furthermore, hypoxic pulmonary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction (HPV) leads to an elevated PAP at altitude. In 2-4% of mountaineers climbing&#xD;
      to 4559 m, excessive PAP-increase triggers high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), a&#xD;
      non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema associated with profound, potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      hypoxemia, which is treated by oxygen therapy and may be prevented by phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      type-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) administration or dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contribution of this project to the gap in knowledge of the effects of hypoxia in PH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trials will provide novel, robust data on the clinical and pathophysiological&#xD;
      effects of exposure to a hypoxic environment in patients with PAH/CTEPH. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate for the first time safety and tolerability of altitude exposure including an&#xD;
      overnight stay in PH-patients and the effect of supplemental oxygen to reverse ARAHE. Close&#xD;
      monitoring of patients including during exercise and sleep will provide insight into&#xD;
      hypoxia-induced physiological mechanisms and the time course of altitude adaptation. Due to&#xD;
      the special geographical location of Switzerland, we have the unique opportunity to study the&#xD;
      response to hypobaric hypoxia in patients with PH in excellently suitable and safe settings&#xD;
      in the nearby mountains and provide this important data to the scientific community worldwide&#xD;
      for the benefit of many PH-patients and their advising caregivers.&#xD;
