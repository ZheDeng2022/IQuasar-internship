    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the safety and tolerability of Pepinemab in combination with Avelumab&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that has progressed after first line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Phase 2 will assess the efficacy of this combination therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths with an&#xD;
      incidence expected to increase over the next decade.3 Despite modest advances in conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy, five-year survival remains dismal at 5-10%.4 Therefore, the development of&#xD;
      effective therapies for treating PDAC represents a significant unmet medical need. The near&#xD;
      95% 5 year mortality observed in PDAC is in part due to advanced disease stage at&#xD;
      presentation, and a propensity for recurrence following curative intent resection. As a&#xD;
      result, 5FU regimens (including FOLFIRINOX) or Gemcitabine based cytotoxic chemotherapies are&#xD;
      standard of care for patients who present with both resectable and unresectable disease.5,6&#xD;
      However, despite advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a majority of patients fail to respond&#xD;
      to first line therapy, and only around 10-15% of patients experience treatment response in&#xD;
      the second line setting, while a third of patients experience grade 2-3 toxicities from&#xD;
      second-line regimens.7,8 Thus, novel second-line treatments with improved toxicity profiles&#xD;
      compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy are a dire medical need and strongly supported by patient&#xD;
      advocates of this dismal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A body of clinical and preclinical work has shown that the profoundly immunosuppressive tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME) in PDAC remains a significant barrier to effective cytotoxic and&#xD;
      immune based therapies.9-11 Somewhat unique to PDAC, a dense fibrotic stroma is infiltrated&#xD;
      with bone-marrow derived myeloid cells of monocytic and granulocytic origin including tumor&#xD;
      associated macrophages (TAM) neutrophils (TAN) and immature suppressive myeloid progenitors&#xD;
      (MDSCs). Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells are highly immunosuppressive and the most prevalent&#xD;
      immune cells found in the TME of PDAC.12,13 These cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines&#xD;
      (Il6, Il10, Il4), secrete considerable amounts of arginase, and produce reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species, essentially shielding the tumor from effective T cell immunity.14 Thus, PDAC is an&#xD;
      immunologically &quot;cold&quot; tumor with minimal T cell adaptive response, which in part explains&#xD;
      the failure of immune-checkpoint blockade therapy to demonstrate efficacy in PDAC.15-17&#xD;
      Previous work has shown that small molecule chemokine inhibitors targeted at monocytic&#xD;
      myeloid cells (TAM precursors) can effectively prevent mobilization and trafficking of these&#xD;
      cells to the TME, and improve the standard of care chemotherapy in both preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical studies (NCT01413022, NCT02732938, NCT02345408).18 However, these successes in&#xD;
      reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment are accompanied by a compensatory increase in&#xD;
      immunosuppressive granulocytes (TANs and pmn-MDSCs), resulting in treatment resistance to&#xD;
      single subtype myeloid blockade.18 Based on this finding of myeloid compensation by TANs in&#xD;
      the absence of TAMs, and the potential therapeutic value in dual myeloid inhibition, new&#xD;
      therapies targeted at both myeloid subtypes represent a unique opportunity for exposing PDAC&#xD;
      to effective immune surveillance.13,19 Human data has previously correlated both SEMA4D and&#xD;
      Plexin B1 expression with nodal metastasis, invasiveness, and worse overall survival in&#xD;
      patients who underwent resection for PDAC.25 Analysis of resected tumor specimens demonstrate&#xD;
      an avid infiltrate of Semaphorin 4D cells (Figure 3B). Concomitantly, myeloid suppressor&#xD;
      cells within the PDAC TME demonstrate avid expression of Semaphorin 4D receptors, Plexin B1&#xD;
      and Plexin B2 (Figure 3B). Thus, Semaphorin 4D blockade represents a novel immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      strategy within the PDAC TME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is carried out in two stages. In Phase 1b, a maximum number of up to 44 patients is&#xD;
      accrued, but as few as 16 patients are needed and 1000 simulations of this model anticipates&#xD;
      between 24-29 patients. Phase 1b will continue until 16 evaluable patients accrue in a dose.&#xD;
      Once 16 patients have accrued to a particular dose based on the BOIN design, the MTD dose is&#xD;
      established as the dose yielding 30% or lower DLT rate. If there is 1 or less objective&#xD;
      responses among these 16 patients, the study will be stopped early for efficacy futility&#xD;
      according to Simon's two-stage design.1,2 If after evaluation of futility the trial is&#xD;
      meeting early markers of efficacy (at least 2/16 responses), an expansion cohort will begin.&#xD;
      Dose escalation will cease and all patients will subsequently enter the second stage of the&#xD;
      trial at the MTD dose defined by Phase 1b. In this expansion cohort, Phase 2, up to 24&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled. These patients will be followed for objective response rates by&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria and iRECIST. When combined with the 16 patients from Phase 1b, the Phase&#xD;
      2 cohort will total an evaluable sample size of 40. If there are 5 or more responses among&#xD;
      these 40 patients, we reject the null hypothesis and claim that the treatment is promising.&#xD;
      An objective response rate of 23% will afford a 10% type 1 error with 80% power to detect a&#xD;
      difference. The null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 0.10 or less, and the&#xD;
      alternative hypothesis is that the true response rate is 0.23 or greater. The design controls&#xD;
      the type I error rate at 0.1 and yields the power of 0.8.&#xD;
