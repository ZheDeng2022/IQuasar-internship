  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational cohort registry that aims to collect data on pulmonary&#xD;
      structure and function in healthy people and those with respiratory disease, using structural&#xD;
      and functional pulmonary 1H-MRI and hyperpolarized 129Xe-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures generated from MRI may include but are not limited to measures of regional&#xD;
      ventilation, pulmonary microarchitecture, and regional gas exchange. Additionally, one of the&#xD;
      goals of the registry is to facilitate the development of novel image analysis techniques&#xD;
      that have not yet been invented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be stored along with demographic data, clinical data, and pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing (PFT) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open registry. Eligible local and international investigators/institutions can&#xD;
      apply for access.&#xD;

        Eligible individuals with respiratory disease will be identified from various Respiratory&#xD;
        Medicine or subspecialty clinics at British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) or from&#xD;
        analogous clinics at St Paul's Hospital (SPH). Participants may be contacted using a First&#xD;
        Contact Letter, or permission to approach will be obtained by a member of their circle of&#xD;
        care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy participants will be recruited from family members of patients in the Division of&#xD;
        Respiratory Medicine at BCCH and SPH as well as from the community or other clinics using&#xD;
        flyers or a First Contact Letter.&#xD;
