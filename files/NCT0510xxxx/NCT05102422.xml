    <textblock>
      General anesthesia interferes with the whole cerebral cortex at different levels. The goal&#xD;
      was to investigate the impact of general anesthesia on different regions of the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex by recording the brain's electrophysiological activity using QEEG and BIS during&#xD;
      general anesthesia for 40 patients undergoing orthopedic surgeries under general anesthesia&#xD;
      to see whether our hypothesis, that there is a topographically-dependent impact of general&#xD;
      anesthesia on different regions of the cerebral cortex, is valid or not. The patients were&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2 groups of 20 patients to compare the effect on the brain function&#xD;
      monitoring (QEEG vs BIS) of the intravenous anesthesia (propofol) with the halogenated&#xD;
      anesthesia (sevoflurane). And finally, we compared the two brain function monitoring&#xD;
      techniques, BIS and QEEG.&#xD;

      After approval by the ethics committee, every patient signed a consent form to participate in&#xD;
      this observational prospective open-label randomized study. We identified potential&#xD;
      participants in the anesthesia pre-admission unit who presented to be seen by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist before their intervention. Details of eligibility criteria described later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the international 10-20 reference system, 4 silver cup electrodes were placed on&#xD;
      the left prefrontal (Fp1), parietal (P7), temporal (T7), and occipital (O1) points with the&#xD;
      vertex (Cz) as a common reference after an adequate preparation of each scalp skin location&#xD;
      using a micro-abrasive paste and degreasing using ethyl ether. The cup electrodes were placed&#xD;
      and fixed on the skin with adhesive paste . After a similar skin preparation, an adult&#xD;
      adhesive EKG surface electrode was secured to the patient's forehead as a cephalic ground&#xD;
      electrode. Thus, by using 6 electrodes, we obtain a 4 channels set-up (prefrontal Fp1-CZ,&#xD;
      parietal P7-Cz, temporal T7-Cz, and occipital O1-Cz) with a common vertex reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the six electrodes of the montage are respectively connected to one special Y adapter&#xD;
      including a double connection to be attached at the same time to the EEG amplifier, for the&#xD;
      QEEG recording, and to the A1000™ Aspect Medical System™ amplifier, for the BIS recording.&#xD;
      After the initial test of the electrode impedance (&lt;5000 Ω), this last one was automatically&#xD;
      checked all along the investigation to maintain the electrodes impedance below the same&#xD;
      threshold. Regarding the QEEG, the low- and the high-frequency filters were set at 0.5 and 30&#xD;
      Hertz (Hz), respectively. EEG five seconds long epochs were sampled every 30 seconds for&#xD;
      further analysis in the three respective domains (frequency, time, and power) in each EEG&#xD;
      channel. Concerning the BIS monitoring, the EEG low- and high-frequency filters were set&#xD;
      similarly to the QEEG whereas EEG sampling corresponds to 5-second segments of traces without&#xD;
      smoothing, every 30 seconds. Finally, the BIS and its ancillary parameters simultaneously&#xD;
      calculated in each channel, were extracted every 30 seconds. The selection of parameters for&#xD;
      the QEEG analysis included Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF), Median EEG Frequency (MEF), Burst&#xD;
      Suppression Ratio (BSR) and Total Spectral Power (TSP). Regarding the bispectral EEG&#xD;
      analysis, the only parameter was the BIS itself. Thus, each parameter value is obtained for&#xD;
      each channel during EEG and BIS sampling. Finally, for clinical monitoring, heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse oximetry (Sa02) were considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the standard clinical monitoring placement (ECG, non-invasive arterial pressure cuff&#xD;
      and ear/finger pulse oximetry device) and a peripheral venous catheter insertion connected to&#xD;
      an infusion line, the non-premedicated patients were preoxygenated with a facial mask with&#xD;
      100% oxygen. Capnography via nasal cannula were initially applied and monitored prior to the&#xD;
      anesthetic induction and replaced by the manual ventilation system when needed during the&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA) effect occurrence. First, every patient received an intravenous (iv)&#xD;
      bolus of 0,2 μg.kg-1 sufentanil. After that, in the group 1 the propofol (P) infusion was&#xD;
      started using target-controlled infusion (TCI) with a Total IntraVenous Anesthesia (TIVA)&#xD;
      pump (Schnider's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data set); targeting the&#xD;
      effect-concentration of 3µg.ml-1. From then on, the effect concentration was gradually&#xD;
      increased by 1µg.ml-1 every two to three minutes until loss of consciousness (LOC as loss of&#xD;
      verbal contact, spontaneous ventilation, corneal reflex, and ciliary reflex) occurred. At&#xD;
      this point the effect concentration level of propofol upon loss of consciousness (PROPLOC) is&#xD;
      recorded. At the same time, in group 2, sevoflurane (S) is started at one minimal alveolar&#xD;
      concentration (2% in 50% oxygen) during mask assisted ventilation. Then, in a similar manner&#xD;
      to group 1, the S concentration is gradually incremented by 2% until the LOC when the mask&#xD;
      ventilation became fully assisted. The corresponding S effect-concentration (SEVOLOC) was&#xD;
      also noted. Subsequently, the LOC confirmed, after an interval of 1 to 2 minutes, a first&#xD;
      laryngoscopy was performed to test the possibility of intubation of the patients. In case of&#xD;
      adequate intubation conditions (no physical or hemodynamical reaction to laryngoscopy and/or&#xD;
      normal airway compliance), 0.1 mg.kg-1 of iv cisatracurium was given to prepare definitive&#xD;
      intubation. When the patients did not encounter correct intubation conditions (first&#xD;
      laryngoscopy failure), the P effect-concentration and the S end-tidal concentration were&#xD;
      respectively increased of 1µg.ml-1 and 1% until the test laryngoscope was successful. After&#xD;
      intravenous cisatracurium administration, manually assisted ventilation was conducted for 3&#xD;
      minutes in a way to have the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) between&#xD;
      32-35 mmHg. Intubation followed and intermittent positive pressure ventilation was used&#xD;
      maintaining the same values of etCO2. The corresponding drug concentrations of propofol at&#xD;
      intubation (PROPIntub) and sevoflurane at intubation (SEVOIntub) were recorded. From the&#xD;
      moment the patient is mechanically ventilated, the effect concentration of propofol and the&#xD;
      end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane are reduced to 3 to 4 µg.ml-1 and one minimal alveolar&#xD;
      concentration (MAC) respectively while awaiting the surgical incision. Then, during the&#xD;
      following 15-minute period of data collection no external stimuli were permitted on or around&#xD;
      the patient. This pharmacological steady-state period was considered for the comparative&#xD;
      topographic analysis between the different electrode categories regarding the general&#xD;
      anesthesia effect on the brain. Therefore, the intraoperative period extends from the&#xD;
      surgical incision to the end of the surgery. During this period, it is left to the discretion&#xD;
      of the anesthetist to add either an iv bolus of sufentanil (0.1 μg.kg-1) and/or an iv bolus&#xD;
      of cisatracurium (0.1 mg.kg-1) only if necessary, in the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
      practitioner. To note, the parametric values of the QEEG and BIS were not considered to guide&#xD;
      the anesthesia throughout the investigation. The postoperative period begins after the end of&#xD;
      surgery when the anesthesia is stopped and lasts until the patient is awake and calm, ready&#xD;
      to leave the operating room after extubation.&#xD;
