  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center randomized controlled trial of a new medical device (Bocaliner™) that&#xD;
      has been designed to improve the treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cancer treatment. The goal of this study is to determine tolerance and response to&#xD;
      the use of Bocaliner™ as reported by patients with chemotherapy and/or radiation&#xD;
      therapy-induced oral mucositis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be referred by their treating physicians to the designated study healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Patients will have been diagnosed with oral mucositis and will be receiving oral&#xD;
      topical medication for oral pain as well as other problems related to oral mucositis. All&#xD;
      subjects will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, subjects will undergo an oral examination and for determination of the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) Oral Toxicity Scale and will then complete a General Oral Mucositis&#xD;
      Assessment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will continue standard therapy with&#xD;
      oral topical agents for oral mucositis. Group 2 will additionally receive Bocaliner™ devices&#xD;
      along with cleaning materials with instructions about device use and cleaning. Subjects in&#xD;
      the Group 2 will use Bocaliner™ with each topical treatment for oral mucositis up to 5 times&#xD;
      per day for 2 weeks or shorter if not tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to the Group 1 will continue the original therapy for oral mucositis,&#xD;
      including oral topical treatments and general hygiene measures. Participants that are&#xD;
      randomized to the Group 2 will place Bocaliner™ inside of their mouth for 5 minutes and fill&#xD;
      out the Initial Bocaliner™ Questionnaire. They will then continue all original therapy for&#xD;
      oral mucositis, including oral topical treatments and general hygiene, and will place the&#xD;
      Bocaliner™ device inside of their mouth and hold it in place up to 40 minutes as instructed&#xD;
      after each topical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be contacted by the Research Coordinator via phone call at 5 and 10 days&#xD;
      after the initial enrollment and invited to answer the questions from the Modified PROMS&#xD;
      Questionnaire at the hospital. Alternatively, the questionnaire can be provided via email, or&#xD;
      the questions can be answered via phone call, if preferred by a patient. Subjects in Group 2&#xD;
      will describe their experience of using Bocaliner™ through the Bocaliner™ Follow-up&#xD;
      Questionnaire. All subjects will give a detailed description of their current medication&#xD;
      usage for oral mucositis. Participants from both groups will return to their practitioners&#xD;
      after 14 days and undergo a general oral examination. The WHO Oral Toxicity Scale will be&#xD;
      used to assess the grade of oral mucositis. Subjects will also complete the Modified PROMS&#xD;
      Questionnaire at days 5, 10, and 14 to understand the impact of standard treatment vs&#xD;
      Bocaliner™ on symptoms related to oral mucositis.&#xD;
