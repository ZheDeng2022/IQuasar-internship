      Multi-omics approach was used to identify patterns of serological biomarkers to diagnose&#xD;
      NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a blood-based assay to diagnose&#xD;
      NAFLD by collecting blood sample from healthy patients undergoing routine screening&#xD;
      ultrasonography and from patients recently diagnosed with NAFLD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Accurate diagnosis of NAFLD combined with effective treatment improves survival and quality&#xD;
      of life. Multi-omics approach was used to identify patterns of serological biomarkers to&#xD;
      diagnose NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a blood-based assay for&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis of NAFLD. The study will collect blood sample from healthy patients&#xD;
      undergoing routine screening ultrasonography and from patients recently diagnosed with NAFLD.&#xD;
      A blood-based test for NAFLD could offer an accurate, convenient, and patient-friendly&#xD;
      screening option for current and future generations, and, in doing so, could save and improve&#xD;
      lives by increasing adherence and accurate diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of patients in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20-85 who have been recently diagnosed with (or strong clinical suspicion for)&#xD;
      NAFLD. Blood samples must be collected before any treatment has been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20-85 undergoing routine screening ultrasonography for NAFLD as part of their&#xD;
      regular medical check-ups. Blood samples must be collected before ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20-85 who have been recently diagnosed with (or strong clinical suspicion for)&#xD;
      NASH, an extremely advanced form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis with inflammation and hepatocyte injury. Blood samples must be collected&#xD;
      before any treatment has been initiated.&#xD;
