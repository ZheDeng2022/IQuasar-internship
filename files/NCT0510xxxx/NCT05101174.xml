  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project is a single-blinded, double-arm, 6-month randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      aiming to assess the effects of a integrated intervention program on neurocognitive function&#xD;
      with respect to event-related potential in adults aged 45-70 years. Additionally, the&#xD;
      potential impacts of apolipoprotein epsilon-4 alleles and the brain-derived neurotrophic&#xD;
      factor will be explored.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While aging has been adversely associated with the alternations of cognitive function,&#xD;
      several lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, meditation, and social interaction) have been&#xD;
      suggested reducing the age-related cognitive decline. Notably, most prior findings were based&#xD;
      on research focused on single lifestyle factor. Accordingly, the effects of an intervention&#xD;
      program combining multiple exercise modalities and lifestyle factors on neurocognitive&#xD;
      function, as well as components of event-related potential (ERP), in middle-aged and older&#xD;
      adults have not been thoroughly examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current randomized clinical trial is designed to examine (1) whether a 6-month integrated&#xD;
      intervention program (IIP) including multiple exercise modalities, meditation, and social&#xD;
      interaction could benefit neurocognitive function (i.e., inhibition, shifting and attention)&#xD;
      in middle-aged and older adults; (2) whether components of ERP will be influenced by the&#xD;
      integrated intervention program; and (3) whether apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes (ApoE&#xD;
      e3/e4, ApoE e4/e4, ApoE e2/e2, ApoE e2/e3, ApoE e2/e4, and ApoE e3/e3), physical fitness, and&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will influence the effects of integrated&#xD;
      intervention program on neurocognitive function and components of ERPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a stratified permuted block randomization algorithm to assign 120 eligible&#xD;
      participants into the IIP group or the active control (AC) group in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be stratified by (1) age at study entry (â‰¤ 55 years vs. &gt; 55&#xD;
      years), and Alzheimer's disease risk [High-risk status (ApoE e3/e4 and ApoE e4/e4) vs.&#xD;
      Low-risk status (ApoE e2/e2, ApoE e2/e3, ApoE e2/e4, and ApoE e3/e3)], in order to ensure&#xD;
      equal allocation to both groups, based on these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IIP includes two 90-minutes sessions involving multiple exercise modalities (i.e.,&#xD;
      aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, coordinative exercise, and flexibility) and two&#xD;
      lifestyle factors (i.e., meditation and social interaction). The AC group will be invited to&#xD;
      attend two 90-minutes online educational course per week to eliminate the experimental&#xD;
      expectation effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurocognitive function (e.g., inhibition, shifting, and attention performances), the&#xD;
      components of ERP, ApoE genotype, physical fitness, and BDNF will be assessed at the baseline&#xD;
      (Baseline-Assessment) and at the end of the 6-month intervention (Post-Assessment).&#xD;
