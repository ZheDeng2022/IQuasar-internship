  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) on&#xD;
      natural oscillatory frequency of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and working&#xD;
      memory in early-course schizophrenia (EC-SCZ). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will&#xD;
      be used to evoke oscillatory activity, and EEG will record the responses of EC-SCZ&#xD;
      participants. A working memory task will also be incorporated in order to determine how DLPFC&#xD;
      natural frequency (NF) is related to working memory performance. iTBS (active or sham) will&#xD;
      be administered, then the oscillatory activity of DLPFC and working memory performance will&#xD;
      be reassessed. The overarching goal is to determine whether iTBS can acutely enhance the&#xD;
      oscillatory activity of the DLPFC and to evaluate the relationship between changes in the&#xD;
      DLPFC and working memory performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish whether, by acutely enhancing&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) oscillatory deficits experimentally, there is a&#xD;
      corresponding improvement in working memory (WM) function in early-course schizophrenia&#xD;
      (EC-SCZ) patients. To achieve this goal, the investigators will perform TMS/EEG assessments&#xD;
      of DLPFC and related oscillatory parameters and evaluate WM ability with the AX-Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Task (AX-CPT) before and after two theta burst stimulation (TBS) sessions&#xD;
      (intermittent (iTBS) and sham TBS of DLPFC) in 75 EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Establish the acute effects of active vs. sham TBS on DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF of&#xD;
      EC-SCZ patients. The investigators will iTBS to enhance DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF, as&#xD;
      assessed with TMS/EEG, in EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: TBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF&#xD;
      from pre to post-TBS, such that DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF will increase following iTBS&#xD;
      (but not sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess the impact of acute active vs. sham TBS on WM performance in EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the acute impact of active vs. sham iTBS on WM performance in&#xD;
      EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: iTBS condition (active vs sham) will moderate the change in WM from pre- to post-TBS,&#xD;
      such that AX-CPT performance will improve following iTBS (but not sham).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Examine the relationship between TBS-related changes in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF&#xD;
      and WM performance in EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: iTBS-induced increase in DLPFC oscillatory activity/NF will predict better post-iTBS WM&#xD;
      performance in EC-SCZ patients.&#xD;

    <description>iTBS is a brief stimulation of a part of the brain with a magnetic field that passes through the scalp and skull safely. It is FDA-approved as a treatment for psychological conditions including depression; however, this device is not approved for the treatment of adults with patients with schizophrenia. This research study is using iTBS off label in SCZ patients to examine research questions.</description>

    <intervention_name>sham intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Sham TBS over the left DLPFC will be performed using a Cool-B65 A/P TMS coil, designed to support blinded clinical trials. Specifically, when the coil is placed in the &quot;P&quot; position (i.e. the &quot;placebo&quot; position), only a very small amount of current is induced in tissue, thus preventing the activation of cortical neurons.</description>
