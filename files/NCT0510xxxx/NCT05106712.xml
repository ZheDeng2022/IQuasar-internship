      This randomized double-blinded-controlled clinical trial consists of two protocols as follow:&#xD;
      protocol 1: evaluation of the therapeutic effects of Vitamin D3 supplement when given alone&#xD;
      and in combination with an ovulation-inducing agent (e.g., Clomiphene citrate or Letrozole)&#xD;
      on ovarian functional status and hormonal and metabolic features of PCOS-Vitamin D-deficient&#xD;
      infertile Saudi women; and protocol 2: evaluation of the effectiveness of Vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplement versus placebo on the clinical pregnancy rate, fertilization implantation rate,&#xD;
      live birth rate, and other outcome parameters following in-vitro fertilization (IVF)&#xD;
      application in these PCOS-Vitamin D-deficient infertile patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinological and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders that affect women at their reproductive age and leading to female infertility&#xD;
      worldwide. PCOS exhibits multiple etio-pathogenic properties in which the genetic,&#xD;
      nutritional, behavioral and environmental factors are intertwined to its complexity and&#xD;
      heterogeneity. At that respect, impaired vitamin D status (hypo-vitaminosis D) has recently&#xD;
      gained an immense interest as a leading cause in development of PCOS and the prevalence of&#xD;
      its underlying hormonal/metabolic abnormalities and ovarian malfunctions. Additionally, serum&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D are considered as potential predictors of successful Assisted&#xD;
      Reproductive technology (ART) outcomes in infertile women with PCOS or with unexplained&#xD;
      infertility. Most importantly, it is hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation improve the&#xD;
      hormonal and metabolic profile and reproduction activity in treatment naïve PCOS and vitamin&#xD;
      D deficient patient women; and also improve the pregnancy rate and oocyte and embryos'&#xD;
      quality following in vitro fertilization (IVF) in these PCOS-vitamin D deficient infertile&#xD;
      women. In despite, evidence regarding the therapeutic value of vitamin D supplementation for&#xD;
      treatment of PCOS and improving IVF outcomes in PCOS-vitamin D-deficient infertile Saudi&#xD;
      women population remain scarce. Therefore, the present study is designed to achieve the&#xD;
      following two objectives: 1) measurement of the therapeutic effects of Vitamin D3 supplement&#xD;
      alone and in combination with an ovulation-inducing agent (e.g., Clomiphene citrate or&#xD;
      Letrozole) on the ovarian functional status and the hormonal and metabolic features of&#xD;
      PCOS-Vitamin D-deficient infertile Saudi women; and 2) measurement of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Vitamin D3 supplement versus placebo on the clinical pregnancy rate, fertilization&#xD;
      implantation rate, live birth rate, and other outcome parameters following in-vitro&#xD;
      fertilization (IVF) application in PCOS-Vitamin D-deficient infertile patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the 1st objective, the investigators plan to recruit about 450 eligible patients&#xD;
      accounting for 10% loss to follow-up and regard a significance level at 0.05 and a power of&#xD;
      80%. The eligible participants will be randomized into 5 groups (1:1:1:1:1) to receive the&#xD;
      following therapies: Group 1: monotherapy with oral vitamin D3 capsules (4000IU/day) for&#xD;
      around 12 weeks; Group 2: monotherapy with oral Clomiphene citrate pills using its respective&#xD;
      standard Stair-Step Dosage protocol (i.e., 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg, once daily for 5 days,&#xD;
      in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycle, respectively); Group 3: monotherapy with oral Letrozole pills&#xD;
      using its respective standard Stair-Step Dosage protocol (i.e., 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 7.5 mg,&#xD;
      once daily for 5 days, in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycle, respectively); Group 4: dual therapy&#xD;
      with Vitamin D3 plus Clomiphene citrate by using their above mentioned dosage regimen; and&#xD;
      Group 5: dual therapy with Vitamin D3 plus Letrozole by using their above mentioned dosage&#xD;
      regimen. At the end of the intervention protocol, post-treatment improvements in menstrual&#xD;
      regularity, ovulation induction rate, and ovarian volumes will be considered as the primary&#xD;
      outcome measures, while the baseline (weak 0) and post-treatment (WK12) levels of fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose levels, insulin resistance (IR) indices, and serum levels of 25(OH)D, calcium,&#xD;
      sex-hormones, reproductive mediators and adipocytokines, and lipid profile levels will be&#xD;
      measured in the different groups and used as the secondary outcomes measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the 2nd objective, the investigators plan to recruit about 180 eligible&#xD;
      PCOS-vitamin D-deficient infertile women scheduled for IVF accounting for 10% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up and regard 0.05 significance level and 80% power. The eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups (1:1) to receive daily oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D3 (Group 1)&#xD;
      or placebo (Group 2) for around 12 weeks until the day of triggering. All IVF procedures will&#xD;
      be carried out according to the routine methods applied in ART centers. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include post-IVF clinical pregnancy, fertilization implantation, and live birth&#xD;
      rates in both groups. Post-treatment changes in insulin resistance indices and serum levels&#xD;
      of 25(OH)D, calcium, sex-hormones, reproductive mediators and adipocytokines, and lipid&#xD;
      profile levels will also be measured as the secondary outcomes measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both protocols, the diagnosis of PCOS is according to the revised Rotterdam PCOS consensus&#xD;
      criteria as the presence of at least 2 of the following 3 diagnostic criteria: oligo- and(or)&#xD;
      anovulation defined as a history of delayed menstrual cycle &gt;35 days in length or ≤9&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding episodes per year, clinical and(or) biochemical evidence of&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism, and features of polycystic ovaries detected by ultrasound (≥12 follicles of&#xD;
      2-9 mm in size found in at least one ovary and/or having ovarian volume more than 10 cm3).&#xD;
      The eligible infertile women will be considered &quot;treatment naïve PCOS&quot; if they have PCOS and&#xD;
      they had no taken any prior anti-PCOS medication; and they will be considered &quot;vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient&quot; if they have fasting serum 25(OH)D ≤20 ng/mL according to The Endocrine Society&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guidelines.&#xD;
