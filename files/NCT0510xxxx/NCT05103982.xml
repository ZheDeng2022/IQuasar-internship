      Twenty women with infertility living in Saskatchewan will be recruited and will be emailed&#xD;
      six weekly 10-minute videos, each providing instructions on a new psychological technique&#xD;
      that is aimed at addressing the emotional and interpersonal challenges of infertility.&#xD;
      Fertility-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and anxious symptoms will be measured&#xD;
      before and after the program. Outcomes will also be measured weekly for three weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention. Feedback about how to improve the program will also be collected.&#xD;
