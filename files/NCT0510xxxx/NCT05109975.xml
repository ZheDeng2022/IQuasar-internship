  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The purpose of this study in Part 1, Dose&#xD;
      Escalation Part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D) of Debio 0123 as monotherapy with repeated dosing in adults with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors that recurred or progressed after prior therapy and/or for whom no standard therapy of&#xD;
      proven benefit is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose in Part 2, Expansion Part of this study, is to characterize the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Debio 0123 when administered as monotherapy at the RP2D determined during the&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Part 1 and to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of Debio 0123 when&#xD;
      administered as monotherapy in participants with specific solid tumor types that recurred or&#xD;
      progressed following prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
