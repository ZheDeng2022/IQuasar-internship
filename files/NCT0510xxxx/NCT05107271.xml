  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project is essential to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with&#xD;
      Chronic Liver Disease (CLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact has been felt due to direct risk of COVID infection in self, or in caregivers,&#xD;
      lack of access to services during lockdown, interruptions in transplant listing and waitlist&#xD;
      mortality. Briefly, the following points will be focused during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Long haul COVID-19 related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impact on health and delay in interventions or drug therapy due to interruption of&#xD;
           physical outpatient services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact on emergency admissions due to refractory ascites, new decompensation, variceal&#xD;
           bleeding etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impact on delayed transplant listing and waitlist mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Impact on post-transplant patients with lack of access to drug monitoring/ physical OPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Impact on delay in interventions due to hepatobiliary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Effects of COVID-19 infection, vaccination (single dose, two doses) and no vaccination&#xD;
           and protective antibody levels in patients with chronic liver disease and&#xD;
           post-transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Determination of dose protocol and need for booster vaccination in patients with CLD and&#xD;
           post liver transplant recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
           syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a devastating global pandemic, with&#xD;
           179,686,071confirmed COVID-19 cases, which include 3,899,172 deaths reported by the&#xD;
           World Health Organization1 as of June 25, 2021. As of June 23, 2021, 2,624,733,776 doses&#xD;
           of vaccine have been administered globally. COVID-19 has been reported as an air- and&#xD;
           surface-borne contagious disease with features of viral pneumonia (fever, cough,&#xD;
           lymphopenia, prothrombotic tendency, ground glass opacities on chest radiology) and&#xD;
           hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, alterations in liver chemistries have been reported in patients with and&#xD;
           without liver disease, with some reports of increasing severity, complication, and new&#xD;
           decompensation, while others refute this possibility. Liver chemistry changes are more&#xD;
           likely in those with severe disease and those who have received multiple therapies,&#xD;
           requiring high flow oxygen or invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term prospective follow-up studies on persistent symptoms, lung function, physical,&#xD;
           and psychological problems of discharged patients with cirrhosis, liver failure or liver&#xD;
           transplant recipients are urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We require predictive models of severity of disease and assess the impact of the&#xD;
           COVID-19 pandemic on the health of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), access to&#xD;
           care, specialty interventions like endoscopy, and transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, the association between liver chemistries, need for invasive ventilation&#xD;
           and COVID-19-associated hospital deaths remains controversial and despite availability&#xD;
           of breakthrough vaccines, the pandemic is likely to continue claiming more lives.7 Given&#xD;
           the heterogenous clinical presentation, the spectrum of liver involvement varies from&#xD;
           altered liver chemistry in patients without underlying liver disease to progressive&#xD;
           decompensation in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differential access to COVID-19 care may affect outcomes in patients with CLD. Access to&#xD;
           care in India may be affected, for example, by age, region of origin, gender, economic&#xD;
           status, disability, homelessness, language, digital accessibility, and social factors&#xD;
           influencing attitudes to modern medicine. Although our institute has deployed&#xD;
           multidisciplinary telemedicine clinics to assess physical and mental health symptoms and&#xD;
           to conduct appropriate investigations by calling patients for physical consultation,&#xD;
           there has been a barrier to access to care and interventions over the course of the&#xD;
           COVID-19 pandemic in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have suffered increased waitlist mortality due to reduction in the access to&#xD;
           affordable transplant and redistribution of priority resources to the COVID-19 effort.&#xD;
           Patients who are liver transplant (LT) recipients have also suffered from lack of access&#xD;
           to follow up due to logistic concerns and travel restrictions. The incidence of COVID-19&#xD;
           infection and outcomes in this subgroup is still unknown. This requires data and policy&#xD;
           making at the National level based on serosurveys and vaccination success in our CLD&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with chronic liver disease who have suffered from COVID-19 need access to&#xD;
           rehabilitation services, with an integrated, multidisciplinary service, based on local&#xD;
           need and resources. A range of specialists should be available, especially for expertise&#xD;
           in treating fatigue and respiratory symptoms (including breathlessness); additional&#xD;
           expertise may be sourced depending on the age and symptoms of the person. The incidence&#xD;
           of post COVID-19 fungal sepsis in patients of CLD and LT recipients is another point of&#xD;
           concern, and data regarding this secondary effect in our patient cohort is still&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A major gap in delivery of care is the disruption of the seamless referral pathways&#xD;
           between primary care and tertiary level centres. Due to the digital divide between urban&#xD;
           and rural sectors, the access to routine services like endoscopy, preventive health care&#xD;
           checks, rehabilitation services, transplantation services, endoscopy and interventional&#xD;
           radiology procedures and mental health care in our patient cohort has been noted but not&#xD;
           systematically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lastly, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 infection may suffer persistent symptoms,&#xD;
           and we are facing an emerging problem that has severely affect individuals with chronic&#xD;
           liver disease, hepatobiliary cancers, persons with co morbidities, and resulted in a&#xD;
           large cohort of individuals with long haul COVID symptoms. The effect of COVID-19 on our&#xD;
           health care systems and society will be noted for years to come, and a systemic study on&#xD;
           the burden of the problem needs to be undertaken to formulate appropriate health care&#xD;
           policy.&#xD;
