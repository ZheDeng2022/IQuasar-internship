      The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of treatment with the&#xD;
      selective post-synaptic a1-adrenergic blocker terazosin on serial 123I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT in a&#xD;
      population of subjects with defined pre-motor PD risks (i.e., RBD and at least one among&#xD;
      hyposmia, constipation, depression and color vision abnormality) and abnormal 123I-MIBG&#xD;
      uptake. Imaging changes will be correlated to the presence and severity of motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms of PD, measured by validated clinical scales and cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      function tests. The rate of RBD clinical phenoconversion to PD will be estimated and compared&#xD;
      to available data in the literature.&#xD;
