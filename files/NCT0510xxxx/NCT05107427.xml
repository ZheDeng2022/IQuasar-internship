  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, switch maintenance study of MRx0518 and Avelumab in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) whose disease did not&#xD;
      progress after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy and who have&#xD;
      residual measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version&#xD;
      1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Up to 30 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will be treated with IV Avelumab every 2 weeks and MRx0518&#xD;
      daily during the treatment period. Patients will receive the study treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression (PD), patient withdrawal, or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inclusion in the study must occur ≥4 but &lt;10 weeks after the date of last dose of first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Post-chemotherapy confirmatory scan(s) for eligibility must be performed within&#xD;
      28 days prior to inclusion in the study to assess response status following first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients with ongoing partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) (per RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1) and who have measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1) are eligible for the study.&#xD;
