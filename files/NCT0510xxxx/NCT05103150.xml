    <textblock>
      High-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) does not usually allow the visualization of&#xD;
      duodenal villous patterns and may be inaccurate for assessing coeliac disease (CD). In&#xD;
      addition, HD-WLE findings depend on CD severity. The lesser the disease severity, the higher&#xD;
      possibility of showing a normal HD-WLE appearance. Thus, sampling routine duodenal biopsies&#xD;
      have been suggested. However, this is time-consuming, expensive, and maybe excessive in&#xD;
      low-risk groups. Sampling routine duodenal biopsies could also be unsuccessful, obtaining&#xD;
      normal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel endoscopic techniques have played an exciting role in increasing the accuracy of&#xD;
      macroscopic evaluation of duodenal villous patterns. There have been described retrospective&#xD;
      and prospective studies using chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography, water immersion, confocal laser endomicroscopy, high-resolution magnification&#xD;
      endoscopy, capsule endoscopy, and I-scan technology. However, results are disjunct, with no&#xD;
      consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iSCAN optical enhancementTM (OE) System (PENTAX Medical, Tokyo, Japan) virtual&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy has been developed to improve the blood vessels' visibility, ducts of the&#xD;
      glands, and surface structures in addition to the traditional iSCAN functions.&#xD;
      High-definition optical magnification (HD-OM) endoscopes have been developed and can combine&#xD;
      HD imaging with OM to produce detailed images with a magnification of up to 136X. This&#xD;
      imaging technique facilitates the evaluation of the superficial vascular aspects of the&#xD;
      mucosa, enabling the identification of early signs of inflammation or lesions not previously&#xD;
      seen with conventional endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data have demonstrated that magnification endoscopy has superior diagnostic&#xD;
      sensitivity in detecting villous atrophy compared to HD-WLE, being efficiently handled by all&#xD;
      endoscopists. On another side, virtual chromoendoscopy has shown disjunct results across the&#xD;
      literature. To the best of the knowledge of the authorship, there is no prospective study&#xD;
      that has assessed the accuracy of combining HD-OM with i-Scan OE for evaluation of duodenal&#xD;
      villous patterns in the context of CD suspicion. Combining both techniques can also guide&#xD;
      better duodenal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study pursues to better characterize duodenal mucosa through OE with HD-OM in&#xD;
      gluten-free diet (GFD) naïve patients with CD suspicion to correlate these findings with&#xD;
      histology. As a second aim, to compare diagnostic accuracy between HD-WLE and HD-OM with OE&#xD;
      using histology as the gold standard in detecting villous abnormalities in CD.&#xD;

    <description>Histology findings will be recorded and graded according to Marsh's classification as revised by Oberhuber et al (Marsh 0, Marsh 1, Marsh 2, Marsh 3a, Marsh 3b, and Marsh 3c). HD-WLE and HD-OM findings will be correlated with Marsh's classification. Finally, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of HD-WLE and HD-OM will be calculated, considering Marsh's classification as gold standard.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the duodenal mucosa with HD-WLE (EG-29i10 gastroscope and EPKi7010 video processor). The endoscopy images will be seen on a 27inch, flat panel, high-definition LCD monitor (Radiance™ ultraSC-WU27-G1520 model) by one endoscopist, randomly assigned via esophagogastroduodenoscopy.&#xD;
There were used the following standard endoscopic findings were: a) &quot;scalloping&quot; or dented aspect of the duodenal folds; b) submucosal vascular pattern; c) &quot;mosaicism&quot; or micronodular look of the mucosa; d) grooves and fissurations of the mucosa.</description>

    <intervention_name>HD-WLE plus I-Scan optical enhancement (OE) virtual chromoendoscopy with High-definition optical magnification (HD-OM)</intervention_name>
    <description>Evaluation of the duodenal mucosa through upper endoscopy with the OE System (EPK-i7010 HD Video Processor and MagniView™ EG-2990Zi Video Gastroscope) with intravenous sedation in a standardized manner. This technique involves using a distal black rubber hood (OE-A58; Pentax) at the tip of the endoscope, to fix the distance between the tip of the endoscope and the gastric mucosa at 2 mm. The OE System will be used in mode one and mode two without HD-OM to obtain an overview of the duodenal surface and identify any changes in the mucosa, then HD-OM will be implemented.&#xD;
There were used OE criteria as previously validated by Cammarota et al: brightness, Ave/peak, blue, red, surface, contrast, and tone enhancement.</description>
