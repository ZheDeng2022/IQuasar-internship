  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysphagia is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in stroke survivors. Electrical&#xD;
      stimulation is often included as part of the treatment plan for dysphagia, and can be applied&#xD;
      at a sensory or motor level intensity. However, evidence to support these different modes of&#xD;
      stimulation is lacking. This study compared the effectiveness of sensory and motor level&#xD;
      stimulation on post-stroke dysphagia.&#xD;

      Objective: Dysphagia is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in stroke survivors.&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation is often included as part of the treatment plan for dysphagia, and can&#xD;
      be applied at a sensory or motor level intensity. However, evidence to support sensory versus&#xD;
      motor stimulation is lacking. This study compares the effect of sensory and motor stimulation&#xD;
      on post-stroke dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Inpatient rehabilitation facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants (50-75 years of age) who had dysphagia caused by a stroke within 6&#xD;
      months prior to enrollment were included. Participants were excluded if they had a&#xD;
      contraindication for electrical stimulation, previous stroke, psychiatric disorder,&#xD;
      contraindications for MBS, or pre-stroke swallowing disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Each patient received ten, 45-minute anterior neck sensory or motor level&#xD;
      electrical stimulation sessions in addition to standard speech therapy. Motor stimulation was&#xD;
      administered as a stimulus intensity sufficient to produce muscle contractions. Sensory&#xD;
      stimulation was defined as the threshold when the patient feels a tingling sensation on their&#xD;
      skin (approximately 4-5mA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: Swallow FIM, National Outcome Measurement System (NOMS), Dysphagia&#xD;
      Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS), and change in modified diet.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-80 who were admitted for symptoms associated with acute ischemic CVA within the&#xD;
             first month and confirmed by MRI. Diagnosis of dysphagia will be obtained by bedside&#xD;
             swallowing exam and MBS/FEES studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who have contraindications for electrical stimulation (malignancy,&#xD;
             DVT/thrombophlebitis, hemorrhagic conditions, pregnancy, pacemaker or other electrical&#xD;
             hardware), known premorbid swallowing disorders, GERD, dementia or psychiatric&#xD;
             disorder, bilateral cerebral involvement, contraindications for FEES/MBS (infectious&#xD;
             disease such as HIV, HCV, HBV, nasal obstruction, decompensated heart disease, risk of&#xD;
             bleeding such as active ulcers, allergy to contrast).&#xD;
