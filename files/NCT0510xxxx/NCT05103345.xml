      Objectives：To characterize safety, tolerability, MTD and RP2D, PK, biological distribution,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral injection of SGN1 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale:The mechanism of action for SGN1 is based on the fact that most tumors are&#xD;
      methionine dependent. SGN1 is designed to be used as a tumor therapeutic bacterium that can&#xD;
      preferentially replicate and accumulate in tumors and starve them of essential amino acids by&#xD;
      delivering the oncolytic enzyme L-Methioninase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:Patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC), who&#xD;
      have disease progression after receiving at least one standard systemic treatment in the&#xD;
      past, or who are intolerant to or unable to receive the curative or life-prolonging standard&#xD;
      of care available therapies. Patients should have target lesions suitable for intratumoral&#xD;
      injection of SGN1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methionine starvation can powerfully modulate DNA methylation, cell cycle transition,&#xD;
      polyamines and antioxidant synthesis of tumor cells, in contrast to normal ones.&#xD;
      L-Methioninase is a pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the γ-elimination&#xD;
      reaction of L-methionine to methanethiol, α-ketobutyrate and ammonia . Absolute-dependency on&#xD;
      exogenous supply of L-methionine, not homocysteine, for growth and proliferation of tumors is&#xD;
      the pivotal biochemical criterion for various human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGN1 is a genetically modified strain of Salmonella enterica, serotype typhimurium&#xD;
      (VNP20009-M) that expresses L-Methioninase. The attenuated live bacterium has been&#xD;
      investigated in China for utility in treating advanced solid tumors. The mechanism of action&#xD;
      for SGN1 is based on the fact that most tumors are methionine dependent. SGN1 is designed to&#xD;
      be used as a tumor therapeutic bacterium that can preferentially replicate and accumulate in&#xD;
      tumors and starve them of essential amino acids by delivering the oncolytic enzyme&#xD;
      L-Methioninase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 3 parts: dose escalation study, MTD expansion study and&#xD;
      specific tumor type expansion study. All parts of the trial will consist of a screening&#xD;
      period of up to 28 days, a treatment period and a safety follow-up period and a long-term&#xD;
      survival follow-up period.The standard 3+3 dose escalation algorithm will be applied to&#xD;
      explore dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) in up to 5 sequential cohorts with 3-6 patients and&#xD;
      identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD).Upon completion of all three 28-day observation&#xD;
      periods, if there are no (0) DLTs over 28 days as determined by the SMC, the 3 participants&#xD;
      may enter the repeated dosing period to receive SGN1 in 28-days cycles (once weekly for 3&#xD;
      weeks followed by 1-week rest). Simultaneously, 3 new participants may be enrolled in the&#xD;
      next higher dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the safety and efficacy of SGN1, the MTD identified in Part 1 will be&#xD;
      expanded with additional 10 to 12 subjects with advanced solid tumors. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive SGN1 once every week for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest in 28-day cycles for up to 4&#xD;
      months, withdrawal of consent, disease progression or occurrence of any intolerable toxicity,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an SGN1 dose for further investigation is established, enrollment of several expansion&#xD;
      cohorts will be opened to determine the safety and efficacy of SGN1 in specific tumor types&#xD;
      with potential efficacy signal observed in the previous dose escalation and MTD expansion&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
