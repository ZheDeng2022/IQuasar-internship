      Great expectations to control the pandemic are placed in vaccines against COVID-19.&#xD;
      Currently, the four COVID-19 vaccines approved in the European Union. We have designed the&#xD;
      study assessing the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer after vaccination cycle the BNT162b2&#xD;
      vaccine in several time points relating these results to the COVID-19 history and severity of&#xD;
      symptoms during the disease and after the first and second vaccine dose&#xD;

      The study includes healthy, unselected volunteers from the staff of Antoni Jurasz University&#xD;
      Hospital No.1 in Bydgoszcz and students of Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University.&#xD;
      To meet the inclusion criteria patients will have to be vaccinated with two doses of the&#xD;
      BNT162b2 vaccine. The assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer at several time&#xD;
      points in each participant. Fresh serum samples were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the&#xD;
      Siemens Atellica system (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Results of SARS-CoV-2 IgG&#xD;
      were given as U/ml, whereby the cut-off for positivity was defined as ≥1.0 U/ml.&#xD;
