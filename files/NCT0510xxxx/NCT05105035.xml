  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effect of 14 days of twice daily doses of ARV-1801 or placebo in&#xD;
      combination with meropenem or ceftazidime in patients hospitalized with melioidosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARV-1801 is an oral dosage form and loading dose regimen of sodium fusidate. Sodium fusidate&#xD;
      is a member of the fusidane class of antibiotics. Recent evidence demonstrates meaningful&#xD;
      activity against multiple biothreat agents, including the intracellular pathogen B.&#xD;
      pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis. Once melioidosis is suspected clinically, treatment&#xD;
      typically involves intravenous antibiotics such as ceftazidime or meropenem during an initial&#xD;
      &quot;intensive&quot; phase (typically 2 weeks) and oral antibiotics such as co trimoxazole during a&#xD;
      more chronic &quot;eradication&quot; phase (typically 12 weeks). Nevertheless, mortality can still&#xD;
      exceed 40% in some regions, with most deaths occurring early during the eradication phase of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ARV-1801 administered for 14 days in&#xD;
      conjunction with the current standard of care (meropenem or ceftazidime) against placebo in&#xD;
      conjunction with the current standard of care. Day 1 dosing will include two doses of 1500mg&#xD;
      of ARV-1801 or placebo administered 12 hours apart. Days 2-14 will include 600 mg doses of&#xD;
      ARV-1801 or placebo administered every 12 hours.&#xD;
