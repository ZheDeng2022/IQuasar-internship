      This phase I trial tests the feasibility and safety of genetically modified cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes in controlling infections caused by adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV),&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), JC virus (JCV), or COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients with cancer.&#xD;
      Viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, and therapeutic options for these infections are often complicated by&#xD;
      associated toxicities. Genetically modified cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are designed to&#xD;
      kill a specific virus that can cause infections. Depending on which virus a patient is&#xD;
      infected with (ADV, BKV, CMV, JCV, or COVID-19), the CTLs will be designed to specifically&#xD;
      attack that virus. Giving genetically modified CTLs may help to control the infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering genetically engineered&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed cancer patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering genetically engineered&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific CTL lines in immunosuppressed cancer&#xD;
      patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients. III. To obtain data&#xD;
      about relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive virus-specific CTLs intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients with&#xD;
      partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive up to 8 additional&#xD;
      infusions of virus-specific CTL at least 2 weeks between each infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up yearly for 15 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt; or = 18 years of age or older.&#xD;

          -  For BKV, ADV or CMV infections: Prior myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplant using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or&#xD;
             single or double umbilical cord blood. For JC virus and COVID19 infection: no prior&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For BKV infection, patients need to have polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For ADV infection, patients need to have PCR positive for ADV in peripheral blood&#xD;
