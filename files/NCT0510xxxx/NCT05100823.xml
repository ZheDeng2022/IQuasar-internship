  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis, an inherited autosomal recessive disease, arises from mutations in the CFTR&#xD;
      gene. For intronic mutations affecting splicing events, oligonucleotides therapy has the&#xD;
      potential to restore the production of the full length CFTR protein. Recent scientific&#xD;
      research has demonstrated the potential of this approach to restore full length mRNA CFTR in&#xD;
      in vitro human airway cells. The study aims to validate the therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
      oligonucleotide blockers (ONB) that target splicing defects associated to splicing variants&#xD;
      in epithelia obtained from patients with Cystic Fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with various CFTR genotypes. The assessment of ONB (named&#xD;
      ONB-CFTR) will be performed using an air-liquid interface model of airway epithelium,&#xD;
      developed from nasal cells of patients, without or with a combination of existing CFTR&#xD;
      modulators, depending on the patient' genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also aim to build a local biobank of rectal organoids from patients (only&#xD;
      from Montpellier, France) carrying rare CFTR disease-causing variants.&#xD;
