      A prospective, multicenter, single-arm objective performance criteria trial to investigate&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study plans to recruit 164 patients with acute intracranial large-vessel occlusion&#xD;
      within 24 hours time window. The Primary endpoint is the instant recanalization rate of&#xD;
      target vessel after operation. Secondary efficacy endpionts will include: 1) immediate&#xD;
      recanalization rate of the first pass of aspiration; 2) the recanalization time of the target&#xD;
      vessel blood flow; 3) the improvement of the postoperative NIHSS score; 4) the ratio of good&#xD;
      neurological function (mRS 0-2 points) at 90 days; 5) the success rate of device; 6) the&#xD;
      success rate of operation; 7) The proportion of rescue therapy. Safety endpionts will&#xD;
      include: 1) the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours after&#xD;
      operation; 2) all-cause death and stroke-related mortality at 90 days; 3) stroke recurrence&#xD;
      rate within 90 days after operation; 4) surgery-related complications; 5) adverse events; 6)&#xD;
      serious adverse events; 7) Device defection rate&#xD;
