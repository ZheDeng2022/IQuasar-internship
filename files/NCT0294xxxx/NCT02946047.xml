    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Ixazomib in HIV&#xD;
      infected patients who are on a stable regimen of ART that suppresses HIV replication. A&#xD;
      secondary goal is to determine the effect of ixazomib on the size of the HIV reservoir.&#xD;
