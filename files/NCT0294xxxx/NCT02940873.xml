    <textblock>
      Insulin treatment for type 1 diabetes inevitably carries risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood&#xD;
      sugar) which can be severe enough to cause coma, seizure, even death. Being unable to feel&#xD;
      when blood glucose is falling, a condition called impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH),&#xD;
      increases risk of severe hypoglycaemia 6-fold. IAH can be reversed and risk of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia reduced when people are taught how to adjust their insulin around their&#xD;
      life-styles through structured education but problematic hypoglycaemia may persist. Many&#xD;
      people with apparently intractable IAH and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia have thoughts about&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia that form barriers to their ability to avoid hypoglycaemia. They cannot benefit&#xD;
      from conventional treatments to reduce hypoglycaemia. The investigators developed the&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia Awareness Restoration Programme for people with type 1 diabetes and problematic&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia despite otherwise optimised self-care (HARPdoc), a novel intervention that&#xD;
      combines revision of knowledge about hypoglycaemia avoidance with psychological therapies&#xD;
      that directly address unhelpful health beliefs about hypoglycaemia. HARPdoc is delivered over&#xD;
      six weeks, by diabetes educators to groups of 6 people. In a pilot study, severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia was greatly reduced in 23 people with very longstanding IAH and recurrent&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a group-randomised controlled trial of HARPdoc, comparing it to an&#xD;
      established educational intervention (Blood Glucose Awareness Training, BGAT) which has also&#xD;
      been shown to reduce severe hypoglycaemia. 96 people with type 1 diabetes and problematic&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia persisting despite otherwise optimised insulin self-management will be&#xD;
      recruited into groups which will be randomised to receive either HARPdoc or BGAT, in 4&#xD;
      centres. The investigators will measure severe hypoglycaemia over two years following&#xD;
      courses; hypoglycaemia risk and experience; overall diabetes control and quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a group randomised trial of HARPdoc, a novel intervention for adults with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1DM) and treatment-resistant impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) and severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (SH), against Blood Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT), an existing educational&#xD;
      programme that has been shown to reduce severe hypoglycaemia rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that HARPdoc, because of its inclusion of psychological therapies&#xD;
      addressing cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia prevention, will be superior to BGAT training&#xD;
      in reducing, and maintaining the reduction in, severe hypoglycaemia and in durably restoring&#xD;
      awareness of hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes whose problematic hypoglycaemia has&#xD;
      persisted despite otherwise optimised diabetes self-management strategies. That optimised&#xD;
      self-management is defined as a minimum of having attended a structured education programme&#xD;
      in flexible intensive insulin therapy and be using its principles as a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HARPdoc and BGAT are both &quot;talking therapies&quot; of education plus, in the case of HARPdoc, a&#xD;
      specific hypoglycaemia-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), delivered to small&#xD;
      groups (4 to 8 participants at a time) by established diabetes educators trained and&#xD;
      supported to deliver each intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educators (nurses and dietitians) will be trained by the study clinical psychologists using&#xD;
      existing curricula, to deliver EITHER HARPdoc OR BGAT. Educators delivering HARPdoc (2 per&#xD;
      course), with its novel elements of hypoglycaemia specific cognitive behavioural therapy,&#xD;
      will also receive weekly supervision from the study clinical psychologist, during the&#xD;
      delivery of patient courses. BGAT educators (1 per course) will be able to seek support on an&#xD;
      ad hoc basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both BGAT and HARPdoc have their own course curricula and teaching aids. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited, will document their hypoglycaemia experience over a period of up to 12 months, and&#xD;
      then be randomly allocated to a group in which they will either receive HARPdoc or BGAT .&#xD;
      Follow up with be for two years with a planned analysis at 12 months. Documentation of SH&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout using statistical process control and control mapping, to allow&#xD;
      early termination of the study if one intervention is clearly outperforming the other, as&#xD;
      assessed by an independent data monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the diabetes outpatient facilities and clinical research&#xD;
      facilities of participating centres. Potential participants will be invited by their usual&#xD;
      diabetes care teams to consider the study. Those expressing interest will be invited to an&#xD;
      initial screening visit (visit 1), where the study will be explained and the person's&#xD;
      characteristics assessed against the eligibility criteria. Those meeting the criteria by&#xD;
      virtue of having impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (Gold and Clarke scores of 4 or more);&#xD;
      and severe hypoglycaemia in the previous 2 years despite having completed, and using the&#xD;
      principles of, structured education in flexible insulin with either multiple daily insulin&#xD;
      injections or insulin pump therapy, monitored by self-monitored blood glucose tests a day at&#xD;
      least four times a day will be given the opportunity to review the patient information&#xD;
      literature and consent to, in writing, participation in the study. They will receive a unique&#xD;
      study identification code and commenced on formal documentation of their hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      experience, using short forms to document any event of severe hypoglycaemia experienced (form&#xD;
      A) and reporting retrospectively all hypoglycaemia in the previous month (form B). These&#xD;
      forms will be completed throughout the study and participants will be asked for permission to&#xD;
      contact them on a monthly basis if there are any missing data. Blood will be taken for&#xD;
      measurement locally of the glycated haemoglobin, a reflection of diabetes control, and for&#xD;
      potential contributors to high hypoglycaemia risk (liver, kidney and thyroid function,&#xD;
      measures of adrenal and pituitary function, screens for coeliac disease and malabsorption and&#xD;
      level of anti-insulin antibodies), if these data are not available in the patient records in&#xD;
      the last year. The participant's glucose meter will be downloaded and the results of their&#xD;
      over the preceding two weeks recorded. Each participant will then be offered two sets of&#xD;
      dates for upcoming courses, but will only undertake one. Once two courses have been filled,&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to receive either HARPdoc or BGAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second visit (baseline) will be made not more than 3 months before the participant's&#xD;
      course. Blood will be taken for central measurement of HbA1c. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire booklet that enquires about attitudes to, worry about and behaviours around&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia (Attitudes to Awareness (A2A) and Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II (HFS-11) scores);&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HADS) and Problem&#xD;
      Areas in Diabetes (PAID); quality of life (Diabetes Specific Quality of Life (DSQoL), Short&#xD;
      Form 12 (SF12) and the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ5-D) and self-management&#xD;
      skills (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) self-management). This booklet has been&#xD;
      reviewed and approved by our user group. This visit may be combined with visit one if consent&#xD;
      has already been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HARPdoc includes 4 full day attendances and 2 one-to-one contacts between the participant and&#xD;
      the educator, via telephone or face-to-face as the patient chooses. In weeks 1-3,&#xD;
      participants meet weekly as a group. These are full day sessions, as in current DAFNE and the&#xD;
      Bournemouth Type 1 Diabetes Education Programme (BERTIE) courses. They cover the&#xD;
      pathophysiology, presentation, detection and treatment of hypoglycaemia and IAH; use&#xD;
      motivational interviewing to support behaviour change and encourage small changes, with&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to address unhelpful cognitions that may be barriers to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia avoidance. In weeks 4 and 5, participants try out their new skills/strategies,&#xD;
      with two scheduled individual face-to-face and telephone educator support. Week 6 is a final&#xD;
      group session, focusing on relapse prevention and support for significant others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BGAT curriculum will be re-planned to be delivered in 4 group sessions spread over 6&#xD;
      weeks to allow participants to be booked inot both courses at one time prior to&#xD;
      randomisation. The curriculum will not however be extended to occupy full day sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will, with participant permission, be video taped, for assessment of fidelity of&#xD;
      course delivery to the curricula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance of at least the first 3 group sessions plus, for HARPdoc participants and the 1:1&#xD;
      sessions, will be considered adherence to the intervention/ control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits, at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, are in line with clinical practice,&#xD;
      recognizing that these patients are high service users. They will last about 2 hours and be&#xD;
      conducted in the groups. Participants will have contact details (telephones with recorded&#xD;
      answering and next-working day reply; e-mail addresses) for their educators through which&#xD;
      they can seek advice at will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled follow-up in groups for re-inforcement of the programme principles and for data&#xD;
      collection (locally measured HbA1c, documentation of hypoglycaemia experience and awareness&#xD;
      scores) at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The 12 and 24 month visits will include completion of&#xD;
      the full questionnaire pack as described for visit 2. Additional non-study visits can be&#xD;
      scheduled if required in the opinion of the participant and/or the educator. Likewise,&#xD;
      participants will be free to seek advice from their educator at any time by telephone or e&#xD;
      mail. Participants will be made aware that the forms on which they document their&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia experience each month will only be reviewed anonymously and they need to seek&#xD;
      advice if they require it, for example, after a hypoglycaemia event, as is routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each visit a one month window on either side of the due date is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four participants (12 from each group) will, be invited to participate in a substudy&#xD;
      in which they wear a real-time continuous glucose monitor for up to one week at baseline and&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned analysis comparing the outcomes of the two interventions is planned when all&#xD;
      participants have completed 12 months of follow-up, with a final analysis at 2 years.&#xD;
      Throughout the data on severe hypoglycaemia will be collected, blinded as to course, by the&#xD;
      Implementation Science group, and entered into control maps, to allow inspection of rates of&#xD;
      severe hypoglycaemia in individual patients and in each intervention in real time. These data&#xD;
      will be reviewed at 6 monthly intervals by the Data Monitoring Committee, which has the&#xD;
      ability to interrupt the RCT if rates of severe hypoglycaemia are increasing in either group&#xD;
      or one intervention is clearly superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The described randomisation procedure is to prevent &quot;researcher bias&quot; with researchers&#xD;
      preferentially selecting higher risk patients for HARPdoc over BGAT. To minimise&#xD;
      contamination, different educators will be trained in and will deliver each intervention. A&#xD;
      further safeguard against contamination is that both HARPdoc and BGAT patient courses are&#xD;
      curriculum driven and the unique elements of HARPdoc are not included in the BGAT curriculum.&#xD;
      The fidelity of delivery of each course will be monitored from video-taped sessions .&#xD;
      Recordings will be coded using a check list of behaviour change techniques and items from&#xD;
      relevant measures such as the Behavioural Change Counselling Index (BECCI) and the&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who wish to withdraw from the trial will remain under services which routinely&#xD;
      collect primary end-point data (severe hypoglycaemia rate, HbA1c, Gold score). Unless refused&#xD;
      permission, we will collect case-record data +/- 3 months of due dates. This will allow us to&#xD;
      conduct both an intention-to-treat and a per protocol analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target is to recruit 96 participants, 6 (4 - 8) participants per group course into at&#xD;
      least 8 HARPdoc courses and 8 BGAT courses), delivered in 4 centres. The study targets adults&#xD;
      (people aged 18 and above) with type 1 diabetes who have IAH and severe hypoglycaemia after&#xD;
      optimised medical therapy, which may include, or have included, use of insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      and/or continuous glucose monitoring. This will allow detection of superiority of HARPdoc&#xD;
      over BGAT at the 5% significance level with 90% power, The power calculation was based on&#xD;
      data from our pilot of HARPdoc, and published data on BGAT, looking at rates of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia. Conservative estimates were used, allowing for 2 episodes per patient per year&#xD;
      in the present study from HARPdoc and 5.7 episodes per patient per year from for BGAT, have&#xD;
      allowing 20% drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified by study centres and enhanced by referrals from neighbouring&#xD;
      diabetes centres and pathways in place for the follow up of people with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      making use of emergency services for severe hypoglycaemia, Potential participants will also&#xD;
      be able to self-refer, and will be offered a review by the clinical team of the participating&#xD;
      centre before deciding with the patient whether the trial might be suitable for them. People&#xD;
      experiencing severe hypoglycaemia who do not fulfil eligibility criteria for the trial or who&#xD;
      chose not to participate will be referred into the centre's usual treatment pathway for&#xD;
      problematic hypoglycaemia, with the option to be included in a HARPdoc course outside the&#xD;
      trial. The exclusion criteria list conditions that led to exclusion from the qualitative&#xD;
      research programme on which the HARPdoc curriculum is based.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  type 1 diabetes(1) for at least four years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experiencing problematic hypoglycaemia(2) for at least one year, despite structured&#xD;
             education(3) in flexible insulin therapy and on-going optimal conventional care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of an appropriate (in the investigator's estimation) multiple daily&#xD;
             insulin injection regimen or CSII (insulin pump) therapy(4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to comply with study design, including willingness and ability to perform&#xD;
             SMBG up to 4 times a day routinely&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Type 1 diabetes will be defined clinically, usually based on starting insulin for&#xD;
                  diabetes within one year of diagnosis and/or a history of diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Having Gold and Clarke scores of 4 or more and having had ≥ 1 episode/s of severe&#xD;
                  hypoglycaemia [events requiring assistance of another person to actively&#xD;
                  administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective action, because of&#xD;
                  impaired cognitive function, and which may include episodes that were not treated&#xD;
                  by another but included loss of consciousness or seizure] in the last 2 years and&#xD;
                  at least one since starting current treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Structured education requires a programme with a curriculum, taught by trained&#xD;
                  educators, which covers insulin dose adjustment around carbohydrate counting and&#xD;
                  lifestyle issues, and a physiological 24 hr basal insulin replacement separate&#xD;
                  from meal insulin replacement) or as judged equivalent by the local investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Participant should be using dose adjustment around carbohydrate counting and&#xD;
                  lifestyle issues, and an appropriate, separate basal replacement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with type 2 diabetes, or type 1 diabetes and good hypoglycaemia awareness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with type 1 diabetes and impaired hypoglycaemia awareness who have not attended&#xD;
             structured education in flexible intensive insulin therapy, such as DAFNE, BERTIE, the&#xD;
             Joslin course (DO IT) or as judged equivalent by the local investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People not fluent in spoken English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with severe mental disorders (schizophrenia, manic depression, depressive&#xD;
             psychosis, active suicidal ideation, learning disability, dementia, alcohol and&#xD;
             substance dependence, personality disorders, eating disorder)(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment independent of hypoglycaemia (e.g. clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             dementia(7), advanced Parkinson's disease, neurodegenerative disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existence of co-morbid medical disease other than diabetes mellitus contributing to&#xD;
             hypoglycaemia (e.g. inadequately treated Addison's disease or growth hormone&#xD;
             deficiency or hypothyroidism; untreated coeliac disease; uncontrolled gastroparesis;&#xD;
             end stage renal disease), which must have been checked since the onset of problematic&#xD;
             hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (5) Participants who continue to experience severe hypoglycaemia episodes 6 months&#xD;
             after they have stopped breastfeeding may be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (6) &quot;Manic depression&quot; covers conditions such as bi-polar disorder. Pre-existing&#xD;
             depression that is on-going but, in the opinion of the investigator, stable and not a&#xD;
             barrier to potential benefit from BGAT or HAPRdoc is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Exclusion of individuals with a personality disorder includes those with current or&#xD;
             previous clinical diagnosis AND current or previous mental health care for that&#xD;
             disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
             (7) Dementia would cover either an existing diagnosis or a Mini Mental State&#xD;
             Examination [MMSE]) score of less than 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have expressed interest in the study, have consented, and have impaired&#xD;
        awareness of hypoglycaemia but do not otherwise meet the inclusion criteria due to low&#xD;
        number of SH episodes may be included in the HARPdoc educational course as 'fillers' if&#xD;
        space is available. These patients will not be randomised, nor entered into the study&#xD;
        database. However, they may be asked to complete the open baseline, 12 and 24-month data&#xD;
        collection if they agree to do so.&#xD;
