      Objective: The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of TENS (transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation) therapy with those of the conventional radiofrequency and pulse&#xD;
      radiofrequency therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single-blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: An outpatient physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: The study included 60 patients who presented with a complaint of chronic low back&#xD;
      pain prevailing at least for 3 months and who were diagnosed with facet joint syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The patients were randomized into 3 groups so that Group 1 (n: 20) patients&#xD;
      would receive conventional radiofrequency therapy, Group 2 (n: 20) patients conventional TENS&#xD;
      procedure for 15 days and Group 3 (n: 20) patients pulse radiofrequency therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main measures: The patients were assessed before treatment, and at month 1 and 6 for pain&#xD;
      (visual analogue scale), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), lumbar movements (hand-floor&#xD;
      distance), functional status (20-meter walking times, 6-min walking distances), quality of&#xD;
      life (Short Form 36), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory).&#xD;

      Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included patients who presented to the outpatient clinics of these units with the&#xD;
      complaint of chronic low back pain prevailing for at least 3 months that had not responded to&#xD;
      previous medical treatment. Medical history were obtained from the patients and their low&#xD;
      back and lower extremity musculoskeletal systems and neurologic systems were examined.&#xD;
      Patients were assessed using their two-way lumbar X-rays taken within the last 1 year and&#xD;
      lumbar magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. After all these examinations and assessments, the&#xD;
      patients who were excluded from the study consisted of those who had a coagulation disorder,&#xD;
      a history of malignity, a mental disorder, a psychiatric disorder, pregnancy, prior low back&#xD;
      surgery, a history of TENS or radiofrequency procedure at their low back region within the&#xD;
      last 1 year, an advanced (grade 3-4) spondylolisthesis defect in their lumbar vertebrae, an&#xD;
      extruded and sequestrated disk hernia or a spinal narrow canal in their magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, a cauda equine syndrome or advanced paresis, an examination finding suggesting&#xD;
      radiculopathy with pain noticeably extending under the knee, a history of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease, an advanced cardiac deficiency and a diagnosis of pulmonary disease. In&#xD;
      the light of the medical history, examination findings and other tests, the patients who were&#xD;
      thought to have facet joint syndrome and who did not meet any of the exclusion criteria above&#xD;
      were informed about the study and treatment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who agreed to receive the treatment based on the information given to them were&#xD;
      administered a diagnostic test dose at the operating room of the Algology Division to confirm&#xD;
      whether the present pain was associated with the facet syndrome meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. This diagnostic procedure involved injection of 0.4 cc of bupivacaine under&#xD;
      fluoroscopy to the median of dorsal ramus that enable innervation of lumbar facet joints. The&#xD;
      patients whose pain receded more than 50% after this administration of a test dose and who&#xD;
      met the other two inclusion criteria, visual analogue scale pain level &gt;3 and 18-75 years of&#xD;
      age, were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study were informed both in writing and verbally about the&#xD;
      purpose and length of the study, the way of implementing it, and possible side effects and&#xD;
      problems that can arise. Patients signed the &quot;subject informed consent form&quot; and local ethics&#xD;
      committee approval was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, single-blind study. While the patients&#xD;
      had knowledge of what the treatment was, the physician who made the assessments before and&#xD;
      after the treatment did not know what treatment the patient received. The randomization&#xD;
      template obtained from www. randomizer.org was used to randomize the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into three groups according to the randomization template. Group 1&#xD;
      patients (n: 20) were administered the conventional radiofrequency procedure, Group 2&#xD;
      patients (n: 20) the TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) procedure and Group 3&#xD;
      patients (n: 20) the pulse radiofrequency procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of safety and drug administration, vascular access was established in the&#xD;
      operating room of the Algology Division in both the patients who would undergo a diagnostic&#xD;
      test and those who would receive the actual treatments, the conventional and pulse&#xD;
      radiofrequency therapies. The patients were laid in supine position; their procedural sites&#xD;
      were sterilized and covered with a sterile cover. All procedures were carried out under&#xD;
      fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the conventional radiofrequency method applied to Group 1 patients, the targeted facet&#xD;
      joints were marked while the fluoroscope was in antero-posterior position. During this&#xD;
      marking, the fluoroscope was directed towards cephal or caudal so that at whatever level the&#xD;
      median ramus block was to be involved the endplate of that vertebra would become a straight&#xD;
      line. Afterwards, the fluoroscope was brought to oblique 45 degrees on facets L4-5 and L5-S1&#xD;
      and 30 degrees on the upper facets. The connection point of the superior articular protrusion&#xD;
      was marked on the fluoroscope using the transverse process and the intervention was applied&#xD;
      with a 22G, 10-cm radiofrequency cannula with 0.5 cm active tip in a way that bone contact&#xD;
      was established through the tunneled vision technique. The intervention was completed after&#xD;
      the conventional radiofrequency procedure was applied at four levels (L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 and&#xD;
      L5-S1) at 80 degrees for 1 minute at each level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 patients were administered TENS therapy 30 minutes a day for 15 days at the&#xD;
      outpatient physiotherapy unit of the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Department. The TENS&#xD;
      therapy was applied in the form of conventional TENS subtype with 80-100 Hz frequency by&#xD;
      placing four electrodes on the region where the pain was most intense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pulse radiofrequency method applied to Group 3 patients, the targeted facet joints&#xD;
      were marked while the fluoroscope was in antero-posterior position. During this marking, the&#xD;
      fluoroscope was directed towards cephal or caudal so that at whatever level the median ramus&#xD;
      block was to be involved the endplate of that vertebra would become a straight line.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the fluoroscope was given an oblique position 45 degrees at L4-5 and L5-S1levels&#xD;
      and 30 degrees at the upper levels. The connection point of the vertebral corpus was marked&#xD;
      on the fluoroscope using the transverse process and the intervention was applied with a 22G,&#xD;
      10-cm radiofrequency cannula with 0.5 cm active tip in a way that bone contact was&#xD;
      established through the tunneled vision technique. The intervention was completed after a&#xD;
      45-V pulse radiofrequency procedure was applied at 4 levels (L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1)&#xD;
      at 42oC for 4 minutes at each level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, all 3 groups of patients were given a home exercise program in the form of&#xD;
      lumbar range of motion and lumbar isometric exercises except extensional and rotational&#xD;
      movements to be performed at least twice a week throughout the follow-up period. The patients&#xD;
      were phoned every week to encourage them to comply with the exercise program.&#xD;
