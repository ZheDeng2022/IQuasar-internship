  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the main objective of this pilot and feasibility study is to develop the&#xD;
      infrastructure that will be used in a larger study that would be proposed at a later date.&#xD;
      Hence, this study has two parts. Part A: To establish contacts, collaboration, and networking&#xD;
      to develop the infrastructure needed to conduct the study, Part B: To recruit eight subjects&#xD;
      (4 subjects randomly assigned to either a control group or intervention group) from a&#xD;
      low-income community in East Lubbock who are willing and able to participate in this pilot&#xD;
      study. The research team's central hypothesis is that the disease burden of obesity and&#xD;
      related co-morbidities could be attenuated within low-income communities by providing&#xD;
      incentive-based free access to a safe and convenient exercise facility and earned credit to&#xD;
      subsidize healthful food cost. The research team's secondary hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      anticipated decrease in disease burden will make the incentivized changes in lifestyle&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;

      Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successfully passing the screening criteria, name, address, contact information, body&#xD;
      weight (in light outdoor clothes and without shoes), height (without shoes), body fat&#xD;
      percentage, BMI, waist circumference, age, and sex will be noted. Only the questions about&#xD;
      medical history that are pertinent to determining the eligibility (as described above), will&#xD;
      be asked. There will be a two week lead-in time period during which grocery store receipts&#xD;
      will be collected and the participants will wear a Fitbit Flex pedometer at all times. This&#xD;
      is to track food purchasing and consumption patterns and a method of determining a baseline&#xD;
      activity level, respectively. The participants will meet with the researcher at the beginning&#xD;
      of this two week period in order to give the participants the Fitbit Flexes. These receipts&#xD;
      will be collected at the end of the two week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this lead-in, the participants will begin their four week testing period. Body weight&#xD;
      and body fat will be determined on day 0 by using a bioimpedance measurement scale. This is a&#xD;
      scale like the bathroom scale on which a person stands and holds onto two handles connected&#xD;
      to the base by cables, while the machine reads body weight and body fat content (by passing a&#xD;
      mild electric current through the body, similar to an electrocardiogram). Body weight and fat&#xD;
      content will be determined once per week, for 4 weeks. The last body weight and body fat&#xD;
      measurements will be at the end of the 4 week walking period. The four week testing period&#xD;
      will include meeting at an agreed upon community center location and time convenient for both&#xD;
      the participant and the researcher. During these meetings, the participants will engage in&#xD;
      indoor walking under the supervision of the researcher. This is to ensure accurate walking&#xD;
      distance recording and also to monitor the participants for any potential adverse events. The&#xD;
      participants will have the option of walking as long or short as they please, so long that it&#xD;
      is less than 20 miles per week. This is to protect the participants from exhaustion or&#xD;
      overexertion. This process will continue for four weeks. At the end of each week, grocery&#xD;
      store receipts will be collected to reflect food purchasing and consumption. The Fitbit Flex&#xD;
      will remain worn by the participants at all times in order to track activity changes, outside&#xD;
      of the supervised walking. At the end of this four week testing period, the total number of&#xD;
      miles will be calculated (maximum of 80 miles). For every mile walked, the participants will&#xD;
      earn dollar points. The money earned by each participant will be split between their utility&#xD;
      payments and healthy food at a local grocery store. The research team will provide a list of&#xD;
      healthful foods to the participants. It will include healthful foods such as fruits (and 100%&#xD;
      juices), vegetables (and 100% juices), non-fat or low fat dairy products, low-fat whole grain&#xD;
      products (bread, bagels, breakfast cereals, muffins), and uncooked fish and chicken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During week 1, nutrition information will be provided. This will consist of brief nutrition&#xD;
      information sessions and a grocery store tour to assist with selection of foods available&#xD;
      with program coupons. The tour will be aimed at helping the subjects identify healthier food&#xD;
      choices and to suggest alternatives and options to high-fat and/or low nutrient-dense foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this four week testing period, there will be a secondary four week follow-up period.&#xD;
      This will be the same as the four week testing period, minus the supervised walking and&#xD;
      earning of money based on miles walked. This follow-up period is purposed to record food&#xD;
      purchasing and consumption patterns along with everyday activity after their intervention.&#xD;
      The participants will remain wearing their Fitbit Flexes and turning in their grocery store&#xD;
      receipts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will have the same two week lead-in period in order to get a baseline food&#xD;
      and activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the four week testing period for the control group, the participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to participate in supervised walking. However, the participants will not be&#xD;
      earning money based on miles walked. The number of miles will be recorded, but strictly to be&#xD;
      compared against the testing period of the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four week follow-up time period will be the same as the intervention group, with one&#xD;
      exception. The control group will have the option to walk under supervision during their&#xD;
      follow-up period in order to earn money under the same set of rules as the intervention group&#xD;
      during their testing period. This opportunity to earn money is an effort to encourage&#xD;
      participation and keep participants in the control group interested. The participants of the&#xD;
      control group during the follow-up period will; however, continue to wear their Fitbit Flexes&#xD;
      at all times and grocery store receipts will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Procedural Information Throughout the study for both groups, the participants will&#xD;
      be paid a small amount for their participation in the study. The payment will be identical&#xD;
      for both the control and intervention groups. This is just a payment for the participants'&#xD;
      time invested in the study. However, the participants will not receive their weekly&#xD;
      participation money unless they turn in their receipts. This is to encourage the turning in&#xD;
      of receipts for our study records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prior arrangement with designated grocery stores, foods that could be purchased with&#xD;
      the coupons or gift cards will be predetermined. The value, types of food, quantity&#xD;
      purchased, and the user name will be recorded for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the four week follow-up period for both groups, there will be an exit interview&#xD;
      for all participants of the study. This interview will ask simple questions such as what the&#xD;
      participants liked the most about the study, what they liked least, what we could improve&#xD;
      upon, how they prefer to receive their earned money, and what most motivated them to walk.&#xD;
      This interview will be one-on-one with the researcher and results will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text message reminders will be given in order to remind the participants of any upcoming&#xD;
      appointments related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study for both groups, the participants will turn in their Fitbit&#xD;
      Flexes to the researcher. The conclusion of this study for both groups will be the ten week&#xD;
      mark, starting with the first day of the lead-in period and concluded at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
