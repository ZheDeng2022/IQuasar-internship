  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study of safety and efficacy of Quisinostat in combination&#xD;
      with Paclitaxel + Carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer, primarily peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma, resistant to&#xD;
      first line platinum and Paclitaxel based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 5-8 Russian and Belarusian sites. A maximum of 32 patients&#xD;
      with metastatic or locally advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, primarily peritoneal or&#xD;
      fallopian tube carcinoma, resistant to first line platinum and Paclitaxel based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be consisted of screening period of 3 weeks before the beginning of&#xD;
      Quisinostat administration, followed by the Investigational product treatment period of&#xD;
      approximately 18 weeks (up to 6 cycles and 21 days for each cycle), a safety follow-up of 4&#xD;
      weeks after the last administration of the study therapy and post-treatment follow-up aimed&#xD;
      at determination of progression-free survival, time to disease progression and overall&#xD;
      survival rate in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed after 10 patients are evaluated for efficacy. If 1 or&#xD;
      less from 10 patients have an objective response (OR), the study will be stopped early for&#xD;
      futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      come to the site to start taking Quisinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive Quisinostat in the dose of 12 mg on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of&#xD;
      each treatment cycle. Administration of Paclitaxel and Carboplatin will be performed on Day 7&#xD;
      of each cycle. The cycles will be repeated once every 3 weeks (21 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of severe carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction, it is permitted to switch to&#xD;
      Cisplatin (75mg/m2) as alternative to Carboplatin in the subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of study therapy and then patients will continue to be&#xD;
      followed-up for ORR, PFS, TTP, OS assessment in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Post-treatment follow up will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of treatment visit will take place in case of treatment's completion within 6 cycles&#xD;
           of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early discontinuation visit will take place in case of the early study termination&#xD;
           (before completion of 6 cycles) . The patients will be asked to make an Early&#xD;
           discontinuation visit not later than in 4 weeks after administration of the last&#xD;
           Investigational product dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After End of treatment or Early Discontinuation visit the patient will continue to be&#xD;
      followed- for up to 1 year from the start of study treatment or until ICRR-determined&#xD;
      progression (or death) (whichever is earlier). This will include tumor assessments every 6&#xD;
      weeks (±7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following disease progression, the Investigator will contact the patients or their relatives&#xD;
      not less than once in 3 months in order to collect information concerning the patient's&#xD;
      survival status and, cause of death. This will occur up to 1 year after initial start of&#xD;
      treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
