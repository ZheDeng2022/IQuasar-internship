  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to investigate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of EYN-1601&#xD;
      for dilation of the pupil. A single microdose of EYN-1601 will be compared to single doses of&#xD;
      commercially available phenylephrine hydrochloride 2.5% and 10% ophthalmic solutions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EYN-1601 delivered topically as a microdose via a proprietary delivery system (the Eyenovia&#xD;
      Multi-Dose Device [MDD] system) is being investigated for dilation of the pupil for&#xD;
      ophthalmic examinations and procedures. Phenylephrine hydrochloride, a sympathetic&#xD;
      α1-adrenergic agonist, has been used for pupil dilation for over 70 years. The mydriatic&#xD;
      action of phenylephrine is due to its stimulation of the α1 receptors of the radial muscle of&#xD;
      the iris, which causes the muscle fibers to contract and results in pupil dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When conducting a variety of ophthalmological procedures, it is necessary to dilate (enlarge)&#xD;
      the pupil to allow an unobstructed view of the lens and retina, as well as the optic nerve.&#xD;
      The degree of pupil dilation required is somewhat dependent on the procedure being performed.&#xD;
      Eyenovia, the Sponsor, is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of&#xD;
      ophthalmic drug products that can be delivered in small volumes, ie, via microdosing, in&#xD;
      order to maximize therapeutic control and minimize systemic absorption. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      Eyenovia is developing a drug/device combination product to allow accurate topical ocular&#xD;
      delivery of controlled quantities of specific active pharmaceutical ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenylephrine has been known to cause systemic cardiovascular effects in some patients when&#xD;
      dosed via the topical ocular route including hypertension, tachycardia, and more rarely,&#xD;
      arrhythmia and stroke, especially in those patients with pre-existing heart conditions. These&#xD;
      risks are even more relevant when phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 10% is used&#xD;
      in circumstances where a greater degree of mydriasis is required. Microdosing with the&#xD;
      Eyenovia MDD system is expected to significantly reduce or eliminate these risks while&#xD;
      allowing the same degree of mydriasis produced with the currently approved products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (healthy volunteers) will be screened for eligibility and 12 subjects that meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. All subjects will be followed&#xD;
      through the same pre-specified treatment visit schedule at which the 3 study drugs are&#xD;
      administered (phenylephrine 2.5% eyedrops at Visit 1, phenylephrine 10% eyedrops at Visit 2&#xD;
      and EYN-1601 MDD at Visit 3). At each treatment visit, baseline measurements will be taken&#xD;
      prior to study medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic assessments. Subsequent&#xD;
      visits must be separated by at least 2 days but may be up to 1 week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by measurement of pupil dilation in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include slit lamp examination (SLE) of both eyes and measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs (blood pressure [BP]/heart rate [HR]) and adverse events, as well as an ocular&#xD;
      discomfort survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absorption will be assessed through blood plasma analysis to detect free phenylephrine.&#xD;
