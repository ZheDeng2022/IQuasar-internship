    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to develop a new test to identify prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      at highest risk of radiotherapy-related complications. This research study would allow&#xD;
      monitoring of total tissue damage within 24 hours of radiation exposure in blood samples that&#xD;
      could give an initial result within a few days that would help clinicians make treatment&#xD;
      decisions. Detection of unusual tissue damage at this early time, well before symptoms occur,&#xD;
      could allow doctors to tailor interventions that could include patient therapies that would&#xD;
      reduce or prevent the problems that occur due to treatment of their cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a patient's risk for toxicity is based almost exclusively on population&#xD;
      statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) dose are based on phase I data and not on the&#xD;
      individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage within&#xD;
      24 hours of radiation exposure and should help identify patients at higher risk for radiation&#xD;
      complications. This should allow physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to&#xD;
      minimize long-term toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing radiation treatment for stage I to III prostate cancer, using protons or&#xD;
      X-rays, either as primary treatment or consolidation after prostatectomy (positive margins or&#xD;
      prostate-specific assay [PSA]-related indications) will be eligible. Hormone treatment will&#xD;
      be allowed.&#xD;

It will be necessary to collect blood specimens prior to and during the first week of radiation therapy.</description>
