  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults living with incurable and advancing life-limiting illness frequently desire to&#xD;
      spend as much time as possible comfortably at home, rather than in hospital. They often have&#xD;
      complex problems that not only affect their ability to function, but also their and their&#xD;
      family caregivers' overall quality of life (QOL). Routine assessment of their perceived&#xD;
      health care needs and their self-reported QOL is necessary to ensure that patients' and&#xD;
      family caregivers' concerns are visible to home care clinicians so that they can be&#xD;
      effectively monitored and addressed. These types of assessments involve asking people to&#xD;
      respond to questions about their symptoms, their physical, psychological, social and&#xD;
      existential/spiritual wellbeing, and their experiences with health care. Electronic&#xD;
      information systems are increasingly used and recommended to facilitate such QOL assessments.&#xD;
      However, there is a need for information about how such systems are best translated into&#xD;
      practice improvements that ultimately may improve patient- and family-centred outcomes. This&#xD;
      study is about the implementation of an innovative, electronic health care information and&#xD;
      practice support system, the Quality of life Assessment and Practice Support System (QPSS),&#xD;
      into routine care provided by home care services for older adults with life-limiting&#xD;
      illnesses and their family caregivers. Eight home care sites in Canada are participating. At&#xD;
      each site the investigators will first adapt the QPSS to the local context and develop a plan&#xD;
      for its local implementation. Then home care staff will be asked to use it in practice and&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate the process of using the QPSS and its effect on patient and&#xD;
      family caregiver quality of life, health, and satisfaction with care as well as the cost&#xD;
      consequences of its integration into practice. The effect of its use will be studied in a&#xD;
      randomized trial, which is the part of the study described in this registry. Patients and&#xD;
      their family caregivers will be randomly assigned to 1) have their home care team use the&#xD;
      QPSS in their care or 2) not to use it, instead receiving care as usual. The effect of using&#xD;
      the QPSS will be measured using questionnaires completed by the participating patients and&#xD;
      family caregivers every two months. If using the QPSS improves quality of life, health, or&#xD;
      satisfaction with care, the last stage will explore how to scale up use of the QPSS in&#xD;
      practice and its integration with existing health information systems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Older adults living with incurable and advancing life-limiting illness frequently desire to&#xD;
      spend as much time as possible comfortably at home, rather than in hospital. They often have&#xD;
      complex problems that not only affect their ability to function, but also their and their&#xD;
      family caregivers' overall quality of life (QOL). Routine assessment of their perceived&#xD;
      health care needs and their self-reported QOL is necessary to ensure that patients' and&#xD;
      family caregivers' concerns are visible to home care clinicians so that they can be&#xD;
      effectively monitored and addressed. These types of assessments involve asking people to&#xD;
      respond to questions about their symptoms, their physical, psychological, social and&#xD;
      existential/spiritual wellbeing, and their experiences with health care. Electronic&#xD;
      information systems are increasingly used and recommended to facilitate such QOL assessments.&#xD;
      However, there is a need for information about how such systems are best translated into&#xD;
      practice improvements that ultimately may improve patient- and family-centred outcomes. This&#xD;
      study will try to improve patient and family caregiver QOL while improving the efficacy of&#xD;
      the health care system by studying the implementation of an innovative health care&#xD;
      information system, the Quality of life Assessment and Practice Support System (QPSS), into&#xD;
      routine care provided by home care services for older adults with life-limiting illnesses and&#xD;
      their family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aims and questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This integrated knowledge translation project involves working with clinicians, patients, and&#xD;
      family caregivers to answer the following aims and research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the efficacy of the QPSS in home care for older adults who have advancing&#xD;
      life-limiting illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Does the routine use of the QPSS in home care improve quality of care, as indicated by&#xD;
      patients' and family caregivers' reports of enhanced QOL and experiences with the care&#xD;
      provided?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the cost consequences of implementing the QPSS in home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To understand the process of implementing the QPSS in home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • How can the integration and routine use of the QPSS in the home care for older adults who&#xD;
      have advancing life-limiting illnesses and their family caregivers be best facilitated?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To examine how integration of the QPSS with health information systems will meet the&#xD;
      needs of administrators for quality improvement and accreditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be conducted in 3 stages at 8 home care service sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: The local adaptation stage will use qualitative methods (user-centered design focus&#xD;
      groups and interviews with clinicians, managers, patients, and family caregivers) to adapt&#xD;
      the QPSS to the unique context of each home care service site and develop site-specific&#xD;
      protocols for its routine integration in daily practice. For evaluative purposes, this stage&#xD;
      will also include (a) measurement of patient and family caregiver QOL and their health care&#xD;
      experiences prior to integrating routine use of the QPSS into home care to serve as a&#xD;
      pre-intervention comparator group (Aim 1) and (b) data collection regarding the cost of local&#xD;
      adaptation of and training to use the QPSS (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: During the evaluation stage, the investigators will (a) conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the impact of using the QPSS on the QOL and care experiences of&#xD;
      patients and their family caregivers (Aim 1); (b) conduct an economic evaluation to estimate&#xD;
      the cost consequences of implementing the QPSS in home care (Aim 2); and (c) apply&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the process of using the QPSS in home health&#xD;
      care (Aim 3). The investigators aim to recruit 540 patients and 540 family caregivers.&#xD;
      Patient participants will be 55 years of age and older who are receiving ongoing home care&#xD;
      due to advancing life-limiting illnesses. Family caregiver participants are identified as&#xD;
      eligible and competent by the patient, or by a clinician if the patient is unable to do so,&#xD;
      and as the person most involved in the care of a patient who meets the abovementioned&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. No more than one caregiver per patient will be recruited. Patient and&#xD;
      family caregiver participants must have the ability to speak English and capacity to provide&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 3: The sustainability stage will focus on (a) whether the results warrant sustained and&#xD;
      widespread integration of the QPSS into practice, and if so, (b) how to scale this up, (c)&#xD;
      how to further integrate the QPSS with other health information systems to facilitate use by&#xD;
      health care administrators for continuous quality improvement and accreditation (Aim 4) and&#xD;
      (d) dissemination of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The start and end dates and recruitment information for this registration pertains only to&#xD;
      the randomized controlled trial in stage 2 (evaluation).&#xD;
