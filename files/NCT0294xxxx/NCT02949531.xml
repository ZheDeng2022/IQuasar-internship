  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is routinely given to patients with common conditions such as COPD and heart failure.&#xD;
      There is no evidence behind giving oxygen to patients specifically in heart failure due to a&#xD;
      stiff heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the effect oxygen has on the ability of patients with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure and the ability to exercise. Other common variables will be assessed such as&#xD;
      heart rate and blood pressure to observe the response to varying concentrations of oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations chosen are commonly offered in hospitals and indeed are being delivered&#xD;
      through standard equipment found in all hospitals in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that studying the effect of short term oxygen on patients with heart failure will&#xD;
      help to identify the effectiveness of oxygen in longer term therapy for patients who are&#xD;
      often breathless with a decreased exercise tolerance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with reduced exercise tolerance have a preserved left ventricular function.&#xD;
      These patients are labelled as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HeFPEF), when the combined use of echocardiography and biochemistry. The prevalence and the&#xD;
      incidence of HeFPEF are on the increase and currently it accounts for around 50% of all&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with HF. The last twenty years of research has led to great improvement in&#xD;
      available treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HeFREF); however,&#xD;
      current guidelines only suggest diuretics to improve symptoms of those patients with HeFPEF:&#xD;
      clinical trials of several pharmacological interventions have failed to show convincing&#xD;
      reductions in morbidity or mortality for patients with HeFPEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of oxygen therapy on exercise capacity has remained poorly understood in HeFREF&#xD;
      and, at the time of writing this study, it has never been explored in HeFPEF. The&#xD;
      investigators recently completed a study showing an increase in exercise time, exercise load&#xD;
      at peak exercise and peak metabolic equivalent on cycle ergometry with 28% oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation and further increments when 40% oxygen supplementation was used in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to improve exercise time in patients with HeFPEF with oxygen&#xD;
      supplementation. Identifying the correct dose of oxygen will be a further aim to avoid&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation but provide adequate oxygen to improve exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified from heart failure clinics and will be invited for screening&#xD;
      visit. Eligible patients will have three treatment visit at least one week apart (each visit&#xD;
      with a different oxygen concentration i.e room air, 28% and 40% oxygen, randomly determined&#xD;
      by sealed envelopes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will use standard cycle ergometry to exercise and work load will be increased every&#xD;
      minute by 5-10 watts. Patients will be encouraged to cycle until tired. At the end of&#xD;
      cycling, exercise time, peak metabolic equivalent, work load, shortness of breath score will&#xD;
      be noted at each visit.&#xD;
