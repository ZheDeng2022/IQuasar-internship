  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at developing and validating an integrated clinico-molecular model for an&#xD;
      accurate survival prognostication in newly diagnosed SMZL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Already existing and coded tumor biological material and health-related personal data will be&#xD;
      retrospectively collected. Mutation analysis will be performed by targeted deep next&#xD;
      generation sequencing of tumor genomic DNA. Deletion of 7q will be assessed by FISH on nuclei&#xD;
      isolated from tumor tissues. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and mutation status will be&#xD;
      analyzed on tumor genomic DNA by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The methylation status of target&#xD;
      genes will be assessed by methylation specific PCR on tumor genomic DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adjusted association between exposure variables and OS will be estimated by Cox&#xD;
      regression. This approach will provide the covariates independently associated with OS that&#xD;
      will be utilized in the development of a hierarchical molecular model to predict OS. The&#xD;
      hierarchical order of relevance in predicting OS among covariates will be established by&#xD;
      recursive partitioning analysis. An amalgamation algorithm will be used to merge terminal&#xD;
      nodes showing homogenous OS. The discrimination capacity of the model will be assessed by&#xD;
      calculating the c-index. Relative survival analysis will be used to provide a measure of the&#xD;
      excess mortality experienced by patient's subgroups stratified according to the developed&#xD;
      hierarchical molecular models, irrespective of whether the excess mortality is directly or&#xD;
      indirectly attributable to the disease. The model developed in the training set will be&#xD;
      tested in the validation sets and the model performance (c-index) in the validation set will&#xD;
      be compared with that in the training set.&#xD;
