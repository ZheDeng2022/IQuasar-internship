  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed asymptomatic&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in Kalamazoo and its neighboring areas using Coronary Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (CCTA) and Coronary Artery Calcium Score (CACS) to assess if asymptomatic CAD is&#xD;
      widespread enough to warrant implementation of CCTA as a routine screening tool.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will use the CCTA results to evaluate several methods of assessing&#xD;
      CAD risk in the asymptomatic population including Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Reynold's&#xD;
      Risk Score, Biomarkers (High sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, Fibrinogen, Vertical Auto&#xD;
      Profile, oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), Apolipoprotein B1&#xD;
      (ApoB1), Vitamin D, Homocysteine) as well as a large panel of genetic markers of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia.&#xD;
