    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient (male or female) â‰¥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Escalation: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with measurable or&#xD;
             non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST version 1.1 who have progressed despite&#xD;
             standard therapy or are intolerant of standard therapy, or for whom no standard&#xD;
             therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Expansion: Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, with at least one&#xD;
             measurable lesion as determined by RECIST version 1.1, who have progressed despite&#xD;
             standard therapy following their last prior therapy or are intolerant to standard&#xD;
             therapy and fit into one of the following groups: Group 1: NSCLC resistant to&#xD;
             anti-PD-1/PD-L1; Group 2: TNBC; Group 3: HCC; Group 4: MSS-CRC; Group 5: pancreatic;&#xD;
             Group 6 ccRCC resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is defined as: Documented progressive disease&#xD;
             occurring while on/or within 6 months after anti-PD-1 and/or anti-PD-L1 agent (single&#xD;
             or combination) received as the last therapy prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG Performance Status â‰¤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy, and be a candidate for tumor&#xD;
             biopsy. Patient must be willing to undergo a new tumor biopsy at screening, and during&#xD;
             therapy on this study. Exceptions may be made on a case by case basis after documented&#xD;
             discussion with Novartis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to study treatment ingredients or other&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies and components of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Note: Patients with&#xD;
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active HBV or HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
