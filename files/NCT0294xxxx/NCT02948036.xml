      Specific Aim 1: Finalize development of the closed-loop strategy in the MMT application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the MMT application with the&#xD;
      target population to prepare for a large-scale efficacy trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Investigators have recently constructed a beta version of the MMT&#xD;
      application, comprised of the multi-modal assessment modules, several treatment modules and&#xD;
      an initial version of the closed-loop algorithm to control treatment delivery. Utilizing the&#xD;
      extensive experience in developing mobile assessment and treatment tools at Posit Science&#xD;
      Corporation, the investigators will employ an iterative development process incorporating&#xD;
      feedback from users (focus groups of patients with mood disorders), clinicians and scientists&#xD;
      (project consultants) to achieve the following development goals: (1) Finalize MMT's&#xD;
      closed-loop algorithm to incorporate all assessment modules and expand the existing triage&#xD;
      approach; (2) Expand cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) functions within the app; and (3)&#xD;
      Expand in-app bi-directional communication feature between the clinician and user. At the&#xD;
      completion of Specific Aim 1, the investigators will have a mobile app suitable for&#xD;
      evaluation in a feasibility trial (Specific Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The investigators will conduct a single arm, open label feasibility field&#xD;
      trial with 30 participants that meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to engage with the experimental cognitive treatment and spend up&#xD;
      to six weeks engaged in 15 hours of cognitive training as an adjunct to their standard&#xD;
      clinical treatment. The experimental cognitive treatment will be deployed as dictated by the&#xD;
      closed loop predictive algorithm, with all patient data continuously accessible for remote&#xD;
      monitoring by the attending clinicians, research staff and Principal Investigator at&#xD;
      University of Minnesota, and research staff and Sponsor PI at Posit Science Corporation.&#xD;
      Participants will be re-evaluated every two weeks during treatment use, and again at the&#xD;
      expected time of completion of training, at 6 weeks, to evaluate changes in cognitive&#xD;
      function. Participants will then stop using their assigned program for 6 weeks, and return&#xD;
      for a follow-up assessment to evaluate the endurance of changes in cognitive function in the&#xD;
      absence of further program use.&#xD;
