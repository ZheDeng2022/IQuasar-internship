      INTRODUCTION: Treatment and management of people suffering from HIV, AIDS and opportunistic&#xD;
      infections using conventional therapeutic interventions is beyond the reach of most&#xD;
      governments because of the cost of imported medicines. The WHO has approved the strategy and&#xD;
      promotion of the use of Traditional Medicine in Health Systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary health care places traditional medicines high on its list of priorities and&#xD;
      emphasizes their easy availability and use. There is however a need for scientific validation&#xD;
      of most potential medicinal plants available in many poor countries and research must focus&#xD;
      on the safety and efficacy of these traditional medicines to support their widespread usage.&#xD;
      This study intends to conduct a phase I clinical trial using the SF2000SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of SF2000 use: The Sondashi Formula 2000, code named &quot;SF2000&quot; is a mixture of 4&#xD;
      plants. Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS have been using this traditional medicine for the&#xD;
      management of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more acceptable dosage form i.e. a spray dried extract (SF2000SD) has been developed based&#xD;
      on the SF2000 inventor's traditional preparation the commencement of a phase I clinical&#xD;
      safety study involving eligible adult male health individual volunteers is warranted.&#xD;
      Information will be collected to scientifically ascertain the safety of SF2000 in these&#xD;
      volunteers paving the way for a phase II clinical study to be conducted after phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be a longitudinal clinical trial of adult healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers taking SF2000SD or placebo under directly observed therapy (DOT). The study&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to each treatment arm as they are being enrolled into the&#xD;
      study. Each treatment arm/group A, B and C will have fifteen (15) study participants, total&#xD;
      45. Apart from the PI the other investigators will be blinded to the participants' treatment&#xD;
      arms. The study participants will also be blinded to the treatment arms and their contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: The study shall be undertaken at the Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Ndola.&#xD;
      Study personnel The following personnel will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Project administrator&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Social scientists&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research nurses&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lab assistants&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical Officer&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Medical doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pharmacist&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Specimen Courier staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Sensitization and awareness posters, volunteer brochures and flyers, direct&#xD;
      mailing and presentations will be given to the targeted community. Volunteers will receive&#xD;
      further briefing from the Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-Principal Investigator. The&#xD;
      briefing will be followed by an opportunity for questions from the volunteers. Potential&#xD;
      study participants will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study. All study&#xD;
      participants will receive counseling pertaining to their intent to participate in the study&#xD;
      from qualified counselors of the research team. Written informed consent which will be&#xD;
      validated by the PI or his designee will be obtained from all participants. Forty five (45)&#xD;
      healthy males will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of assigning study participants to treatment arm/group: The blocked randomization&#xD;
      method will be used to allocate the participants to the treatment. Selection of participants&#xD;
      to each treatment will be based on the rank of 45 randomly generated numbers of sizes between&#xD;
      0 and 1, generated for each sequential participant. Accordingly, participants in blocks of 3&#xD;
      will be ranked according to the random number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each block the participants with the highest rank will be allocated to treatment A, the&#xD;
      ones with the second highest will be allocated to treatment B, and the ones with the third&#xD;
      highest will be allocated to treatment C. A randomization list with participants&#xD;
      Identification (ID) numbers will be generated by the statistician and will be kept by the PI.&#xD;
      Treatment packs will bear participant ID numbers. Only the PI will know the treatment&#xD;
      allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration: Participants will start taking the dose orally in their respective&#xD;
      treatment arms when recruitment for the study is complete. In order to ensure that the study&#xD;
      drug is taken, a Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) approach will be used. The study drug will&#xD;
      be administered twice daily between 06.00hrs - 09.00hrs and 17.00hrs - 20.00hrs for six&#xD;
      weeks. All administrations will be recorded on the dosing sheet and signed by the person&#xD;
      administering the treatment and Co-PI or Medical Doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The participants will be required to report any adverse events immediately.&#xD;
      At each visit, the participants will also be interviewed on any adverse events since the&#xD;
      previous visit. Furthermore, participants will be required to keep a dairy of adverse events&#xD;
      for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory tests will mainly be carried out at the Tropical Diseases Research Centre&#xD;
      (Ndola), and Ndola Central Hospital (Ndola).&#xD;

           including information on any concomitant medication given for the management of adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unscheduled visits throughout follow up during these visits, the same procedures will be&#xD;
           applied. Any laboratory study specific or any other measurements can be performed,&#xD;
           according to the physician's clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry: The data generated will be entered and analyzed by STATA computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Null Hypothesis set p-values The SF2000SD herbal preparation is not&#xD;
      safe for human consumption P-value = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse events will be classified into three to five categories (Adverse events&#xD;
      categories against the three &quot;treatments&quot;). Proportions will be compared using the Chi-square&#xD;
      test. If the expected frequencies will be less than 5%, then the Fisher's t test will be&#xD;
      used. The students' t test will be used to compare the means. The level of statistical&#xD;
      significance will be set at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical findings will also be classified into three to five categories and an exact&#xD;
      chi-square test will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the null hypothesis (no association between occurrence of adverse events or physical&#xD;
      examination findings for exact chi-square test and no difference in the changes for analysis&#xD;
      of variance test) in the exact Chi-square test or the analysis of variance test is rejected&#xD;
      then multiple comparison tests and stratified analysis will be done to compare the placebo&#xD;
      against the other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct interim analysis at week 3 of study starting from baseline (baseline to be all at the&#xD;
      same time for all 45 participants if possible - must be included in randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL: The Investigators will review the consent and screening processes with all&#xD;
      study stuff prior to commencement of the study to ensure that a standardized approach is&#xD;
      followed during the study. In addition, the Investigators will frequently conduct performance&#xD;
      assessments of the study support staff to ensure smooth collection of reliable data and&#xD;
      review participants' concerns during the study. In addition the study monitor will visit at&#xD;
      initiation, during the conduct of the study and at closure to verify if the study is being&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with, Protocol/amendment(s), with Good Clinical Practices, Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures (SOPs) and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES TO HANDLE ADVERSE EVENTS: At admission for each treatment period study&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to report any changes in normal health that they experience&#xD;
      to the Principal Investigator or Co-Principal Investigator. AEs will also be elicited by&#xD;
      indirect questioning at regular intervals, usually at the time of measurement of vital signs,&#xD;
      with such questions as &quot;How do you feel today? or &quot;Is anything bothering you?&quot; No study&#xD;
      participant shall be permitted any medication during the study except as permitted by the&#xD;
      study medical doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs or symptoms will be recorded in the CRF. Any SAE will be reported to the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator/Co- Principal Investigator, within 48 hours (0977 655096 or 0966 263271), who in&#xD;
      turn will report them to the Ethics Committee and DSMB. On the basis of the occurrence and&#xD;
      severity of AEs, coupled with results of any other observations, the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      or Co-Principal Investigator, at his discretion and in consultation with the DSMB, may decide&#xD;
      to withdraw a study participant or prematurely end the study for reasons of clinical safety.&#xD;
      The time of such termination will be recorded and palliative treatment will be instituted as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL STOPPING RULES: The DSMB has the right to stop the trial based on the following rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of any major life threatening adverse event may result in the trial being&#xD;
           abandoned immediately at the discretion of the DSMB. The investigators together with the&#xD;
           DSMB may agree to stop the study should a certain number of participants experience SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An occurrence of a SAE directly attributed to SF2000SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If any number of participants have abnormal laboratory results or other AEs over Grade 3&#xD;
           as per the exclusion criteria, then this would warrant for the exceptional meeting of&#xD;
           the DSMB to determine whether the trial should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REASONS FOR NOT COMPLETING THE STUDY: Participants may not complete the study for medical or&#xD;
      non-medical reasons PROJECT MANGEMENT: The project will be managed by four investigators: PI,&#xD;
      Co-PI (MD), Biostatistician and Social Scientist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MONITORING: Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible to monitor the&#xD;
      progression of the study and analyzing the data generated.&#xD;
