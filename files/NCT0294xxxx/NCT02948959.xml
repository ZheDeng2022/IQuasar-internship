    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 90 active centers in 17 countries. A total of 631 participants were screened between 21 April 2017 and 22 July 2019, of which 408 participants were enrolled and randomized to receive dupilumab or placebo. A total of 223 participants failed screening mainly due to failure to meet inclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dose level (medium or high), blood eosinophils count (less than [&lt;] 300 cells per microliter and greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 300 cells per microliter), and region (Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Western countries). Treatment assignment was done by Interactive Voice/Web Response System (2:1 ratio) to receive dupilumab or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>ACQ-7-IA had 7 questions, which assessed: frequency of nocturnal awakenings, severity of asthma symptoms in the mornings, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath due to asthma and wheeze, reliever medication use, and FEV1 (% predicted). Participants recalled their previous week asthma and answered 5 symptom questions on 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment).

        <description>The PEF is a participant's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter. Peak flow testing for AM PEF was performed in morning prior to taking any salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol reliever medication. Baseline AM PEF was the mean AM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to the first dose of investigational product. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in AM PEF (liters/minute) values up to Week 52 as the response variable, and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline AM PEF (liters/minute) value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <description>FEF is the amount of air (in liters) which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEF 25-75% was defined as the mean FEF between 25% and 75% of the FVC, where FVC was defined as the volume of air (in liters) that can be forcibly blown out after full inspiration in the upright position. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in FE F25-75% values up to Week 52 as the response variable, and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, sex, ethnicity, baseline height, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline FEF 25-75% value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <description>Participants were assessed for post-bronchodilator FEV1 30 minutes after bronchodilator administration (200 to 400 mg [2 to 4 puffs] of albuterol/salbutamol or 45 to 90 micrograms [2 to 4 puffs] of levalbuterol/levosalbutamol). FEV1 was the volume of air (in liters) exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration as measured by spirometer. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV1 values up to Week 52 as the response variable, and treatment, baseline weight group, region, ethnicity, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline post-bronchodilator FEV1 value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Evening Asthma Symptom Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52: Type 2 Inflammatory Asthma Phenotype Population</title>
          <description>The evening asthma symptom score evaluated participant's overall asthma symptoms experienced during the day. It ranged from 0 (very well, no asthma symptoms) to 4 (asthma very bad, unable to carry out daily activities as usual), where lower scores indicate more mild symptoms and higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in PM asthma symptom score values up to Week 52 as response variable, and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline PM asthma symptom score value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-Interviewer Administered, 5-question Version (ACQ-5-IA) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52: Type 2 Inflammatory Asthma Phenotype Population</title>
        <description>ACQ-5-IA has 5 questions, reflecting top-scoring 5 asthma symptoms: frequency of nocturnal awakenings, severity of asthma symptoms in the mornings, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath due to asthma and wheeze. Participants were asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week and to respond to each of the five symptom questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment). ACQ-5-IA total score was mean of the scores of all 5 questions and, therefore, ranged from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), higher scores indicated lower asthma control. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in ACQ-5-IA values up to Week 52 as the response variable, and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline ACQ-5-IA value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-Interviewer Administered, 7-question Version at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 36, and 52: Baseline Blood Eosinophils &gt;=300 Cells Per Microliter Population</title>
        <description>ACQ-7-IA had 7 questions, assessed: frequency of nocturnal awakenings, severity of asthma symptoms in the mornings, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath due to asthma and wheeze, reliever medication use, and FEV1 (% predicted). Participants recalled their previous week asthma and answered 5 symptom questions on 7-point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment). Total score:mean of scores of all 7 questions; ranging from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled), higher score indicated lower asthma control. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in ACQ-7-IA values up to Week 52 as response variable and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline ACQ-7-IA value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <description>Participants might be administered salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol as reliever medication as needed. Number of reliever medication inhalations were recorded daily in electronic diary/PEF meter. When Nebulizer solutions were used as alternative delivery method, nebulizer dose was converted to number of puffs as per conversion factor: salbutamol/albuterol nebulizer solution (2.5 mg) and levosalbutamol/levalbuterol (1.25 mg) corresponds to 4 puffs. Change From Baseline in number of puffs of reliever medication used per 24 hours at specified weeks was reported. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in number of puffs of reliever medication/24 hours values up to Week 52 as response variable and treatment, age, baseline: weight group, region, eosinophil level, FeNO level, ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline number of puffs of reliever medication/24 hours value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <description>PAQLQ(S)-IA, a disease-specific, interviewer-administered QoL questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to children &gt;=7 years with asthma. The PAQLQ(S)-IA comprises of 23 items in 3 domains: symptoms (10 items), activity limitation (5 items) and emotional function (8 items). Each item was scored on a 7-point likert scale (1=maximal impairment to 7=no impairment). 23 items of questionnaire were averaged to produce 1 overall quality of life score ranging from 1 (severely impaired) to 7 (not impaired at all), higher scores indicated better quality of life. LS means and SE were derived from MMRM model with change from baseline in PAQLQ(S)-IA global score values up to Week 52 as the response variable, and treatment, age, baseline weight group, region, baseline eosinophil level, baseline FeNO level, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline PAQLQ(S)-IA global score value and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates.</description>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and did not necessary have to had a causal relationship with treatment.TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed or worsened in grade or became serious during TEAE period which was defined as the period from the time of first dose of study drug to the end of post-treatment period. A serious adverse events (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in: death; or life-threatening experience; or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; or resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or a medically important event. TEAEs included both SAEs and non-SAEs.</description>
