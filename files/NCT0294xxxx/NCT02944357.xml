    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      AGS-003-BLD work in treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread to the muscle and&#xD;
      who are undergoing surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and&#xD;
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vaccines made from&#xD;
      a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and AGS-003-BLD before surgery may make&#xD;
      the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the immunogenicity of AGS-003-BLD in subjects with muscle invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess 1-year disease-free survival rate of patients with muscle-invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer who receive cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy plus AGS-003-BLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to first metastatic lesion. III. To explore the disease-free and&#xD;
      overall survival of patients treated with this treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and identify any activity of this&#xD;
      treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate toxicities and tolerability associated with this treatment combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the success rate of tumor procurement and AGS-003-BLD production of &gt;= 5 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the relationships between pathologic complete response with the change in&#xD;
      CD28+ T cell levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the change in frequency of CD11a highPD-1+ CD8+ T cells (and their expression&#xD;
      of Bim) in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEOADJUVANT PHASE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1&#xD;
      and 8, AGS-003-BLD intradermally (ID) on day 1, and cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients then receive AGS-003-BLD ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for&#xD;
      up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Patients undergo cystectomy during course 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT PHASE: Patients continue AGS-003-BLD ID on day 1 of course 9. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 12 weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
