  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that will assess the effects of (1) the&#xD;
      Family-Supportive Supervisor Behavior (FSSB) and Sleep Leadership training and (2)&#xD;
      sleep/cognitive effectiveness feedback intervention on health and well-being among full-time&#xD;
      employees in the Oregon National Guard, their supervisors, and their families. The&#xD;
      interventions involving both health protection and health promotion are expected to&#xD;
      contribute to improvements in employees' and their supervisors' sleep, risk behaviors, mental&#xD;
      and physical health, and injury, as well as employees' and their spouse/partners' family&#xD;
      experiences, health and well-being, and workplace outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Military Employee Sleep and Health (MESH) study is to improve safety,&#xD;
      health and well-being of service members in the Oregon National Guard and their families. The&#xD;
      MESH Study seeks to do this by training supervisors to support Oregon National Guard service&#xD;
      members by focusing on a reduction in work-life stress while increasing sleep health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oregon MESH Study proposes that leadership can influence a fundamental change in the&#xD;
      recognition of sleep health and service members' overall well-being and the well-being of&#xD;
      their family members. With the support of the Oregon National Guard, the MESH Study will&#xD;
      provide family-support and sleep leadership training for supervisors while raising awareness&#xD;
      of sleep through daily non-invasive sleep measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of the Oregon MESH Study expect positive results for study participants,&#xD;
      including reduced stress and increased social support. Longer term, these effects are&#xD;
      expected to create a more supportive work environment, which has positive effects on safety,&#xD;
      health, well-being, family, and organizational outcomes. The investigators also expect that&#xD;
      providing service members with individual sleep feedback will reduce sleep problems and&#xD;
      improve sleep awareness.&#xD;
