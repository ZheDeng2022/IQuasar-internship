      This research study is to compare the radiopharmacokinetics of I-124 to the&#xD;
      radiopharmacokinetics of I-131 in patients who have well-differentiated thyroid cancer after&#xD;
      thyroid hormone withdrawal. I-131 is routinely used for imaging and dosimetry for patients&#xD;
      with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. In this study, I-124 is administered orally in&#xD;
      capsular form, and the radiopharmacokinetics of I-124 is compared with I-131. I-124 is&#xD;
      another isotope of iodine, which is cyclotron-produced. I-124 has multiple advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ideal Half-Life (4.2 days) for delayed imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High resolution tomographic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of quantitating lesion uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential of dosimetry for the planning of radioiodine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary patients will have I-124 dosimetry performed in addition to the I-131 dosimetry,&#xD;
      which is planned as part of routine clinical care. I-124 dosimetry is composed of three&#xD;
      parts: (1) the administration of I-124, (2) imaging, and (3) drawing blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start 3-5 weeks of thyroid hormone withdrawal. This is similar to the procedure&#xD;
      for I-131 dosimetry. Second, they will receive I-124. I-124 is similar to I-131 except I-124&#xD;
      decays in a different way to emit a positron so that the PET scanner can be used for imaging.&#xD;
      I-124 is given in the form of one or several capsules, which are taken by mouth. This is also&#xD;
      similar to I-131. Third, PET/CT imaging is done for approximately 30 minutes to one hour on&#xD;
      five consecutive days. Radiation from PET/CT scan is far less than what they receive from a&#xD;
      diagnostic CT scan. For the fourth part, a technologist will draw about 5 cc from the forearm&#xD;
      on each of the five consecutive days. This is also similar to I-131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, all patients will be randomized to one of two study groups. The first group will&#xD;
      have the I-131 dosimetry performed first followed by the I-124 dosimetry, and the second&#xD;
      group will have the I-124 dosimetry performed first followed by the I-131 dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of this study is considered very low, and the potential benefits to the patient are&#xD;
      considered very high.&#xD;

      Radiopharmacokinetics and Dosimetric Calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tracer dosage of either I-131 or I-124 is first administered to the patient, and the&#xD;
      clearance is then followed for the specified period. In the classical approach, the blood is&#xD;
      considered the critical organ which is irradiated either from the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  particles emitted from activity in the blood itself, or from the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emissions originating from activity dispersed throughout the remainder of the body.&#xD;
           Therefore only two compartments need to be monitored for radioactivity: (a) blood and&#xD;
           (b) the whole body. Based on a classical dosimetry approach, the radiation dose to the&#xD;
           whole blood in cGy (rads) per MBq I-131 is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the area under these two curves is based on a mathematical fit to the data&#xD;
      points using a multiple exponential function. Since the data collection is terminated after 4&#xD;
      days these curves must then be extrapolated to infinity. A very conservative estimate is&#xD;
      employed by assuming that the clearance following the final measured data point is based&#xD;
      simply on the physical decay. This ignores any biological clearance and results in an&#xD;
      overestimation of the area of these tails and hence in the radiation dose per millicurie&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have the following calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Whole body radiopharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Blood radiopharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Whole blood dosimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Lesion Kinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Whole body radiopharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to using an external probe to measure the whole body retention, a dual&#xD;
      detector gamma camera system can be used. In this case the patient is scanned in the whole&#xD;
      body mode in a reproducible geometry while lying supine on the imaging table. This method has&#xD;
      been generally accepted for patient-specific whole body dosimetry of I-131 radiolabeled&#xD;
      antibodies . Furthermore, it has been shown to yield comparable results with the external&#xD;
      probe data . This technique has the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simultaneous anterior and posterior images using a high-energy collimator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Table height, detector radii, scan length, scan speed, and energy window are&#xD;
           standardized and reproduced for each data point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scan speed can be relatively rapid (typically we have used 30 cm/min) so that the data&#xD;
           acquisition is completed in approximately 8 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional scans are performed each day for (1) background, and (2) a counting standard&#xD;
           (vial containing about 37 MBq (1 mCi) of I-131).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total counts in the image or fixed regions of interest encompassing the entire body are&#xD;
           used for the calculation of whole body retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the images are not used for diagnostic purposes, this approach has the additional&#xD;
      advantage that if for some reason there is delayed absorption of the tracer dosage in the&#xD;
      stomach, and then the measurement could be repeated at 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial 2-hour period following the I-131 administration the patient is not&#xD;
      allowed to urinate or defecate. Under these circumstances essentially 100 percent of the&#xD;
      dosage will be contained within the patient at these observation points. The initial image is&#xD;
      then defined to represent the 100 percent value and subsequent daily measurements are&#xD;
      normalized to this value using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When used in this way, the standard will correct for variations in detector sensitivity from&#xD;
      measurement to measurement, as well as for physical decay. Absolute calibrations are not&#xD;
      necessary since the patient is used as his/her reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole body I-124 images will be obtained at the same time points using the PET system. In&#xD;
      this case emission imaging will be obtained for 1-2 minutes/bed position for a sufficient&#xD;
      number of positions to cover the patient from head to foot. Transmission imaging will also be&#xD;
      performed to correct the emission data for attenuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Blood pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples (3-4 ml in purple top tubes) are counted using scintillation well-detector&#xD;
      system. Since we need to determine the activity in these samples, it is necessary to make up&#xD;
      a calibration standard, which can be counted at the same time. This involves the addition of&#xD;
      a carefully assayed quantity of I-131 (approximately 3.7 MBq - 7.4 MBq {100-200 uCi}) to a&#xD;
      total volume of 1000 ml. Such a small concentration is necessary in order to avoid saturating&#xD;
      the detector. An alternative that we have implemented in the dosimetry program here at the&#xD;
      Washington Hospital Center uses a Ba-133 rod source instead that has been cross-calibrated&#xD;
      against the I-131 standard. With its relatively long half-life (10.3 years) and similar gamma&#xD;
      emissions, Ba-133 is a suitable replacement for the prepared I-131 standard. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the data acquisition, two 1-ml aliquots of whole blood, and the &quot;standard&quot; are&#xD;
      counted. Using this information, it is possible to calculate the % of administered&#xD;
      dosage/liter of whole blood at each of the timed samples. A zero time point is calculated by&#xD;
      dividing the total dosage by the patient's total blood volume. However, a patient-specific&#xD;
      blood volume is not determined, but is assumed to equal 20% of the body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Whole blood dosimetry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Maximum Treatment Activity (MTA) is then calculated as the activity of I-131, which would&#xD;
      deliver a combined beta and gamma dose to the blood component of 200 cGy (200 rads).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This calculation will be performed using the whole body and blood clearance data from both&#xD;
      the I-131 and the I-124 biokinetic clearance data. The I-124 data will first be corrected for&#xD;
      the difference in half-lives of these two radionuclides so as to generate the &quot;equivalent&quot;&#xD;
      I-131 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Lesion Kinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients in which focal lesion(s) can be visualized the clearance curves and&#xD;
      half-lives will be determined from the images for both the I-131 and the I-124 studies. A&#xD;
      manually drawn region-of interest (ROI) will be placed around each lesion as visualized on&#xD;
      the diagnostic whole body scan performed at 48hrs post administration of the radioiodine.&#xD;
      This ROI will then be positioned over the comparable area on each of the scans. A background&#xD;
      ROI adjacent to the lesion will also be drawn. The total counts in the lesion after&#xD;
      background correction will be determined for each time point. In the case of the PET scans&#xD;
      first each PET study will be co-registered to the diagnostic scan using the Hermes image&#xD;
      registration tool. The coronal slices will then be added to generate a whole body scan that&#xD;
      is &quot;equivalent&quot; to that of I-131. Regions of interest will be defined in the same manner as&#xD;
      discussed above. A least squares single exponential fit will be applied to each of the lesion&#xD;
      clearance curves. The half-life of the exponential will then be computed and the values&#xD;
      derived for I-131 compared with I-124 for each identified lesion.&#xD;
