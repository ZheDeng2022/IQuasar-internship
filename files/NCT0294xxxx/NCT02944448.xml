    <textblock>
      The study schedule consists of a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a blinded 4- week&#xD;
      Titration-to-Effect Period with weekly visits, a blinded 4-week Maintenance Treatment Period&#xD;
      at the optimal dose level determined for each patient, and a 1-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either CR845 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Every&#xD;
      patient will be started on a 1-mg dose of CR845 or matching placebo. During the&#xD;
      post-randomization Titration-to-Effect period, the dose of study drug may be increased to 2.5&#xD;
      mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion. Patients may know their dose is being changed but will&#xD;
      not know whether they were randomization to active study drug or placebo. Approximately 330&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, titration-to-effect&#xD;
      study of orally administered CR845 in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study schedule consists of a Screening Period (up to 14 days), a blinded 4- week&#xD;
      Titration-to-Effect Period with weekly visits, a blinded 4-week Maintenance Treatment Period&#xD;
      at the optimal dose level determined for each patient, and a 1-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either CR845 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified based on a patient's primary OA joint (knee vs. hip). Every&#xD;
      patient will be started on a 1-mg dose of CR845 or matching placebo. During the&#xD;
      post-randomization Titration-to-Effect period, the dose of study drug may be increased to 2.5&#xD;
      mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may know their dose is being changed but will not know whether they were randomized&#xD;
      to active study drug or placebo. Approximately 330 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening, Titration-to-Effect and Follow-up Period, pain intensity scores will be&#xD;
      obtained at specified time points. Blood sampling and safety assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      during this period as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of rescue medication for the treatment of any pain (including but not limited to&#xD;
      headache, menstrual cramps, or non-target joint pain) during the study will be discussed with&#xD;
      the patients at the Screening Visit. Acetaminophen is the only allowable rescue medication&#xD;
      for pain beginning from Day -5 until the end of the Maintenance Treatment Period. Starting at&#xD;
      the Screening Visit Acetaminophen will be provided as 325-mg tablets and its use (number of&#xD;
      tablets taken in the previous 24 hours) will be reported each evening in the patient diary.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC Index is a self-administered assessment used to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC Index contains 24 questions across 3 different sub-scales (pain, stiffness, and function) all with scoring 0-10 (0 = No Pain/Stiffness/Difficulty, 10 = Extreme Pain/Stiffness/Difficulty). Each WOMAC Index Subscale score (Pain/Stiffness/Function) is calculated as the sum of all scores within that subscale. The pain subscale consists of five scores from 0-10, 0 is no pain 10 is extreme pain possible for a range of 0 - 50 points. The stiffness subscale consists of two scores from 0-10, 0 is no stiffness 10 is extreme stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 20 points. The function subscale consists of 17 scores from 0-10, 0 is no difficulty and 10 is extreme difficulty, for a range of 0 - 170 points. The WOMAC Index Total Score is calculated as the sum of all 24 scores (range of 0-240).</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With at Least 30% Improvement From Baseline in the Weekly Mean Pain Intensity at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A patient's pain response to treatment is defined as the percent improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of &quot;average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; pain score during the last week of the Maintenance Treatment Period (Week 8) . If a patient's mean weekly pain score during the last week of the Maintenance Treatment Period is greater than the baseline score (i.e., the patient has an increase in pain compared to baseline), his/her response to treatment will be assigned a value of 0 (i.e. the patient will be considered a non-responder). Patients who discontinue study drug early will be considered non-responders to treatment and will be assigned a pain response of 0.&#xD;
The percentage of subjects achieving levels of treatment response 10% to 100% by 10% increments as defined above will be calculated with 30% of key interest as it has been shown to represent a clinically important improvement in pain.</description>

    <description>The PGIC is a self-administered instrument that measures the patient's overall impression of his/her OA on a 7-point scale where 1 = &quot;Very much improved&quot; and 7 = &quot;Very much worse&quot;.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC Index is a self-administered assessment used to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC Index contains 24 questions across 3 different sub-scales (pain, stiffness, and function) all with scoring 0-10 (0 = No Pain/Stiffness/Difficulty, 10 = Extreme Pain/Stiffness/Difficulty). Each WOMAC Index Subscale score (Pain/Stiffness/Function) is calculated as the sum of all scores within that subscale. The pain subscale consists of five scores from 0-10, 0 is no pain 10 is extreme pain possible for a range of 0 - 50 points. The stiffness subscale consists of two scores from 0-10, 0 is no stiffness 10 is extreme stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 20 points. The function subscale consists of 17 scores from 0-10, 0 is no difficulty and 10 is extreme difficulty, for a range of 0 - 170 points. The WOMAC Index Total Score is calculated as the sum of all 24 scores (range of 0-240).</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With at Least 30% Improvement From Baseline in the Weekly Mean Pain Intensity at Week 8</title>
        <description>A patient's pain response to treatment is defined as the percent improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of &quot;average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; pain score during the last week of the Maintenance Treatment Period (Week 8) . If a patient's mean weekly pain score during the last week of the Maintenance Treatment Period is greater than the baseline score (i.e., the patient has an increase in pain compared to baseline), his/her response to treatment will be assigned a value of 0 (i.e. the patient will be considered a non-responder). Patients who discontinue study drug early will be considered non-responders to treatment and will be assigned a pain response of 0.&#xD;
The percentage of subjects achieving levels of treatment response 10% to 100% by 10% increments as defined above will be calculated with 30% of key interest as it has been shown to represent a clinically important improvement in pain.</description>
