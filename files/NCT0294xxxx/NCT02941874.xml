    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is on one hand to verify the measurement conformity of the IRAP&#xD;
      dosage and on the other hand to obtain normal values of the blood IRAP concentration on&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study consists of two visits, from two to five days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will be on an empty stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  they will have a clinical examination, blood tests and blood samples will be taken to&#xD;
           constitute a blood collection. the IRAP concentration will be measured with those&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit : This visit will take place in an interval from 2 to 5 days after the first&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be on an empty stomach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 3 hours will be performed. Blood samples will&#xD;
           be taken three time 15 minutes apart at Baseline (before taking the glucose). And then&#xD;
           after the glucose intake, blood sample will be taken every 15 minutes to measure&#xD;
           insulinemia, blood glucose, and IRAP concentration.&#xD;

    <measure>Normal values of IRAP concentration will be calculated by making the average of the three dosages of IRAP measured at base line.</measure>

    <description>Three blood samples will be taken 15 minutes apart, before the OGTT. The average of IRAP concentration measured with those 3 samples, will be used to assess the normal values of IRAP concentration on a healthy population.</description>

    <time_frame>At the beginning of the second visit of the study, before the glucose intake</time_frame>
