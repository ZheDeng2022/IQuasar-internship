    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of a new formulation of the omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and to assess whether&#xD;
      it decreases inflammation and inflammatory pain in children and young adults with Sickle Cell&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive SCD-Omegatex™ (Enteric Fish Oil 250 DHA/27 EPA Soft Gelatin Capsule, 450 mg) at one of two daily doses, orally, once a day for 6 months. The trial will follow a &quot;3+3&quot; design using two dose levels. In the phase I portion, subjects will be treated with a dose of 25 mg/kg/day DHA and EPA. If this is tolerated without dose limiting toxicity (DLT), a subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg/day with a maximum total daily dose of 4 grams. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, subjects on the phase II portion of the study will be treated at that dose.</description>

SCD-Omegatex™: Subjects will receive SCD-Omegatex™ (Enteric Fish Oil 250 DHA/27 EPA Soft Gelatin Capsule, 450 mg) at one of two daily doses, orally, once a day for 6 months. The trial will follow a &quot;3+3&quot; design using two dose levels. In the phase I portion, subjects will be treated with a dose of 25 mg/kg/day DHA and EPA. If this is tolerated without dose limiting toxicity (DLT), a subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg/day with a maximum total daily dose of 4 grams. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, subjects on the phase II portion of the study will be treated at that dose.</description>
