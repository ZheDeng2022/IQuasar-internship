      Nivolumab (OpdivoTM, BMS), a human IgG-4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody has demonstrated&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators postulate that patients with melanoma nivolumab have a comparable tumor&#xD;
      response rate at a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg q2wks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab (YervoyTM, BMS), a human IgG-1 anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody improves the&#xD;
      survival of patients with advanced melanoma. Adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab improves the&#xD;
      relapse-free survival after complete resection of high-risk stage III melanoma (EORTC 18071).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab improves the tumor response rate and&#xD;
      overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma but is associated with a higher incidence&#xD;
      of immune related adverse events (CheckMate 067).Nivolumab and ipilimumab have distinct&#xD;
      immunological mechanisms that can be revealed by analyzing TCR usage in blood lymphocytes.&#xD;

      Currently, there is no standard of care or no available treatment for subjects with AJCC&#xD;
      Stage IIIb/c and Stage IV NED melanoma who are at high risk for recurrence following complete&#xD;
      resection of their metastasis. Ipilimumab (10mg/kg), interferon, pegylated interferon therapy&#xD;
      or observations alone are the typical options for the Stage III patients who achieve a&#xD;
      complete resection and are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. In the EU, high-dose&#xD;
      interferon is the only approved drug for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma patients. Given&#xD;
      the unexceptional benefit and high toxicity profile in a patient population that is free of&#xD;
      disease, it is controversial whether ipilimumab and interferon can be considered standard of&#xD;
      care for Stage III melanoma. Nivolumab, a PD1 blocking monoclonal antibody, has shown&#xD;
      superior anti-tumor activity across a wide range of dose-levels (0,1 to 10 mg/kg every 2&#xD;
      weeks) in patients with advanced melanoma. Nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks)&#xD;
      demonstrated a survival benefit in treatment naive patients with BRAF Wild Type (WT),&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma in a Phase 3, randomized clinical trial and a PFS benefit over ipilimumab&#xD;
      as a first-line therapy for advanced melanoma. Combination therapy with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab results in a higher response rate and PFS as compared to the results obtained with&#xD;
      monotherapy. Combination therapy however significantly increases the incidence of grade &gt; 3&#xD;
      adverse events, to the extent that this regimen would probably be associated with&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity in the adjuvant setting. The toxicity seems to be driven by Ipilimumab.&#xD;
      The adverse events seen on Ipilimumab are dose dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike PD-1 blockade, CTLA-4 blockade diversifies the peripheral T-cell pool, representing a&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effect that can be measured by a DNA-sequencing technology referred to as&#xD;
      ImmunoSeq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase IB study will investigate the effect of low-dose ipilimumab and low-dose nivolumab&#xD;
      on the peripheral T-cell repertoire of patients who are free of disease following the&#xD;
      resection of melanoma macrometastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with low-dose ipilimumab in combination with low-dose nivolumab will be safe and&#xD;
      modify the peripheral T-cell repertoire in subjects with completely resected Stage IIIb/c and&#xD;
      Stage IV melanoma who are at high risk for recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;

      survival of patients with advanced melanoma .Adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab improves the&#xD;
      relapse-free survival after complete resection of high-risk stage III melanoma .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab improves the tumor response rate and&#xD;
      overall survival of patients with advanced melanoma but is associated with a higher incidence&#xD;
      of immune related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have distinct immunological mechanisms that can be revealed by&#xD;
      analyzing TCR usage in blood lymphocytes.&#xD;
