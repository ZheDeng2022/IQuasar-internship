      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are looking for new ways to control and eradicate malaria. They want to test&#xD;
      vaccines to block malaria transmission in adults in Mali. These vaccines work by inducing&#xD;
      antibodies in a person. The antibody is then taken up with blood by a mosquito that bites the&#xD;
      person. This blocks parasite development in the mosquito. This stops malaria transmission to&#xD;
      another person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and transmission-blocking activity of the&#xD;
      vaccines Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Malians ages 18-50 living in certain areas in Mali who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are not pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are not infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do not have evidence of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do not have history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria Comprehension Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (for participants in certain study groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to a study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for 12-16 months. For the first 7 months, they will have&#xD;
      between 1 and nine visits a month. The number depends on the month and on what group they are&#xD;
      in. For the rest of the months, they will have 1 monthly visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit includes a physical exam. Most include blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 3 doses of a study or comparator vaccine. They get the vaccine through&#xD;
      an injection in the upper arm. This occurs at their first visit, then 1 month later, and then&#xD;
      5 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants develop an injection site rash or reaction, photographs may be taken of the&#xD;
      site.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) would be a valuable tool for local&#xD;
      elimination or eradication of this disease, and may contain components that block&#xD;
      transmission to mosquitoes (such as Pfs25 or Pfs230) or that prevent human infection (such as&#xD;
      the vaccine RTS,S). Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes (and&#xD;
      gametocytes for Pfs230) in the mosquito stage of P. falciparum, are the lead candidates for a&#xD;
      malaria transmission blocking vaccine (TBV). Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M&#xD;
      have each been conjugated to P. aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with AS01. Our&#xD;
      ongoing experience with Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA in Malian adult trial participants, and&#xD;
      the extensive experience with the AS01 adjuvants in African children and adults, justify&#xD;
      conducting the first-in-human trial of Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian&#xD;
      adults. This dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      functional activity of these vaccines in Malian adults. Pfs25M-EPA + Pfs230D1M-EPA in AS01&#xD;
      will be assessed by mosquito feeding assays in Malian adults for evidence that they may&#xD;
      reduce the number of malaria transmission events in study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 305 subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites in Mali, West Africa to receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of a malaria transmission blocking vaccine (s): Pfs25M-EPA/AS01,&#xD;
      Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01, or simultaneous administration of Pfs25M-EPA/AS01 and Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01;&#xD;
      or a comparator vaccine (ENERGIX-B). Enrollment within each group will be staggered for&#xD;
      additional safety and subjects will only be enrolled into the co-administration group once&#xD;
      each individual dose has been administered. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months&#xD;
      after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse events and&#xD;
      serious adverse events. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by&#xD;
      ELISA against recombinant Pfs25, Pfs230, EPA, CSP, and B cell and T cell responses.&#xD;
      Functional activity of the induced antibodies will be assessed in TBV arms by standard&#xD;
      membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases, and activity that interrupts malaria transmission will be measured in all arms by&#xD;
      direct skin feeding assays in Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the open label safety cohorts (Arms 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b) will be&#xD;
      offered reenrollment for follow-up laboratory assessment to explore the duration of&#xD;
      immunogenicity and functional activity at approximately 9, 12 months post vaccination.&#xD;
      Following scheduled, intentional unblinding, subjects enrolled in Arms 2c, 2d, and 4c will be&#xD;
      provided the opportunity to re-enroll for a fourth vaccination (Arm 2c and 2d with 40&#xD;
      microgram dose of Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01; Arm 4c with Menatctra) approximately 1 year post&#xD;
      vaccination #3. Subjects in these arms will also be eligible to re-enroll for follow up of&#xD;
      duration of immunogenicity and functional activity at approximately 9, 12 months post&#xD;
      vaccination if they choose not to enroll to recive the booster vaccination. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed similarly to the previous year for safety, immunogenicity, and functional activity.&#xD;
