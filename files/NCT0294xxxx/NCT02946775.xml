      Specific Aim 1. To define and characterize the etiologic agents of community acquired&#xD;
      bacteremic syndromes in young Nigerian children Hypothesis 1a: the role of&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable infections such as those caused by the Pneumococcus, Hib in the etiology&#xD;
      of CABS is currently underestimated due to widespread use of non-prescription antibiotics.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: Salmonella species are the leading cause of persistent febrile illness (fever&#xD;
      &gt; 2 weeks) in young Nigerian children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To determine the role of respiratory viruses in promoting the severity of&#xD;
      bacteremic and radio-logic pneumonia Hypothesis 2: Influenza viruses promote the severity of&#xD;
      bacteremic pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To determine acute host inflammatory response profiles in CABS associated&#xD;
      with respiratory distress Hypothesis 3a: Bacteremia induces a pattern of host inflammatory&#xD;
      profile that is distinct from those induced by malaria or respiratory viral infections.&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Clinical presentation and outcome (death, survival or prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization) is associated with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine and&#xD;
      chemokine dissonance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global burden of childhood deaths is largely borne by developing countries. Of the&#xD;
      estimated 10 million deaths that occur in children aged less than 5 years, over 90% of these&#xD;
      occur in developing countries and more than half of these in sub Saharan Africa. Causes of&#xD;
      these deaths have been largely classified based on syndrome presentation, such as pneumonia,&#xD;
      malaria, diarrhea, meningitis and septicemia and only recently have attempts been made to&#xD;
      define the etiologic pathogens that are responsible for these deaths, an important step to&#xD;
      implementing primary prevention. In sub Saharan Africa, malaria has for a long time been&#xD;
      perceived as the leading cause of childhood deaths but recent studies from Kenya suggest that&#xD;
      more deaths are in fact caused by bacteremia. However, disease burden varies by region and&#xD;
      disease burden perceptions also vary, particularly in malaria endemic regions where clinical&#xD;
      presentation of acute malaria, pneumonia and sepsis are often indistinguishable. The&#xD;
      situation is compounded further in regions where malaria is present all-year round where&#xD;
      children who are bacteremic may also have malaria parasitemia and healthy children may have&#xD;
      asymptomatic parasitemia. These complex and overlapping features present a challenge for&#xD;
      efficient clinical management and implementation of appropriate preventive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most developing countries, due to lack of local data, clinical management recommendations&#xD;
      are often obtained from the World Health Organization for common conditions based on the&#xD;
      integrated management of childhood illness approach 3. In such settings, diagnosis is based&#xD;
      on a limited number of clinical syndromes. However, because seriously ill children often meet&#xD;
      criteria for several clinical syndromes, each of which could be caused by several viral or&#xD;
      bacterial pathogens, treatment is empiric and management approach is non-specific. A key&#xD;
      component of clinical management in malaria endemic areas with high incidence of invasive&#xD;
      bacterial disease is the initiation of antibiotic treatment and anti-malarials. While this&#xD;
      approach provides an easy scheme, because it is not pathogen-specific there is a significant&#xD;
      risk of promoting long-term antibiotic resistance due to over prescription of antibiotics and&#xD;
      paradoxically, there is also the risk of increased mortality and morbidity due to&#xD;
      inappropriate medication. An etiology-based management approach would be more effective and&#xD;
      also provide data to explore primary preventive measures such as immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causes of bacteremia vary from reports in several sub-Saharan countries with high under-five&#xD;
      childhood mortality. These include studies from Malawi and the Central African Republic where&#xD;
      Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) predominate and some reports from Nigeria where staphylococcus&#xD;
      aureus has been the leading cause of bacteremia in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only a few studies from Nigeria, the most populated country in sub-Saharan Africa,&#xD;
      and these studies have not identified S. pneumoniae nor Hib as an important pathogen in the&#xD;
      etiology of community acquired bacteremic illness or invasive bacterial disease in young&#xD;
      children. The disparity in prevalence of different bacterial pathogens across countries is&#xD;
      likely due to the different study entry criteria, age groups, bacterial culture methods and&#xD;
      the prevalence of antibiotic exposure in the population. A high rate of antibiotic use is&#xD;
      likely to select for resistant bacterial strains in such populations. It is notable that of&#xD;
      all the studies that identified S. pneumoniae as a leading cause of bacteremia were studies&#xD;
      that utilized the automated Bactec culture system. Thus to determine the true burden of&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable bacterial disease in such a setting would warrant the use of&#xD;
      culture-based and molecular microbiology techniques that would overcome the problem of poor&#xD;
      sensitivity secondary to partially treated infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the childhood illnesses commonly associated with bacteremia, pneumonia is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death, with Streptococcus pneumonia making a significant contribution to these&#xD;
      deaths in reports from the Gambia but limited data from the West African sub region. Thus&#xD;
      this study will focus on providing further understanding of the etiologic agents of&#xD;
      bacteremia and pneumonia. Determination of the cause of pneumonia remains a challenge, since&#xD;
      bacterial blood culture, the current &quot;gold standard&quot; is useful only when when pneumonia is&#xD;
      associated with bacteremia and is positive only in about 10-15% of cases. The vast majority&#xD;
      of pneumonias are not associated with bacteremia and to ascertain cause in these cases&#xD;
      warrants the use of lung aspirates, a very specific but invasive procedure used only in&#xD;
      research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia is made using the WHO guideline, which is very&#xD;
      sensitive but poorly specific, only a fraction of these have any radio-logic abnormality and&#xD;
      a variable smaller fraction still, have a confluent alveolar density that culminates in a&#xD;
      lobar consolidation. When the lung consolidation is readily assessable to the chest wall, the&#xD;
      more sensitive and specific approach for the etiologic diagnosis is the use of a percutaneous&#xD;
      lung aspirate which is considered invasive and only used in research settings. This approach&#xD;
      improved etiologic diagnosis from 18% with the use of blood culture alone to 52%. Since this&#xD;
      procedure is invasive and reserved for only selected cases, the causes of most non-bacteremic&#xD;
      pneumonia remains poorly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the population level, another approach for determining the burden of disease-attributable&#xD;
      to an etiologic agent in a population is the use of an efficacious vaccine. For example, in&#xD;
      The Gambia, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine efficacy trial was associated with 37%&#xD;
      reduction in radio-logic pneumonia and 16% reduction in all-cause childhood mortality; an&#xD;
      important testament to the under-estimation of the true disease burden attributable to the&#xD;
      pneumococcus and the poor sensitivity of the current diagnostic methods for the detection of&#xD;
      invasive pneumococcal disease in young children. While the development and application of&#xD;
      these new generation vaccines are a major advancement with a huge potential for saving&#xD;
      several thousands of lives, they also provide a sensitive tool for probing the burden of&#xD;
      vaccine-attributable preventable disease in a population but are very expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of the causes of pneumonia in childhood presents a further challenge as&#xD;
      other agents such as viruses have often been identified from respiratory secretions but their&#xD;
      role in the patho-genesis of severe pneumonia in developing countries is less well defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the host immune responses to infection is critical to providing insight into&#xD;
      treatment modalities, since these responses and not necessarily the pathogen, determine&#xD;
      outcome. This observation is further supported by the observation that prompt diagnosis and&#xD;
      initiation of antibiotic treatment does not always avert death as recently reported from a&#xD;
      study from the Gambia, where delayed mortality was reported within 28 days of hospital&#xD;
      discharge after appropriate in-patient care at a hospital. The reason for these delayed&#xD;
      deaths is unknown but prolonged immunologic dissonance (imbalance between pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines) is a likely contributing factor. This deserves further&#xD;
      investigation since if these delayed deaths are due to immunologic dissonance, these deaths&#xD;
      may be averted with the use of steroids or other immunomodulators, in addition to&#xD;
      antibiotics. Characterization of host inflammatory responses among children with community&#xD;
      acquired pneumonia may facilitate understanding of host inflammatory response, provide a&#xD;
      prognostic tool for clinicians or identify potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children presenting with an acute febrile illness, with respiratory distress in a malaria&#xD;
      endemic region may have severe malaria, bacteremia, sepsis and/or pneumonia. A number of&#xD;
      studies have explored acute inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin&#xD;
      but have reported significant overlap in serum concentration of these proteins in both&#xD;
      conditions to justify a diagnostic use for in such settings. While the clinical presentation&#xD;
      with respiratory distress in pneumonia and malaria may be similar, understanding the&#xD;
      molecular basis for this clinical sign could provide valuable information for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, community acquired bacteremic syndromes in malaria endemic regions of Africa&#xD;
      presents a diagnostic conundrum for physicians and pose an important clinical management&#xD;
      dilemma that warrants further evaluation. This study proposes to take advantage of new&#xD;
      molecular and genomic technology in addressing this challenge with the ultimate goal of&#xD;
      defining the etiologic agents of community acquired bacteremic syndromes in Nigerian children&#xD;
      and generating information on host inflammatory responses that would be useful in developing&#xD;
      primary and secondary preventative measures.&#xD;
