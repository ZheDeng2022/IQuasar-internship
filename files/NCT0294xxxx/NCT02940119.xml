  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in the neck and shoulders is a musculoskeletal disorder that affects a significant&#xD;
      number of individuals.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of PBMT (with a device&#xD;
      that combines low level laser therapy and light emitting diode therapy) in chronic pain&#xD;
      relief of musculoskeletal origin in the neck and shoulders area.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was carried out. Seventy-two&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain in neck and shoulder were recruited and randomized into two groups&#xD;
      (n = 36 each group), one group received active PBMT and another group received placebo PBMT&#xD;
      (with a device with same appearance of the actual laser, including any visible light).&#xD;
      Patients were treated at 9 different sites of 3 zones in the neck and shoulders area, twice a&#xD;
      week during 3 consecutive weeks with a PBMT device manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical™&#xD;
      (Solon - OH, USA). Primary outcome was intensity of pain using the Visual Analog Pain Scale&#xD;
      (VAS), secondary outcomes were range of motion (ROM) of the neck and shoulders and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with therapy employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size calculation: The success criterion was defined as a 30% or greater reduction in&#xD;
      VAS from baseline to the final evaluation and overall efficacy of the PBMT/sMF therapy was&#xD;
      considered successful if a minimal difference of 35% is found between the active and placebo&#xD;
      group. It was anticipated that about 55% of subjects in the active group and about 20% of&#xD;
      subjects in the placebo group would meet the individual success criteria and intended&#xD;
      application of a two-tailored test with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 33 eligible subjects per group was calculation31 and a subject&#xD;
      loss-to-follow-up of 10% was anticipated to bring the sample size to 36 subjects in each&#xD;
      group. To ensure statistically valid and representative data of the general population&#xD;
      sampled, a total of 72 subjects were enrolled in this study and stratified by Fitzpatrick&#xD;
      skin type as following: Lighter skinned individuals were into Fitzpatrick skin types I, II&#xD;
      and III, while darker skinned individuals were into Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V and VI.&#xD;
