    <textblock>
      Objective: Acute urinary retention (AUR) is a common problem in hospitalized patients. Either&#xD;
      indwelling urethral catheterization or clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) can be the&#xD;
      choice of treatment. In chronic urinary retention, most physicians prefer CIC to chronic&#xD;
      indwelling urethral catheter on the basis of the claim that the rate of catheter-associated&#xD;
      urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The patients were randomized into indwelling urethral catheter and CIC groups. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes of the study were catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria and CAUTI.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes were pain, hematuria, cloudy urine, and quality of life.&#xD;

      We queried the hospitalized patients in Ramathibodi Hospital who developed first-time AUR&#xD;
      from June 2014 to May 2015. Patients under 18 years of age with a history of urinary&#xD;
      retention, urinary tract infection, and poor compliance were excluded from this study. All&#xD;
      the patients gave their written informed consents. The patients were randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups depending on the type of assigned intervention: CIC and indwelling urethral&#xD;
      catheter groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were followed up after 2 weeks; urinalysis and urine culture were obtained&#xD;
      at the time of AUR and whenever the patients developed UTI-associated symptoms. The patients&#xD;
      with positive urine culture at the time of AUR were excluded from the study.&#xD;
