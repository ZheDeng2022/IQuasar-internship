  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to observe/measure the circadian pattern of sleep, Cortisol&#xD;
      and Melatonin in MDD subjects and Control subjects. We will also assess if controlled&#xD;
      exposure to light in MDD subjects (post-partum females, non- post-partum females and males)&#xD;
      will change these parameters using light glasses. In addition to the biological outcome&#xD;
      measures (sleep, cortisol and melatonin) we will also monitor sleep and depressive symptoms&#xD;
      in the research subjects for the duration of the protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will collect baseline hormone data and clinical data along with assessing&#xD;
      light exposure using a Daysimeter in MDD participants and control subjects. We will collect&#xD;
      baseline Daysimeter data for 5 days and then collect cortisol and melatonin levels in both&#xD;
      MDD subjects and Control Subjects. Control subjects will complete the study following the&#xD;
      sample collection. MDD participants will then have a light intervention (sham or active).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Daysimeter and hormone data collection, MDD subjects in each group will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into a non-treatment group or treatment group. While continuing to wear the&#xD;
      Daysimeter, all MDD subjects will wear assigned glasses for 2 hours prior to bedtime. The&#xD;
      subject will choose the bedtime hour and try and consistently wear the glasses at the same&#xD;
      time throughout the study. Subjects will then wear the assigned glasses in the am upon waking&#xD;
      for 1 hour. Following 7 days wearing the assigned glasses MDD subjects will repeat the sample&#xD;
      collection for Cortisol and Melatonin&#xD;
