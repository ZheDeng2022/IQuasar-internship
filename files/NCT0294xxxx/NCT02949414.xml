    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel tracheal replacement therapy using a cadaveric tracheal scaffold and patients own&#xD;
      mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample of the patients own bone marrow. The study is aimed&#xD;
      at treating patients who suffer from severe tracheal stenosis or malacia and for whom&#xD;
      conventional therapies are no longer adequate. A total of 4 patients will be treated during&#xD;
      the course of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hospital multi disciplinary team will review the medical history and available treatment&#xD;
      options for all potential patients and recommend whether they are suitable for the study.&#xD;
      Once patients are approved they will enter an 8 week screening period. During this period&#xD;
      bone marrow from the patient will be harvested and the manufacturing of the final graft&#xD;
      tissue will start. The manufacturing facility will use a cadaveric donated decellularised&#xD;
      tracheal scaffold (supplied by the NHS blood and transplant body) and the patients own cells&#xD;
      to make the final investigational product (graft).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product will be surgically grafted into the patient in place of the damaged tracheal&#xD;
      section. The graft will be supported by a stent for the first 6 months with replacements of&#xD;
      this stent occurring at week 8 and week 16 post-surgical procedure. Hospitalization for a&#xD;
      number of days will be required during this replacement steps. The patient will be followed&#xD;
      frequently post surgery to capture any safety and efficacy measures. Long term follow up will&#xD;
      continue up to 5 years post surgery.&#xD;
