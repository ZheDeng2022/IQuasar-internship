  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three events can be considered of major importance for patients after a hospitalization in an&#xD;
      AGU: death, hospital readmission, and institutionalization. Current published data do not&#xD;
      allow the clinician to simultaneously estimate the risk of hospital readmission,&#xD;
      institutionalization and death of an older patient according to his/her characteristics and&#xD;
      various complications that occurred during the hospitalization. However, clinicians often&#xD;
      need to estimate these risks at hospital discharge to adapt their therapeutic choices, their&#xD;
      proposals post-hospital care, and provide reliable and fair information to the patient and&#xD;
      his relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating simultaneously the hazard for each of these three events can be complex. Indeed, a&#xD;
      death event hinder the observation of re-hospitalization or institutionalization if death&#xD;
      occurs before these events. The death should be considered a competing risk in these&#xD;
      analyzes. Hospital readmission may modify the risk of death or institutionalization and&#xD;
      should be considered as an intermediate factor for these event. This complexity cannot be&#xD;
      accounted with classical statistical models, like logistic regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use more appropriate statistical models (multi-state models)&#xD;
      to better estimate simultaneously the risks of hospital readmission, institutionalization,&#xD;
      and death of a patient given after hospitalization in AGU, and to show that accuracy of these&#xD;
      estimations can be improved by taking into account complications that occurred during the&#xD;
      stay in AGU.&#xD;
