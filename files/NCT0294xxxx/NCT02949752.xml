    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to prospectively evaluate the effect of adjunct use of&#xD;
      Aripiprazole, as an agent to improve metabolic profile and induce weight loss in patients&#xD;
      established on atypical antipsychotics (Olanzapine, Clozapine and Risperidone).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a well described cluster of interrelated risk factors for&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The main components of MetS are&#xD;
      central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Individuals with MetS are&#xD;
      two to three times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke and five times more likely to&#xD;
      develop type 2 diabetes than those without. Metabolic abnormalities have often been&#xD;
      identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Since the introduction of second generation&#xD;
      antipsychotics, evidence has accumulated of their link with metabolic abnormalities. An&#xD;
      abnormality in glucose metabolism, particularly diabetes mellitus (DM), has received the most&#xD;
      attention. Other conditions such as cardiovascular morbidity, abnormal lipid metabolism and&#xD;
      obesity also have a serious impact on the physical health of individuals with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      Several pharmacological strategies are under investigation for countering the metabolic side&#xD;
      effects, of which antipsychotic Aripiprazole has shown good evidence, when switched to as&#xD;
      monotherapy, and also as an adjunct .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as an open label study. An open label exploratory design will help test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that use of adjunct Aripiprazole can help with reducing weight gain on&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics, and improve metabolic parameters. The number of patients in each arm&#xD;
      is designed to yield an 80% power to detect significant differences in weight from baseline&#xD;
      at P&lt;0.05. There is no randomisation, blinding or placebo control, as this study is planned&#xD;
      to test the initial hypothesis, which can inform further RCT's, if results are encouraging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will initially be screened to ensure that they fulfil the inclusion criterion,&#xD;
      and eligible participants will be entered into the 12 week study, where they will be&#xD;
      prescribed 5 mg Aripiprazole per day, in addition to their routine atypical antipsychotic.&#xD;
      The typical dose range of the routine atypical antipsychotics are clozapine 200-450 mg,&#xD;
      olanzapine 5-20mg and risperidone 2-16mg respectively. During the 12 week study, the dose of&#xD;
      the antipsychotic and Aripiprazole should stay unchanged. If the clinical situation warrants&#xD;
      a change in dose of antipsychotic or switch of antipsychotic, the participant will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. Atypical antipsychotic other than the ones under investigation will&#xD;
      be prohibited, as well as medications or supplements for weight loss or weight gain, or&#xD;
      medications known to have substantial propensity for weight changes. Benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      anticholinergics, sleep aides will generally be allowed. Antidepressants and mood stabilisers&#xD;
      at a stable dose, which patients were receiving prior to the study, will be allowed. Patients&#xD;
      at high risk of suicide or self-harm as assessed by the study investigator, will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study, as well as those with significant side effects from adjunct Aripiprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess mean change of weight from the baseline after&#xD;
      use of adjunct Aripiprazole. The secondary endpoints include changes in metabolic parameters&#xD;
      (waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels).Safety and tolerability will be measured by Simpson Angus Scale (SAS total score),&#xD;
      Side Effects Checklist, Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale&#xD;
      (AIMS), adverse events or serious adverse events reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate neurocognition via a brief battery of 2 tests - the digit&#xD;
      sequencing and symbol coding. These 2 tasks have been shown in a previous study to explain&#xD;
      76% of the variance of global neurocognition in a large sample of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In our local sample, it was similarly shown that these 2 tasks are valid,&#xD;
      representing 72% of the variance in global neurocognition in schizophrenia (unpublished&#xD;
      results). The avoidance of a language component in these 2 tasks is a significant strength in&#xD;
      choice of cognitive tasks as has been previously shown that the local population tend to&#xD;
      underperform on language-based cognitive tasks.&#xD;
