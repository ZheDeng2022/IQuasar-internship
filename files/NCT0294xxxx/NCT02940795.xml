  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of pregnant women in the United States are either overweight or obese at&#xD;
      conception with their offspring having greater adiposity at birth, a 2-fold greater risk of&#xD;
      later obesity and neonatal insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional wisdom holds that breast-milk composition is uniform; recently our group has&#xD;
      questioned this. An increase in consumption of dietary sugars including fructose over the&#xD;
      past 30 years has risen, and this has been associated with chronic metabolic and endocrine&#xD;
      disorders and phenotypic alterations that promote obesity and diabetes. However, no prior&#xD;
      studies have examined how maternal increases of sugars/fructose during lactation affects&#xD;
      breast-milk composition with potential transmission to the infant. The objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to comprehensively assess the presence and pharmacokinetics of sugars, including&#xD;
      fructose in human breast-milk in response to maternal consumption. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that a graded, dose-response relationship be-tween maternal adiposity and sugar&#xD;
      concentrations in breast-milk exist and that milk fructose concentrations are associated with&#xD;
      altered body composition in the first months of life. This proposal, guided by compelling&#xD;
      preliminary data will examine the evidence linking high intakes of milk fructose with altered&#xD;
      metabolism and early obesity by pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) Test novel relationships&#xD;
      between breast-milk sugars and changes in infant fat mass and 2) Characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of milk sugars after consuming a 20 oz. cola. These aims are significant&#xD;
      given the intractability of obesity/diabetes and a potentially identifiable novel target,&#xD;
      making for a clear but powerful public message to reduce sugary beverage consumption during&#xD;
      lactation.&#xD;

      One of the most highly effective preventive measures a mother can make in protecting the&#xD;
      health of her infant and herself is to breastfeed. Despite extensive research on breast-milk,&#xD;
      limited information beyond basic micro/macronutrient composition currently exists in the&#xD;
      literature. Breast-milk is a complex, non-uniform biological substance. In prior studies the&#xD;
      PI has shown significant associations be-tween non-nutritive constituents in breast-milk&#xD;
      (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α, insulin, leptin) and body composition in infants starting at 4wks of age.&#xD;
      The putative causal influence of breastfeeding reducing obesity is mixed with no clear&#xD;
      probative evidence showing causal pathways. Despite many studies in this area, there are no&#xD;
      detailed studies that have examined the potential modifying role of maternal diet, especially&#xD;
      one high in sugars on the compositional makeup of the three largest breast-milk sugars&#xD;
      (glucose, galactose and lactose) with none to date looking at fructose. Animal models have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the obesogenic effect of maternal fructose consumption is transmitted to&#xD;
      offspring via breast-milk with fructose-fed lactating dams producing offspring with double&#xD;
      fasting insulin levels compared to control pups. This is relevant in humans because of the&#xD;
      increase in dietary sugar consumption that has occurred in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mother/infant cohort (n=37) has been established with detailed infant phenotypic body&#xD;
      composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and detailed breast-milk analysis (insulin,&#xD;
      leptin, IL-6, TNF-α but no milk sugars other than glucose) in exclusively breast feeding&#xD;
      mothers varying widely in BMI (19 to 44 kg/m2). Sampling of breast-milk and infant body&#xD;
      composition occurred at both 4 and 24wks. As a proof of concept, fructose was detected in&#xD;
      breast-milk from 9 of these mothers which was significantly related to infant body fat, which&#xD;
      is a novel finding to date and has never been reported in the literature. Building upon this&#xD;
      prior work this study will determine the concentration and pharmacokinetics of breast-milk&#xD;
      sugars after a test beverage is consumed.&#xD;
