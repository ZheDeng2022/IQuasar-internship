      To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the Test product - Methotrexate Tablets USP,&#xD;
      2.5 mg of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, compared to that of the corresponding Reference product -&#xD;
      Methotrexate Tablets USP 2.5 mg manufactured for DAVA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in patients with&#xD;
      mild to severe psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, who are already on established regimens of&#xD;
      2.5 mg every 12 hours for three doses per week under fasting conditions, and to assess their&#xD;
      bioequivalence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will continue their own established dose of 2.5 mg tablet at 12 hours intervals for&#xD;
      3 doses given as a course once weekly. This dosing regimen will be kept constant throughout&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0 of each period, the patient will be hospitalized/ housed in the clinical&#xD;
      facility/hospital, so patient will be administered IP dose on day 1 under supervision of&#xD;
      trained study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In supervised dosing, patient will be administered oral dose of Methotrexate Tablet 2.5 mg&#xD;
      (Test or Reference product as per randomization schedule) with approximately 240 mL of water&#xD;
      at ambient temperature in sitting position. Mouth check will be done by investigator/&#xD;
      designee followed by IP administration to verify dosing compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be advised to take two subsequent doses of the locally approved drug at&#xD;
      every 12 hours of interval after the administration of study drug on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance to subsequent two doses of locally approved Methotrexate tablets 2.5 mg will be&#xD;
      ensured as below in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose which is to be given 12 hours after IP administration (Second dose) will be&#xD;
      administered inside clinical facility after collection of 12 hours post-dose PK sample under&#xD;
      supervision of trained study personnel. The next dose (third dose) will be provided to the&#xD;
      patients with the instruction to take the same on their own. Telephonic follow-up will be&#xD;
      made on the next day for this third dose. The same will be documented in the patient dosing&#xD;
      log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In period I, patient will be housed on day 0 at least 12 hours prior to IP dosing scheduled&#xD;
      on day 1 and will remain in clinical facility till last PK sample on day 1. Patient will be&#xD;
      checked out on day 1 after last PK blood sample collection followed by administration of&#xD;
      second dose of locally approved Methotrexate 2.5 mg tablet. The third dose of locally&#xD;
      approved Methotrexate 2.5 mg tablet should be taken by patient on their own approximately 12&#xD;
      hours after the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedure will be followed in period II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a period of at least 7 days between first dosing (IP administration) in both&#xD;
      the study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have to stay hospitalized for a period of 2 days and 1 night in each study&#xD;
      period for their convenience and close safety monitoring.&#xD;
