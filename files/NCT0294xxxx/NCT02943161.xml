  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether treatment with L-citrulline, which is an amino acid found in&#xD;
      some foods, can increase levels of L-arginine and thereby restore the concentration of nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) in the airways.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that some obese asthmatics have a metabolic imbalance in which L-arginine&#xD;
      levels are reduced. L-arginine is an amino acid that is used to make NO, a gas that is&#xD;
      normally made in the bronchi and ensures that the lungs function properly. In this pilot&#xD;
      study subjects with asthma that have an increased body mass index compatible with being&#xD;
      obese, will be invited to participate in a short open-label treatment with 15g/day of&#xD;
      L-citrulline for two weeks. Study participants will be asked to do lung function testing and&#xD;
      donate blood before and after taking the supplement. L-citrulline is safe and well tolerated&#xD;
      and has been used at much higher doses without significant side effects.&#xD;
