      Evaluate the effect of the NxThera BPH Rezum System on prostate tissue in subjects suffering&#xD;
      from LUTS symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with BPH symptoms were treated with the Rezum device with a range of thermal&#xD;
      energies (as measured by calorie output) to optimize the setting for maximum lesion size with&#xD;
      minimal intra and post-procedure discomfort. Lesion size and ablated tissue resorption rate&#xD;
      was followed post-procedure at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in International Prostate Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, annually to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scores were recorded at Baseline to 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, then annually to 5 years. The mean change in IPSS was calculated.&#xD;
The IPSS is a validated questionnaire used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Scoring ranges from 0 to 35 with overall scores of 0-7 correlated to mildly symptomatic, 8-19 correlated to moderately symptomatic and 20-35 correlated to severely symptomatic. A reduction in score from baseline corresponds to improved outcome post procedure.</description>

    <time_frame>Procedure Day, 1 day post procedure, 1 week post procedure, 1 month post procedure, 3 months post procedure ,6 months post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-procedural and post-procedural pain for each subject was assessed using the Wong Baker Pain Rating scale (0-10 with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst pain imaginable). Each subject selected the response on the pain scale that he felt best represented his pain level. Unless otherwise noted, the subjects were not given pain medications or anesthesia. All subjects were given an anti-anxiety medication plus a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) pre-procedure.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Requiring Catheterization Post Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day post procedure, 1 week post procedure, 1 month post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects were kept at the clinic for observation for 24 hours post-procedure. The number of subjects requiring post-procedure catheterization were recorded.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post Procedure Catheterization Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the duration (days) of catheterization for subjects who required catheterization post procedure. Post-procedure catheterization was allowed if the Principal Investigator determined that the subject had symptoms of retention (defined as failure to void within 8 hours post procedure) or required catheterization for other safety reasons.</description>

    <description>The Rezūm System is designed to treat patients with bothersome urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The Rezūm System utilizes radiofrequency current to generate &quot;wet&quot; thermal energy in the form of water vapor, which is then injected into the transition zone and/or median lobe of the prostate tissue in controlled 9-second doses. The vapor that is injected into the prostate tissue rapidly disperses through the interstitial space between the tissue cells. As the vapor cools, it condenses immediately on contact with tissue and the stored thermal energy is released, denaturing the cell membranes and causing cell death.&#xD;
The denatured cells are absorbed by the body, which reduces the volume of prostate tissue adjacent to the urethra. The vapor condensation process also causes a rapid collapse of vasculature in the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This single arm, single center interventional study recruited subjects who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and consented to participate. Subjects on BPH medication underwent a washout period prior to treatment. Subjects who successfully completed the washout period and still met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Subjects were considered officially enrolled only if treatment with the NxThera Rezūm System was attempted.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Change in International Prostate Symptom Score</title>
        <description>International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scores were recorded at Baseline to 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, then annually to 5 years. The mean change in IPSS was calculated.&#xD;
The IPSS is a validated questionnaire used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Scoring ranges from 0 to 35 with overall scores of 0-7 correlated to mildly symptomatic, 8-19 correlated to moderately symptomatic and 20-35 correlated to severely symptomatic. A reduction in score from baseline corresponds to improved outcome post procedure.</description>

            <title>Rezum Treatment</title>
            <description>Participants underwent the Rezūm transurethral needle ablation procedure to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. They were followed for 5 years for adverse events and quality of life data.&#xD;
Rezum System: The Rezūm System is designed to treat patients with bothersome urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The Rezūm System utilizes radiofrequency current to generate &quot;wet&quot; thermal energy in the form of water vapor, which is then injected into the transition zone and/or median lobe of the prostate tissue in controlled 9-second doses. The vapor that is injected into the prostate tissue rapidly disperses through the interstitial space between the tissue cells. As the vapor cools, it condenses immediately on contact with tissue and the stored thermal energy is released, denaturing the cell membranes and causing cell death.&#xD;
The denatured cells are absorbed by the body, which reduces the volume of prostate tissue adjacent to the urethra. The vapor condensation process also causes a rapid collapse of vasculature in the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure.</description>

            <description>Participants underwent the Rezūm transurethral needle ablation procedure to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. They were followed for 5 years for adverse events and quality of life data.&#xD;
Rezum System: The Rezūm System is designed to treat patients with bothersome urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The Rezūm System utilizes radiofrequency current to generate &quot;wet&quot; thermal energy in the form of water vapor, which is then injected into the transition zone and/or median lobe of the prostate tissue in controlled 9-second doses. The vapor that is injected into the prostate tissue rapidly disperses through the interstitial space between the tissue cells. As the vapor cools, it condenses immediately on contact with tissue and the stored thermal energy is released, denaturing the cell membranes and causing cell death.&#xD;
The denatured cells are absorbed by the body, which reduces the volume of prostate tissue adjacent to the urethra. The vapor condensation process also causes a rapid collapse of vasculature in the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure.</description>

            <description>Participants underwent the Rezūm transurethral needle ablation procedure to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. They were followed for 5 years for adverse events and quality of life data.&#xD;
Rezum System: The Rezūm System is designed to treat patients with bothersome urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The Rezūm System utilizes radiofrequency current to generate &quot;wet&quot; thermal energy in the form of water vapor, which is then injected into the transition zone and/or median lobe of the prostate tissue in controlled 9-second doses. The vapor that is injected into the prostate tissue rapidly disperses through the interstitial space between the tissue cells. As the vapor cools, it condenses immediately on contact with tissue and the stored thermal energy is released, denaturing the cell membranes and causing cell death.&#xD;
The denatured cells are absorbed by the body, which reduces the volume of prostate tissue adjacent to the urethra. The vapor condensation process also causes a rapid collapse of vasculature in the treatment zone, resulting in a bloodless procedure.</description>
