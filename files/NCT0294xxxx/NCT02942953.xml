      The diaphragmatic pacemaker (DP) has proven its utility in replacing mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (MV) in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&#xD;
      (ALS), by improving the patients quality of life and reducing morbi-mortality and the&#xD;
      associated health care costs. The anesthetic management of these patients and the&#xD;
      particularities of the surgical procedure represent an anesthetic challenge. The objective of&#xD;
      our study is to analyze the management and the intraoperative complications in the patients&#xD;
      with DP in our institution.&#xD;

      Patients included are part of a program developed by the Spinal Cord Injury Unit of the&#xD;
      Institut Guttmann of placement and strengthening of the diaphragm with NeuRx® Diaphragm&#xD;
      Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System (Synapse Biomedical, Oberlin, OH, USA) device for patients&#xD;
      suffering from neuromuscular disorders or upper spinal cord injuries dependent on MV. All of&#xD;
      them were preselected by a multidisciplinary expert committee after the assessment of their&#xD;
      clinical history and the evaluation of the phrenic nerve function using two complementary&#xD;
      techniques like phrenic nerve stimulation and fluoroscopic evaluation of diaphragm movement.&#xD;
      Pediatric patients were the exception, since they underwent surgery in order to obtain a&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis on the phrenic nerve functionality. Patients were admitted in the center&#xD;
      24 hours prior to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure of DP implantation consists in placing four intramuscular electrodes,&#xD;
      two in each hemidiaphragm, using a conventional abdominal laparoscopy with carbon dioxide&#xD;
      insufflation at 10 L/minute speed and pressure up to 15 mmHg. Four ports are inserted: one&#xD;
      for the optical equipment, two for the mapping electrode and electrode insertion instruments&#xD;
      and a smaller sized port as an exit site for the wires of the electrodes. Reverse&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position is required for the procedure. It consists in locating the optimum&#xD;
      point for electrode insertion. The process involves mapping between 30 and 50 different&#xD;
      points in each hemidiaphragm by applying an electric stimulus of 2-24 mA at 100 µsec pulse&#xD;
      widths11. It results in both qualitative and quantitative assessment of diaphragmatic&#xD;
      movement: qualitative through laparoscopy and quantitative using the external assessment of&#xD;
      the intraabdominal pressure during stimulation with temporal mapping electrode. Site of main&#xD;
      electrode is identified as the location of each hemidiaphragm's change of maximum pressure&#xD;
      and site of secondary electrode as replica of main site. Once the sites are identified in&#xD;
      each hemidiaphragm, intramuscular electrode placement phase is initiated. Response to desired&#xD;
      stimulation is checked subsequently. Finally the electrodes are tunneled out to the&#xD;
      corresponding percutaneous exit site and an electrocardiogram strip is recorded with all&#xD;
      electrodes active in order to confirm there is no capture of cardiac rhythm. In the case of&#xD;
      pediatric age patients equipment and incisions were adapted to patient's weight and size.&#xD;
      However the surgical procedure was the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room, heart rate (HR), non-invasive arterial pressure (NIAP),&#xD;
      pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SaO2) and capnography (Carescape Monitor B850, GE&#xD;
      Healthcare, Finland) were standardly monitored. In patients with previous history of ischemic&#xD;
      cardiopathology and/or difficult to manage autonomic dysreflexia crisis, invasive arterial&#xD;
      pressure was monitored through radial artery catheterization using the Seldinger technique&#xD;
      (Leathercath Arterial; Vygon Ecoven, France). In most cases no premedication was provided. In&#xD;
      pediatric patients prophylactic atropine was required for induction, it was given in doses of&#xD;
      0.01 mg/kg. Induction was carried out either intravenously with propofol in doses raging&#xD;
      1.5-2 mg/kg in adult patients and 3 mg/kg in pediatric patients or by inhalation with&#xD;
      sevoflurane in pediatric patients. After a prior priming of the circuit, a series of three&#xD;
      forced inspirations were carried out using reservoir bag at concentrations of 6% of the&#xD;
      anesthetic until reaching a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of 2.0-3.5%. Anesthetic&#xD;
      maintenance was carried out following anesthetist's criterion, with sevoflurane of 2-2.5% MAC&#xD;
      or continuous intravenous infusion with propofol for Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA)&#xD;
      maintaining the infusion at 10 mg/kg/h for 30 minutes, followed by 8 mg/kg/h for another 30&#xD;
      minutes and 6 mg/kg/h until the end of the intervention, maintaining bispectral index (BIS)&#xD;
      value of 40-60. Patients were disconnected from their usual ventilation system and&#xD;
      transferred to the GE Datex-Ohmeda Aespire 3000 (GE Healthcare, Finland) system on volume&#xD;
      control mode, with tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, respiratory rate between 10 and 15 breaths per&#xD;
      minute and PEEP +7 cmH₂O with a mixture of O2/air at 50% in order to reach oxygen saturation&#xD;
      superior to 95% before initiating the surgical procedure. Given the type of procedure, it was&#xD;
      attempted to minimize the use of muscle relaxants, since these are not required in patients&#xD;
      with tracheostomy. Rocuronium at 0.4 mg/kg at the anesthetist's criterion was used for&#xD;
      managing the airway in patients who needed orotracheal intubation (OTI). In these cases,&#xD;
      neuromuscular relaxation was monitored (NMT Neuromuscular Transmission MechanoSensor GE&#xD;
      Healthcare, Finland) and a Train of Four (TOF) measurement of 100% was obtained prior to&#xD;
      administering muscle relaxants. OTI was performed when TOF answer was 0 and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      mapping phase initiated solely if TOF answer was 4 and with a percentage superior to 90%.&#xD;
      When these levels of response were not achieved, sugammadex 2 mg/kg was used to reverse the&#xD;
      blocking in case of induction with rocuronium or neostigmine 0.04-0.07 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative analgesia was carried out using continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.5-1&#xD;
      µg/kg/min) until the end of the intervention. Surgeons infiltrated laparoscopic ports with&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.5% with vasoconstrictor before incision. Patients requiring OTI received a&#xD;
      fentanyl bolus (3 µg/kg) in the induction and in all cases at the end of the surgery a&#xD;
      fentanyl bolus (1.5 µg/kg) was administered in order to avoid postoperative hyperalgesia&#xD;
      associated to remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolated boluses of propofol (0.5-1 mg/kg) or fentanyl (1-1.5 µg/kg) were administered when&#xD;
      patients required anesthetic deepening for a correct tolerance of the laparoscopic technique&#xD;
      without using muscle relaxants. Patients received bolus of 5 mg ephedrine repeatedly until&#xD;
      normal values were reached if intraoperative arterial hypotension appeared, defined as a 20%&#xD;
      decrease of baseline or mean arterial pressure (MAP) inferior to 60 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dysreflexive events manifesting as hypertensive crisis with pressure 20% higher&#xD;
      than baseline associated to bradycardia were treated using anesthetic deepening and/or&#xD;
      hypotensive drugs (bolus of urapidil 25 mg every 10 minutes) until reaching a correct&#xD;
      pressure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the intervention all patients were connected to their usual MV, either invasive&#xD;
      or not, with supplemental oxygen. They also received intravenous analgesic treatment in the&#xD;
      ward with paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) dexketoprofen or&#xD;
      metamizole magnesium and tramadol as rescue medication during 24-48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the immediate postoperative period, following protocols a control X-ray was carried out in&#xD;
      order to rule out pneumothorax. If present, it was drained percutaneously. Patients remained&#xD;
      in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for at least two hours. They were transferred to ward&#xD;
      while maintaining continuous monitoring of ECG, NIAP and SaO₂ during 24 h once they were&#xD;
      aware and oriented in the three spheres and the following criteria were met: analgesia is&#xD;
      optimized visual analogue scale (VAS) inferior to 2), dysreflexive events and postoperative&#xD;
      spasms ruled out, arterial pressure is normalized, heart rate to baseline values and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation higher than 95%. Stimulation of diaphragm was initiated in the ward during the&#xD;
      first 3-4 days following surgery in SCI and after one week in ALS depending on the medical&#xD;
      team in charge of the stimulation process. Correct conditioning of the diaphragm and weaning&#xD;
      from MV required repeated sessions. Surgical team carried out a 15 days post-intervention&#xD;
      follow-up and given that it was a neuroprosthesis, they also did follow-ups one month and one&#xD;
      year after the surgery. Once patients were released, the team in charge of neurostimulation&#xD;
      carried out postoperative follow-ups at three, six and twelve months. Subsequently they&#xD;
      conducted annual controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information compiled included demographic data, ASA classification, diagnostic that led&#xD;
      to device placement, chronically used MV type and tracheostomy use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of anesthesia administered was also indicated, including specific accessory monitoring,&#xD;
      drugs used, airway management, surgery duration and placement or not of permanent electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All incidents or complications occurred during the procedure were also recorded, whether they&#xD;
      were related to anesthetic or surgical technique. During intraoperative period there were&#xD;
      recorded any arrhythmias related to electric stimulation during mapping phase, disadaptation&#xD;
      to MV or poor tolerance to the pneumoperitoneum (peak pressure &gt; 35 cmH2O and plateau&#xD;
      pressure &gt; 30 cmH2O, desaturation &lt; 90%) and presence of autonomic dysreflexia crisis related&#xD;
      to painful stimulus (blood pressure &gt; 20% of baseline or systolic blood pressure &gt; 155 mmHg&#xD;
      and diastolic blood pressure DBP &gt; 100 mmHg). As for surgical complications in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period, pneumothorax appearance was given special attention.&#xD;
