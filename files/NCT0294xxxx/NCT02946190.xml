    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized double-center, and observer-blind controlled pilot vaccine&#xD;
      trial in 11 to 15 years old healthy subjects to assess the immunogenicity of the genetically&#xD;
      detoxified pertussis toxin (rPT) included in a novel acellular pertussis vaccine (Pertagen®)&#xD;
      manufactured by BioNet-Asia when delivered by the intramuscular route to adolescents&#xD;
      previously primed and boosted with chemically-detoxified PT, along with Td-pur® and in&#xD;
      comparison with that of Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 0, eligible volunteers will undergo a venous bleed for the determination of baseline&#xD;
      values and enter the randomization scheme, being allocated to one of two groups: A (Pertagen®&#xD;
      + Td-pur®), B (Boostrix® dTpa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized participants will receive one dose of Pertagen® and Td-pur® (Group A) or 1 dose of&#xD;
      Boostrix® dTpa (Group B) by intramuscular injection in the deltoid. All subjects will be&#xD;
      observed in the Plateforme de Recherché Pédiatrique for 30 minutes after immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-immunization local and systemic reactions will be followed up for 7 days after&#xD;
      immunization. Adverse events will be followed for 28 days after immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 28, a second visit (study end visit) will take place for safety evaluation and blood&#xD;
      draw for immunogenicity evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draws performed on Day 0 (Baseline) and Day 28 will be used to evaluate immune response&#xD;
      to study vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary statistical analysis will be performed with visit 2 (Day 28) data to compare the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of one dose of Pertagen®, given simultaneously with Td-pur®, to&#xD;
      those elicited by Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant increase of pertussis incidence is reported in a growing number of countries.&#xD;
      This resurgence is considered as resulting from the limited durability of aP-vaccine-induced&#xD;
      immunity and is associated with increased mortality in young infants and morbidity at all age&#xD;
      groups. As the pertussis immunity acquired through immunization or infection is short-lived,&#xD;
      its maintenance or reactivation requires repeat boosting at regular time points. Thus, novel&#xD;
      strategies capable of reactivating pertussis immunity in older children, adolescents or&#xD;
      adults, including pregnant women, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A puzzling observation is that the efficacy of current acellular pertussis vaccines (which&#xD;
      contain chemically-detoxified pertussis toxoid (PT)) is higher in infants and children than&#xD;
      adolescents, in whom vaccine efficacy is limited and rapidly wanes. This may derive - at&#xD;
      least in part - from priming and repeat immunizations with acellular vaccines containing&#xD;
      chemically-detoxified PT and thus induction of antibodies specific of the&#xD;
      chemically-detoxified PT but unable to efficiently recognize the native PT expressed by B.&#xD;
      pertussis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of optimized acellular pertussis vaccines should thus include antigens with a&#xD;
      similar immunogenicity profile as native PT but deprived of its toxic properties. This is&#xD;
      best achieved through the genetic rather than chemical detoxification of PT, which results in&#xD;
      both nontoxic and immunogenic PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies have shown the good tolerability profile and the superior immunogenicity&#xD;
      profile of acellular pertussis vaccines including genetically-detoxified PT (rPT) in adults&#xD;
      and adolescents previously primed with whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines. As whole-cell&#xD;
      vaccines express native PT, whether the superior immunogenicity of rPT will be observed in&#xD;
      adolescents/adults previously primed with acellular pertussis vaccines containing&#xD;
      chemically-detoxified PT is of key importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II randomized, observer-blind controlled study to compare the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines including chemically or genetically-detoxified&#xD;
      pertussis toxin in adolescents aged 11-15 years. The primary objective is to assess the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the genetically detoxified pertussis toxin (rPT) included in a novel&#xD;
      acellular pertussis vaccine (Pertagen®) when delivered by the intramuscular route to&#xD;
      adolescents previously primed and boosted with chemically-detoxified PT, along with Td-pur®&#xD;
      and in comparison with that of Boostrix® dTpa. The secondary objectives are (1) to assess&#xD;
      safety of Pertagen® when administered with Td-pur® to adolescents as compared to Boostrix®&#xD;
      dTpa and (2) to assess the humoral responses elicited by Pertagen® when administered with&#xD;
      Td-pur® as compared to Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, exploratory immunological measures will also be performed (pending sufficient&#xD;
      or additional funding). These are anticipated to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The assessment of antibody titers to specific neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes&#xD;
           of PT, by competitive ELISA, before and after (Day 28) boosting with Pertagen® and&#xD;
           Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess cellular responses to PT before and after boosting with Pertagen® and&#xD;
           Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the frequency and phenotype of PT-specific memory B cell responses (as&#xD;
           compared to tetanus toxoid) before and after boosting with Pertagen® or Boostrix® dTpa&#xD;
           (i.e. at Day 0 and Day 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize changes in cellular responses following boosting with Pertagen® or&#xD;
           Boostrix® dTpa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three vaccines will be used in the study. The BioNet-Asia study vaccine (Pertagen®), Td-pur®&#xD;
      (Novartis/GSK) which will be concomitantly administered with the study vaccine, and the&#xD;
      control Boostrix® dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product Pertagen® will be manufactured, labeled, packaged and released&#xD;
      for clinical use by BioNet-Asia, in accordance with the requirements of Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practices.Both Td-pur® and Boostrix® dTpa vaccines used in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available in Switzerland and will be purchased for the study. One batch of each vaccine will&#xD;
      be used for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vaccines are presented in 0.5 mL pre-filled syringes to be administered by intramuscular&#xD;
      injection. The study vaccine Pertagen® and Boostrix® dTpa will be administered in the&#xD;
      non-dominant deltoid. If applicable, Td-pur® will be administered in the contralateral&#xD;
      deltoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 0, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the following&#xD;
      vaccine groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Pertagen® and Td-pur 30 volunteers Group 2 Boostrix® dTpa 30 volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list containing subject numbers and vaccine group assignments will be&#xD;
      established and provided to the clinical investigators. Each participant will be immunized&#xD;
      according to the vaccine group assignment. At study site, the Principal investigator will&#xD;
      designate the blinded and unblinded teams in order to keep the observer-blind design of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unblinded personal will be responsible for study vaccine preparation, handling, storage&#xD;
      and accountability, and immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinded team will be responsible for assessing adverse events. The laboratory staff&#xD;
      performing the immunological assays will also be blinded. After vaccination, volunteers will&#xD;
      be observed for 30 minutes at study site for any immediate post-immunization reactions.&#xD;
      Reactogenicity and safety will be assessed during study visits at the clinical trial unit&#xD;
      (CTU) on Day 0 and Day 28 after immunization. At Day 0 (Visit 1, vaccination day), a Diary&#xD;
      Card will be distributed to study volunteer to record post-immunization local and systemic&#xD;
      reactions and adverse events. At Day 28 (Visit 2), investigator will reconcile and transcribe&#xD;
      the Diary Card information in the CRF. Post-immunization local and systemic reactions will be&#xD;
      collected and monitored for 7 days after vaccination. All adverse events, including SAEs,&#xD;
      will be collected and monitored for 28 days after vaccination (until Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be contacted by phone at Day 7 to confirm that adverse reactions have&#xD;
      subsided. Should this not be the case, an unscheduled visit will be considered as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs and SAEs occurring within the 28 days following treatment and observed by the&#xD;
      Investigator or reported by the volunteer, whether or not attributed to study intervention,&#xD;
      will be recorded in the CRF. All AEs that result in a volunteer's withdrawal from the study&#xD;
      will be followed up until a satisfactory resolution occurs, or until a non-study related&#xD;
      causality is assigned (if the volunteer consents to this).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation This is a phase II randomized, observer-blind controlled pilot study&#xD;
      to compare the safety and immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines including chemically&#xD;
      or genetically-detoxified pertussis toxin in adolescents previously immunized with acellular&#xD;
      vaccines. The sample size for this study is based on clinical and practical considerations&#xD;
      and not on a formal statistical power calculation. Where applicable, 2-sided test at the 5%&#xD;
      significance level will be utilized with no multiplicity adjustment. P-values will be&#xD;
      considered exploratory only. Sixty volunteers will be randomized in total, with 30 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis The safety analysis will include all randomized subjects who have received a&#xD;
      dose of study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall percentage of subjects with at least one spontaneously reported adverse event,&#xD;
      with date of onset up to 28 days after vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals, by type of adverse event; by severity; and by causality. They will be&#xD;
      displayed by vaccine group as both frequencies and percentages on the ITT data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reported adverse events that start post-vaccination will be tabulated. If a given disease&#xD;
      is already reported as ongoing at the first visit on the medical history pages, it will be&#xD;
      counted and tabulated as a vaccine emergent adverse event only if it worsens after the&#xD;
      immunization with the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse event(s) will be described in&#xD;
      detail by vaccine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity analyses The primary immunogenicity endpoint will assess the immune response&#xD;
      to Pertagen® - as compared to Boostrix® dTpa - by measuring the Day 28 geometric mean&#xD;
      concentration (GMC) of neutralizing antibodies to PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other immunogenicity end-points include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GMCs of PT, FHA, tetanus and diphtheria-toxoid specific IgG antibodies measured by ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seroresponse rates of PT, FHA, tetanus and diphtheria-toxoid specific IgG antibodies&#xD;
           measured by ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reverse cumulative distribution curves of PT neutralizing antibodies, and of PT, FHA,&#xD;
           tetanus and diphtheria-toxoid IgG antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare PT-specific responses elicited by Pertagen® in adolescents previously&#xD;
           immunized (this study) or not (BioNet Phase II/III TDA202) by acellular pertussis&#xD;
           vaccines The following descriptive statistics will be provided for each variable: number&#xD;
           of subjects, percentages, mean, geometric mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,&#xD;
           maximum, and range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control and Quality Assurance Procedure Approved site-specific SOPs will be used at&#xD;
      clinical and laboratory sites. Monitoring will be performed according to ICH Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) by the Centre de Recherche Clinique (CRC) of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Geneva. Following a Monitoring Plan and written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the&#xD;
      clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance&#xD;
      with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The CTU will provide&#xD;
      direct access to all trial-related source data, documents and reports for the purpose of&#xD;
      monitoring and inspection by local and regulatory authorities.&#xD;
