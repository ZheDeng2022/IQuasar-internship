    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well ethyl icosapentate and physical activity work&#xD;
      in treating fatigue in patients with cancer that has spread from where it started to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Ethyl icosapentate and physical activity may provide more robust and&#xD;
      clinically effective improvement of cancer related fatigue, which may facilitate patients&#xD;
      continuing cancer therapy since it would be tolerated and effective in controlling disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of the combination of ethyl icosapentate (icosapent ethyl) 2 gm&#xD;
      orally daily plus physical activity (PA) for the reduction of cancer related fatigue (CRF)&#xD;
      (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue [FACIT-F] subscale) at the end of&#xD;
      8 weeks in patients with advanced cancer by comparing the difference between the FACIT-F&#xD;
      subscale score at baseline and at 57 +/- 5 days, between patients who will receive either&#xD;
      Icosapent ethyl plus physical activity and placebo plus physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction of using the combined&#xD;
      intervention for the reduction of cancer related fatigue in advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the effects of the combination of Icosapent ethyl 2 gm orally daily plus&#xD;
      physical activity on quality of life (QOL)-related variables, mood (HADS - Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      and Depression Inventory), quality of life domains (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -&#xD;
      General [FACT-G]), cancer related symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale - ESAS) in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the effects of combined intervention on serum C - reactive protein and&#xD;
      intracellular cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-a, IL-10, IL-1RA) before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore its side effects and tolerability of the combined study interventions in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the effect of multimodal therapy on body composition. VI. To explore the effect&#xD;
      of the proposed treatment in this study on the overall survival time in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive ethyl icosapentate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients complete resistance exercises 3 days per week and undergo walking program at least 5&#xD;
      days per week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, patients may optionally continue to receive ethyl&#xD;
      icosapentate, complete resistance exercises, and undergo walking program for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 8 weeks. Patients complete resistance exercises&#xD;
      3 days per week and undergo walking program at least 5 days per week for 8 weeks. After 8&#xD;
      weeks, patients may optionally receive ethyl icosapentate, complete resistance exercises, and&#xD;
      undergo walking program for 4 weeks as in Group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 8 weeks. Patients meet with an exercise&#xD;
      specialist during the first week to learn different stretching exercises and complete the&#xD;
      stretching exercises 3 days per week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, patients may optionally&#xD;
      receive ethyl icosapentate, complete resistance exercises, and undergo walking program for 4&#xD;
      weeks as in Group I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;

        <title>Cancer Related Fatigue</title>
        <description>Cancer related fatigue was measured using the 13 questions of Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue subscale on a four point Likert scale (0=not at all fatigue to 4= very much fatigued). We measured the difference in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue subscale score between baseline and 57±5 days, among patients who would receive either Icosapent ethyl plus physical activity and placebo plus physical activity.</description>
