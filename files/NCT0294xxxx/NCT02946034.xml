      Open-label experimental trial of 12 weeks of Viekira Pak treatment ± ribavirin or Mavyret for&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir,&#xD;
      dasabuvir (referred to as Viekira Pak) ± ribavirin or Glecaprevir / Pibrentasvir (referred to&#xD;
      as Mavyret) for adults with advanced CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&#xD;
      less than 45ml/min that are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and to determine&#xD;
      the effect of treatment on traditional and novel markers of kidney function and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk in patients with advanced CKD. During the course of this&#xD;
      prospective, single arm treatment trial, we will measure currently accepted markers of kidney&#xD;
      function and novel biomarkers of CKD progression to determine if they improve with&#xD;
      eradication of HCV.&#xD;

          <description>Measure of novel biomarkers of incident and progressive CKD and liver disease to determine if eradication of HCV infection changes the measures of chronic inflammation associated with progressive end-organ disease.&#xD;
To calculate the average change, the difference between baseline values and the average of 12-weeks post treatment and 40-weeks post treatment were found for each patient. These differences were then averaged, as shown below.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our study has several limitations. Our pilot trial was limited by the small number of patients enrolled. Additionally, two subjects were lost to follow-up, decreasing the power of our analysis comparing pre- and post-treatment kidney function and biomarkers. Thus, the analysis presented is descriptive in nature. The analysis is limited by the absence of a control group.</limitations_and_caveats>
