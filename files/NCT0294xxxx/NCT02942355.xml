  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      combining anastrozole and palbociclib in the following two cohorts: Cohort A) as first-line&#xD;
      therapy and Cohort B) as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy in postmenopausal&#xD;
      patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Pre- and perimenopausal&#xD;
      women must receive therapy with an LHRH agonist. The LHRH agonist will be by choice for an&#xD;
      approved LHRH agonist administered according to its respective prescribing information.&#xD;
      Following informed consent and eligibility check, subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort&#xD;
      A or Cohort B.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled over an enrollment period of 18-24 months. The study&#xD;
      is planned to enroll up to 25 patients in Cohort A (upfront) and 15 patients in Cohort B&#xD;
      (maintenance). Subjects will be recruited through Levine Cancer Institute locations and&#xD;
      through referrals. Women of any race or ethnic origin who meet the study criteria may&#xD;
      participate in this clinical trial. Males will not be eligible for this study. Breast cancer&#xD;
      in men is rare and the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in males is limited. Children are not&#xD;
      included in this clinical trial because the effects of palbociclib are not known in the&#xD;
      pediatric population, but may be eligible for other pediatric trials.&#xD;

                  postmenopausal females;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented bilateral oophorectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medically confirmed ovarian failure OR premenopausal or perimenopausal, i.e., not&#xD;
                  meeting the criteria for being postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal or perimenopausal women can be enrolled if amenable to be treated with&#xD;
             an LHRH agonist. Patients must have commenced treatment with an LHRH agonist at least&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytological confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of&#xD;
             metastatic disease. Locally advanced disease not amenable to resection is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of ER-positive and, or PR-positive tumor based on most recent tumor&#xD;
             biopsy (unless bone-only disease). ER and PR assays are considered positive if there&#xD;
             is at least 1 percent positive in the tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation of HER2-negative tumor based on most recent tumor biopsy. Tumor must not&#xD;
             demonstrate overexpression of HER2 by either IHC (immunohistochemistry) or in-situ&#xD;
             hybridization (ISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous treatment for metastatic disease for Cohort A.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort A: previous treatment with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or&#xD;
                  neoadjuvant setting is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort B: only first-line chemotherapy (can be single-agent or a combination&#xD;
                  regimen) for metastatic disease with response (defined as a complete response or&#xD;
                  partial response by RECIST version 1.1, or stable disease for six months or more&#xD;
                  from this regimen) and chemotherapy discontinued for 21 days is allowed; patients&#xD;
                  may have received prior systemic therapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Cohort A, measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1, or bone-only&#xD;
             disease prior to start of study treatment. Patients with bone-only metastatic cancer&#xD;
             must have a lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesion that can be accurately assessed by CT&#xD;
             or MRI. Patients with bone-only disease who have blastic-only metastasis are not&#xD;
             eligible. Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other loco regional&#xD;
             therapy will only be deemed measurable if progression at the treated site after&#xD;
             completion of therapy is clearly documented. For Cohort B, measurable disease as&#xD;
             defined by RECIST version 1.1, or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has archival tumor tissue available that is formalin-fixed and&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded. Biopsy sample taken at the time of presentation with recurrent or&#xD;
             metastatic disease is recommended.For patients who do not have archival tissue, tissue&#xD;
             from a fresh biopsy should be obtained prior to study treatment initiation, if it can&#xD;
             be safely attained using local anesthesia only. One exception is those patients with&#xD;
             bone-only disease for whom provision of previous archival tissue would be acceptable.&#xD;
             Serial fresh tumor tissue samples will be collected in patients with lesions amenable&#xD;
             for a biopsy who consent to such a procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;

                  creatinine levels &gt; 1.5X ULN [CrCl should be calculated per institutional&#xD;
                  standard; GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN; AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less&#xD;
                  than or equal to 3X ULN (less than or equal to 5X ULN if liver metastases&#xD;
                  present); Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5X ULN (less than or equal&#xD;
                  to 5X ULN if liver or bone metastases present)&#xD;

             eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
             CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI&#xD;
             or CT) during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of food or drugs known to be potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and drugs known to be potent&#xD;
             CYP3A4 inducers (for examples, see the Prohibited Medications Section)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Impairment of gastro-intestinal function or GI disease that may significantly alter&#xD;
             the absorption of palbociclib, such as history of GI surgery which may result in&#xD;

             bowel syndrome, unresolved nausea, vomiting, active inflammatory bowel disease or&#xD;
             diarrhea of CTCAE Grade &gt; 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation.&#xD;

             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or&#xD;
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 4 weeks before&#xD;
             treatment initiation in this study.&#xD;
