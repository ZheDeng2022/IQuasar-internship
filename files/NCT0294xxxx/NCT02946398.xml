      Procedures for identification of high-risk elderly patients in the emergency department are&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to identify early risk factors associated with an adverse outcome in elderly patients&#xD;
      who visit the emergency department (ED). Second, we aim to find practical tools to identify&#xD;
      those elderly patients who are at risk for an adverse outcome in an early stage (by applying&#xD;
      and testing triage and risk stratification scores, clinical impression and laboratory&#xD;
      results).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the results of this study, we intend to develop a clinical prediction model to identify&#xD;
      older emergency department patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly patients (≥65 years of age) constitute an increasing population in emergency&#xD;
      departments (EDs) in many countries. These patients are largely different from younger&#xD;
      patients and undoubtedly need different approaches in acute care. Commonly used triage&#xD;
      systems are not validated in elderly patients. We hypothesize that this factor contributes to&#xD;
      a lack of recognition of patients at risk for adverse events or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At first, we will try to identify early risk factors associated with adverse outcome&#xD;
           such as age, the premorbid state (comorbidity, living status and cognitive/functional&#xD;
           state), medication use, vital signs, and number of previous visits to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly, we will investigate the discriminating power of several triage and risk&#xD;
           stratification scores. In our study, we will retrieve and validate the following triage&#xD;
           and risk stratification scores: The Manchester Triage System (MTS) triage score, the&#xD;
           Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and the&#xD;
           Identification of Seniors At Risk-Hospitalised Patients (ISAR-HP) score for all&#xD;
           hospitalized patients. Furthermore, we will calculate four well-known disease specific&#xD;
           stratification scores: The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding (GBS Score) for patients with an&#xD;
           upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the Abbreviated Mortality ED Sepsis (abbMEDS) score and&#xD;
           Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the Confusion, Urea,&#xD;
           Respiration, Blood pressure, Age &gt;65 years (CURB-65) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thirdly, we will investigate the predictive value of the clinical impression of&#xD;
           professionals (doctor/nurse) and the disease perception of patient/companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fourth, we will investigate the predictive value of laboratory tests (routine tests and&#xD;
           biomarkers like lactate, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP),&#xD;
           high-sensitivity troponin (hs-TnT), procalcitonin (PCT) and d-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At last, we intend to develop a clinical prediction model for short-term mortality and&#xD;
           test the predictive ability of this model for the other adverse outcomes/endpoints. This&#xD;
           model will be validated in an external cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a multi-center prospective observational cohort study. The study will take&#xD;
      place in Zuyderland MC in Heerlen and Maastricht UMC+ in the Netherlands. On presentation to&#xD;
      the ED the patients will be given information about the study and informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed. The patient or family member/companion, the nurse and the doctor will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a questionnaire in the ED (5 questions for patient/family and 9 questions for doctor&#xD;
      or nurse). These questions will be used for evaluation of the clinical impression of the&#xD;
      doctor/nurse and disease perception by the patient/companion. At the ED, 2 extra venous&#xD;
      samples and one arterial blood gas sample will be taken in patients participating in the&#xD;
      study in Zuyderland M.C. Blood gas analysis will take place immediately and the results will&#xD;
      be presented to the attending doctor. Analysis of the biomarkers from the venous blood&#xD;
      samples will take place after a few weeks and the results will be blinded in this study.&#xD;
      Routine laboratory test will be analyzed in both hospitals. During the days and weeks after&#xD;
      inclusion, data will be obtained from patients medical records. During the days and weeks&#xD;
      after inclusion, data will be obtained from patients medical records. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed up for 30 days and if possible for one year.&#xD;
