  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this single institution study is to evaluate boys with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)&#xD;
      diagnosed early in life, and to prospectively monitor them to determine parameters that will&#xD;
      facilitate earlier detection of the childhood cerebral form of the disease. These at-risk&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed yearly through travel to the University of Minnesota, where plasma&#xD;
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies, MRI based imaging and neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital and&#xD;
      Clinics. The MRI and lumbar puncture to obtain CSF will be obtained under sedation. In&#xD;
      addition, at intervening 6 months intervals information will be obtained remotely, including&#xD;
      surveys and MRI's in their home location. Also at that time blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      locally and shipped to the University of Minnesota for study. There is no therapeutic intent&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

        While this study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov, no specific patient&#xD;
        recruitment materials will be utilized. However, various Foundations and Patient Groups&#xD;
        will be contacted. In addition, we will work with providers, neurologists, genetic&#xD;
        counselors, etc. in the areas where newborn screening is taking place. We will also be&#xD;
        available for families and providers at other institutions where a diagnosis may be made.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Boys with confirmed adrenoleukodystrophy, as determined by very long chain fatty acid&#xD;
             (VLCFA) analysis and/or genotyping. Genotyping is not necessary for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 1 and 5 years of age, inclusive at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to undergo a sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English as primary language of the household, to maximize consistency of the&#xD;
             neuropsychological/developmental testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written parental/guardian consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of cerebral disease at time of enrollment - patients over 3 years of age must&#xD;
             have an MRI within 4 months of signing consent to confirm that there is no evidence of&#xD;
             cerebral disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to travel to the University of Minnesota once a year for&#xD;
             the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of cerebral disease by standard T2/FLAIR MRI. If a subject develops cerebral&#xD;
             ALD during the study, they will come off study, as it is anticipated that they would&#xD;
             be considered for transplantation.&#xD;
