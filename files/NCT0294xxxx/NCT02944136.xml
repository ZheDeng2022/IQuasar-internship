  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of a stepped collaborative&#xD;
      care intervention, versus enhanced usual care arm, to reduce depression of cancer caregivers.&#xD;
      Biobehavioral factors will include assessment of changes in health behaviors and biomarkers&#xD;
      of inflammation. The investigators will also include measures metabolic abnormalities and&#xD;
      clinical markers of CVD. The investigators expect few cardiac events during the study period.&#xD;
      The investigators will also measure other health outcomes but CVD risk factors will be the&#xD;
      focus of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators expect to follow the caregivers for 12 months during the caregiving period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our prior experience and that of others, patients with clinical levels of symptoms&#xD;
      report the greatest benefit from interventions aimed at reducing depressive symptoms. The&#xD;
      investigators will screen caregivers for clinical levels of depression using the CES-D scale.&#xD;
      If the caregiver screens positive for clinical levels of depressive symptoms (CES-D&gt;16) and&#xD;
      the patients and caregiver consent to participation, the dyad will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention or enhanced usual care arm based on block randomization and stratification by&#xD;
      gender (male/female) to assure approximate equal gender distribution in each arm of the&#xD;
      study. The screening will take place in UPMC Montefiore and Presbyian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of this study will be blinded to which arm of the intervention they&#xD;
      received, either the stepped collaborative care or enhanced usual care. Prior to&#xD;
      randomization they will be asked to provide information on the intervention that they prefer&#xD;
      and at the end of the intervention they will be asked what intervention they think they&#xD;
      received. The findings will be analyzed to determine if intervention preference or perception&#xD;
      of intervention received affected the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care coordinators for the proposed intervention will have Master's degrees in psychology&#xD;
      or counseling and training in cognitive-behavioral therapy and have experience working with&#xD;
      people diagnosed with cancer and their families. The care coordinators will receive training&#xD;
      at the University of Pittsburgh in cultural competence. The therapists will serve as a&#xD;
      liaison between the patient and other health care professionals within the spousal and&#xD;
      intimate partner caregivers' medical team. A psychiatrist will not be included as part of the&#xD;
      study team as many of the spousal and intimate partner caregivers do not reside locally. The&#xD;
      care coordinator will work with the spousal and intimate partner caregivers' PCP,&#xD;
      psychiatrist, and other health care providers in the spousal and intimate partner caregivers'&#xD;
      home community to manage the symptoms and medication if indicated. The care coordinators will&#xD;
      be supervised by the PI who is a clinical psychologist who has been working with cancer&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers for 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed using a battery of standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires. The investigators have chosen instruments that are as brief as possible to&#xD;
      limit burden to patient and spousal and intimate partner caregivers. All instruments have&#xD;
      been demonstrated to be valid and reliable. The order of the instruments in the battery of&#xD;
      questionnaires will begin with general, not emotionally laden instruments and also end with&#xD;
      instruments which may not increase distress in a participant. The proposed time points&#xD;
      (baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months) reflect intervals that permit the ability to capture changes&#xD;
      in symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers while not burdening the patient or spousal/intimate&#xD;
      partner caregivers. The proposed questionnaires were used in prior studies by this team and&#xD;
      with advanced cancer patients and their family caregivers. The investigators have shown&#xD;
      better adherence to completing the outcomes measures with self-reported pencil and paper&#xD;
      questionnaires versus telephone interviews (K07CA118576; R01CA176809). However, the&#xD;
      investigators will also offer telephone interviews for spousal and intimate partner&#xD;
      caregivers or patients who have low levels of literacy, sensory impairments, or prefer a&#xD;
      telephone interview. For all interviews, the research associate will be blinded to the&#xD;
      participant's assigned treatment arm to prevent bias. The investigators have found no&#xD;
      differences by method of administration (paper and pencil versus telephone interview).&#xD;
      Inter-operator variability will be addressed by ensuring that the research staff performing&#xD;
      measurement of blood pressure, and waist circumference will be trained together, tested by&#xD;
      the PI for inter-operator consistency, and be assessed at intervals every 4 months for&#xD;
      continued consistency in measurement of blood pressure and abdominal girth. Consistency in&#xD;
      laboratory personnel techniques (inter operator variability) will be monitored by Dr.&#xD;
      Butterfield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency distributions of study variables will be examined prior to statistical analyses&#xD;
      to provide descriptive data and to identify departures from normality. If nonlinearity is&#xD;
      detected, a transformation will be performed using the Box-Cox transformation, which finds&#xD;
      the optimal relationship between variables. All measures have established reliability and&#xD;
      validity similar to that from which the study sample will be drawn; however, the&#xD;
      reliabilities of scales will be assessed using Cronbach's α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SAS (Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) to conduct&#xD;
      preliminary exploratory analyses, missing data testing, and the analyses for the primary aims&#xD;
      (linear mixed models). The level of significance for the analyses will be set at .05. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention compared to enhanced usual&#xD;
      care will be examined using the 'intent to treat' (ITT) approach, as well as the actual&#xD;
      treatment received. In the ITT approach, subjects will be included in the analyses in the&#xD;
      groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment, adherence, withdrawal&#xD;
      or deviation from protocol. The ITT approach minimizes the introduction of bias into the&#xD;
      analyses and most closely aligns with clinical practice; therefore, it is strongly&#xD;
      recommended for studies examining intervention efficacy.&#xD;
