      This study will be a single-institutional randomized, single-blinded prospectively controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of a single dose of Ciprofloxicin 500mg antibiotic tablet as prophylaxis at&#xD;
      the time of office flexible cystoscopy with ureteral stent removal. The control group will be&#xD;
      no prophylaxis oral antibiotics. The study will be conducted at UCSD Urology outpatient&#xD;
      clinic and Genesis Healthcare Partners Urology outpatient clinic. UCSD will be the&#xD;
      coordinating institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to control or intervention arm based on a predetermined allocation&#xD;
      sequence that will be generated by a computerized random number generator. Study staff not&#xD;
      participating in patient recruitment or procedure will manage the allocation sequence.&#xD;
      Physicians involved in urologic patient care will be blinded from the participants'&#xD;
      allocation. Only study staff at the coordinating institution (UCSD) will have access to the&#xD;
      full allocation sequence. i.e. no clinical staff involved in recruiting and consenting&#xD;
      patients for the study at UCSD or other participating institutions will have knowledge of the&#xD;
      allocation sequence at their institution prior to enrollment of each patient. To further aid&#xD;
      allocation concealment, the block size will be varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified at the time of clinic visit for cystoscopic stent removal. All&#xD;
      patients will be counseled on the American Urological Association's clinical guidelines for&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic use, and the varied standardization of practice patterns. We will not&#xD;
      deviate from routine care standards. Patients undergoing routine ureteral stent removal&#xD;
      within two weeks following stone treatment procedure (ie. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy,&#xD;
      Ureteroscopy, Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery, or Extracorporal Shockwave Lithotripsy).&#xD;
      Patients that agree to participate and provide consent will be enrolled into the study,&#xD;
      receiving a randomized allocation, and specific data points will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
      Patients will be consented prior to determination of prophylaxis for collection of&#xD;
      demographic, disease, perioperative, and postoperative data. If the patient does not consent&#xD;
      to the study the use of antibiotics will be based on the routine clinical practice of the&#xD;
      treating urologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational portion of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be provided a single oral dose of&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin 500mg at the time of stent removal. Ciprofloxacin is currently indicated for&#xD;
      the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Patients with fluoroquinalone&#xD;
      allergy will receive Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800mg) single dose instead of&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin. Those patients that do develop infectious complications after stent removal&#xD;
      will be treated empirically based on the preference of the treating physician followed by&#xD;
      culture specific antibiotics. Centeral prophylaxis randomization will take place at UCSD, as&#xD;
      the lead site, using staff members not involved in patient management. Randomization will&#xD;
      occur in block randomization in block sizes of 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care procedures Patients will have cystoscopy and stent removal performed in&#xD;
      standard fashion, without deviation from standard of care. The time frame of stent removal&#xD;
      after initial stone procedure is consistent with current standard of care. If the treating&#xD;
      physician's preference is to maintain the patient's indwelling stent for longer than two&#xD;
      weeks, then the patient would not be considered for this study. No patient's management&#xD;
      course will be altered for inclusion into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All female patients are screened with a urinary pregnancy test during the preoperative&#xD;
      screening visit, which occurs before the kidney stone surgery. Any pregnant female patients&#xD;
      will be excluded from participation in this study. Post-operative instructions include&#xD;
      refraining from sexual activity. Cystoscopic stent removal is performed within 14 days of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic fields that will be obtained preoperatively include age, race, gender, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), and comorbidities including history of diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression,&#xD;
      prior urinary tract infection(s), neurogenic bladder, incomplete bladder emptying.&#xD;
      Pre-operative clinical data points will include kidney stone size (largest diameter as&#xD;
      measured on coronal imaging for either kidney-ureter-bladder plain x-ray or computerized&#xD;
      tomography) and pre-operative urine culture results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure fields will include post-void residual urine volume per bladder scan (to&#xD;
      assess emptying capability), culture of urine collected during stent removal (only to be&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics if patient becomes symptomatic - per standard of care), stone&#xD;
      culture results, stone analysis, and stone-free status. Phone call interview will occur&#xD;
      between 7-14 days post-operatively to determine if any post-operative infectious events have&#xD;
      occurred. Any infectious symptoms (see below) will prompt mid-stream clean catch specimen for&#xD;
      urinalysis and urine culture. During this period, patients will be closely observed for&#xD;
      infectious complication--ie. symptomatic urinary tract infection, defined as presence of&#xD;
      bacteruria (&gt;5k colony forming units) with any of the following: fever &gt;38 C, malodorous&#xD;
      urine, dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, lower abdominal discomfort, back pain,&#xD;
      gross hematuria. . Patients will be evaluated at 8 weeks for re-assessment in the clinic with&#xD;
      a renal bladder ultrasound performed at 6 weeks, which is the routine post-operative care.&#xD;
