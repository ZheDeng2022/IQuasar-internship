    <textblock>
      When developing new medications for lung diseases like Cystic Fibrosis (CF), scientists&#xD;
      perform lab experiments using cells from the airways, physiology studies of how the lungs&#xD;
      change when a drug is given, and clinical studies to determine how drugs affect overall&#xD;
      health. The investigators of this study are seeking to develop computer models that will&#xD;
      predict how patients will respond to drugs by just doing lab studies on cell samples from&#xD;
      their noses. Such models would allow for medications to be developed more rapidly for all&#xD;
      patients and allow treatments to be personalized as well. In order to develop these computer&#xD;
      models a series of tests will be performed on patients who have CF. Tests will include&#xD;
      sampling cells from the nose and measuring lung physiology using a combination of different&#xD;
      imaging, breathing, and other studies performed both before and after participants take a&#xD;
      therapy. Similar tests will be performed on people who do not have CF, and on the parents of&#xD;
      the CF participants who carry a single CF gene because this will provide information on how&#xD;
      specific genes might affect CF lung disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to develop a series of interconnected models of therapeutic&#xD;
      response in the diseased lung, focused primarily on Cystic Fibrosis (CF), that will&#xD;
      ultimately provide a means for predicting in vivo response based on patient-specific in vitro&#xD;
      testing, allowing for the optimization and personalization of therapies. Investigators use&#xD;
      both human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and more recently human nasal epithelial (HNE) cell&#xD;
      cultures to study CF pathophysiology. The investigators performing this study have also&#xD;
      developed functional imaging biomarkers in the lung that provide organ level quantification&#xD;
      of CF lung physiology (mucociliary clearance and airway liquid absorption), and, more&#xD;
      recently, in silico systems models of lung physiology at both the cell and organ level. The&#xD;
      in silico models provide a framework of differential equations that describe how basic&#xD;
      physiological processes interact and contribute to experimental outcomes. Their use allows&#xD;
      these mechanisms to be more specifically differentiated. Here the investigators propose to&#xD;
      link in vitro and in vivo response by sampling and culturing HNE cell cultures from both&#xD;
      non-CF and CF subjects who will also perform a series of physiological assessments, including&#xD;
      functional imaging scans. The in silico models will facilitate linking therapeutic studies in&#xD;
      cells to therapeutic outcomes in patients.&#xD;
