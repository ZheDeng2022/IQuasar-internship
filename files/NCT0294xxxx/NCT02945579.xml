      This clinical trial studies eliminating surgery and how well radiation therapy after systemic&#xD;
      therapy works in treating patients with HER2 positive or triple negative breast cancer when&#xD;
      image-guided biopsy shows no residual cancer. Patients then receive standard breast&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;

      and one year postradiotherapy or surgery) among protocol participants with pathologic&#xD;

&#xD;
      For Cohorts A and B, within 12 weeks of completing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, patients&#xD;
      undergo whole breast irradiation over 15-25 fractions on consecutive days. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) boost over 7 fractions on consecutive days&#xD;
      beginning the day following completion of whole breast irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;
