  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fimaporfin (TPCS2a) is a photosensitiser drug being developed by PCI Biotech AS for use in&#xD;
      novel Photochemical Internalisation (PCI) technology. PCI technology is designed to enhance&#xD;
      the effects of other drugs in a site-specific, light-directed manner and is used to&#xD;
      re-localise endocytosed molecules from endosomes to cytosol. This research study is&#xD;
      evaluating the use of the PCI Technology in combination with adjuvant and vaccine antigens&#xD;
      for safety and induction of immune responses.&#xD;
