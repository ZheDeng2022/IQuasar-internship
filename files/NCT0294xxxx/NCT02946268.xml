  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ideal delivery of local anesthetics for pain&#xD;
      control when using continuous interscalene peripheral nerve catheters for shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three stages. In the first stage the ideal bolus volume of&#xD;
      ropivacaine will be determined. In the second stage the optimal rate of delivery of the bolus&#xD;
      (infusion rate) will be determined. Finally, once both the ideal volume and infusion rate has&#xD;
      been determined, the optimal interval between boluses of local anesthetic will be determined.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the ideal delivery of local anesthetics for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia when using continuous interscalene peripheral nerve catheters for&#xD;
      shoulder surgery. New technology has emerged with electronic pumps that permit intermittent&#xD;
      mandatory boluses of local anesthetic to be delivered in addition to continuous infusions.&#xD;
      The pump would automatically deliver a bolus at a given interval, but would otherwise be idle&#xD;
      for a period of time. This technology could improve the efficacy of local anesthetics, and&#xD;
      thereby improve postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous peripheral nerve catheters have been shown to improve pain control in several&#xD;
      orthopedic surgical procedures when compared to opioids. However, it is not uncommon for&#xD;
      patients to experience breakthrough pain in spite of a functional peripheral nerve block.&#xD;
      Many times, this breakthrough pain can be managed with a bolus of local anesthetic&#xD;
      administered by an anesthesia provider. Until recently, the vast majority of peripheral nerve&#xD;
      catheter infusion pumps have only had the capability of providing a constant rate of local&#xD;
      anesthetic administration. Newer technology allows for infusion pumps to deliver intermittent&#xD;
      mandatory boluses of local anesthetic. This technique of local anesthetic administration has&#xD;
      previously been evaluated with popliteal nerve blocks, but to our knowledge has never been&#xD;
      evaluated for use with interscalene nerve catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, data would support the idea that a bolus of local anesthetic can improve analgesia&#xD;
      with decreased side effects compared to a continuous infusion. However, there is little data&#xD;
      evaluating the optimal volume of bolus, the optimal speed of delivery, or the optimal&#xD;
      interval between local anesthetic boluses.&#xD;
