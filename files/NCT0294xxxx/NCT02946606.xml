  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, sequential dose group, Phase 1b/2 study&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      of weekly and every other week doses of GX-H9 in the treatment of AGHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects who are adequately eligible to attend this clinical trial via screening will be&#xD;
      sequentially assigned starting with Group 1. Each group will be comprised of subjects who&#xD;
      will receive both GX-H9 and Genotropin, and subjects will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      GX-H9 and Genotropin in the ratio of 4:1. The treatment will proceed as the proposed group&#xD;
      order (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3), and safety and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) will be&#xD;
      reviewed six weeks after each treatment by the safety monitoring committees before proceeding&#xD;
      to the next group.&#xD;

             central laboratory reference values.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a BMI of ≥18.0 and 35.0 kg/m2 (both male and female subjects).&#xD;
