    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that occur most commonly in women of reproductive age.&#xD;
      Symptoms of uterine fibroids may be heavy menstrual bleeding which may lead to anemia,&#xD;
      pressure symptoms, bowel symptoms or urinary urgency. In recent years, increasing attention&#xD;
      has been paid to the study of minimally invasive methods for treatment. Microwave ablation of&#xD;
      myomas and endometrium has been shown to have good effect and acceptability has been high.&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of percutaneous&#xD;
      or per vaginal microwave ablation and uterine artery embolization for the treatment of&#xD;
      uterine myomas in a randomized single blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Volume reduction 6 months post treatment (+/- 15 days) compared to pre treatment measured&#xD;
      as mean volume reduction of the 3 largest fibroids evaluated by magnetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to show a difference between the groups in myoma shrinkage at 6 months of 75% in&#xD;
      microwave ablation and 50%[11] in the embolization group with a standard deviation of 25%&#xD;
      with a alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% we would need 16 women in each group and thus need to&#xD;
      randomize 32 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compensate for loss to follow-up or drop out a total of 36 women will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and investigators will not be blinded. The MRI will be performed and evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having signed informed consent but before randomization patients will undergo MRI of&#xD;
      the uterine fibroids. Patients with a single fibroid measuring more than mean diameter 8cm&#xD;
      will be excluded from further participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women included in the study after MRI examination will fill in a PBAC evaluation[7]&#xD;
      during the menses preceding treatment. Women will fill a VAS for maximal pain during 1 month&#xD;
      prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation will be performed percutaneously or vaginally using a Covidien Emprint&#xD;
      microwave ablation system. Embolization will be performed in conscious women with an epidural&#xD;
      catheter for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow up visit 1, 3 months and 6 months post treatment acceptability will be assessed as&#xD;
      overall satisfaction of treatment on a scale from 1-7 and if the woman would recommend the&#xD;
      treatment to a friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new MRI scan will be performed 6 months post treatment (+/-15 days).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that occur most commonly in women of reproductive age.&#xD;
      Symptoms of uterine fibroids may be heavy menstrual bleeding which may lead to anemia,&#xD;
      pressure symptoms, bowel symptoms or urinary urgency. Hysterectomy remains the reference&#xD;
      standard in the treatment of uterine fibroids. However, it may cause long-term side effects&#xD;
      such as pain and genitovaginal prolapse. It also carries a substantial risk of short term&#xD;
      complications such as infections and organ damage. Myomectomy is another conventional&#xD;
      treatment, but it is associated with a recurrence rate as high as 20% according to&#xD;
      literature. It carries the same short term risks of complications as hysterectomy but at a&#xD;
      lower frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the study of minimally invasive or&#xD;
      non-invasive therapies with uterine preservation such as uterine arterial embolization (UAE),&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF), microwave treatment and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). RF&#xD;
      ablation often requires the aid of a laparoscopic procedure, which is invasive. HIFU is&#xD;
      effective in small myomas, but can be time consuming in large myomas with treatments for&#xD;
      several hours. Ultrasound or computer tomography guided percutaneous microwave thermal&#xD;
      ablation is minimally invasive, has low time requirements, is easy to perform, and has been&#xD;
      broadly used for the treatment of solid tumours in organs other than the uterus with&#xD;
      favourable effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation of myomas and endometrium has been performed in China and Japan. The&#xD;
      effect and acceptability has been high. The research team in this study has been to China to&#xD;
      study the treatment. We have visited the clinic and studied the procedure as well as talked&#xD;
      to patients pre- and post operatively . The equipment at Danderyd Hospital has the same&#xD;
      output effects as the equipment in China. Danderyd Hospital as approved the method for use in&#xD;
      uterine myomas. However, no randomized comparative study of other minimally invasive methods&#xD;
      has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of percutaneous&#xD;
      CT- or ultrasound guided microwave ablation and uterine artery embolization for the treatment&#xD;
      of uterine myomas in a randomized single blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to show a difference between the groups in myoma shrinkage at 6 months of 75% in&#xD;
      microwave ablation and 50% in the embolization group with a standard deviation of 25% with a&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% we would need 16 women in each group and thus need to&#xD;
      randomize 32 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compensate for loss to follow-up or drop out a total of 36 women will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women fulfilling inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria will be identified at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of Danderyds Hospital. Advertisement may be placed in local newspapers or&#xD;
      on social media (Facebook and Instagram) and relevant webpages or in gynecological clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomized after having been informed orally and in written and after having&#xD;
      signed informed consent and after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      MRI-examination. Randomization will be in random permuted blocks of 6 at a ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization will be according to a computer generated randomization sequence. After&#xD;
      patients have signed informed consent and fulfill inclusion without exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      the initial magnetic resonance imaging they will be allocated to an intervention by&#xD;
      consecutive opening of sealed opaque envelopes containing the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and investigators will not be blinded. The MRI will be performed and evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre randomization evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having signed informed consent but before randomization patients will undergo MRI of&#xD;
      the uterine fibroids. Patients with a single fibroid measuring more than 6cm will be excluded&#xD;
      from further participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women included in the study after MRI examination will fill in a PBAC evaluation during&#xD;
      the menses preceding treatment. Women will fill a VAS for maximal pain during 1 month prior&#xD;
      to treatment. In addition a full blood panel will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for uterine artery embolization no pathologist report will be performed before any&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microwave ablation will be performed percutaneously using a Covidien Emprint microwave&#xD;
      ablation system with a 30-90 Watts effect in 14-16 gauge needle with a ceramic tip using&#xD;
      computer tomography with fusion technique or ultrasound for myoma imaging and needle&#xD;
      guidance. After identification of the needle path with CT or peroperative ultrasound local&#xD;
      anaesthesia (carbocain 1% with 0,05mg/ml adrenaline) will be given along the needle path and&#xD;
      a small skin incision using a scalpel will made for the needle entry. Patients will be given&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia with spontaneous breathing or general anesthesia during treatment to&#xD;
      minimize movement during ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine artery embolization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolization will be performed in conscious women with an epidural catheter for pain relief.&#xD;
      A catheter will be inserted in the femoral artery to access the uterine artery during x-ray&#xD;
      monitoring and during administration of contrast to visualize the fibroma and its supporting&#xD;
      arterial supply. When the supporting arterial branch has been identified polyvinyl alcohol&#xD;
      particles are released into the bloodstream. These particles cause a thrombosis in the&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will estimate VAS maximum postoperative pain day of surgery and the following 7 days.&#xD;
      In addition they will note how many days passed before all pain subsided, use of pain&#xD;
      medication will be noted and period until resuming normal daily activities. The period of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be noted. Menstrual blood loss (PBAC) will be noted the first&#xD;
      menstruation, menstruation number 3 and 5 post treatment. PBAC is a validated instrument for&#xD;
      menstrual blood loss quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be after first menstruation at approximately 1 month and at 3 and 6-7&#xD;
      months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow up visit 1, 3 months and 6 months post treatment acceptability will be assessed as&#xD;
      overall satisfaction of treatment on a scale from 1-7 and if the woman would recommend the&#xD;
      treatment to a friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new MRI scan will be performed 6 months post treatment (+/-15 days). Women will then be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a long-term follow up with evaluation of fibroma growth using&#xD;
      ultrasound and recurrence of symptoms using PBAC yearly until retraction of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicial significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine myomas are a benign disease but have a significant impact on the lives of women. As&#xD;
      many as 70% of women have myomas. However, the self-reported frequency of uterine myomas&#xD;
      differs between countries and ranges from 4% to 15% in some countries- probably depending on&#xD;
      the use of ultrasound in gynecological practice and the information given to women. Women&#xD;
      with self reported uterine myomas are much more likely to report on symptoms which are known&#xD;
      to be caused by myomas such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pressure symptoms, urinary urgency&#xD;
      and pain (dysmenhorrea and dyspareunia). Myomas remain the leading cause of hysterectomies in&#xD;
      most western countries. As hysterectomy is a highly invasive procedure with cost for women in&#xD;
      terms of absence from work and short and long term complications, finding new minimally&#xD;
      invasive treatments should remain a focus of health care.&#xD;
