      Prospective, single cohort, multi-center study evaluating the TREFOIL concept for the&#xD;
      treatment of edentulous or patients with failing mandibular dentition over 5 years. 90&#xD;
      patients (15 per centre) will be included. The subject population is at least 18 years old,&#xD;
      in need of an implant restored full prosthesis providing sufficient bone in the&#xD;
      interforaminal where a fixed restoration on three implants is regarded as an appropriate&#xD;
      treatment solution. The components are TREFOIL treatment concept (implants and framework).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obtained informed consent from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age (passed cessation of growth) and not older&#xD;
             than 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is in such a physical and mental condition that a 5-year follow-up period&#xD;
             can be carried out without foreseeable problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject fulfills the prerequisite that a harmonic, stable occlusal relationship&#xD;
             can be achieved with opposing natural teeth resp. fixed or removable opposing&#xD;
             dentition (tooth or implant based) or soft tissue born denture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with all study related procedures (such as&#xD;
             exercising oral hygiene and attending all follow-up procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is compliant with good oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an edentulous mandible or failing mandibular dentition providing&#xD;
             sufficient bone in the interforaminal where a fixed restoration on three (3) implants&#xD;
             is regarded as an appropriate treatment solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has an osseous architecture enough to receive three implants with a length&#xD;
             of at least 11.5 mm and a diameter of 5 mm in the interforaminal (e.g. jaw volume B, C&#xD;
             or D; inter foramina distance at least 20 mm; buccal/lingual width at least 6-7 mm,&#xD;
             vertical height after leveling bone sufficient to receive an implant of at least 11.5&#xD;
             mm length).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a jaw curvature that fits to the prefabricated framework design.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Implants will be placed in healed or extraction sites (clinical stability has to be&#xD;
             ensured).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The implant sites are free from infection and extraction remnants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subjects as well as the implant sites fulfill the criteria for early loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Smokers that have reduced their consumption may be included after a certain test phase&#xD;
        (e.g. test phase for reduction from 2 to 1 packages of cigarettes should be at least 6&#xD;
        months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Class II inter-jaw relation patients are not an exclusion criteria per se. Based on the&#xD;
        individual judgment of the clinician those patients may be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject inclusion criteria at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After bone leveling sufficient mandible bone volume in the interforaminal present for&#xD;
             three (3) implants with a length of at least 11.5 mm and a diameter of 5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After bone leveling the jaw curvature does fit to the prefabricated framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The implant sites are free from infection and extraction remnants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject as well as the implant sites fulfill the criteria for early loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent of participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health conditions, which do not permit the surgical (including anesthesia) or&#xD;
             restorative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the subject's&#xD;
             overall situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in subject records or history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disorders in the planned implant area such as previous tumors, chronic bone&#xD;
             disease or previous irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in subject records or in subject history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoking of more than 1 package of cigarettes per day (&gt; 20 cigarettes or equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled diabetes, i.e. a subject with diagnosed diabetes that has a history of&#xD;
             neglecting doctor's recommendations regarding treatment, food and alcohol intake or&#xD;
             A1c level above 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bisphosphonate therapy - based on individual judgment of the clinician (if&#xD;
             intravenously administered or too high oral doses recently before surgery and during&#xD;
             follow-up period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologic occlusion, e.g. severe bruxism or other destructive habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of opposing dentition or unstable occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing infections, endodontic or periodontal problems in opposing teeth or implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject shows an unacceptable oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has allergic or adverse reactions to the restorative material.&#xD;
