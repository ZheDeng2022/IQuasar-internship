  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and fuel&#xD;
      distribution in 3,200 households in four countries (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda).&#xD;
      Following a common protocol, each intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged&#xD;
      18-34 years, 9 - &lt;20 weeks gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to&#xD;
      receive LPG stoves and an 18-month supply of LPG. Control households are anticipated to&#xD;
      continue to cook primarily with solid biomass fuels, and will receive compensation based on a&#xD;
      uniform set of trial-wide principles, customized to each site based on formative research.&#xD;
      The mother will be followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. The&#xD;
      researchers estimate that 15% of households will have a second, non-pregnant older adult&#xD;
      woman (aged 40 to &lt;80 years) who will also be enrolled at baseline and followed during the&#xD;
      18-month follow-up period. To optimize intervention use, the researchers will implement&#xD;
      behavior change strategies informed by previous experiences and formative research in Year 1.&#xD;
      This study will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure assessments of&#xD;
      household air pollution, and collect dried blood spots and urinary samples for biomarker&#xD;
      analysis and biospecimen storage. The primary outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia&#xD;
      incidence, and stunting of the child, and blood pressure in the older adult woman. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include preterm birth and development in the child, maternal blood pressure during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and endothelial function, respiratory impairment, atherosclerosis, carcinogenic&#xD;
      metabolites, and quality of life in the older adult woman.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast&#xD;
      majority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution&#xD;
      (HAP) is the third leading risk factor in the 2010 global burden of disease, accounting for&#xD;
      an estimated 4.3 million deaths annually, largely among women and young children. Previous&#xD;
      interventions have provided cleaner biomass-based cookstoves, but have failed to reduce&#xD;
      exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no&#xD;
      large-scale field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves, likely the cleanest&#xD;
      scalable intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of LPG stove and fuel&#xD;
      distribution in 3,200 households in four LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda) to&#xD;
      deliver rigorous evidence regarding potential health benefits across the lifespan. Each&#xD;
      intervention site will recruit 800 pregnant women (aged 18-34 years, 9 - &lt;20 weeks&#xD;
      gestation), and will randomly assign half their households to receive LPG stoves and an&#xD;
      18-month supply of LPG. Control households are anticipated to continue to cook primarily with&#xD;
      solid biomass fuels, and will receive compensation based on a uniform set of trial-wide&#xD;
      principles, customized to each site based on formative research. The mother will be followed&#xD;
      along with her child until the child is 1 year old. In households with a second, non-pregnant&#xD;
      older adult woman (aged 40 to &lt;80 years) the researchers will also enroll and follow her&#xD;
      during the 18-month follow-up period in order to assess cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and&#xD;
      cancer outcomes. To optimize intervention use, the researchers will implement behavior change&#xD;
      strategies. This study will assess cookstove use, conduct repeated personal exposure&#xD;
      assessments to HAP (PM2.5, black carbon, carbon monoxide), and collect dried blood spots and&#xD;
      urinary samples for biomarker analysis and biospecimen storage on all participants at&#xD;
      multiple time points. The primary outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence,&#xD;
      and stunting of the child, and blood pressure in the older adult woman. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include preterm birth and development in the child, maternal blood pressure during pregnancy,&#xD;
      and endothelial function, respiratory impairment, atherosclerosis, carcinogenic metabolites,&#xD;
      and quality of life in the older adult woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the following specific aims: (1) using an intent-to-treat analysis,&#xD;
      determine the effect of a randomized LPG stove and fuel intervention on health in four&#xD;
      diverse LMIC populations using a common protocol; (2) determine the exposure-response&#xD;
      relationships for HAP and health outcomes; and (3) determine relationships between LPG&#xD;
      intervention and both targeted and exploratory biomarkers of exposure/health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide evidence, including costs and implementation strategies, to inform&#xD;
      national and global policies on scaling up LPG stoves among vulnerable populations.&#xD;
      Ultimately, this will facilitate deeper policy-level discussions as well as identify&#xD;
      requirements for initiating and sustaining HAP interventions globally.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Length-for-age z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measured is linear growth failure, or stunting, at one year of age. Infant length will be assessed at birth and quarterly thereafter, until the child is 12 months old. Stunting will be assessed using length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) based on the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards. Stunting is defined as LAZ &lt;-2 standard deviations (SD) below the median z-score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child development</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months of age to 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Child development will be assessed with the Caregiver Reported Early Childhood Development Instrument (CREDI). The CREDI is a population-level measure of early childhood development (ECD) for children from 0-3 years of age. The CREDI assesses 5 domains of child development: 1) motor development (fine and gross motor), 2) language development (expressive and receptive language), 3) cognitive development (executive function, problem solving and reasoning, and pre-academic knowledge), 4) socio-emotional development (emotional and behavioral self-regulation, emotional knowledge, and social competence), and 5) mental health (internalizing and externalizing behaviors). The CREDI long form has 117 items and the number of questions answered depends on the age of the child. Responses of &quot;yes&quot; are coded as 1 and &quot;no&quot; is coded as 0; certain items are reverse coded. Total raw scores increase by age (with developmental progression), and higher scores indicate increased development.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brachial artery reactivity testing (BART)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery reactivity testing (BART) measures endothelial function via flow-mediated dilatation to reactive hyperemia following the release of arm blood-flow occlusion. In this test, baseline artery diameter is measured, then a blood pressure cuff is inflated to induce distal arm ischemia for 5 minutes and after releasing the pressure, the post-occlusion brachial artery diameter is measured. The ratio of post- to pre-occlusion artery diameter represents endothelial function where lower values indicate worse endothelial function. (Peru only)</description>

    <measure>Family Care Indicators (FCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The FCI is a 10-item questionnaire developed by UNICEF that gauges caregiver-child interaction and play materials in global and low resource settings. The FCI asks if anyone over the age of 12-years in the home engaged with the child by reading or looking at books, telling stories, singing songs, taking the child outside of home, playing and drawing in the past 3 days. This was analyzed as a FCI subscale, &quot;play scale&quot; (0-6). The FCI questionnaire also asks about sources of play materials (presence of books, homemade toys or owning factory-made toys). This was also analyzed as a separate subscale, &quot;toys scale&quot; (0-3). Test-retest reliability of the FCI was moderate to excellent for most items, and the rates of agreement were consistently high during instrument development (Altafim, 2020).</description>

    <measure>Maternal Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 12 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PPS) assesses the way an individual appraises their life events as stressful (e.g., &quot;In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?&quot;) (Cohen, 1983). Likert-level responses ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (very often), meaning a high PPS score would result in a high level of perceived stress. A Spanish language PPS created and tested and found to be valid and reliable (Vallijo et al., 2018).</description>
