             cytology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment decision to initiate a treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab or nivolumab&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with a diagnosis of a cancer other than advanced/metastatic advanced RCC&#xD;
             within the past five years, ie, a cancer other than advanced/metastatic RCC that&#xD;
             requires systemic or other treatment. Participants that have been treated curatively&#xD;
             more than five years ago with no evidence of recurrence and prostate cancer patients&#xD;
