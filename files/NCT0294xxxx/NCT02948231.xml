      The Mistral is an investigational device intended for percutaneous trans-catheter repair in&#xD;
      high risk for surgery individuals suffering from functional Mitral Regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device system is to be used only in accordance with the approved Investigational Plan on&#xD;
      subjects who have signed an informed consent form. Device use is limited to the approved&#xD;
      study investigators.&#xD;

      The study is designed to clinically demonstrate device acute safety (Primary Endpoint) along&#xD;
      with longer FU device safety and effectiveness evaluation (Secondary Endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the Acute safety of the implanted Mistral device post procedure and at 30 day&#xD;
           follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the long term Safety of the device (3 and 6 months follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate effectiveness of the Mistral device in improving MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Safety: Acute safety. Rate of device related SAE including device related mortality,&#xD;
      stroke, MI, cardiac tamponade, surgery for failed percutaneous repair and non-elective&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgery to treat an adverse event. At discharge and 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  • Safety: Safety at 3 and 6 months. Rate of SAEs and device related SAEs at 3, 6 and&#xD;
           12months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effectiveness: MR reduction post-procedure, at discharge and 30 days, 3 and 6 and 12&#xD;
           months. Improved NYHA class and 6MWT distance at 30 days, 3 and 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
