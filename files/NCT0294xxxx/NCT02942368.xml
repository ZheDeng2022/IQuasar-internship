    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate the potential role of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
      tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique which has been utilized for the treatment&#xD;
      of major depression in several studies, both as a primary and adjunctive treatment. The&#xD;
      treatment will be administered under the supervision of a physician with experience in&#xD;
      administering the treatment and monitoring for complications. This will be a prospective&#xD;
      &quot;adaptive tDCS stimulation&quot; open label research study. Participants will receive 20 minute&#xD;
      sessions of up to 4 milliamps (mA) transcutaneous electrical stimulation sessions over 4 to 6&#xD;
      weeks. Building on the theory that greater current &quot;dose&quot; may be a significant factor in&#xD;
      determining efficacy, this study aims to determine whether higher tDCS current doses lead to&#xD;
      greater improvements in depressive symptoms in this population of patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.&#xD;
