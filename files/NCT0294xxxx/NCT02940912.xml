  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that continuous apomorphine treatment during the&#xD;
      night compared with placebo improves sleep quality in insomniac patient with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders are very common in Parkinson's disease (PD). They are present in almost all&#xD;
      patients. They have an important impact on quality of life. To improve the comfort of&#xD;
      patients, neurologists typically offer either dispersible form of levodopa, prolonged release&#xD;
      dopaminergic agonists treatments or deep brain stimulation surgery. Unfortunately these&#xD;
      treatments are too short-acting for the dispersible form of levodopa or not always sufficient&#xD;
      for the oral or transdermal dopamine agonist or are very heavy to implement as surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some sleep disorders such as restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements, and&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, seem to be more frequent in PD patients than in general&#xD;
      population and could be improved by a continuous dopaminergic treatment the night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, daytime sleepiness is a major problem in PD patients. Although it seems most often&#xD;
      linked to dopaminergic treatments given during the day, it could also be, in some patients&#xD;
      the result of a very bad night's sleep, leading to a rebound of sleep during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate that compared with placebo, nocturnal continuous&#xD;
      apomorphine treatment improves sleep quality assessed by the patient on the PDSS-2 scale in&#xD;
      fluctuating parkinsonian patients with complaints of insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to measure the effectiveness of nocturnal continuous apomorphine&#xD;
      on sleep quality : total sleep time, sleep efficiency, arousal index, ventilatory events and&#xD;
      legs movements indexes, to measure the relative proportion of sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, Rapid&#xD;
      Eye Movement ou REM sleep), position changes during sleep index and the percentage of time&#xD;
      spent in the supine position, percentage of time with SpO2 &lt;90%), sleepiness (Epworth and&#xD;
      Multiple Sleep Latency Test) and their consequences on quality of life (EuroQol 5),&#xD;
      depressive symptoms (Beck II), anxiety (STAI), overall cognition (MOCA), pain and engine&#xD;
      condition after waking up.&#xD;
