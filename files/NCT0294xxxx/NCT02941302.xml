    <textblock>
      Knowledge of the spatial extent of gliomas is an essential prerequisite for the treatment&#xD;
      planning. In particular, the localization of the border zone between tumor infiltrated and&#xD;
      normal brain tissue is one of the major problems to be solved before beginning therapy.&#xD;
      However, it is a well known problem that, in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      it often is difficult to detect areas with low tumor infiltration, especially in gliomas,&#xD;
      because of their infiltrative and often diffuse nature.The study has two purpose:I.To&#xD;
      correlate the imaging border zone with pathological grade of different tumor site following&#xD;
      surgery in patients with newly diagnosed intracranial gliomas, work out the biological border&#xD;
      zone, and complete resect the tumor.II.To determine the feasibility of defining the optimal&#xD;
      target volume for radiation therapy using MR spectroscopy, diffusion, perfusion and&#xD;
      functional imaging.&#xD;

      Gliomas are widely infiltrative tumors. Although an oncological resection is not feasible,&#xD;
      there is compelling evidence that patients benefit from resection of the tumor. The surgical&#xD;
      target is the main tumor bulk, which is defined as the contrast enhancing part of the tumor&#xD;
      on preoperative MRI. Surgical treatment in gliomas is based on maximal safe resection of this&#xD;
      mass. Several new technologies have been devised to maximize the resection and intraoperative&#xD;
      MRI is one of these new technologies. Intraoperative MRI has been shown by many studies to&#xD;
      increase the extent of resection in glioma surgery. Intraoperative determination of the&#xD;
      extent of resection, however, requires use of intravenous contrast administration, which has&#xD;
      some technical limitations. Fundamental problems associated with the use of contrast material&#xD;
      are the enhancement at the resection margin and contrast leakage into the resection cavity.&#xD;
      Both problems can complicate the differential diagnosis between residual tumor and surgically&#xD;
      induced changes. Nowadays, the basic theory of a largest removal the tumor is the imaging&#xD;
      boundary.&#xD;
