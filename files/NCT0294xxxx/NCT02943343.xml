    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data on pulmonary embolism (PE) in China needs to be updated and reported.&#xD;
      The China Pulmonary Thromboembolism Registry Study (CURES) is designed to provide the&#xD;
      cross-sectional spectrum and chronological trends of PE in China, as well as to reveal the&#xD;
      intrinsic etiology and pathogenesis of the disease. The CURES is an ongoing large prospective&#xD;
      multicenter registry, which was originally initiated in January 2009 via enrolling suspected&#xD;
      or confirmed PE or PE with DVT (deep venous thrombosis) patients and assessed their&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes from 100 medical centers in the China PE-DVT network. As of July 2011,&#xD;
      in order to determine the PE-relevant short-term outcomes, enrolled participants were&#xD;
      followed-up for at least three months in a longitudinal manner. Since August 2016, with the&#xD;
      launch and development of precision medicine research scheme in China, the main principle&#xD;
      investigators of CURES decided to collect enrolled patients' blood samples with regular&#xD;
      follow-ups every three or six months for at least two years (for long-term outcomes). The&#xD;
      study protocol has been approved by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital ethics committee, and&#xD;
      all collaborating centers received approvals from their local ethics committee. All patients&#xD;
      provided written or verbal informed consent to their participation.&#xD;

        Symptomatic PE or PE with DVT are objectively confirmed by imaging tests. PE is confirmed&#xD;
        by positive helical computed tomographic angiography of pulmonary artery (CTPA),&#xD;
        high-probability ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy (V/Q), positive pulmonary&#xD;
        angiography, or echocardiographic visualization of thrombus (in right atrium, right&#xD;
        ventricle, pulmonary aorta trunk, or left/right pulmonary trunk), right atrium enlargement,&#xD;
        or right ventricle hypokinesis while CTPA, V/Q scanning or pulmonary angiography are not&#xD;
        applicable. DVT in the lower limbs is diagnosed with positive implications of compression&#xD;
        ultrasonography (CUS) or computed tomographic venography (CTV).&#xD;
