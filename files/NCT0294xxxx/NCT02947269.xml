  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) refers to the period of gut dysmotility that occurs after abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. Patients with POI are unable to eat, suffer ongoing nausea and vomiting, are unable&#xD;
      to open their bowels and have a prolonged hospital stay. Research at ADHB shows that 25% of&#xD;
      patients will have a prolonged POI after elective bowel resection, which makes it the most&#xD;
      common major complication after colorectal surgery. Clinicians currently lack a definitive&#xD;
      medication to prevent or treat POI, which means POI causes patients ongoing morbidity and&#xD;
      places a significant drain on healthcare resources. Serotonin plays an important role in gut&#xD;
      motility. Evidence suggests that serotonin agonists, such as prucalopride, increase gut&#xD;
      transit and may have anti-inflammatory properties. The hypothesis of this study is that&#xD;
      Prucalopride given pre-operatively and continued post-operatively in patients having an&#xD;
      elective bowel resection will improve gut function recovery after surgery and reduce POI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' proposed study is a double-blinded randomised controlled trial of&#xD;
      prucalopride compared to an identical placebo tablet, in patients having an elective bowel&#xD;
      resection at Auckland City Hospital. Patients will receive a single tablet of Prucalopride or&#xD;
      placebo 2-3 hours preoperatively and then daily after operation for a maximum of 6 days. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be return to bowel function defined by the time to tolerate a solid&#xD;
      diet and pass stool. In addition, the investigators plan to assess postoperative gastric&#xD;
      emptying rates using the safe and non-invasive carbon breath test method. This will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to determine the effects of prucalopride on the stomach, and support its role&#xD;
      as a gastric prokinetic.&#xD;
