    <textblock>
      This phase I/II clinical trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab with or without&#xD;
      elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      liver cancer that has spread to other places in the body and does not respond to previous&#xD;
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin may work better in treating patients with liver cancer&#xD;
      than with pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the tolerability of intravenous (V) administration of pembrolizumab as&#xD;
      second-line systemic therapy in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. (Arm A and&#xD;
      Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with elbasvir/grazoprevir&#xD;
      (Zepatier) as assessed by the proportion of subjects with hepatitis C virus (HCV) GT1 or GT4&#xD;
      achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all HCV study therapy&#xD;
      (SVR12), defined as HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ)&#xD;
      (either target detected unquantifiable [TD(u)] or target not detected [TND]) 12 weeks after&#xD;
      the end of all study therapy. (Arm B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 assessed by MD Anderson radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to&#xD;
      progression (TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by MD Anderson&#xD;
      Department of Diagnostic Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier as assessed by the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 achieving SVR12 and SVR24, defined as HCV RNA&#xD;
      below the LLOQ (either TD[u] or TND) 12 and 24 weeks after the end of all study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate ORR, DOR, DCR, TTP, PFS and overall survival (OS) per immune response RECIST&#xD;
      (irRECIST) as assessed by MD Anderson radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationship between progression on sorafenib versus intolerance of&#xD;
      sorafenib and response to pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform exploratory biomarker research to study the correlation between immunological&#xD;
      and molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with TTP, OS, and rate of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the association between PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC), somatic gene expression profiling (GEP) and antitumor efficacy of pembrolizumab based&#xD;
      on RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore predictive biomarkers to study the correlation of independent effect of&#xD;
      cirrhosis grade and severity of portal hypertension by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      classification on OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore retrospective risk stratification of the degree of the underlying liver&#xD;
      dysfunction by IGF score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore retrospective risk stratification of the degree of the underlying liver&#xD;
      dysfunction by IGF-1 score. See section 2.1. VII. To assess whether pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with Zepatier affects the course of viral infections in subjects with underlying&#xD;
      HCV GT1 or GT4. We hypothesize that pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier will help to&#xD;
      reduce viral loads in those with untreated HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIIII. To evaluate the response of HCV GT1 and GT4 to treatment as assessed by sustained&#xD;
      virologic response at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of 12 to 16 weeks of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with Zepatier dosing. Sustained virologic response is defined as defined as HCV&#xD;
      RNA below the LLOQ (either TD[u] or TND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance-associated variants (RAVs) to pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in combination with Zepatier in subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 without RAVs as baseline .&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with Zepatier as assessed by the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects with HCV GT1 or GT4 achieving undetectable (TND) HCV RNA and HCV RNA&#xD;
      below the LLOQ at Weeks 2, 4, 12 and Follow- Up Week 4 (SVR4), Week 12 (SVR12), and Week 24&#xD;
      (SVR24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To explore the relationship between genetic variation and subject response to the&#xD;
      treatment(s) administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in arm A. Patients also receive elbasvir/grazoprevir&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) and ribavirin PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment continues for 12-16&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-90 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

             a) intrauterine device (IUD); b) vasectomy of a female subject's male partner; c)&#xD;
             contraceptive rod implanted into the skin B) combination method (requires use of two&#xD;
             of the following): a) diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with&#xD;

             heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is&#xD;
             consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered&#xD;
             acceptable by local regulatory agencies and Ethical Review Committees&#xD;
             (ERCs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs); periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception; if a contraceptive method listed above is&#xD;

             any one of the following: a. A liver biopsy performed prior to day 1 of this study&#xD;
             showing cirrhosis (F4) b. Fibroscan performed within 12 calendar months of day 1 of&#xD;
             this study showing cirrhosis with result &gt; 12.5 kPa [29] c. A FibroSure (Fibrotest)&#xD;
             performed during screening with a score of &gt; 0.75 and an AST: platelet ratio index&#xD;
             (APRI) of &gt; 2; absence of cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following: a. Liver&#xD;
             biopsy performed within 24 months of day 1 of this study showing absence of cirrhosis&#xD;
             b. Fibroscan performed within 12 months of Day 1 of this study with a result of =&lt;&#xD;
             12.5 kPa [29] c. A Fibrosure (Fibrotest) score of 0.48 and AST to Platelet Ratio Index&#xD;
             (APRI) of =&lt; 1 during Screening Fibroscan cut-off of 12.5 kPa has a positive&#xD;
             predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity of 95% for &gt;/= F3; based on box and whisker&#xD;
             plot of interquartile distribution &gt; 12.5 kPa will exclude the majority of subjects&#xD;
             with metavir F3 fibrosis; in the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or&#xD;
             absence of cirrhosis by the above criteria, a liver biopsy is required; liver biopsy&#xD;
             results supersede the results obtained by Fibroscan or Fibrosure&#xD;
&#xD;
