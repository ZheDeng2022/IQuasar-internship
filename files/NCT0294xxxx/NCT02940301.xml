  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with&#xD;
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back or has not responded to treatment. Ibrutinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by&#xD;
      targeting certain cells. Giving ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients&#xD;
      with classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the complete response (CR) rate with ibrutinib at the standard dose of 560 mg&#xD;
      daily in combination with nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks up to 16&#xD;
      infusions in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) with ibrutinib and nivolumab in combination&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed or refractory classical HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine safety and toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory cHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      cHL treated with combined ibrutinib and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL treated&#xD;
      with ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on the distribution of T-, B-, and NK&#xD;
      cells in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 cytokines profile and&#xD;
      correlate this with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the effects of ibrutinib and nivolumab on Th1/Th2 ration and specific IgG&#xD;
      sub-isotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and nivolumab IV&#xD;
      continuously over 60 minutes on day 1.Treatment with nivolumab repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 16 courses and treatment with ibrutinib continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
