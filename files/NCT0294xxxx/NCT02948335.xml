  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microorganisms that colonize hospital environments play an important role in the transmission&#xD;
      of hospital acquired infections (HAI) and multi-drug resistant organisms. Previous studies&#xD;
      examining microorganisms in the hospital environment have been limited by reliance on&#xD;
      targeted culture-based methods resulting in potentially missed or unrecognized organisms.&#xD;
      Evidence now suggests that using microbiome analysis offers an innovative strategy that may&#xD;
      improve our understanding of HAI and how best to prevent them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot longitudinal observational study aims to characterize the taxonomic composition of&#xD;
      microbial communities on environmental surfaces and people in these environments prior to and&#xD;
      following the introduction of patients, caregiver, and hospital staff to newly constructed&#xD;
      inpatient care areas at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). This proposed study is&#xD;
      uniquely characterized by evaluating the hospital environment of a pediatric&#xD;
      immunocompromised oncology patient population that has not been studied in the past using&#xD;
      advanced molecular techniques such as microbiome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the pattern of microbial communities of the hospital environment before,&#xD;
           during and after patient occupancy of a newly constructed hospital space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the similarity or difference of environment microbial communities to that of&#xD;
           the humans occupying this environment in a newly occupied hospital space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the pattern in environment microbial communities after each step of&#xD;
           disinfection (manual cleaning with chemical disinfectant and Ultraviolet light&#xD;
           disinfection machine) after patient discharge from the inpatient hospital environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation between environmental Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) measures&#xD;
           and organism bioburden.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited from the patient population at SJCRH. Patients admitted to one&#xD;
      of the protocol defined inpatient rooms in the Kay Research and Care Center (KRCC) will be&#xD;
      enrolled on the study. Participating patients will be asked to provide stool, nasal swab, and&#xD;
      skin swab samples while inpatient. Primary caregivers and the nurse assigned to the patient's&#xD;
      room will also be asked to provide nasal and skin swabs while the patient remains inpatient.&#xD;
      These samples will be used to characterize the human microbiome for comparison to the&#xD;
      environmental microbiome.&#xD;
