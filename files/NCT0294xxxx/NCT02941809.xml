  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 2 million individuals in the United States have an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).&#xD;
      Methadone maintenance treatment is the gold standard of medication-assisted treatment for&#xD;
      OUD, but high-dose methadone is associated with cardiotoxicity and respiratory complications,&#xD;
      among other side effects. These adverse effects make enhancing the effectiveness of lower&#xD;
      doses of methadone an attractive therapeutic goal. Long recognized for its capacity to&#xD;
      enhance treatment outcomes for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including pain, the&#xD;
      placebo effect offers an as-yet untested avenue to such an enhancement. This approach is&#xD;
      particularly compelling given that individuals with substance use disorder tend to have&#xD;
      higher salience attribution, and may thereby be more sensitive to placebo effects. Our study&#xD;
      combines two promising clinical methodologies-open-label placebo and conditioning-to&#xD;
      investigate whether placebo effects can increase the effective potency of methadone in&#xD;
      treatment-seeking OUD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 newly-enrolled treatment-seeking OUD patients will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two different groups: either methadone plus daily open-label placebo (OLP; treatment&#xD;
      group), or methadone/Treatment as Usual (TAU; control). Participants will meet with study&#xD;
      team members five times over the course of three months of treatment with methadone&#xD;
      (baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months post-baseline). Throughout this study time period,&#xD;
      methadone dosages will be adjusted by an addiction clinician blind to patient assignment, per&#xD;
      standard clinical methods. The primary outcome is methadone dose at three months. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include self-report of drug use; 3-month urine toxicology screen results; and&#xD;
      treatment retention. Exploratory outcomes include several environmental as well as&#xD;
      personality factors associated with OUD and with propensity to demonstrate a placebo effect.&#xD;

    <measure>Barratt Impulsivity Scale, version 11 (BIS-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS-11 (Patton, Stanford, Barratt, 1995) is a 30-item assessment that yields information regarding three facets of trait impulsivity (ie, attentional impulsivity, motor impulsivity and non-planning impulsivity). Participants indicate on a four-point Likert-like scale the extent to which each of 30 items describes their overall behavior. A scoring algorithm (with some items reverse-scored) yields 6 first-order and 3 second-order factors, as well as an overall score (a total possible score of 120). Higher values on each of the factors indicate higher levels of impulsivity.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants who are randomly assigned to group OLP will receive placebo pills. In Phase 1 of the study (first two weeks), participants in this group are given one pill, to be taken concomitant with the methadone. In Phase 2 (3 weeks up to 3 months), OLP participants continue to take the single (morning, or AM) pill, and are given a second pill in a bottle as a take-home. OLP participants will meet with the study team at five time points: at baseline (entry into treatment), 2 weeks post-baseline, and 1-, 2- and 3-months post-baseline.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Open-Label Placebo (OLP)</intervention_name>
    <description>We are designating this as a behavioral intervention for two reasons: (1) the placebo pill is physiologically inert and is not classified under FDA regulations; and (2) other studies have demonstrated that the efficacy of the placebo pill is strongly dependent on the participants' anticipation of an effect. We are presenting the pill's efficacy in an open and transparent way to the participants, but using a positive frame. We feel that this qualifies the placebo pill use as a behavioral intervention, in the same general category as exercise or relaxation.</description>
