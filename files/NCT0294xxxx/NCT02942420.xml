  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects on a standard regimen of tiopronin (cystine binding thiol drug; CBTD) plus&#xD;
      prescribed first-line therapy (i.e. on a hydration, alkali therapy and dietary restriction)&#xD;
      who are failing therapy will be selected for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing informed consent, the subject will have Screening consisting of medication&#xD;
      history and physical examination with vital signs. Samples of blood and urine will be taken&#xD;
      for clinical laboratory and urinalysis. Patients will undergo a 12-lead ECG test. A history&#xD;
      of side effects with current CBTD as well as laboratory recordings of abnormalities&#xD;
      attributable to treatment will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed in a sequential manner, starting with the low dose group (300 mg/day),&#xD;
      then proceeding to the 600 mg.day dose group.. Safety and tolerability will be monitored&#xD;
      closely by an Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) and based on the IMM's assessment that it is&#xD;
      safe to proceed to the higher dose (600 mg/day), subsequent subjects will be enrolled into&#xD;
      that group. Up to 15 subjects each will be enrolled into either Group A or Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 7 days on the assigned bucillamine dose, a 24-hour urine sample will be taken and after&#xD;
      completing the Day 8 safety visit, subjects will undergo a 7 day washout where no CBTDs will&#xD;
      be taken. Thereafter, subjects will be allowed to resume their originally prescribed CBTDs&#xD;
      under Investigator's supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week following study drug discontinuation, subjects will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up safety assessments.&#xD;

      Subjects on a standard regimen of tiopronin (cystine binding thiol drug; CBTD) plus&#xD;
      prescribed first-line therapy (i.e. on a hydration, alkali therapy and dietary restriction)&#xD;
      who are failing therapy will be selected for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged to continue their usual self-selected ad-lib diets, fluid and&#xD;
      alkali regimen and keep this regimen consistent throughout the duration of the study. Study&#xD;
      diaries will be kept to assess consistency and drug compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing informed consent, the enrolled subject will have an initial Screening&#xD;
      interview. During the interview the patient will be assessed for symptoms of renal colic as&#xD;
      well as asked about any scheduled urological procedures (a positive indication is an&#xD;
      exclusionary criteria). At the Screening visit, a medication history will be taken and a&#xD;
      complete physical examination, including vital signs will be done. Samples of blood and urine&#xD;
      will be taken for clinical laboratory and urinalysis. Patients will then undergo a 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history of side effects with current CBTD as well as laboratory recordings of abnormalities&#xD;
      attributable to treatment will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be dosed in a sequential manner, starting with the low dose group (300&#xD;
      mg/day). Safety and tolerability will be monitored closely by an Independent Medical Monitor&#xD;
      (IMM) and based on the IMM's assessment that it is safe to proceed to the higher dose (600&#xD;
      mg/day), subsequent subjects will be enrolled into that group. Up to 15 subjects each will be&#xD;
      enrolled into either Group A or Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will stop taking their current CBTDs for 7 days and perform a 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection on Day-7 and report for Day 1 Visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled into Group A will start taking bucillamine tablets orally, three times a&#xD;
      day preferably 1hr before or 2hrs after meals in the following sequence; 100 mg (1 tab) in&#xD;
      the morning; 100 mg (1 tab) at noon and 100 mg (1 tab) at night. This drug regimen will&#xD;
      continue for 7 days. Safety Visits are scheduled on Day 3 and Day 8 (End of Study Visit).&#xD;
      Furthermore, on Day 7 a 24-hour urine collection will be performed. Instructions for handling&#xD;
      this sample will be provided in a separate manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled into Group B, will start taking bucillamine tablets orally, three times a&#xD;
      day preferably 1hr before or 2hrs after meals in the following sequence; 200 mg (2 tabs) in&#xD;
      the morning; 200 mg (2 tabs) at noon and 200 mg (2 tabs) at night. This drug regimen will&#xD;
      continue for 7 days. Safety Visits are scheduled on Day 3 and Day 8 (End of Study Visit).&#xD;
      Furthermore, on Day 7 a 24-hour urine collection will be performed. Instructions for handling&#xD;
      this sample will be provided in a separate manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 7 days on the assigned bucillamine dose and after providing the 24-hour urine sample,&#xD;
      and after completing the Day 8 safety visit, subjects will undergo a 7 day washout where no&#xD;
      CBTDs will be taken. Thereafter, subjects will be allowed to resume their originally&#xD;
      prescribed CBTDs under Investigator's supervision.&#xD;
