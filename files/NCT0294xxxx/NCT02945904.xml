      Purpose of this clinical trial is to improve prediction of outcomes from surgical&#xD;
      intervention in patients with Primary aldosteronism, and evaluate the merits of non-invasive&#xD;
      metomidate PET CT versus adrenal vein sampling in the diagnosis of surgically correctable&#xD;
      aldosteronism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational multi-centre prospective cohort study which takes place within&#xD;
      secondary and tertiary care. All participants will have the same two investigations performed&#xD;
      in random order. These are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      11C- metomidate PET CT This is a one-hour non-invasive study, prior to which participants are&#xD;
      treated with dexamethasone for 3 days. A proportion of patients will have an additional&#xD;
      18F-CETO PET CT scan to measure concordance between the two PET CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenal Vein Sampling This is an invasive investigation in which both adrenal veins are&#xD;
      cannulated and blood collected for measurement of adrenal steroid hormones.&#xD;
      Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is administered prior to AVS in order to ensure steroid&#xD;
      hormone secretion during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will standardise the start-time of treatment with spironolactone, which is&#xD;
      first-choice treatment for participants with primary aldosteronism, in order that the&#xD;
      pre-spironolactone blood pressure and biochemistry can be compared with subsequent&#xD;
      measurements post-surgery, and the changes during the first month of spironolactone treatment&#xD;
      can be used to assess their value in predicting response to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study of Repeat 11-C Metomidate PET CT before and after Spironolactone therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine whether it will be necessary for the start of spironolactone treatment&#xD;
      to be delayed in all participants until after both investigations are completed, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a sub-study, early in MATCH, in which 6 patients have their PET CT&#xD;
      repeated after at least 6 weeks treatment with spironolactone. (This is the conventional&#xD;
      period of time for which spironolactone is withdrawn prior to AVS.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up management and investigations The investigators anticipate ~50% of participants&#xD;
      will be found on one or both investigations to have unilateral PA, and be recommended for&#xD;
      adrenalectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measurements will be at 6 months after surgery, or 9-12 months following&#xD;
      MDT decision, in those who do not undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following primary outcomes will be analysed hierarchically, with each analysis being&#xD;
      considered as part of the primary analysis if all preceding analyses demonstrate statistical&#xD;
      significance at p&lt;0.05. Otherwise, analyses of subsequent outcomes will be considered to be&#xD;
      secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normalisation of ARR at 6 months, defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ARRactivity &lt; 750 pmol/L per ng/ml/hr&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ARRmass &lt; 91 miU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in BP (mean of at least 6 measurements from home monitoring, or mean of at least&#xD;
           2 measurements from clinic ) from baseline to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cure of hypertension at 6 months. Definitions of biochemical and clinical success based&#xD;
           on the PASO criteria (using on data available on eCRF) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each primary outcome will be analysed in the subgroup of participants who undergo surgery.&#xD;
      For each of the above outcomes, AVS and 11C-metomidate PET CT will be judged to be 'accurate'&#xD;
      if it indicated unilateral disease and if normalisation of ARR, reduction in SBP or cure of&#xD;
      hypertension (measured hierarchically, in turn) was achieved at 6 months post-surgery; or if&#xD;
      it did not indicate unilateral disease and the above outcomes were not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated differences in accuracy will be reported with 95% CI and p-value between&#xD;
      11C-metomidate PET CT and AVS. For cure of hypertension at 6 month, non-inferiority of&#xD;
      11C-metomidate PET CT will be declared if the lower limit of the above 95% CI is greater than&#xD;
      -17%. Each measure of cure based on the PASO criteria (biochemical, clinical) will be&#xD;
      analysed in turn. Superiority of 11-C metomidate PET CT will be declared if p&lt;0.05 and the&#xD;
      lower limit of the 95% CI is greater than 0%.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical success (based on PASO criteria) at 6 months, analysed as a 3-level&#xD;
           categorical variable (complete, partial, absent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical success (based on PASO criteria) at 6 months, analysed as a 3-level categorical&#xD;
           variable (complete, partial, absent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in serum Potassium from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in ARRactivity or ARRmass from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in home SBP and DBP from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in clinic SBP and DBO from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in blood levels of Troponin, Brain Natriuretic Peptide from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in cardiac MRI measures of heart structure, anatomy and blood flow from baseline&#xD;
           to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in quality of life measures from baseline to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (and Primary) outcomes will be compared between participants who underwent surgery&#xD;
      and those who did not; for those who underwent surgery, between those for whom surgery was&#xD;
      indicated by AVS only, 11C-metomidate PET CT only, or for both investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation has been performed to permit detection of a significant influence&#xD;
      on outcome where the smallest number of patients will be available. This is the group of&#xD;
      patients in whom the two diagnostic techniques give discordant results, estimated to be ~20%&#xD;
      of the total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of 140 patients across 3 centres over 3 years (&lt;1/centre/month), assuming an&#xD;
      estimated 10% dropout, and 50% proceeding to adrenalectomy, permits 90% power at alpha=0.01&#xD;
      of detecting superiority of metomidate vs AVS in predicting hierarchical primary outcomes.&#xD;
      The 25 patient extension, on the same assumptions regarding dropouts and proportion&#xD;
      proceeding to surgery, will also provide 90% power to show non inferiority of 11C-metomidate&#xD;
      PET CT in relation to AVS, within a margin of 18%.&#xD;
