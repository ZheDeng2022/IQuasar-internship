        <description>Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) and Patient-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS) is a 5-level scale ranging from &quot;0&quot; (None) to &quot;4&quot; (Severe). A 2-level composite responder is a participant that received EN3835 with a reduction (decrease in score) in severity of at least 2-levels from baseline on both the CR-PCSS and the PR-PCSS at a particular visit.&#xD;
Observation Phase is defined as the time period from Screening to the first treatment date of the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202, or the end of Study EN3835-202 if there was no treatment received for the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202.

        <description>Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) and Patient-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS) is a 5-level scale ranging from &quot;0&quot; (None) to &quot;4&quot; (Severe). A 1-level composite responder is a participant that received EN3835 with a reduction (decrease in score) in severity of at least 1-level from baseline on both the PR-PCSS and the CR-PCSS at a particular visit. Observation Phase is defined as the time period from Screening to the first treatment date of the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202, or the end of Study EN3835-202 if there was no treatment received for the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202.</description>

        <description>Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) is a 5-level scale ranging from &quot;0&quot; (None) to &quot;4&quot; (Severe). A decrease in the CR-PCSS score from baseline indicates an improvement in cellulite severity. Treatment phase is defined as the time period from the second EN3835 treatment date to the end of Study EN3835-202. One hundred sixty-two participants received a second treatment course Study EN3835-202 and were included in the Effectiveness Population. This retreated/redosed treatment group comprised 87 participants that received their second treatment course of EN3835 in Study EN3835-202 having received their first treatment course in Study EN3835-201 and 75 participants that received both their first and second treatment courses in Study EN3835-202.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Hexsel CSS Total Score During the Observation Phase</title>
        <description>The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (CSS) is a photonumeric scale that evaluates 5 key morphologic features of cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, (B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature. Each of these features is evaluated on a 4-point scale from a low of &quot;0&quot; to a high of &quot;3&quot;, with higher scores signifying more severe cellulite. The Hexcel CSS total score is the sum of all 5 features and can range from &quot;0&quot; (no cellulite) to &quot;15&quot; (extremely severe cellulite) and is designated in this study as the Hexsel CSS total score.</description>

        <title>Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I-GAIS) at Observation Visit Day 360 During the Observation Phase</title>
        <description>Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I-GAIS) is a 7-point numeric scale that evaluates the improvement of the treated treatment area in global aesthetics. The scale ranges from &quot;+3&quot; (Very much improved) to &quot;-3&quot; (Very much worse), an increase in the I-GAIS scores indicates an improvement in Global Aesthetic Score. Percentages are based on the number of all evaluable subjects at each visit. Observation Phase is defined as the time period from Screening to the first treatment date of the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202, or the end of Study EN3835-202 if there was no treatment received for the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202.</description>

        <description>Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S-GAIS) is a 7-point numeric scale that evaluates the improvement of the treated treatment area in global aesthetics. The scale ranges from &quot;+3&quot; (Very much improved) to &quot;-3&quot; (Very much worse), an increase in S-GAIS indicates an improvement. Percentages are based on the number of all evaluable participants at each visit. Observation Phase is defined as the time period from Screening to the first treatment date of the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202, or the end of Study EN3835-202 if there was no treatment received for the same treatment area in Study EN3835-202.</description>

The scale ranges from &quot;+3&quot; (Very much improved) to &quot;-3&quot; (Very much worse). Percentages are based on the number of evaluable participants at each visit. One hundred sixty-two participants received a second treatment course in EN3835-202 Study and were included in the Effectiveness Population. This retreated/redosed treatment group comprised 87 participants that received their second treatment course of EN3835 in Study EN3835-202 having received their first treatment course in Study EN3835-201 and 75 participants that received both their first and second treatment courses in Study EN3835-202.

        <title>Subject Satisfaction With EFP Treatment in Treatment Phase for Subjects With Second EN3835 Treatment</title>
        <description>Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Scale is a 5-level scale designed for participants to assess their satisfaction with cellulite treatment. The scale ranges from &quot;+2&quot; (I am very satisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks or thighs) to &quot;-2&quot; (I am very dissatisfied with the cellulite treatment on my buttocks or thighs). Percentages are based on the number of evaluable participants at each visit. One hundred sixty-two participants received a second treatment course in Study EN3835-202 and were included in the Effectiveness Population. This retreated/redosed treatment group comprised 87 participants that received their second treatment course of EN3835 in Study EN3835-202 having received their first treatment course in Study EN3835-201 and 75 participants that received both their first and second treatment courses in Study EN3835-202. Treatment phase is defined as the time period from the second EN3835 treatment date to the End of Study EN3835-202.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 71 - Day 360</time_frame>
        <population>Effectiveness Population included all safety participants who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment on both the CR-PCSS and PR-PCSS on the treatment area selected for treatment in Study EN3835-202.</population>
