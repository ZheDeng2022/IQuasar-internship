      This study will monitor and further describe the long-term safety of the ReWalk Personal&#xD;
      Device for Subjects and their Companions in institutional and non-institutional environments,&#xD;
      such as the clinic, home, and community. The study will also evaluate the adequacy of the&#xD;
      Multi-Tiered Training Program of the ReWalk Personal Device for Subjects, their Companions,&#xD;
      and their Clinical Trainers, monitor and further describe all ReWalk Personal Device&#xD;
      malfunctions and screen for potential Unexpected Adverse Events.&#xD;
