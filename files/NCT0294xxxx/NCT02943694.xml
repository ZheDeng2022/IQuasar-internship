  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the leading deadly diseases in the world. Due to the TME (total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision) for the last decades, the survival and relapse rate of rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients have been considerably improved. However, anatomical limitations in pelvic space&#xD;
      hinder the further optimization of surgical treatment Thus, the natural orifice transluminal&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery (NOTES) emerges as an alternative surgical strategy. Of note, transanal&#xD;
      total mesorectal excision (TaTME) , a new invention based on TME principle, NOTES conception&#xD;
      and single port technique, has been prevailing both in West and East nations, with or without&#xD;
      the abdominal laparoscopic assistance. Up to date, there are various kinds of instruments and&#xD;
      patterns to complete TaTME with comparable clinical outcomes. However, flaws in each&#xD;
      instrument remains according to the feedbacks. This study is therefore designed to clinically&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of the new instruments specifically for TaTME&#xD;
      (CS-Compact, GelPoint pathway).&#xD;

      Rectal cancer comprises the most in colorectal cancer around the world, among which surgery&#xD;
      remains the optimal therapeutic intervention. The TME (Total Mesorectal Excision), proposed&#xD;
      by Bill Heald, provides novel insights for the eradication of possible disseminated cancer&#xD;
      cells and therefore reduces the recurrence and mortality rates. However, either laparoscopic&#xD;
      or open TME surgery is limited by the pelvic space and further improvement. For the last&#xD;
      decade, the emerging of the natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) offers an&#xD;
      alternative pattern for rectal cancer surgery, among which, the TaTME (transanal total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision) represents the most optimized surgery techniques. Derived from TME,&#xD;
      NOTES and modified laparoscopic instruments, TaTME facilitates the dissection process of&#xD;
      rectal cancer from caudal to cranial, from indirect to direct vision. TaTME allows for&#xD;
      accurate confirmation of resected margin with proper transecting level, better dissection of&#xD;
      mesorectum and protection of sphincter, a qualified end-to-end anastomosis and reduced need&#xD;
      of endolinear stapler and possible leakage afterwards. However, various kinds of instruments&#xD;
      and surgical procedures have been proposed to complete TaTME, all of which have been&#xD;
      validated by preclinical and clinical trials in small size. Of note, this study is initiated&#xD;
      to apply a suit of instruments specifically designed for TaTME ( GelPoint pathway CS-Compact)&#xD;
      and clinically evaluate the feasibility and safety of the new instruments without comparison&#xD;
      to other prevailing ones. The CS-Compact and GelPoint pathway has been confirmed both safe&#xD;
      and feasible to operate in preclinical trials and clinical trials in western. This study&#xD;
      strictly examines the corresponding issues in Chinese rectal cancer patients. The surgeons in&#xD;
      our institute have successfully completed the training programs of TaTME in preclinical&#xD;
      trials, in animal models and cadavers. Clinical skills and knowledge to safe operations are&#xD;
      qualified.&#xD;
