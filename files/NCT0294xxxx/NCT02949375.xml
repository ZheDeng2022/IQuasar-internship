      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the change in serum alanine transaminase [ALT] levels from Day 0 to Day 28,&#xD;
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 compared to placebo, in patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and elevated serum levels of ALT. Serum ALT level will be used as a marker of&#xD;
      liver inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety and tolerability of GRI-0621 at these two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the change in serum aspartate transaminase [AST] levels from baseline to Day 28,&#xD;
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo, in patients with chronic&#xD;
      liver disease and elevated serum levels of AST. Serum AST level will be used as a second&#xD;
      marker of liver inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the response to 4.5mg GRI-0621 versus 6mg GRI-0621 in terms of the change in&#xD;
      serum ALT levels from baseline measured at the different trial time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess changes in serum cytokeratin 18 [CK-18] levels from baseline to Day 28, following&#xD;
      daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo, in patients with chronic liver&#xD;
      disease. Serum CK-18 is used as a marker of hepatocyte cell death due to either necrosis or&#xD;
      apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure Natural Killer T lymphocyte [NKT] cell activity at baseline and at Day 28&#xD;
      following daily doses of 4.5 or 6mg of GRI-0621 or matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the steady-state pharmacokinetics [PK] of GRI-0621 in patients with chronic liver&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect, if any, that the investigational product may have on serum triglyceride&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi- centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial in&#xD;
      participants aged 18 to 65 years with chronic liver disease. It is designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of both 4.5mg and 6mg of GRI-0621 when administered once&#xD;
      daily for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 participants will be randomised to received 4.5mg or 6mg of GRI-0621 or&#xD;
      matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The investigational product will be administered orally&#xD;
      once daily in the morning for a duration of 28 days. Participants will return to the clinic&#xD;
      for follow-up safety and efficacy assessments on Days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Additionally, PK&#xD;
      sampling will be performed on Days 7 and 28, and samples for immunological assays to assess&#xD;
      the activity of NKT cells will be drawn on Days 0 (baseline) and 28. An end-of-trial&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be performed 14 days after the last dose of the investigational product&#xD;
      on Day 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy objective will be measured by the change from baseline to Day 28 in&#xD;
      serum ALT levels. The baseline ALT level will be calculated as the mean of the Day -7 to -1&#xD;
      and Day 0 serum ALT results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events and&#xD;
      changes in physical examination findings, physical measurements, vital signs, ECG findings&#xD;
      and standard laboratory safety parameters (including hematology, clinical chemistry,&#xD;
      coagulation parameters and urinalysis).&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant will be eligible for participation in the trial if all of the following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Completion of the written informed consent process for trial participation prior to&#xD;
             all trial-related procedures, including HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female participants aged 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participants of child-bearing potential must practice an effective method of&#xD;
             birth control from four weeks prior to randomization and agree to continue this until&#xD;
             6 months after the completion of the end-of-trial follow-up visit. Effective birth&#xD;
             control must include two methods, one of which must be a barrier method. Female&#xD;
             participants are considered not to be of child-bearing potential if they are&#xD;
             post-menopausal (12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical&#xD;
             profile, or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with local laboratory serum&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels in keeping with post-menopause) or&#xD;
             surgically sterile (after bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or salpingectomy). For&#xD;
             the purpose of this trial any participant who has had a tubal ligation will not be&#xD;
             considered surgically sterile due to the teratogenic nature of this class of chemical&#xD;
             entities.&#xD;

             pregnancy tests at screening and randomization respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of chronic liver disease [CLD] as a result of viral hepatitis, alcoholic&#xD;
