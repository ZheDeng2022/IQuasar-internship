  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a previous therapeutic trial, investigators showed that the bumetanide improved&#xD;
      significantly autism. This trial showed that a therapeutic response was obtained in 75% of&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These first results were reinforced by a study led with adult patients for whom the eye&#xD;
      tracking measurements as well as the functional MRI showed a diminution of the response time&#xD;
      and a modification (amplification) of the cerebral response during an emotions recognition&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, investigators confirmed the physiological mechanism behind the action of the&#xD;
      bumetanide in a study in two mouse models of autism.&#xD;

After the 3 months in the double blind trial (bumetanide versus placebo), all the patient will receive (in the open phase of the trial) the bumetanide during 3 months with the posology fitting with their weights.</description>
