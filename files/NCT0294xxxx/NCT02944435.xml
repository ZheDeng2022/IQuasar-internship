    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover PK comparability study of CB-839&#xD;
      administered as capsule and tablet formulations in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new tablet formulation of CB-839 was recently developed in order to enable rapid, automated&#xD;
      manufacturing of CB-839. Previous studies have used a capsule formulation of CB-839. This&#xD;
      study will enable a PK comparison between CB-839 capsules and CB-839 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, comparative, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover PK comparability&#xD;
      study of CB-839 administered as capsule and tablet formulations in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
      Serial blood samples for PK analyses will be collected over a 24 hour period after each&#xD;
      administration of CB-839. All subjects will be monitored for safety throughout their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
