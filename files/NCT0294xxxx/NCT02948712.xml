    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help adolescents and young adult cancer survivors address&#xD;
      their psycho-social needs during the transitional period. The transitional period begins at&#xD;
      completion of cancer treatment and continues throughout that first year. Patients often&#xD;
      report this period can be difficult and distressing in many areas of life. This study will&#xD;
      use a simple tool to measure, on a regular basis, the level of distress a young adult may be&#xD;
      feeling. Based on this assessment additional mental health support and intervention can be&#xD;
      recommended to help cancer survivors cope and enhance their feelings of well-being.&#xD;
