  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella enteric serovar Typhi (S. typhi), a human specific&#xD;
      pathogen. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes typhoid fever as a global health&#xD;
      problem, with an estimated 21 million cases and 200,000-600,000 deaths annually. In Africa&#xD;
      and South Asia, young children represent a subgroup with the highest disease burden. The&#xD;
      onset of the illness is insidious and clinical diagnosis is often unreliable. Definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis through blood or bone-marrow culture is labor-intensive, expensive, and invasive,&#xD;
      with a sensitivity of 40 to 70%. WHO recommends routine typhoid fever vaccination but&#xD;
      currently licensed vaccines provide only 55-75% protection against the disease. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need to develop rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive diagnostic methods, as&#xD;
      well as more efficacious vaccines for countries where typhoid fever remains a major public&#xD;
      health burden. The long term goals are 1) to develop innovative molecular diagnostic assays&#xD;
      for rapid and inexpensive detection of typhoid fever and, 2) to better understand the&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms of host response to facilitate the development of next-generation&#xD;
      typhoid fever vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate objective is to obtain global gene expression and proteomic profiles of S.&#xD;
      Typhi infected African children, identify and validate the classifier genes and proteins as&#xD;
      potential diagnostic biomarkers and vaccine targets. A bacteremia surveillance system was&#xD;
      established in central Nigeria in 2008; a pilot study was initiated from a small cohort from&#xD;
      this system composed of children with typhoid fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data showed unique gene expression profiles of host response in peripheral blood&#xD;
      of children with typhoid fever compared with other bacteremic infections, as well as patients&#xD;
      in acute vs. convalescent phase. Here, it is hypothesized that distinct classifier genes and&#xD;
      proteins based on host response in the peripheral blood and serum can be obtained to&#xD;
      discriminate typhoid fever from other bacteremic infections and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Define typhoid fever-specific host response classifier genes using gene expression (GE)&#xD;
           micro-arrays,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Discover specific serum anti-typhoid fever proteins using newly established S. Typhi&#xD;
           proteome micro-arrays and develop prototype serologic assay for acute typhoid (ELISA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validate classifier genes and field-test prototype ELISAs using new, independent&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these objectives, a multidisciplinary team with expertise in infectious&#xD;
      disease, immunology, molecular genomics/proteomics, micro-arrays, and bioinformatics has been&#xD;
      assembled to ensure success of this project. These studies will identify distinct classifier&#xD;
      genes and proteins of typhoid fever infection based on immunological responses. Classifiers&#xD;
      that discriminate S. Typhi from other bacteremia are possible to develop and offer rapid,&#xD;
      inexpensive, non-invasive, and sensitive molecular diagnostic assays specific for typhoid&#xD;
      fever. Classifier proteins obtained from the new, custom whole-proteome typhoid fever&#xD;
      micro-arrays will provide new insights of targeted proteins and antibodies for&#xD;
      next-generation vaccine development.&#xD;
