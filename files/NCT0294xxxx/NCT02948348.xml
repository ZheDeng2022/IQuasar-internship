    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, and proof of concept (POC) of monotherapy with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      drug, as a sequential therapy following chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with capecitabine and&#xD;
      subsequent surgical therapy in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [Phase Ib]&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preoperative CRT, to sequentially administer nivolumab in combination for patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced resectable rectal cancer. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab in sequential&#xD;
      combination therapy, the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the safety of subsequent&#xD;
      surgical therapy, and to decide on a recommended dose (RD) for the phase II part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Phase II] Phaseâ…¡ is composed of 4 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: First-onset rectal cancer cohort (42 cases) To evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      nivolumab (at the RD determined in Phase Ib) in sequential combination with surgery,&#xD;
      administered following preoperative CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And to search for biomarkers related to therapeutic effects in first-onset cases. Evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Rectal cancer with localized recurrence cohort (10 cases) To conduct an exploratory&#xD;
      evaluation of the efficacy and safety of nivolumab (at the RD determined in Phase Ib) in&#xD;
      sequential combination with surgery, administered after preoperative CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search for biomarkers related to therapeutic effects in localized recurrence cases. Conduct&#xD;
      an exploratory evaluation on the safety of surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C: Rectal cancer with resectable lung/liver metastasis cohort (10 cases) To conduct an&#xD;
      exploratory evaluation of the efficacy and safety of nivolumab (at the RD determined in Phase&#xD;
      Ib) in sequential combination with surgery, administered after preoperative CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search for biomarkers related to therapeutic effects in resectable lung/liver metastasis&#xD;
      cases. Conduct an exploratory evaluation on the safety of surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D: First-onset rectal cancer using ipilimumab-nivolumab combination cohort (25 cases)&#xD;
      To conduct an exploratory evaluation of the efficacy and safety of nivolumab (240 mg/body at&#xD;
      two-week intervals) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg at six-week intervals) after preoperative CRT,&#xD;
      and search for biomarkers related to therapeutic effects in first-onset cases. Conduct an&#xD;
      exploratory evaluation on the safety of surgical treatment.&#xD;
