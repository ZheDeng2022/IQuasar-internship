      The purpose of this study is to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD,&#xD;
      especially the metabolomic pathway related to the behavioral/neuropsychological deficits of&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify specific metabolites that show significant differences between ADHD and control&#xD;
      groups, both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry&#xD;
      will be performed. In addition, the behavioral measures include ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL,&#xD;
      CGI-ADHD-S, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C. Neuropsychological testing, including CPT and CANTAB,&#xD;
      will be performed. Conditional logistic regression and partial least squares discriminant&#xD;
      analysis will be applied to identify significant metabolites for ADHD. Pathway enrichment and&#xD;
      topology analyses will be conducted to evaluate the regulated pathways.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early onset and long-term&#xD;
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies, detection&#xD;
      and diagnosis are very important for ADHD. Current diagnosis of ADHD relies mainly on&#xD;
      clinical observation and interview tools that may involve a great subjective variability, and&#xD;
      thus the investigation of objective biomarkers for ADHD is warranted. Metabolomics is the&#xD;
      study of a biologic process involving all metabolites that are end products of the cellular&#xD;
      process in a whole organism. Because metabolites represent the downstream expression of&#xD;
      genome, transcriptome, and proteome, metabolomic profiles are more proximal to the behavioral&#xD;
      phenotypes of ADHD. Analyzing metabolic differences between children with ADHD and healthy&#xD;
      controls will provide insight into underlying disease pathology. To date, there has been no&#xD;
      metabolomics study on ADHD. In this 3-year project, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      metabolomics analysis of serum to identify potential biomarkers for the behavioral and&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-year project. After careful calculation of sample size, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit 120 drug-naïve children with ADHD, aged 7-18, and 120 healthy controls with matched&#xD;
      age, sex and BMI. Using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry, serum-based metabolomic profiling will be performed. The&#xD;
      behavioral measures include ADHDRS-IV, SNAP-IV, CBCL, CGI-ADHD-S, SAICA, and Family APGAR-C.&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing, including CPT and CANTAB, will be performed. Conditional logistic&#xD;
      regression and partial least squares discriminant analysis will be applied to identify&#xD;
      significant metabolites for ADHD. Pathway enrichment and topology analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate the regulated pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a matched study design, the investigators anticipate to identify specific metabolites&#xD;
      that show significant differences between ADHD and control groups. In addition, results of&#xD;
      pathway analysis may offer more biological understanding in explaining the underlying&#xD;
      metabolic regulation among children with ADHD. This findings will significantly contribute to&#xD;
      the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD, especially the metabolomic&#xD;
      pathway related to the behavioral/neuropsychological deficits of ADHD.&#xD;

      The investigators will collect blood samples from each participant after 8-hour fasting.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be transferred into evacuated tubes that contain anticoagulant sodium&#xD;
      dihydrogen phosphate (EDTA), centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Serum will be&#xD;
      extracted and stored at -80°C for sample analysis. The collection of blood sample will be&#xD;
      conducted at the NTUH.&#xD;
