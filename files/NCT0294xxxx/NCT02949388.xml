      This study is designed as a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial to study the efficacy and safety of two oral doses of Prurisol administered twice daily&#xD;
      for twelve weeks to subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 189 study participants will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of three treatment groups in a 3:3:1 randomization ratio, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (n=81): Prurisol 150 mg bid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (n=81): Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (n=27): Prurisol 200 mg bid Outpatient subjects with moderate to severe chronic&#xD;
           plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy will be&#xD;
           recruited to the study. Study participants are required to have a Psoriasis Area and&#xD;
           Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12, body surface area involvement ≥ 10%, and a static&#xD;
           Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) of moderate or severe (score of 3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject studied under this clinical protocol will commence with a screening period of up to&#xD;
      4 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks ending with an End&#xD;
      of Study evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment, subjects will return to the study center every 2 weeks. Efficacy&#xD;
      assessments, including physician and patient rated endpoints, will be measured throughout the&#xD;
      study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by ascertainment of AEs and results of&#xD;
      clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and need for concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a subset of sites, blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of Prurisol&#xD;
      (abacavir glycolate) and abacavir, it's metabolite, will be obtained from subjects who&#xD;
      consent to provide these samples. At selected sites, for those subjects consenting to&#xD;
      photography, standardized digital photographs will be obtained for illustrative purposes.&#xD;
