    <textblock>
      This study will examine differences in diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) between a meal made&#xD;
      of processed ingredients and an equivalent, isocaloric meal made of whole ingredients. For&#xD;
      the purpose of this study processed foods (PFs) will be considered those that are purchased&#xD;
      in a state that is modified from their whole food (WF) counterpart (e.g. shell eggs compared&#xD;
      to powdered eggs). Research has shown that less energy is expended to digest processed foods&#xD;
      than whole foods, which confers an advantage to processed foods in terms of caloric&#xD;
      efficiency, but a disadvantage in terms of energy balance and weight loss. A 2010 study&#xD;
      showed that subjects expended approximately 10% less energy to digest sandwiches made of&#xD;
      white bread and cheese product compared to sandwiches made of whole grain bread and cheddar&#xD;
      cheese. The intent of this study is to enhance those results and improve upon the study&#xD;
      design by constructing meals to be more similar in the makeup of individual ingredients,&#xD;
      making ingredient processing a more isolated variable. Subjects will be healthy CWU male&#xD;
      students with a body mass index of 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2. Metabolism will be assessed by repeated&#xD;
      measurements of resting energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry. Measurements of baseline&#xD;
      metabolism will be made; subjects will then be provided one of two meals, both comprised of&#xD;
      rice, green beans, and eggs cooked in canola oil and equivalent but differing in processing&#xD;
      status (e.g. brown rice and white rice, fresh cooked green beans and canned green beans,&#xD;
      etc). Hourly metabolic measurements will be made post-meal for 6 hours. During this time&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to minimize non-DIT deviations in metabolism; e.g. those due to&#xD;
      physical activity, excitement level, etc. The procedure will be repeated one week later with&#xD;
      the other meal so that changes in DIT can be assessed on a subject-by-subject basis. The&#xD;
      results of this study will be assessed in the lens of weight loss, specifically dietary&#xD;
      choices that affect energy balance. It is possible that consuming a diet that includes more&#xD;
      whole foods (versus processed foods) would be beneficial to the attainment of a healthy body&#xD;
      weight - either through potential weight loss or weight maintenance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a crossover design that will use indirect calorimetry to assess changes in&#xD;
      metabolic rates in twelve healthy subjects prescreened for any known metabolic abnormalities.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from healthy CWU male students of a normal BMI range that express&#xD;
      interest in research study participation. Subjects will be assigned either a meal made of&#xD;
      whole ingredients (whole grain brown rice, unrefined canola oil, scrambled eggs from the&#xD;
      shell, freshly-steamed green beans) or one made of processed ingredients (white rice, canola&#xD;
      oil-based margarine, scrambled eggs from a powdered mix, canned green beans). Subjects will&#xD;
      have a basal metabolic rate (BMR) measurement taken before ingesting the meal and DIT will be&#xD;
      measured on an hourly basis post meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Meal Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal preparation will begin the night prior to each testing session by cooking 2 cups of dry&#xD;
      rice per the package instructions and chilling it in a shallow stainless steel pan. This rice&#xD;
      will be refrigerated overnight and re-heated portion-by-portion for the following morning's&#xD;
      meal feeding. Three portions of one cup's worth of fresh green beans will also be washed,&#xD;
      trimmed, cut into one-inch pieces, and refrigerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two subjects will be assessed per day. Subjects will each report to the lab for a total of&#xD;
      two days (approximately 8 hour days) one week apart for a baseline metabolic measurement, a&#xD;
      meal feeding, and a series of post-meal metabolic measurements. Measurements will take 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete, including time for calibration to the individual prior to the&#xD;
      measurement and time for cleaning and preparing the assessment equipment for the next&#xD;
      subject. Subjects will arrive in thirty minute staggered scheduled intervals each morning&#xD;
      (see proposed example schedule attached). At least three days prior to initial testing&#xD;
      subjects will be provided with a three-day diet intake record to be completed by the subject&#xD;
      during the three days prior to initial testing. Instructions on correct completion of the&#xD;
      three day diet record will be given to each subject when they are provided with the three day&#xD;
      records (please see attached; this diet record has been modified and used with permission&#xD;
      from the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute-[see attached email]). At&#xD;
      this time subjects will be re-briefed on pre-test protocol and provided instructions for&#xD;
      setting up and using the heart rate monitors. The three day records will be reviewed with&#xD;
      each subject on the day of data collection for completeness and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-test protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein has the greatest effect on metabolism of all macronutrients, so intake will be&#xD;
      limited to no more than the recommended daily allowance of .8 g protein per kg body weight3&#xD;
      the evening prior to testing; all other macronutrient and micronutrient intakes are to be&#xD;
      consumed at the discretion of the subject. No intake with caloric content is to be consumed&#xD;
      after a point in the evening which is 12 hours prior to testing (approximately 7 PM).&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol, marijuana, and caffeine use the night before&#xD;
      and the day of testing. Subjects will be asked to refrain from strenuous physical activity&#xD;
      for two days before testing and to restrain from all but light physical activity the day&#xD;
      before testing. Upon awakening the morning of testing, subjects will activate a MyZone MZ-3&#xD;
      heart rate monitor and consume 500 mL of supplied bottled water. Subjects will report to the&#xD;
      lab, expending as little energy as possible (driving instead of walking, taking the elevator&#xD;
      instead of stairs, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting Phase and BMR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arriving at the testing site, subjects will be provided a 30 minute period during which&#xD;
      they will be briefed again on the procedure, allowed to urinate or defecate if needed, and&#xD;
      rest until baseline testing. A ParvoMedics TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measuring System (MMS) will&#xD;
      be used to determine metabolic rates using the dilution method outlined in the manual (see&#xD;
      attached). At the beginning of the 30 minute BMR testing period the subject will lie face up&#xD;
      on the assessment table and will be allowed to get comfortable before being fitted with the&#xD;
      measurement hood. The flow rate of the MMS dilution pump will be calibrated to each subject.&#xD;
      During each measurement, the subject will be instructed to lie still with the eyes closed&#xD;
      while breathing normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Meal Preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Food Meals Bring one quart of water to boil in a medium pot. Heat 2 Tbsp unrefined&#xD;
      canola oil on medium heat in a skillet. Beat 3 large shell eggs together in a cup and add&#xD;
      directly to the skillet, cooking and stirring until eggs are fluffy and set (3-5 minutes).&#xD;
      During this time, place 1 cup of cut green beans in a metal strainer, set above boiling&#xD;
      water, and cover with lid for 3 minutes. Place 1.5 cups of precooked brown rice on a plate&#xD;
      and microwave for 1.5 minutes, then allow to stand for 2 minutes to ensure even heating. Add&#xD;
      cooked eggs and green beans to plate, and scrape oil over rice with a spatula. Cover plate&#xD;
      with a lid and deliver to testing site. Microwave meal for 30 seconds immediately before&#xD;
      serving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processed Food Meals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drain and rinse 1 cup of canned green beans. Heat 2 Tbsp canola-based margarine on medium&#xD;
      heat in a skillet. Prepare 3 eggs' worth of powdered egg mix per package instructions and add&#xD;
      directly to the skillet, cooking and stirring until eggs are fluffy and set (3-5 minutes).&#xD;
      During this time, place 1.5 cups of precooked white rice and the 1 cup of green beans on a&#xD;
      plate and microwave for 1.5 minutes, then allow to stand for 2 minutes to ensure even&#xD;
      heating. Add cooked eggs to plate, and scrape oil over rice with a spatula. Cover plate with&#xD;
      a lid and deliver to testing site. Microwave meal for 30 seconds immediately before serving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Meal ingredient amounts may change based on the average energy needs of the subjects&#xD;
      (e.g. 1 cup of rice instead of 1.5, etc). Both meals will be adjusted so as to keep them&#xD;
      isocaloric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal Feeding and Rest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be served one type of meal during the assessment session, and the other meal&#xD;
      one week later during the second assessment. Meals will be served immediately after BMR&#xD;
      measurements are complete. Subjects will be asked to consume the entire meal and will be&#xD;
      provided 30 minutes to do so. Following completion of the meal, subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      remain onsite and will be instructed to lie down or sit quietly and rest until the first DIT&#xD;
      measurement takes place. During the meal and until the completion of the day's testing,&#xD;
      subjects will be permitted to consume only water. A graduated water bottle will be provided&#xD;
      to record water intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIT Measurement and Rest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIT will be assessed in the same fashion as BMR. The first DIT reading will take place one&#xD;
      hour from the beginning of the BMR measurement. Afterwards, subjects will be asked to remain&#xD;
      onsite and will be instructed to rest. Subjects may lie down or sit quietly, or engage in a&#xD;
      non-physical activity that does not induce psychological stress or excitement. This includes&#xD;
      but is not limited to: using the bathroom, reading, completing homework, watching an&#xD;
      appropriate movie, talking quietly, etc. DIT measurements will be taken on an hourly basis&#xD;
      for six hours or until metabolism returns to base levels. No intake except for water will be&#xD;
      permitted until the day's measurements are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be assigned a study ID number and all data collected will only be&#xD;
      identifiable by that study ID number. Only the primary investigators will have access to&#xD;
      participant's contact information to assure confidentiality. Summary statistics (mean,&#xD;
      standard deviations, ranges, and proportions) will be calculated for baseline demographic&#xD;
      characteristics (see attached questionnaire). Three-day diet record information will be&#xD;
      entered on ESHA Food Processor Software and quantitative analysis of macronutrient intake&#xD;
      performed. Data from the MSM will be transferred on to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and&#xD;
      repeated measures t-tests performed on metabolic statistics for each subject. A p-value &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
