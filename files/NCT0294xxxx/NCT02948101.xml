  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of PD 0360324 and cyclophosphamide and to see&#xD;
      how well they work in treating patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of improvement.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as PD 0360324, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Cyclophosphamide may stop the growth of disease by blocking the growth of new blood&#xD;
      vessels necessary for tumor growth. Giving PD 0360324 and cyclophosphamide may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety of anti-CSF1 monoclonal antibody PD-0360324 (PD 0360324) followed&#xD;
      by cyclophosphamide in patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the density of CD8+ T cells in tumor biopsies before and after PD 0360324.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate response rate and progression free survival associated with low dose oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide after PD 0360324 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate M-CSF concentrations before and after treatment with PD 0360324 and during&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the immunologic effects of PD 0360324 on peripheral blood and ovarian cancer&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the relationships between drug concentration and immunologic biomarkers and&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-CSF1 monoclonal antibody PD 0360324 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Starting on day 43, patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO)&#xD;
      once daily (QD). Courses with cyclophosphamide repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days.&#xD;
