    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well targeted therapy works in treating patients with&#xD;
      incurable non-small cell lung cancer with a genetic mutation. Giving drugs that target other&#xD;
      genetic mutations or other specific proteins may work better when a patient has cancer caused&#xD;
      by a driver mutation and the treatment that targets that mutation stops working.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate among patients with high PD-L1 expressing cancers&#xD;
      after failure of targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall survival for patients receiving treatment targeting primary&#xD;
      mutations, secondary mutations, or immunotherapy at the time of progression on tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the incidence of secondary mutations in this population according to smoking&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the response rates of patients treated using these different approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate outcomes with specific secondary genetic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (PD-L1 &gt;= 50%): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2&#xD;
      weeks or pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (PD-L1 &lt; 50% without secondary oncogenic driver): Patients receive tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy orally (PO) targeting the initial oncogenic driver or other treatment for&#xD;
      about 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III (PD-L1 &lt; 50% with secondary oncogenic driver): Patients receive tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy PO targeting initial oncogenic driver, a drug targeting the secondary&#xD;
      mutation, or other treatment for about 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for a minimum of 30 days.&#xD;
