  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of ixazomib and erlotinib that can be given to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat non-small cell lung cancer, but its use in advanced solid cancer is considered&#xD;
      investigational. Ixazomib is FDA approved. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs&#xD;
      are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of ixazomib and erlotinib based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of&#xD;
      ixazomib will be tested. Up to 18 participants may be enrolled at each dose level. The first&#xD;
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of ixazomib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose of erlotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 18 participants will be enrolled at that dose&#xD;
      level as an expansion group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of the study drug combination that you receive may be lowered if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take ixazomib capsules by mouth on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take erlotinib tablets by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should swallow ixazomib capsules whole with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water. Each capsule&#xD;
      should be swallowed separately with a sip of water. You should also swallow erlotinib tablets&#xD;
      whole with water. You should take the ixazomib and erlotinib doses at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do not break, chew, or open the capsules or tablets. Each dose should be taken on an empty&#xD;
      stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If you miss a dose, take it as soon&#xD;
      as you remember, as long as the next scheduled dose is at least 72 hours (ixazomib) or 12&#xD;
      hours (erlotinib) away. You should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. If&#xD;
      you vomit after taking a dose, wait until the next scheduled dose. Do not take an additional&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your dose of study drug may be changed and/or you may be given drugs to help control the side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, leftover blood (about 1 teaspoon) and/or urine will be&#xD;
           collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, blood (about 1-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body&#xD;
           at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and kidney&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 2 and Beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. The blood&#xD;
           sample will also be used for liver and kidney function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the routine blood or urine test will be used for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test. To continue on this study, you must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 28 of each cycle, if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of every other cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), you will have imaging scans&#xD;
           (either CT scans or MRI) performed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have side effects or abnormal test results while on study, you may be asked to return&#xD;
      to the clinic for more tests until the side effects or abnormal test results improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, if you develop new health problems, or if you are no longer&#xD;
      able to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and&#xD;
           kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;

             treatment with anti-EGFR therapy (e.g. erlotinib or afatinib) and tested negative for&#xD;
             EGFR T790M mutation. We will allow patients with positive EGFR T790M mutation if they&#xD;
             have progressed on third generation anti-EGFR therapy (e.g. CO-1686 or AZD9291) or&#xD;

         14. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: 1) Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patient with&#xD;
             KRAS point mutation at codon G12 or G13. Since KRAS mutation is present in more than&#xD;
             90% of pancreatic cancer with 98% of the mutation found at codon 12, we expect&#xD;
             majority of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be eligible for the&#xD;
             study. We plan to enroll up to 9 patients in this cohort. In addition to the above&#xD;
             inclusion criteria, first 5 patients from both non-small cell lung cancer and&#xD;
             pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients will need to agree to mandatory pre- and&#xD;

             the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Radiotherapy completed within 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Radiotherapy&#xD;
             completed &gt;2 weeks prior to treatment initiation is allowed if all procedure-related&#xD;

             chemically related to study drug, or excipients or to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current use of a prohibited medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal or brain metastases or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression. If these were treated and clinically stable for 4 weeks, patient can be&#xD;
             considered for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient who is on strong inducer/inhibitor of CYP3A needs to be off the medication&#xD;

             of pregnancy and not as a tumor marker during the screening period. If pregnancy is&#xD;
             tested positive, treating physician will further investigate if the patient is&#xD;
             pregnant or not. Treating physician may consider repeating the serum beta-hCG at next&#xD;
             follow up visit or refer patient to OB/GYN for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
