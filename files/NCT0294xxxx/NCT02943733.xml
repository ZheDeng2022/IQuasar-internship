  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish maximum tolerated doses/recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of temozolomide (TMZ) and TAS-102 when these agents are used in combination and to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety profile of this drug combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two part phase 1B clinical trial consisting of three study periods: a&#xD;
      screening period of 14 days or less, a treatment period, and a safety follow-up period 30&#xD;
      days after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a dose finding phase with the objective to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the proposed drug combination and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is an open-label expansion study, which will enroll patients with metastatic pNETs who&#xD;
      have not been previously treated with chemotherapy. Part 2 will obtain further safety data of&#xD;
      the proposed drug combination.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1: dose-escalation phase to determine MTD of TAS-102 in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ). Treatment cycles are 28 days, with TAS-102 administered orally twice daily days 1-5 and 8-12, and TMZ administered orally days 8-12. No treatment medications administered days 13-28 of each cycle. Growth factor support is required during Part 1 and should be dosed per institutional standards.&#xD;
Part 2: expansion phase to evaluate preliminary efficacy of MTD. Subjects treated with the recommended phase 2 drug doses determined in part 1. Treatment will continue for up to 13 cycles (approx. 12 months). Growth factor support is allowed during Part 2 and should be dosed per institutional standards.</description>
