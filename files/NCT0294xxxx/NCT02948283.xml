      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin hydrochloride&#xD;
      and ritonavir in treating patients with multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia that&#xD;
      has returned after a period of improvement or has not responded to treatment. Metformin&#xD;
      hydrochloride and ritonavir may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering metformin&#xD;
      hydrochloride (metformin)/ritonavir combination therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the clinical activity of this two-drug combination by assessing disease&#xD;
      response, response duration, and (in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [RRMM]) clinical&#xD;
      benefit response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the progression-free survival, overall survival and compliance of all patients&#xD;
      who start the two-drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate potential changes in health-related quality of life, as assessed by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM) and Leukemia&#xD;
      (FACT-Leu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of metformin and ritonavir when given in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. In relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RRCLL), to describe changes in pAKT,&#xD;
      pAMPK, and MCL-1, in circulating lymphocytes in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SINGLE AGENT STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMBINATION REGIMEN STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID and ritonavir PO&#xD;
      BID on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
