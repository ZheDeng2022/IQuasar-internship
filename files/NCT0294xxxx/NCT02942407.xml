  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial. The&#xD;
      patient population consists of patients on hemodialysis who have atrial fibrillation (AF) and&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study in adult patients with AF and ESRD who are on hemodialysis and&#xD;
      who have stroke risk factors making them candidates for oral anticoagulation. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to apixaban versus warfarin, and will be treated for up to 15 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing ISTH (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) Major or Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to Month 15/Final Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the safety of apixaban versus warfarin regarding ISTH major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in patients with NVAF (nonvalvular atrial fibrillation) and ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on hemodialysis.&#xD;
Major bleeding event is defined as:Acute clinically overt bleeding (including access site related bleeding) accompanied by 1 or more of the following: Decrease in Hgb of 2g/dL or more with overt bleeding; Transfusion of 2 or more units of packed RBCs in the setting of an overt bleeding event; Bleeding within a critical site. Hemorrhagic stroke (primary or infarction with hemorrhagic conversion) were classified as major bleeds.&#xD;
Non-major bleeding event is defined as: Acute or sub-acute clinically overt bleeding (including access site related bleeding) that does not meet criteria for major bleeding &amp; results in Hospital admission for bleeding, physician guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or change in antithrombotic therapy</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Systemic Embolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to Month 15/Final Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Adjudicated diagnosis of systemic arterial embolism (Non-pulmonary, non-cranial events) will require a positive clinical history consistent with an acute loss of blood flow to a peripheral artery (or arteries), which is supported by evidence of embolism/thrombosis from surgical specimens, autopsy, angiography, vascular imaging, or other objective testing.&#xD;
Clinical presentation would include:&#xD;
Abrupt development of pain, absent pulses, pallor, and/or paresis in an extremity (at least an entire digit) without previous severe claudication or findings of severe peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
Renal embolism will be diagnosed when sudden flank pain or a change in renal laboratory findings occurred.&#xD;
Abdominal vascular/visceral embolism was considered definite if acute abdominal symptoms or referred symptoms developed along with a change in abdominal examination or appropriate laboratory values.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to Month 15/Final Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Adjudcated stroke defined as a new, non-traumatic episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction of sudden onset caused by central nervous system (CNS) vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction and not due to a readily identifiable non-vascular cause (i.e. brain tumor). CNS includes brain, spinal cord and retina. The required duration of the deficit is ≥ 24 hours.&#xD;
Events with neurologic deficit lasting for &lt; 24 hours and an imaging modality showing evidence of an acute stroke will be counted as stroke as well.&#xD;
A retinal ischemic event (embolism, infarction) will be considered a stroke</description>

Non-major bleeding event is defined as: Acute or sub-acute clinically overt bleeding (including access site related bleeding) that does not meet criteria for major bleeding &amp; results in Hospital admission for bleeding, physician guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or change in antithrombotic therapy</description>
