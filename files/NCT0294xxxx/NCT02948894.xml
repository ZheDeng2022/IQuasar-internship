  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim: The MOSAIC trial aims to assess the impact of a mandibular advancement device&#xD;
      (MAD) on Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) in Asian patients with Heart Failure with reduced&#xD;
      Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the AHI was 60% lower after 3-month treatment with MAD than with sham MAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims: The investigators also aim to determine i. the interaction between ethnicity&#xD;
      (Chinese, Malay, Indians) and the effects of MAD in lowering AHI; ii. the effect of MAD on&#xD;
      cardiac remodeling (LVEDVI assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]); iii. the&#xD;
      characteristic craniofacial skeletal anatomy (using coned beam computed tomography [CT])&#xD;
      associated with OSA in Asian patients with HFrEF; iv. the association between self-reported&#xD;
      adherence to MAD and cardiac remodeling; v. the effects of MAD on biomarkers of HF&#xD;
      (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP],high sensitivity cardiac troponin T&#xD;
      [hs cTnT], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], and ST2);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: OSA is associated with incident HF. The investigators will study Asian patients&#xD;
      because a body of evidence suggests mechanisms for OSA differ between Asians and Caucasians.&#xD;
      While obesity is the major contributing factor in Caucasians, craniofacial skeletal anatomy&#xD;
      (short mandible, maxilla, and cranial base and a large mandibular volume) plays an important&#xD;
      role in the development of OSA among Asians. Using cone beam CT, it has been shown that&#xD;
      Asians have shorter mandibular, maxillary, and cranial base lengths and a greater mandibular&#xD;
      volume compared with Caucasians. Using a MAD to adjust maxillary-mandibular juxta-positioning&#xD;
      to maintain a patent airway may be an ethnic-specific approach to treat OSA in Asians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MOSAIC is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to be&#xD;
      conducted at the National University Health System. It is a collaboration between the&#xD;
      National University Heart Centre Singapore, the Faculty of Dentistry, and the University&#xD;
      Medicine Cluster. Apart from evaluating the effect of MAD on AHI- a conventional measure of&#xD;
      OSA severity, the investigators will also explore the effect of MAD on cardiac remodeling.&#xD;
      Adverse remodeling equates to progressive worsening of cardiac function, and slowing or&#xD;
      reversing such remodeling is a goal of HF therapy. Ventricular measures including LV end&#xD;
      diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) have proven to be meaningful surrogates reflecting the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of therapeutic agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the remodeling process and on &quot;hard&quot; morbid and mortal end&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening. Patients (n=200) will undergo polysomnography and coned beam CT if the following&#xD;
      criteria are met: (i) Asians (Chinese, Malay or Indians) living in Singapore (ii) symptomatic&#xD;
      HF (NYHA classes II-III) due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, (iii) LVEF &lt;45% (as determined by&#xD;
      echocardiography) (iv) clinical stability for ≥1 month, (v) optimal medical therapy including&#xD;
      a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker,&#xD;
      and a beta-blocker. The doses of these background medications should be stable for ≥1 month.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:-(i) known OSA on treatment, (ii) acute coronary syndrome within the&#xD;
      preceding 3 months, (iii) severe valvular heart disease, (iv) sustained ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmia, (v) stroke with residual neurological deficits, (vi) contraindication to CMR such&#xD;
      as a pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Polysomnography will be performed at the National University Health System (NUHS)&#xD;
      Cardiosleep Research Laboratory following a standard laboratory protocol with a computerized&#xD;
      recording system. All sleep studies will be scored according to the American Academy of Sleep&#xD;
      Medicine guidelines, by an experienced sleep physician. Apnea is defined as a complete&#xD;
      cessation in airflow lasting ≥10 s and hypopnea as a reduction in airflow or&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal movement by ≥50% for ≥10 s. Apneas will be classified as (i) obstructive if&#xD;
      thoraco-abdominal movement was present during the apnea; (ii) central if thoraco-abdominal&#xD;
      movement was absent; and (iii) mixed if thoraco-abdominal movements were both present and&#xD;
      absent during the period of airflow cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coned beam CT. To determine the specific craniofacial anatomy that predicts OSA in Asians&#xD;
      with HFrEF, the patients (regardless of the polysomnography results) will undergo a coned&#xD;
      beam CT for craniofacial profiling at the Faculty of Dentistry. Image acquisition will be&#xD;
      performed during quiet tidal breathing with subjects supine and with a neutral head position.&#xD;
      Landmarks will be identified and measurements performed as previously reported. Tongue area&#xD;
      will be measured by tracing the contours on the sagittal plane, whereas lateral wall&#xD;
      thickness and parapharyngeal fat will be quantified on the axial plane. To determine tongue&#xD;
      volume, the tongue limits will be identified and traced manually on each axial image&#xD;
      obtained. Volumetric reconstructions will be performed to determine mandible, tongue, and&#xD;
      airway volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. After the initial evaluation, the patients found to have OSA (estimated&#xD;
      prevalence 50%, n=100) with an AHI of ≥ 15 events/hr will be randomized to (i) MAD followed&#xD;
      by sham MAD (non-advanced device) or (ii) sham MAD followed by MAD, with a 2-week washout&#xD;
      period in between. A dentist, who is otherwise not involved in HF care, will open a sealed&#xD;
      envelope at the time of randomization and program the MAD device accordingly. Each mode will&#xD;
      be maintained for 3 months, with comprehensive testing (polysomnography, echo, and biomarker&#xD;
      assays) at the end of each 3-month period. The patients would also keep a daily record of&#xD;
      time overnight wearing the device (adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular Advancement Devices. MADs are designed to improve upper airway configuration and&#xD;
      prevent collapse through alteration of jaw and tongue position. MADs have been shown in&#xD;
      randomized trials to improve OSA and its symptoms. A significant reduction in blood pressure,&#xD;
      improvement in endothelial reactivity and a fall in plasma NT-pro BNP have been reported with&#xD;
      MAD treatment. Side effects from the treatment, such as pain from the teeth and jaws, are&#xD;
      generally mild and transient. In a randomized trial, MAD and continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure therapy were found to be equally effective in reducing blood pressure in patients&#xD;
      with moderate-to-severe OSA. Given that MADs target the mandible by mechanically protruding&#xD;
      the lower jaw and enlarging the upper airway, we hypothesize that they could be particularly&#xD;
      effective in Asian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers. Serum levels of NT-proBNP, TnT, hs-CRP, and ST2 will be evaluated serially.&#xD;
      NT-proBNP is released from cardiac myocytes in response to pressure or volume overload,&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmia and hypoxaemia, with the predominant stimulus end-diastolic wall stress.&#xD;
      NT-proBNP provides independent prognostic information on disease progression, hospital&#xD;
      re-admission and mortality. TnT is typically used to diagnose myocardial infarction, but&#xD;
      elevated troponin is commonly present in patients with HF. Troponin above the upper reference&#xD;
      limit is associated with more severe HF. Inflammation is an important mechanism in the&#xD;
      progression of HF. In a recent study of patients with HF, the prognostic value of hs-CRP was&#xD;
      investigated and it was found that mortality rate increased from the lowest to highest hs-CRP&#xD;
      quartiles. After adjustment for confounders, hs-CRP was found to be an independent predictor&#xD;
      of 12-month mortality. ST2 is an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor family member that is secreted&#xD;
      into the circulation and functions as a &quot;decoy&quot; receptor for IL-33, inhibiting IL-33/ST2&#xD;
      signaling. In patients with HF, plasma ST2 is strongly associated with measures of HF&#xD;
      severity and poor outcome.&#xD;
