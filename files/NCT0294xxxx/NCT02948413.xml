      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cancer diagnosis is a threat to life and bodily integrity. This can cause people with&#xD;
      cancer to experience traumatic stress. Researchers want to better understand the types of&#xD;
      stress and emotional reactions people with cancer experience. They also want to know if the&#xD;
      stress people with cancer have had during their life affects their stress related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if lifetime traumas, along with psychosocial distress, can predict traumatic stress&#xD;
      symptoms in people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have had or are currently getting care from the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center for one of these cancers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with name, date of birth, and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will allow access to their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete, online or in person, a demographic sheet and 3 questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: This assesses traumatic stress symptoms and takes 5 10&#xD;
&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5: This assesses potentially traumatic life events and&#xD;
&#xD;
      takes about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Brief Symptoms Inventory 18: This assesses psychosocial distress and takes about 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      minutes to complete....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The American College of Surgeons requires accredited cancer hospitals to screen for&#xD;
           distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providers at the NIH CC do not uniformly screen for traumatic stress in oncology&#xD;
           patients but have observed innumerable patients with deficits in social functioning,&#xD;
           difficulty adhering to treatment, and trouble coping due to oncology related traumatic&#xD;
           stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A seminal distress study reported the prevalence of distress for 14 cancer diagnoses was&#xD;
           as high as 43.4% with prevalence of distress in the 30% range for the diagnoses covered&#xD;
           in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It has been shown that a cancer diagnosis represents a threat to life and bodily&#xD;
           integrity and can create a sense of loss of social and occupational roles, causing one s&#xD;
           adaptive capacity to become overwhelmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In oncology patients, the literature reports that symptoms or traumatic stress range&#xD;
           from 20% with early stage cancer to 80% in those with recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The outcome of this study will provide information about traumatic stress, aid in the&#xD;
           identification of it, and provide guidance on trauma informed care for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A descriptive study to explore the relationships between levels of psychosocial distress&#xD;
           and levels of traumatic stress symptoms (TSS) in patients with cancer (lymphoma,&#xD;
           leukemia, prostate cancer, and mesothelioma) on clinical trials at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
           Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also describe the relationship between psychosocial distress and TSS in the&#xD;
           context of the number of lifetime traumas experienced by patients enrolled on a clinical&#xD;
           trial at the NIH for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receiving treatment at the NIH CC will be recruited from four diagnostic&#xD;
           groups: leukemia, lymphoma, mesothelioma, and prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria include: diagnosed and treated for one of four types of cancer&#xD;
           (patients can have any stage of one of these four types of cancer and can be at any&#xD;
           point in the treatment continuum); aged 18 and over; able to understand and willing to&#xD;
           sign a written informed consent document to participate in this study; enrolled in a&#xD;
           clinical trial and actively followed on at the NIH CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is an exploratory cross-sectional survey design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the standardized measures (e.g. BSI-18, LEC-5, and the PCL-5) and demographic&#xD;
           and medical history from the medical charts will describe the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol participation is estimated to take approximately 10-15 minutes per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To address the primary objective, a backwards stepwise process will be used to identify&#xD;
           covariate variables that will be used in the final model. This will allow for the data&#xD;
           to present naturally occurring gaps in p-values to inform significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bi-variate analysis such as t-tests to compare means, time since diagnosis, time since&#xD;
           clinical trials participation (e.g. treatment) and demographics, will be used to explore&#xD;
           differences and relationships among the main variables and the demographic and&#xD;
           illness-related variables.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study is open to all people with or who have been treated for cancer at the NIH CC in&#xD;
        Bethesda, Maryland and meet the following criteria. This is done to provide the richest&#xD;
        cross-section possible in this availability sample of patients undergoing or post&#xD;
        treatment. Eligibility criteria include participants who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently diagnosed or have been diagnosed with one of four types of cancer: leukemia,&#xD;

             including active treatment, remission, recurrence, and surveillance or watchful&#xD;
             waiting. An oncology diagnosis is considered sufficient for this protocol if it is&#xD;
