  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While new innovations in the care of extremely premature infants have led to decreased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, poor postnatal growth remains as a major challenge. Early growth in&#xD;
      the postnatal period influences neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study will challenge current nutritional regimens for infants &lt; 1000 g birth&#xD;
      weight (BW) by providing an exclusive human milk based diet with a higher amount of protein&#xD;
      based on individual caloric and protein analysis of human milk utilizing targeted&#xD;
      fortification. The investigators will evaluate the effects of a high versus standard protein&#xD;
      enteral diet on growth and body composition in infants &lt; 1000 g BW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no published studies evaluating the effect of an exclusive human milk protein diet&#xD;
      on body composition in premature infants. Research has shown that infants who receive this&#xD;
      diet achieve growth at targeted standards but body composition has not been evaluated. As an&#xD;
      all human milk diet is well tolerated and associated with improved outcomes in the highest&#xD;
      risk neonates, it is imperative to evaluate the benefits of a high protein exclusive human&#xD;
      milk diet and the possible positive changes in body composition, specifically lean mass, in&#xD;
      these infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this proposed study will immediately influence current nutritional practices and&#xD;
      will provide landmark information regarding targeted fortification with provision of adequate&#xD;
      protein providing the most optimal body composition in the most fragile and vulnerable&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effects of a high versus standard protein enteral diet&#xD;
      utilizing targeted fortification on linear growth in infants &lt; 1000 g birth weight (BW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Infants who receive a high protein diet will have increased length velocity at&#xD;
      36 weeks postmenstrual age when compared to infants who receive a standard protein diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate body composition by total body dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age in infants &lt; 1000 g BW who received a high&#xD;
      or standard protein enteral diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Infants who received a high protein diet will have greater fat-free mass (lean&#xD;
      mass) compared to infants who received a standard protein diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein and energy are key nutrients for growth. A low protein intake or protein to energy&#xD;
      ratio may lead to poor linear growth and excess fat accumulation. Studies suggest that&#xD;
      preterm infants require a high protein to energy ratio to obtain catch up growth without&#xD;
      excessive fat accretion and that growth should focus on length gain and lean body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macronutrient analysis of donor human milk shows that mean protein values are 1.16 g/dL which&#xD;
      is similar to term milk composition. Mother's milk and donor human milk protein content&#xD;
      varies and is often lower than expected values. Infants may not be receiving the full amount&#xD;
      of calories and protein needed to support growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to challenge current nutritional regimens for infants &lt; 1000 g BW by&#xD;
      providing an enteral diet with a higher amount of protein based on individual caloric and&#xD;
      protein analysis of human milk also known as targeted fortification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective randomized study design, infants 500-1000 g BW receiving an exclusive&#xD;
      human milk protein-based diet will be identified after admission to the NICU. For infants&#xD;
      that meet inclusion criteria, the parent/guardian will be approached about the study. After&#xD;
      informed written parental consent is obtained, infants will be randomized to receive either a&#xD;
      high protein or standard protein diet. The standard protein diet (control group) providing&#xD;
      3.5-3.8 g/kg/day of protein represents our current practices. The high protein diet&#xD;
      (intervention group) will provide 4.2-4.5 g/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (standard protein diet) versus the intervention group (high protein diet):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group (standard protein diet), infants will receive a standard feeding regimen&#xD;
      which consists of mother's own milk or donor human milk with donor human milk derived&#xD;
      fortifier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once daily, a 24 hour batch of human milk will be prepared for each infant (standard practice&#xD;
      in the milk bank). A 2.5 mL sample from the batch of human milk will be analyzed for calories&#xD;
      (reported in kcal/oz) and protein, fat, and carbohydrate (reported in g/dL). Based on the&#xD;
      amount of protein in the milk, fortification of feeds with donor human milk derived fortifier&#xD;
      will be adjusted to reach an average of 3.5 to 3.8 g/kg/day of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group (high protein diet) will receive the same standard feeding regimen&#xD;
      with the addition of extra milk fortification to give a high protein diet. Based on the&#xD;
      amount of protein in the milk, fortification of feeds with donor human milk derived&#xD;
      fortifier, the number will be adjusted to reach an average of 4.2 to 4.5 g/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded for milk analysis, nutrition, and infant growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diets will be continued until approximately 35 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) at&#xD;
      which point a DXA scan will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will have 3 sets of labs for study purposes. A serum Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and&#xD;
      creatinine will be performed 2-3 days and then 1 week after goal protein is achieved. At the&#xD;
      time of the DXA scan, a serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics: weekly weight, length, and head circumference by trained research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Milk Samples: A 2.5 mL sample from the batch of human milk will be analyzed using a&#xD;
      milk analyzer. This analyzer uses a secondary method for measurements. It is calibrated with&#xD;
      bias samples from primary methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests: DXA scan will be used to evaluate body composition and provide measures of bone&#xD;
      mineral, lean and fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labs: BUN; creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase will be obtained at the&#xD;
      time of DXA scan to measure bone mineral status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on admission data from our institution, approximately 120 infants &lt; 1000 grams are&#xD;
      admitted to our NICU each year. A projected 50% of eligible subjects to enroll in the study.&#xD;
      Recruitment goal is 50 subjects in each group (n=100) with an additional 10 subjects per&#xD;
      group to account for drop out providing a total sample size of 120 infants. This would&#xD;
      provide 89% statistical power to detect a 15% difference (hypothesized in infants who receive&#xD;
      high protein) in length velocity at the (two sided) 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be recruited from Level 3 NICU (Texas Children's Hospital) which admits inborn&#xD;
      premature infants and from Level 4 NICU (Texas Children's Hospital) which admits infants born&#xD;
      at another institution. Infants from Level 4 will be recruited if they were transferred to&#xD;
      Texas Children's Hospital within the first 24 hours of life and have received an exclusive&#xD;
      human milk diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled infants will be randomized to either the (control group or intervention group).&#xD;
      Infants are usually within a range of birth weights, gestational ages and ethnicity. Male and&#xD;
      females are usually close to 50%. The investigators are not recruiting specific ethnicities&#xD;
      or genders as part of the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be in this study from the time of consent to 35 - 36 weeks postmenstrual age.&#xD;
