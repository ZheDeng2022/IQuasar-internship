  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Australian Indigenous children, particularly those living in remote communities, suffer a&#xD;
      disproportionately high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis disease. Despite the introduction&#xD;
      of rotavirus vaccine into the Northern Territory (NT) Immunisation Schedule in 2006, the rate&#xD;
      of hospitalization for rotavirus in NT Aboriginal children &lt; 5 years continues to be high,&#xD;
      and the rate ratio of rotavirus hospitalisations for Indigenous versus non-Indigenous&#xD;
      children has actually increased. The reasons for sub-optimal vaccine response are not&#xD;
      completely understood, but both reduced vaccine immune responses and low vaccine coverage are&#xD;
      likely to be important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Aboriginal children who receive an additional&#xD;
      dose of RV1 between the ages of 6 and 12 months, will have an increase anti-rotavirus serum&#xD;
      IgA seroconversion and decreased medical presentations with gastroenteritis in the first&#xD;
      three years of life, compared to those who receive placebo.&#xD;

      Australian Indigenous children, particularly those living in remote communities, suffer a&#xD;
      disproportionately high burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis disease. Despite the introduction&#xD;
      of rotavirus vaccine into the Northern Territory (NT) Immunisation Schedule in 2006, the rate&#xD;
      of hospitalization for rotavirus in NT Aboriginal children &lt; 5 years continues to be high,&#xD;
      and the rate ratio of rotavirus hospitalisations for Indigenous versus non-Indigenous&#xD;
      children has actually increased. The reasons for sub-optimal vaccine response are not&#xD;
      completely understood, but both reduced vaccine immune responses and low vaccine coverage are&#xD;
      likely to be important factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol Aboriginal infants aged 6 months to &lt; 12 months old who have received&#xD;
      one or two prior doses of RV1. The coprimary aim is to determine whether an oral dose of RV1&#xD;
      vaccine at age 6 months to less than 12 months, compared to placebo, results in an increase&#xD;
      in the average time to medical attendance for gastroenteritis before age 36 months&#xD;
      (co-primary endpoint 1), and/ or superior immune protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis&#xD;
      assessed approximately 1 to 2 months after vaccination (co-primary endpoint 2), in Australian&#xD;
      Indigenous children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase IV, randomised, placebo-controlled Bayesian trial with two strata&#xD;
      representing residency based on a standard geographical classification of remoteness. It has&#xD;
      the following key features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The procedures for enrolment, intervention, end-point and analysis are based on the&#xD;
           principles of pragmatic trial design;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-fixed sample size up to 1,000 participants based on Bayesian stopping rules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fixed 1:1 enrolment into the active and control arm throughout the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Frequent interim analyses can result in the trial stopping early for futility or&#xD;
           expected success.&#xD;
