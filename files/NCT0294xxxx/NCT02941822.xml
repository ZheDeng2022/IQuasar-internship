    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of ambroxol in&#xD;
      participants with Parkinson Disease. Participants will administer ambroxol at five dose&#xD;
      levels and will undergo clinical assessments, lumbar punctures, venepuncture, biomarker blood&#xD;
      analysis and cognitive assessment throughout the course of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AiM-PD study will recruit 20 patients (10 GBA-positive &amp; 10 GBA-negative status)&#xD;
      diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD). Each patient will self-administer the study drug,&#xD;
      ambroxol (60 mg per tablet) at 5 intra-dose escalations over the course of 6 months, as shown&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day 1-7: 60 mg three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 8-14: 120 mg three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 15-21: 180 mg three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Day 22-28: 300 mg three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Day 29-186: 420 mg three times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug is licensed in the EU as an over-the-counter drug to treat respiratory&#xD;
      conditions by reducing mucus production. Previous studies have shown that ambroxol can&#xD;
      penetrate the brain in rodent and non-human primate models, and may have an effect in slowing&#xD;
      PD. The results also indicate individuals who express the GBA mutation (increased risk of PD)&#xD;
      are able to reduce the growth of cells that cause PD by stimulating an enzyme called&#xD;
      glucocerebrosidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine samples before, during and after&#xD;
      the drug has been taken over a 6 month period. In these samples the Investigators will&#xD;
      measure ambroxol drug levels, assess whether the glucocerebrosidase enzyme has been&#xD;
      stimulated and the levels of other substances thought to be associated with the development&#xD;
      of PD and confirm whether the study drug has penetrated the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS. The&#xD;
      study will administer clinical and cognitive assessments to determine if there is any&#xD;
      improvement in patient's PD symptoms. If the study proves ambroxol penetrates the CNS and&#xD;
      replicates our current findings in the laboratory, the Investigators shall move on to a much&#xD;
      larger drug trial to test whether the study drug may be able to slow the progression of PD.&#xD;
