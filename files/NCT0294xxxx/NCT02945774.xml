  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroinflammation is increasingly implicated as a potential critical pathogenic mechanism in&#xD;
      a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. This study will use hybrid PET/MRI imaging&#xD;
      to evaluate neuroinflammation and its relationship to cerebral perfusion in frontotemporal&#xD;
      dementia (FTD). Patients with FTD will be recruited from the Cognitive Neurology and Aging&#xD;
      Brain clinics at Parkwood Institute and will undergo neurocognitive assessment and MRI/PET&#xD;
      using the PET ligand FEPPA which binds to activated microglia, a marker of neuroinflammation.&#xD;
      Correlations will be conducted to determine whether abnormal neuroinflammation is present in&#xD;
      Frontotemporal dementia and whether differential patterns of neuroinflammation are present in&#xD;
      different FTD clinical and molecular subtypes, and to determine the relationship between&#xD;
      neuroinflammation, cerebral perfusion using arterial spin labeling MRI imaging techniques,&#xD;
      and indices of brain structure including volumetric and white matter analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients diagnosed with a probable Frontotemporal Dementia or neurologically healthy&#xD;
             control participants with no history of neurological problems&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Study partner is available who has frequent contact with the subject and can accompany&#xD;
             the subject to all clinic visits for the duration of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Visual and auditory acuity adequate for neuropsychological testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Good general health with no diseases expected to interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is not pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential (i.e. women must be&#xD;
             two years post-menopausal, surgically sterile or practicing an effective form of&#xD;
             family planning&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to participate in a longitudinal imaging study at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing to undergo MRI (3Tesla)/ PET scan (with FEPPA ligand) and no medical&#xD;
             contraindications to MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any significant neurologic disease other than suspected Frontotemporal Dementia that&#xD;
             would better account for symptoms (i.e. frontal lobe stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Screening/baseline MRI scans with evidence of infection, infarction, or other focal&#xD;
             lesions. Subjects with multiple lacunes are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of pacemakers, aneurysm clips, artificial heart valves, ear implants, metal&#xD;
             fragments or foreign objects in the eyes, skin or body that may preclude MRI&#xD;
             participation as per MRI screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major depression, bipolar disorder as described in DSM-IV within the past 1 year.&#xD;
             Psychotic features, agitation or behavioral problems within the last 3 months which&#xD;
             could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of schizophrenia (DSM IV criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition which could lead to&#xD;
             difficulty complying with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically significant abnormalities in B12, or thyroid function tests that might&#xD;
             interfere with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Investigational agents are prohibited one month prior to entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

             radioactive agents such that the total radiation dose exposure to the subject in any&#xD;
             given year would exceed the limits of annual and total dose commitment set forth. The&#xD;
             current regulation for radiation dose to patient volunteers and health control&#xD;
             volunteers are contained within Health Canada's recently amended (June 19, 2012)&#xD;
             Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Positron-emitting&#xD;
             Radiopharmaceuticals). Limitations for effective total body dose is 50 mSv (C.03.305&#xD;
             (c)) which has been increased from the previous values of 20 mSv (Table 1 in&#xD;
             INFO-0491).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Exclusion Criteria for controls undergoing arterial line placement: Absent pulse,&#xD;

             Inadequate circulation to the extremity, Raynaud syndrome, Anticoagulation therapy,&#xD;
             Atherosclerosis of upper extremity vessels, Coagulopathy, inadequate collateral flow,&#xD;
