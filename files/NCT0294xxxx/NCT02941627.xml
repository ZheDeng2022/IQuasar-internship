  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate adult cochlear implant candidates with sensorineural hearing loss, from English&#xD;
      French Canadian centres and Danish centre, received Neuro Zti cochlear implant and fit with&#xD;
      Neuro One sound processor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech perception testing, using HINT (Hearing In Noise Test) sentences in quiet (65 dB SPL)&#xD;
      (decibel, Sound Pressure Level) and in noise (+10 dB SNR) (decibel, Signal-to-Noise-Ratio),&#xD;
      will be administrated pre-operatively in the best listening conditions and 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months post-activation in the implanted ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected during the surgery and over the post-surgical period from&#xD;
      activation to12 months post-activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed on the overall English, French and Danish participants. Efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed on English speaking participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Hearing In Noise Test Score in Quiet (HINT-Q) From Baseline to 6 Months in English-speaking Participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the clinical efficiency, speech perception performance using the HINT sentences was measured in quiet at 6 months pos-activation in English speaking participants.&#xD;
Primary clinical efficiency outcome is defined as the change in HINT scores from baseline to 6 months post-activation.&#xD;
Recorded HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 dB SPL (sound pressure level) pre-operatively in the best aided hearing conditions and at 6 months in the implanted ear after Neuro Zti implant activation. The post-activation assessment was performed in the implanted ear alone with masked controlateral ear. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated. Possible scores are range from 0% to 100% words correctly repeated. Change = (6 Months score - Baseline score). A score greater or equal to 10% was considered clinically significant improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Major Related Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired change from the participant's baseline condition symptom or clinically relevant symptom or disease, regardless of its cause.&#xD;
AEs include complications that are related to the device or clinical procedure, as well as unrelated AE that are not related to the device or the trial procedure.&#xD;
AEs were classified as Major if they corresponded to any of the following criteria:&#xD;
life-threatening conditions (e.g. meningitis)&#xD;
require hospitalization&#xD;
result in permanent disability or damage (e.g. facial nerve paresis)&#xD;
require revision surgery with or without explantation or re-implantation (e.g. device failure, flap necrosis)&#xD;
medical events that could not be alleviated by electrode deactivation (e.g. tinnitus, facial nerve stimulation, pain)&#xD;
The co-primary safety endpoint is the major related adverse events rate during the surgery and over the post-surgical period from activation to 12 months post-activation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit on English-speaking Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit is defined as the change of HINT scores post-operatively in the implanted ear only with masked contralateral ear and pre-operatively in the best aided conditions. Clinical benefit is measured in quiet and in noise using the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT).&#xD;
In quiet, HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL). In noise, the sentences were presented with concurrent background noise at +10 decibel signal-to-noise-ratio (dB SNR), signal level at 65 dB SPL and noise at 55 dB SPL. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated, possibly ranged from 0% to 100%.&#xD;
Clinical benefit is computed for each participant. A positive difference of post- and pre-operative HINT scores is considered clinically significant if it exceeded 10 percentage points (pp). A decrease that exceeded 10 pp is considered a clinically significant decrement. A difference of less than 10 pp was considered as no change in performance.</description>

    <measure>Hearing In Noise Test Score in Quiet (HINT-Q) Pre-operatively, at 3-, 6- and 12-Months on English-speaking Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3, 6 and 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the clinical efficiency, speech perception performance using the HINT sentences was measured in quiet pre-operatively, 3-, 6- and 12-months pos-activation on English speaking participants.&#xD;
Secondary clinical efficiency outcome is defined as the mean HINT scores from baseline to 12 months post-activation.&#xD;
Recorded HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 dB SPL pre-operatively in the best aided hearing conditions, at -, 6- and 12- months. The post-activation assessment was performed in the implanted ear alone with masked controlateral ear. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated. Possible scores are range from 0% to 100% words correctly repeated. A higher score is better.</description>

    <measure>Hearing In Noise Test Score in Noise (HINT-N) Pre-operatively, at 3-, 6- and 12-Months on English-speaking Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3-, 6- and 12-Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the clinical efficiency, speech perception performance using the HINT sentences was measured in noise pre-operatively, 3-, 6- and 12-months pos-activation on English speaking participants.&#xD;
Secondary clinical efficiency outcome is defined as the mean HINT scores from baseline to 12 months post-activation.&#xD;
Testing open-set sentence recognition with concurrent background noise present at +10 decibel signal-to-ratio (dB SNR) with signal level presented at 65 dB SPL and noise at 55 dB SPL. Recorded HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant in front pre-operatively in the best aided condition and post-operatively in the implanted ear alone with masked contralateral ear. Speech and noise were colocated (S0N0). Resultant score is a percentage of words correct. Possible scores range from 0% to 100% words correctly repeated. A higher score is better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minor Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired change from the participant's baseline condition symptom or clinically relevant symptom or disease, regardless of its cause.&#xD;
AEs include complications that are related to the device or clinical procedure, as well as unrelated AE that are not related to the device or the trial procedure.&#xD;
AEs were classified as Minor if they corresponded to any of the following criteria:&#xD;
adverse event settled spontaneously without surgical procedure (e.g. hematoma)&#xD;
adverse event settled spontaneously with conservative medical management&#xD;
The secondary safety endpoint is the minor related adverse events rate during the surgery and over the post-surgical period from activation to 12 months post-activation.</description>

        <description>To assess the clinical efficiency, speech perception performance using the HINT sentences was measured in quiet at 6 months pos-activation in English speaking participants.&#xD;
Primary clinical efficiency outcome is defined as the change in HINT scores from baseline to 6 months post-activation.&#xD;
Recorded HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 dB SPL (sound pressure level) pre-operatively in the best aided hearing conditions and at 6 months in the implanted ear after Neuro Zti implant activation. The post-activation assessment was performed in the implanted ear alone with masked controlateral ear. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated. Possible scores are range from 0% to 100% words correctly repeated. Change = (6 Months score - Baseline score). A score greater or equal to 10% was considered clinically significant improvement.</description>

        <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired change from the participant's baseline condition symptom or clinically relevant symptom or disease, regardless of its cause.&#xD;
AEs include complications that are related to the device or clinical procedure, as well as unrelated AE that are not related to the device or the trial procedure.&#xD;
AEs were classified as Major if they corresponded to any of the following criteria:&#xD;
life-threatening conditions (e.g. meningitis)&#xD;
require hospitalization&#xD;
result in permanent disability or damage (e.g. facial nerve paresis)&#xD;
require revision surgery with or without explantation or re-implantation (e.g. device failure, flap necrosis)&#xD;
medical events that could not be alleviated by electrode deactivation (e.g. tinnitus, facial nerve stimulation, pain)&#xD;
The co-primary safety endpoint is the major related adverse events rate during the surgery and over the post-surgical period from activation to 12 months post-activation.</description>

        <title>Clinical Benefit on English-speaking Participants</title>
        <description>Clinical benefit is defined as the change of HINT scores post-operatively in the implanted ear only with masked contralateral ear and pre-operatively in the best aided conditions. Clinical benefit is measured in quiet and in noise using the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT).&#xD;
In quiet, HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL). In noise, the sentences were presented with concurrent background noise at +10 decibel signal-to-noise-ratio (dB SNR), signal level at 65 dB SPL and noise at 55 dB SPL. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated, possibly ranged from 0% to 100%.&#xD;
Clinical benefit is computed for each participant. A positive difference of post- and pre-operative HINT scores is considered clinically significant if it exceeded 10 percentage points (pp). A decrease that exceeded 10 pp is considered a clinically significant decrement. A difference of less than 10 pp was considered as no change in performance.</description>

In quiet, HINT sentences lists were presented to the participant at 60 decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL). In noise, the sentences were presented with concurrent background noise at +10 decibel signal-to-noise-ratio (dB SNR), signal level at 65 dB SPL and noise at 55 dB SPL. Resultant score is a percentage of words correctly repeated, possibly ranged from 0% to 100%.&#xD;
Clinical benefit is computed for each participant. A positive difference of post- and pre-operative HINT scores is considered clinically significant if it exceeded 10 percentage points (pp). A decrease that exceeded 10 pp is considered a clinically significant decrement. A difference of less than 10 pp was considered as no change in performance.</description>
