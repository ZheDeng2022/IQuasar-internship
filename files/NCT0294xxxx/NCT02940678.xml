  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is one of the top threats to population health globally. A substantial body of&#xD;
      research has been devoted to the development of clinical prediction models to aid early&#xD;
      decision making in trauma care. Often these models are applied outside the context in which&#xD;
      they were originally developed. In contrast, very little research has focused on the effects&#xD;
      on model performance of such transfers despite the fact that a potential loss in performance&#xD;
      could have devastating consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Swedish trauma registry SweTrau will be used to study the effects on model&#xD;
      performance of transfers between different contexts within a single conceptually homogenous&#xD;
      setting. Using logistic regression models for predicting all-cause mortality within 30 days&#xD;
      of trauma in adult patients will be developed, focusing on systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, and Glasgow coma scale as predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different sets of data sampled from SweTrau will be used to simulate transfer of models&#xD;
      between high and low volume centres, metropolitan and non-metropolitan centres, multicentre&#xD;
      and single centre data, and finally between individual centres. Measures of overall&#xD;
      performance, clinical usefulness, discrimination, calibration, and recalibration will be used&#xD;
      to quantify the effects on performance of model transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide evidence to help clinicians and policy makers in deciding on whether&#xD;
      it is appropriate to apply models developed in other contexts. For example, the results of&#xD;
      this study may inform decisions on the development and implementation of models intended to&#xD;
      be applied on a national or regional level, and ultimately help designing better trauma care&#xD;
      and improve the outcomes of trauma patients.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry based study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Swedish trauma registry SweTrau will be used. This is a quality registry, which&#xD;
      means that patients are registered continuously as part of their care. They receive written&#xD;
      information about the registration and may opt to withdraw their data from the registry. The&#xD;
      registry was implemented in 2011 and had as of early 2016 more than 30,000 entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SweTrau includes data from Swedish university hospitals and non-university county hospitals.&#xD;
      The country has approximately 50 university and non-university county hospitals that receive&#xD;
      trauma patients and out of those all seven university hospitals and more than 60% of&#xD;
      non-university county hospitals contribute data to SweTrau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no national classification of hospitals that receive trauma patients in&#xD;
      Sweden. Previous research has described the university hospitals as level I-II trauma&#xD;
      centres, using the classification in the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma&#xD;
      guidelines. Prehospital care and transport is provided by ground and air ambulances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry include any patient that prompts trauma team activation and any transferred&#xD;
      trauma patient. Trauma team activation criteria vary across hospitals but there are generally&#xD;
      two levels of trauma team activation, for suspected major and minor trauma respectively. The&#xD;
      criteria are based on prehospital vital signs and a priori specified mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables Predictors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (mmHg), respiratory rate (breaths per minute) and Glasgow coma scale&#xD;
      will be included as predictors in the clinical prediction mode. All are recorded on arrival&#xD;
      to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables will be used to characterize the patient cohort: age in years, sex&#xD;
      registered as male or female, pre-injury comorbidity status according to the American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical Status classification, anatomical injury severity according&#xD;
      to the injury severity score (ISS) and new injury severity score (NISS), and transfer from&#xD;
      other hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study size&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in SweTrau matching the eligibility criteria. Details on sample size for&#xD;
      specific analysis steps are provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the modelling exercises quantitative variables, i.e. all predictors, will be handled as&#xD;
      continuous. Both systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate are assumed to be non-linearly&#xD;
      associated with mortality and will therefore be modelled using restricted cubic splines with&#xD;
      four knots placed at equally spaced percentiles, as implemented in the R rms package. Glasgow&#xD;
      coma scale will be modelled as a linear term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple imputation using chained equations will be employed to handle missing data, assuming&#xD;
      a missing at random (MAR) missing data mechanism. The R package mice will be used. Predictive&#xD;
      mean matching to impute quantitative variables and logistic regression for qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be used as appropriate. The number of imputed datasets will be equal to the&#xD;
      percentage of missing data, rounded up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfer of models will be studied using four different sets of data. Each set of data&#xD;
      will simulate a specific, plausible, situation in which models are transferred between&#xD;
      different but related contexts. In each set of data there will be at least two samples of&#xD;
      data drawn from the complete SweTrau database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High and low volume centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the transfer of models between high and low volume centres the data will be split in&#xD;
      two, using centre volume. High volume centres will be those belonging to the quartile of&#xD;
      centres with the largest number of patients registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metropolitan and non-metropolitan centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      This set of data will also consist of two samples, one with patients from Sweden's&#xD;
      metropolitan areas Greater Stockholm, Greater Gothenburg and Greater Malm√∂ as defined by&#xD;
      Statistics Sweden, and one with patients from non-metropolitan areas. The underlying&#xD;
      assumption is that trauma mechanisms differ between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi and single centre data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from each centre with large enough effective sample size to allow for model&#xD;
      development and validation as outlined below will constitute its own sample. The multicentre&#xD;
      data sample will be the combined data from all those centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual centres&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the transfer of models between individual centres this set of data will consist of&#xD;
      samples from centres with large enough effective sample size to allow for model development&#xD;
      and validation as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      R will be used for all statistical analyses, which will be conducted in the following&#xD;
      sequence: model development, model validation, model comparison. A temporal split of each&#xD;
      sample will be made based on the date of trauma. The earlier part of the data will is&#xD;
      henceforth referred to as the development sample. The later part is henceforth referred to as&#xD;
      the validation sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temporal split will be made so that the development sample includes 70 events, i.e.&#xD;
      patients who died within 30 days, and all non-events registered during the same time period.&#xD;
      These 70 events correspond to 10 events per free parameter in the prediction models, since&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate will be modeled using three spline bases each&#xD;
      and Glasgow coma scale as a single term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation sample needs to include at least 100 events and non-events. Therefore, in the&#xD;
      studies of transfer of models between multi and single centre data and between individual&#xD;
      centres, only centres with at least 170 events can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals will be estimated for predictive performance measures by repeating&#xD;
      the analysis in 1000 bootstrap samples drawn with replacement. Each imputed dataset will be&#xD;
      bootstrapped separately and analysed using standard techniques for multiple imputed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      One model per development sample will be developed using logistic regression to select main&#xD;
      effects. To avoid overfitting and model optimism a shrinkage factor will be estimated using a&#xD;
      bootstrap approach. Model performance in the development sample will be evaluated using&#xD;
      measures of overall performance, discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness as&#xD;
      outlined in section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The models will be validated by using the linear predictor generated in the model development&#xD;
      phase to estimate the probability of 30 day mortality in the corresponding validation sample.&#xD;
      Validation will be performed by estimating the same predictive performance measures as in the&#xD;
      model development phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison&#xD;
&#xD;
      Models will be compared in the validation part of each sample. The performance of models will&#xD;
      be compared in terms of overall performance, discrimination, calibration, clinical&#xD;
      usefulness, and reclassification, see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive performance measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall performance will be assessed using the Brier score and net benefit will be used as a&#xD;
      measure of clinical usefulness. Discrimination will be assessed by calculating the area under&#xD;
      the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and by estimating specificity at 95%&#xD;
      sensitivity . The 95% sensitivity was chosen as this is the cutoff often quoted as indicative&#xD;
      of an &quot;acceptable&quot; level of undertriage, i.e. false negative ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess calibration the sample will first be grouped using ten quantiles of the mortality&#xD;
      probabilities estimated by the model of interest. The mean mortality probability (x) and the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who died in each group (Y) will be calculated. Finally, the general&#xD;
      linear model Y=A+B*x+e, and use the calibration intercept A and slope B to quantify&#xD;
      calibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate reclassification the models being compared will first be used to categorise&#xD;
      patients as belonging to one of four risk groups. The difference between &quot;original&quot; groupings&#xD;
      compared to those obtained by using &quot;external&quot; model, i.e. reclassification, will be measured&#xD;
      as the net reclassification improvement (NRI).&#xD;
