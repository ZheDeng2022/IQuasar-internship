  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is the most common and feared complication of ERCP, occurring after 1% to&#xD;
      30% of procedures. Since 2012, a multicenter RCT was published in NEJM, indomethacin use in&#xD;
      high risk patients was considered a &quot;standard&quot; method to prevent PEP. However, the risk&#xD;
      factors of PEP is not fully clear. Additionally, the complication of NSAID use lead to some&#xD;
      serious physical problem bleeding. Therefore, the exclusive criteria for limiting the NSAID&#xD;
      use is including allergy， gastrointestinal haemorrhage ，presence of coagulopathy or received&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy. Previous study showed that another natural compound, resveratrol,&#xD;
      owns similar biological effect with NSAID. Firstly, it could inhibit the inflammatory&#xD;
      response on in vivo model through inhibition of COX and IL-6 etc. Secondly, it could not&#xD;
      influence the level of platelet and coagulation, which means safer than NSAID. Thirdly,&#xD;
      numerous studies showed that resveratrol could effectively the progression of severe acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis. According to data, we design the project. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether oral resveratrol pre-ERCP is effective on control of Post-ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;

      -  This prospective, randomised controlled trial was done in 8 tertiary referral hospitals&#xD;
           in China. Patients (aged 18-90 years) with native papilla planned for diagnostic or&#xD;
           therapeutic ERCP were eligible for enrolment in the study. Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
           contraindications to ERCP, known pancreatic head mass, previous biliary sphincterotomy&#xD;
           without planned contrast injection into the pancreatic duct, acute pancreatitis within 3&#xD;
           days, ERCP for biliary stent removal or exchange without anticipated pancreatogram,&#xD;
           known active cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, unwilling or inability to&#xD;
           provide consent, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Indications or contra- indications&#xD;
           for ERCP were determined by endoscopists or anaesthesiologists before ERCP; these&#xD;
           included risks to patient health or life judged to outweigh the potential benefit of&#xD;
           ERCP, known or suspected perforated viscus, and haemodynamic instability. The risk&#xD;
           stratification of the patients was defined based on criteria used in the study by&#xD;
           Elmunzer and colleages. Patients were considered high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis if&#xD;
           they met at least one of the major criteria or two or more of the minor criteria. The&#xD;
           risk status of the patients was determined immediately after the procedure by one&#xD;
           investigator at each site who was masked to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomisation and masking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study coordinator did the block randomisation (ten in each block). The randomisation&#xD;
           list was computer generated, and stratified according to individual centres. Patients&#xD;
           were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio, before receiving ERCP, to either the universal&#xD;
           pre- procedural group or the risk-stratified post-procedural group. Oral resveratrol or&#xD;
           Indometacin was administered in the procedure room before or after ERCP by one&#xD;
           investigator in each site who did not participate in data collection and analysis.&#xD;
           Endoscopists and assistances who participated in ERCP procedures were masked to group&#xD;
           allocation. Investigators who collected demographic or procedure-related data or&#xD;
           participated in the assessment of post-ERCP compli- cations were also masked to group&#xD;
           allocation. Patients were not masked to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the start of this study, post-procedural selective indometacin in high-risk&#xD;
           patients had been demonstrated as effective in the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes The primary outcome of the study was the frequency of post-ERCP pancreatitis.&#xD;
           The diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis was established if there was new onset of upper&#xD;
           abdominal pain associated with an elevated serum amylase of at least three times the&#xD;
           upper limit of normal range at 24 h after the procedure, and admission to hospital for&#xD;
           at least 2 nights. The secondary outcome was the frequency of moderate to severe&#xD;
           post-ERCP pancreatitis. We defined severity of pancreatitis according to the criteria&#xD;
           reported by Cotton and colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other post-ERCP complications (including bleeding, biliary infection, perforation, and any&#xD;
      adverse outcomes requiring hospital admission or prolonged hospital stay for further&#xD;
      management) were monitored as described previously.24 Moderate to severe bleeding was defined&#xD;
      as clinically significant bleeding with decrease in haemoglobin concentration of at least 3&#xD;
      g/L with the need for transfusion, angiographic intervention, or surgery. 23 Patients were&#xD;
      contacted at 30 days to assess late complications (including delayed bleeding or&#xD;
      cardiovascular or renal adverse events); this was the final follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An investigator who was familiar with ERCP at each site and masked to treatment allocation&#xD;
      recorded the procedure-related parameters including cannulation methods, numbers of&#xD;
      cannulation attempts, and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation, pancrea- tography, and&#xD;
      prophylactic placement of pancreatic duct stent. The same investigator also recorded the&#xD;
      patient demographics, post-ERCP adverse events potentially caused by the procedure or study&#xD;
      drug, and follow-up data. All data were subsequently entered into a web- based database and&#xD;
      managed by independent investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We defined severity of post-ERCP complications according to the Cotton criteria:23 mild&#xD;
      (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring admission or prolongation of planned admission to&#xD;
      2-3 days); moderate (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring hospitalisation of 4-10&#xD;
      days); and severe (pancreatitis after the procedure requiring hospitalisation for more than&#xD;
      10 days, or haemorrhagic pancreatitis, phlegmon or pseudocyst, or intervention). Detailed&#xD;
      definitions for other adverse events are provided in the appendix.&#xD;
