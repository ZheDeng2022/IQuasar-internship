      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the health benefits of an education&#xD;
      and peer mentor support intervention. Chinese American breast cancer survivors who have&#xD;
      completed primary treatment will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a&#xD;
      control group to receive enhanced usual care while waiting for the JLA. Health outcomes are&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 1 and 4 months follow-ups.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the control group will receive enhanced usual care while waiting for the JLA program.

The peer-support component assigns each participant with a mentor who is a breast cancer survivor. They share their own experience with participants and also make weekly phone calls to mentees during the intervention to provide support and address remaining concerns.</description>
