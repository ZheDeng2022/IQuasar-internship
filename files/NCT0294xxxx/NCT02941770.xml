  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pediatric obesity makes this condition a worldwide public health concern.&#xD;
      Physical Activity (PA) is recognized as having many health benefits, many of them related to&#xD;
      obesity and its comorbidities. Despite of all the efforts, the majority of the overweight&#xD;
      children/adolescents still present low levels of PA and high levels of sedentary behaviors.&#xD;
      Thus, it seems that the greatest challenge is to influence behavior change in order to&#xD;
      increase PA exposure in this population. PA consultation can be a cost-effective way of&#xD;
      enhancing PA and improve weight status among overweight children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to analyze if the inclusion of a PA consultation in a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary program for the management of adolescent overweight improves body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) z-score, PA levels and sedentary behavior outcomes at six and twelve months,&#xD;
      compared to those attending only the Pediatric and the Dietetic consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a non-randomized, controlled clinical trial with six months&#xD;
      duration and follow-up at the 12th month, that will include overweight adolescents (BMI ≥&#xD;
      p85) aged 12 to 17, attending the Clinic for the first time, and accepted to be enrolled.&#xD;
      Those with (i) major pathologies (other than obesity or its related comorbidities), (ii)&#xD;
      inability to perform regular PA, (iii) mental disorders, (iv) smoking habits, (v) under any&#xD;
      kind of prescription (other than antihypertensives or metformin), or (vi) being involved in&#xD;
      another weight loss program will be excluded. According to the sample size calculation, we&#xD;
      expect to recruit 129 participants that will be allocated in three groups by consecutive&#xD;
      sampling: (i) control group - standard care (Pediatric and Dietitian consultations); (ii)&#xD;
      intervention group I - standard care plus PA consultation; (iii) intervention group II - 2&#xD;
      weekly exercise sessions additionally to the standard care and PA consultations..&#xD;

      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of adolescent obesity management cannot be assessed only based on the BMI/BMI&#xD;
      z-score or PA levels. Thus, the secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Analyze the effect of the intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). CRF is&#xD;
      commonly expressed as VO2 max and represents the ability to uptake, deliver, and use oxygen&#xD;
      to produce energy. CRF is inversely associated with BMI and waist circumference, and have a&#xD;
      potential beneficial effect on the endothelial function and structure - which is known to be&#xD;
      impaired among overweight adolescents - even without the occurrence of major changes in the&#xD;
      BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Analyze the effect of the intervention on biochemical markers, including insulin&#xD;
      resistance and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Analyze whether changes in BMI z-score, PA/sedentary behavior and CRF are associated&#xD;
      with changes in endothelial structural health (assessed trough carotid intima-media thickness&#xD;
      - cIMT) and function (assessed trough pulse wave velocity - PWV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Validate a sub-maximal exercise step test for an overweight adolescent population for&#xD;
      future use in the PA consultation routine. Sub-maximal exercise step testing has been&#xD;
      considered a timely and cost-effective method of assessing CRF, which can be conducted at the&#xD;
      clinical office with minimal risk and discomfort for the participant compared to maximal&#xD;
      exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Analyze the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the intervention, since it is considered as an&#xD;
      important aid to public health decision-making, with an extra potential additional value in a&#xD;
      tertiary health care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-economic status Social-economic classification (SES) will be based on the&#xD;
      parents/caregivers occupation, according to the Portuguese National Institute of Statistics.&#xD;
      The socio-occupational status of both parents/caregivers will be categorized in three groups:&#xD;
      (i) management positions (Class I); (ii) office, service or skilled manual workers (Class II&#xD;
      and III); (iii) unskilled workers or unemployed (Classe IV and V).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry The anthropometric assessments will be performed at the exercise physiologist&#xD;
      office in the outpatient clinic, Department of Pediatrics, HSM. All the assessments will be&#xD;
      performed by the same investigator. With the exception of body composition, all the other&#xD;
      anthropometric assessments will be performed twice as a confirmation procedure. The Technical&#xD;
      Error of Measurement (TEM) will be calculated accordingly to: TEM=√[∑Dif2/2n]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Height (height stadiometer, SECA 217, Hamburg, Germany) assessed in the anthropometric&#xD;
      position, without shoes, with the participant back to the stadiometer, and after an&#xD;
      expiratory phase. Height will be registered to the nearest 0.1 cm; (ii) Body weight and body&#xD;
      composition (bioelectrical impedance scale InBody 230, Seoul, Korea). Body weight will be&#xD;
      measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, in the anthropometric position (with the palms turned into&#xD;
      thighs), with the subjects wearing as few clothes as possible, and without shoes or socks;&#xD;
      (iii) BMI will be calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in&#xD;
      meters [BMI= weight (kg)/height2 (m)]. We will further calculate the BMI z-score [BMI&#xD;
      z-score= [(BMI/M(t))L(t)-1]/L(t)S(t)], since it is acknowledge as the best choice to track&#xD;
      changes in growing children; (iv) Waist and hip circumferences (circumference measuring tape,&#xD;
      SECA 203, Hamburg, Germany) will be measured with the subject standing. Waist circumference&#xD;
      will be measured 1 cm above the iliac crest at the end of a regular expiration, and hip&#xD;
      circumference at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) Additionally to bioelectrical impedance,&#xD;
      which is a usual assessment in the clinical office, body composition will be assessed by DXA&#xD;
      (Explorer W, Hologic; Waltham, MA, USA) and analyzed using the equipment's software (QDR&#xD;
      12.4, Waltham, MA, USA). DXA exam will be performed in accordance with the National Health&#xD;
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocol. Trunk and Whole Body Fat, as well as&#xD;
      Trunk and Whole Body Peripheral Fat will be assessed. All the procedures will be performed by&#xD;
      the same investigator. All the scans will be made in the morning after overnight feasting&#xD;
      (10-12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments (i) Pubertal status will be assessed by a pediatrician and categorized&#xD;
      in accordance with Tanner stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Resting blood pressure (digital sphygmomanometer, CAS 9302S, CAS Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Branford, USA) will be measured in the right arm with an appropriate sized cuff, after five&#xD;
      minutes of rest in the seating position. The measurement will be performed three times and&#xD;
      the average of the three measurements will be recorded. Children will be then classified&#xD;
      accordingly to sex, age and height-specific charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Biochemical analysis will be performed in the laboratory of clinical pathology at the&#xD;
      HSM. Blood samples will be collected after overnight feasting (10-12 hours) in the presence&#xD;
      of one of the parents/ caregivers, and after a local application of a topical anesthesia&#xD;
      patch (EMLA). Blood glucose levels will be determined using hexokinase method and insulin&#xD;
      will be assessed using a chemiluminescence immunoassay technique. Insulin sensitivity will be&#xD;
      derived from the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method. Total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol will be determined using enzymatic,&#xD;
      GPO-trinder, and direct methods, respectively. Plasma liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and GGT) will&#xD;
      be assessed with modified IFCC method. C-reactive protein will be determined using a&#xD;
      turbidimetric immunoassay (Siemens, ADVIA 2400, Newark, DE, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy intake A three-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) using semi-quantitative&#xD;
      scaling (e.g. number of spoons or scoops) will be used in order to provide comprehensive&#xD;
      information about meal patterns and to estimate the energy intake. Although it is known that&#xD;
      overweight children tend to underestimate their energy intake, the 3-day food diary still is&#xD;
      considered acceptable and often used instrument at the clinical practice. Moreover, the use&#xD;
      of a 3-day food diary instead of a 7-day, may enhance the adherence to the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity, sedentary behaviors and cardiorespiratory fitness Data from the&#xD;
      accelerometers will be uploaded at the Exercise and Health Laboratory, Faculty of Human&#xD;
      Kinetics, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal. Sedentary activity questionnaires and CRF&#xD;
      will be assessed at the same institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) PA will be assessed with accelerometers (ACTIGRAPH GT3X, Pensacola, Florida, USA). All&#xD;
      the subjects will use one accelerometer above the right hip, near to the iliac crest, during&#xD;
      at least one weekend day and two week days, except during sleep, bath or swimming. The&#xD;
      accelerometer will be programmed to use a 5-second cycle. Only days with more than 480 min&#xD;
      (8h) counted, will be considered into the analysis. Periods of 60 min with &quot;zero activity&quot;&#xD;
      will be interpreted as un-using equipment. The data upload will be performed with the&#xD;
      ActiLife software, version 6.8.0. Between 0 and 149 counts/minute we will consider as&#xD;
      sedentary activity; between 150 and 499, Light Physical Activity (LPA); between 500 and 3999,&#xD;
      Moderate Physical Activity (MPA); between 4000 and 7599, Vigorous Physical Activity (VPA);&#xD;
      and with more than 7600 counts/minute Very Vigorous Physical Activity (VVPA); (ii) Sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors will be assessed by a questionnaire (questionnaire ASAQ - adolescent sedentary&#xD;
      activity questionnaire) additionally to the accelerometry, answered while waiting for the&#xD;
      assessment of CRF. The ASAQ is a reliable and cost-effective instrument that may be able to&#xD;
      measure three dimensions of the sedentary behaviors (type, frequency and time/duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) CRF will be indirectly determined with a maximal exercise test using a cycle ergometer&#xD;
      (electronically braked cycle ergometer, Monark 839 Ergomedic, Monark, Vansbro, Sweden).&#xD;
      Initial workload and increments will be of 40 or 50 W for girls and boys, respectively. Heart&#xD;
      rate will be registered continuously (Polar Vantage NV, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland).&#xD;
      Criteria to stop the test will include a heart rate superior to the theoretical maximal heart&#xD;
      rate (208 - 0.7(age), failure to maintain a frequency of at least 30 revolutions/min, and a&#xD;
      subjective judgement by the observer that the adolescent is exhausted. The maximal power&#xD;
      output (Wmax) will be calculated as the power in the last fully completed workload plus the&#xD;
      power increment of the last step multiplied by the time proportion completed of the last&#xD;
      step. The maximal power output will be converted to VO2 (ml/kg/min) using the following&#xD;
      equation: VO2 (1∕min) = 0.465 + (0.0112 ×Wmax) + (0.172 × sex), where sex =0 for girls and&#xD;
      sex=1 for boys (38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity cIMT and pulse wave velocity will be&#xD;
      measured in the Exercise and Health Laboratory, Faculty of Human Kinetics, University of&#xD;
      Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) cIMT will be measured with an ultrasound imager using a 13 MHz probe (MyLab One, Esaote,&#xD;
      Genoa, Italy). cIMT will be defined as the distance between the lumen-intima and the&#xD;
      media-adventitia interfaces. The measurement will be performed in the longitudinal plane on&#xD;
      the right carotid artery, accordingly with previously validated radiofrequency-based tracking&#xD;
      of arterial wall that allows a real-time determination of common carotid far-wall thickness&#xD;
      (QIMT®) with high spatial and temporal resolution. cIMT will be automatically measured, and&#xD;
      distension curves will be acquired within a CCA 1.59-cm region of interest, approximately 1&#xD;
      cm proximal to the carotid bifurcation. Maximum and minimum carotid diameters will be&#xD;
      obtained from the distension curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) PWV will be measured with applanation tonometry immediately after ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
      Pressure curves from left carotid, femoral, radial and distal posterial tibial arteries will&#xD;
      be assessed with two specific pressure sensitive transducers. The distance between the&#xD;
      carotid and femoral, radial and distal posterial tibial arteries, will be measured directly&#xD;
      and entered into the Complior Analyse software (ALAM Medical, Paris, France). Left brachial&#xD;
      blood pressure will be measured and entered into the software. The values obtained from the&#xD;
      carotid to femoral artery (aortic), carotid to radial artery (upper limb) and carotid to&#xD;
      distal posterior tibial artery (lower limb) will be recorded as indices of central/aortic,&#xD;
      upper and lower limb arterial stiffness, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Statistical analysis will be performed using the software IBM SPSS&#xD;
      statistics (IBM SPSS statistics, version 22.0, IBM, New York, USA). We intend to use the&#xD;
      Chi-square and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate baseline differences between&#xD;
      the control and intervention groups. The effect of the intervention will be analyzed with&#xD;
      analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) controlling for baseline values of continuous variables.&#xD;
