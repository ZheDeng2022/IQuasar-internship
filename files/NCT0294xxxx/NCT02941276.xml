      This trial is looking at using an intra-oral electrostimulating device for the management of&#xD;
      radiotherapy-induced dry mouth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth is a common complaint of radiotherapy for cancer of the head and neck region. It is&#xD;
      a distressing often persistent condition which can lead to longlasting oral discomfort,&#xD;
      dental infections, diminished quality of life, social isolation and loneliness.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current therapies of dry mouth are often unsatisfactory, expensive and may&#xD;
      result in adverse effects. A novel intraoral electronic device has recently been developed to&#xD;
      treat dry mouth. The device, acting as a &quot;salivary pacemaker&quot;, harmlessly stimulates nerves&#xD;
      of the salivary glands and does not cause adverse side effects. The aim of this proposal is&#xD;
      to assess the longterm effects of such a device in this population, which have yet to be&#xD;
      investigated, to demonstrate whether its daily application is an effective method of&#xD;
      lessening dry mouth and improving life quality. 84 individuals will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      to use the device for 12 months, after receiving appropriate instructions. 42 participants&#xD;
      (out of 84) will act as controls as they will receive a sham device that will not deliver&#xD;
      electric stimuli but only tactile stimulation (like using a chewing gum). All participants&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue using their routine local therapy for dry mouth (e.g. artificial&#xD;
      saliva) during the study. Each participant will keep a diary relevant to the frequency of use&#xD;
      and potential changes in dry mouth sensation. Participants will also be asked to attend&#xD;
      hospital appointments to measure changes in saliva production and complete questionnaires on&#xD;
      their dry mouth and quality of life. The device has the potential to radically change current&#xD;
      clinical practice. If the trial is successful, the use of the device will provide patients&#xD;
      having radiation-induced dry mouth with a safe and drug-free therapeutic modality.&#xD;
