      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the macula in the eye. This is the central&#xD;
      part of the retina. It is needed for sharp, clear vision and activities like reading and&#xD;
      driving. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 years of age and older. An&#xD;
      advanced form of AMD is called geographic atrophy or GA. It happens when light-sensitive&#xD;
      cells in the macula die so much that central vision decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about geographic atrophy associated with age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 55 years old with a certain kind of GA. They must be enrolled in study&#xD;
      08-EI-0102, 08-EI-0169, 08-EI-0043, 12-EI-0042, or 11-EI-0147 but no other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have study visits every 3 months for 15 months, then every 6 months. They&#xD;
      will be in the study almost 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will last about 8 hours. At each visit, participants may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and eye history. Participants will answer questions about their general health&#xD;
           and eye health. They may answer written questions about how their eye problems affect&#xD;
           their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam and photographs. Eye pressure will be measured and eye movements will be&#xD;
           checked. Pupils will be dilated with drops. The thickness of the retina will be measured&#xD;
           and photos of the eye may be taken....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people&#xD;
      over age 65 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal&#xD;
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to&#xD;
      impairment of central visual acuity (VA). AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which&#xD;
      involves choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar.&#xD;
      This is often referred to as the neovascular or wet form. A second form, the subject of this&#xD;
      study, is termed dry atrophic macular degeneration or otherwise geographic atrophy (GA) and&#xD;
      involves a slow progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and&#xD;
      photoreceptors in the macula, also resulting in central vision loss. GA is estimated to&#xD;
      affect up to one million people in the U.S. and there is no current treatment that can&#xD;
      prevent its onset or retard its progression. While the etiology of GA is not completely&#xD;
      understood, inflammatory processes involving the activation of resident immune cells of the&#xD;
      retina called microglia are likely to contribute. The objective of this study is to study the&#xD;
      progression of GA so as to be able to characterize in quantitative terms the natural&#xD;
      progression of GA in patients not receiving any directed treatment; there is currently no&#xD;
      approved treatment for GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Twenty-five (25) participants with unilateral or bilateral GA associated&#xD;
      with AMD will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This prospective, natural history study will follow participants with GA associated&#xD;
      with AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on grading by&#xD;
      an external Reading Center of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images in the assigned study eye.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be calculated for 45 months as compared to baseline. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), rate of change in area&#xD;
      of GA based on fundus photography and development of exudative AMD ascertained using optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) and changes in macular sensitivity.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participant must be 55 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participant must understand and sign the protocol s informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participant must have evidence of early or intermediate AMD as defined by&#xD;
                  characteristic presence of drusen and/or pigmentary changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Participant is enrolled in one of the following screening protocols: 08-EI-0102,&#xD;
                  08-EI-0169, 08-EI-0043, 12-EI-0042, or 11-EI-0147.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is actively receiving study therapy in another investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant is on ocular or systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina&#xD;
             or optic nerve (e.g., ethambutol, chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Study Eye Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
        exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study Eye Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The study eye(s) must have GA compatible with dry AMD. GA is defined as one or&#xD;
                  more well-defined and often circular patches of partial or complete&#xD;
                  depigmentation of the RPE, typically with exposure of underlying choroidal blood&#xD;
                  vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved and large choroidal&#xD;
                  vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial depigmentation may be&#xD;
                  classified as early GA. The GA in the study eye must be able to be photographed&#xD;
                  in their entirety and it must not be contiguous with any areas of peripapillary&#xD;
                  atrophy, which can complicate area measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The study eye(s) must have clarity of ocular media and degree of pupil dilation&#xD;
                  sufficient to permit adequate fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study Eye Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Current evidence of neovascularization as determined by the treating physician or&#xD;
                  a history of treatments for neovascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Evidence of retinal atrophy due to causes other than atrophic AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Current evidence or history of ocular disorders in the study eye that might&#xD;
                  confound study outcome measures, including (but not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy involving 10 or more hemorrhages or&#xD;
                       microaneurysms, or active proliferative diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Branch or central retinal vein or artery occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Macular hole&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Pathologic myopia&#xD;
&#xD;
                    5. Uveitis&#xD;
&#xD;
                    6. Pseudovitelliform maculopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. History of vitreoretinal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Need for ocular surgery during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Recent history of lens removal (&lt;3 months prior to enrollment) or Yttrium&#xD;
                  Aluminum&#xD;
&#xD;
        Garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy (&lt;1 month prior to enrollment)&#xD;
