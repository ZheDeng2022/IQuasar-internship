  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current state of knowledge and gaps in the literature we will conduct an&#xD;
      intervention study to explore novel treatment and rehabilitation of patients at Royal&#xD;
      University Hospital (RUH) with motor deficits following stroke. This project has the&#xD;
      following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if cross-education, in addition to standard rehabilitation leads to better&#xD;
           recovery of upper limb function for stroke patients with hemiparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To incorporate functional brain activation as measured by functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural mechanisms associated with changes in motor&#xD;
           function of the paretic arm post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to measure connectivity and examine&#xD;
           the extent to which white matter tract thickness correlates with preserved motor output&#xD;
           in patients post-stroke.&#xD;

    <description>The cross-education group will engage in strength training of the non-paretic hand in addition to standard rehabilitation. Cross-education will be progressive in nature, beginning with 2 sets of 8 repetitions and increasing up to a maximum of 6 sets of 8 repetitions of maximal voluntary effort isometric handgrip contractions as tolerated. Grip training will be performed using standard grip trainers (Digi-Flex Grip trainers) to train both finger flexors and full hand and wrist isometric contractions. In addition, patients will perform controlled dynamic wrist flexion and extension training of the non-paretic hand using exercise tubing with the same prescription. Patients will be asked to complete exercises 3 times per week for 26 weeks, and to record adherence in a training log. An average of one session per week will be considered 'trained'.</description>

    <description>Standardized rehabilitation involves several strategies tailored to the patient and remains somewhat based on clinician preference. These therapies may involve functional electrical stimulation, neuro-facilitation, strengthening, range of motion (ROM), mirror therapy, and force-use therapy (e.g., CIMT). Patients engage in therapy 5 days per week as inpatients, and 2 days per week as outpatients with additional home exercises. Specific therapies for each patient will be tracked using a therapy log.</description>
