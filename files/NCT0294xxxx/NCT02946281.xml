  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Do CHANGE is to develop a health ecosystem for integrated disease&#xD;
      management of citizens with high blood pressure and patients with ischemic heart disease or&#xD;
      heart failure. The system will give them access to a set of personalized health services in a&#xD;
      near real-time fashion. This disruptive system will incorporate the behaviour change methods,&#xD;
      such as &quot;Do Something Different&quot;, in conjunction with new innovative wearable/portable tools&#xD;
      that can monitor behaviour and clinical parameters in normal living situations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled for participation will be randomly assigned to the intervention or 'care as&#xD;
      usual' group (1:1). Patients assigned to the intervention group will receive a 3 month&#xD;
      intervention aiming to enhance self-management and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist out 4 components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Behavioral prompts (Do's) from the Do Something Different Programme The Do Something&#xD;
           Different Program has previously been developed and evaluated (ref). For the current&#xD;
           study, the programme has been adapted to the population of interest (CAD, HF, and HT&#xD;
           patients) together with behavioural experts and cardiologists. The program aims to&#xD;
           change behavioural habits and increase flexibility and subsequently change habits&#xD;
           associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and distress, which are both found to be&#xD;
           associated with hypertension and cardiovascular risks. The program has been developed&#xD;
           with input from cardiologists , psychologists, and patients. 'Typical' other behavioural&#xD;
           risks besides hypertension have been identified and are addressed within the program. To&#xD;
           further adapt the program to patient' needs, all patient, prior to starting the program,&#xD;
           will be assessed regarding their own functioning, distress, and personality such that&#xD;
           the Do's will match their personal habits and challenge them to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After assessing patients personality profile the intervention will be provided for 11&#xD;
           weeks. Patients will receive a total of 32 Do's / messages during this period. The Do's&#xD;
           will be matched to their personal profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Care-Portal All patients who are randomized to the intervention group will also receive&#xD;
           a Care-Portal (Docobo Ltd.) which will be installed at their home. The Care-Portal will&#xD;
           be used to gather ECG data and blood pressure on a daily basis. The Care-Portal will&#xD;
           send the physiological data directly to the cardiologist who will be able to access&#xD;
           those via an online platform and contact the patient if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, patients will receive their Do's trough the care-portal. The Care-Portal is&#xD;
           a CE-marked device that has previously been successfully used and implemented to support&#xD;
           patients with chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood pressure monitor All patients in the intervention group will receive the digital&#xD;
           blood pressure monitor 'UA -767 Plus' which is a CE-marked device for clinical use.&#xD;
           Patients will be asked to measure their blood pressure on a daily basis and record the&#xD;
           values through the care-portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Moves App For the future study within the Do CHANGE project, the Do Something Different&#xD;
           programme wants to focus on providing 'Contextual Do's' where patients will receive&#xD;
           behavioural prompts at the moment that the behaviour takes place. In order to reach this&#xD;
           goal getting more insight in patients behavioral patters is of utmost importance. Hence,&#xD;
           that data will be gathered within this current study as one of the exploratory&#xD;
           objectives using GPS data. This will give more insights and will be used as input for&#xD;
           future study. All patients participating in the intervention will be provided with the&#xD;
           'Moves' app that will log their activities anonymously. This information will&#xD;
           automatically be available for research purposes only. Patients will not receive any&#xD;
           push messages from that app or any feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Moves&quot; is an automatic diary of patients life. The daily storyline and maps show where,&#xD;
      when, and how much a person moves. The application automatically records any walking,&#xD;
      cycling, and running that is done. The app is always active in the background, so there's no&#xD;
      need to start and stop it. Just keep the phone in the pocket or a bag. The app consumes&#xD;
      battery power, so nightly charging is recommended. With typical phone use, a smartphone&#xD;
      running Moves should have enough battery power to last all day. The optional Battery Saving&#xD;
      Mode in Moves for iPhone saves up to 40% of battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Moves API can be used to build new apps, integrate with an existing service and visualise&#xD;
      data. The API is designed for apps and services that have a server component. Individual&#xD;
      users need to give permission to access data. However, providing any kind of personal&#xD;
      information is optional, data collection can be done anonymously as well. Moves uses OAuth&#xD;
      2.0 for authentication and authorization and the actual authorization happens in the Moves&#xD;
      app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study the API can be used to collect location based data from participants. This&#xD;
      data will be used to develop the location based responsive Do program. During the study&#xD;
      participants will not receive feedback from the application. In the settings all&#xD;
      notifications can be turned off. Besides, the app can be used without setting goals and&#xD;
      accounts. The only thing a participant is asked is to install the app and fill in a unique&#xD;
      code for data collection. Participants who do not use a smartphone or are not able to install&#xD;
      the app do not have to use it.&#xD;
