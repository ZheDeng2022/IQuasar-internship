    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the correct identification of baseline (pre-treatment) vs. 12 weeks post-final treatment images by two out of three blinded, independent reviewers. Success was defined as at least 70% correct identification of the baseline (pre-treatment) photographs.</description>

          <title>Proportion of Correctly Identified Photos by Blinded Reviewers</title>
          <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the correct identification of baseline (pre-treatment) vs. 12 weeks post-final treatment images by two out of three blinded, independent reviewers. Success was defined as at least 70% correct identification of the baseline (pre-treatment) photographs.</description>
