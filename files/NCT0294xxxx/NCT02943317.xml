  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose expansion trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of defactinib (VS-6063) in combination with avelumab&#xD;
      in epithelial ovarian cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part A (Dose Escalation of VS-6063) and Part B&#xD;
      (Expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A (Dose Escalation), approximately 18 subjects will receive avelumab IV treatment in&#xD;
      28-day cycles (10 mg/kg over approximately 1 hour on Days 1 and 15) and oral defactinib&#xD;
      twice-daily (BID) continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Subject enrollment will proceed&#xD;
      according to a standard 3+3 design. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), each&#xD;
      subject will receive the study drug regimen for a minimum of 28 days (Cycle 1) and may&#xD;
      continue to receive additional cycles of study treatment until disease progression has been&#xD;
      documented or unacceptable toxicity or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been&#xD;
      met. All subjects in a cohort must have completed at least 1 cycle of dosing before dose&#xD;
      escalation involving new subjects entered into the next dose cohort can occur. Based on the&#xD;
      safety and PK data obtained in the dose escalation portion of the study, the RP2D of the&#xD;
      combination will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B (Expansion), approximately 80 subjects will be enrolled and will receive avelumab&#xD;
      IV treatment in 28-day cycles (10 mg/kg over approximately 1 hour on Days 1 and 15) and oral&#xD;
      defactinib at the RP2D dose continuously starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
