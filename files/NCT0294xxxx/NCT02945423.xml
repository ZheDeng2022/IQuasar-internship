  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome which is frequently missed or misdiagnosed among&#xD;
      psychiatric patients. The current project is a systematic examination of catatonia which will&#xD;
      characterize the phenotype and identify biological correlates that play a central role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and effective pharmacological treatment of this condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify and phenotype participants ranging in age from 10-30 years old who are already&#xD;
           diagnosed with catatonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review laboratory investigations already complete and further conduct any laboratory&#xD;
           tests which were not previously completed, to exclude a general medical etiology of&#xD;
           catatonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain skin biopsy for fibroblast from participant to reprogram somatic cells to iPSC&#xD;
           (induced pluripotent cell lines) which will be differentiated to cortical neurons for in&#xD;
           vitro pharmacological studies against the target tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will be consented. Eligibility will be determined through UM medical record&#xD;
      screening. When a potential participant is identified, the study team will reach out to the&#xD;
      treating clinician to make contact with participant about research interest. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to initiation of any study-related procedures. Consent may be emailed&#xD;
      at request of potential participants or their representative in advance of a scheduled&#xD;
      research appointment for their review. Additionally, informed consent will take place in&#xD;
      person both verbally and in writing, with adequate time for participants to ask questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, a comprehensive psychiatric interview will be completed to&#xD;
      identify overall psychiatric diagnoses and symptoms of catatonia. Based on this evaluation, a&#xD;
      decision will be made whether or not the individual is testable or untestable for&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical exam will be performed which will include weight, height, waist and head&#xD;
      circumference, as well as vital signs that include blood pressure and pulse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic medical record (EMR) will be reviewed to identify any comorbid medical condition,&#xD;
      lab results and medications received including the response to each agent. The medical&#xD;
      disorders (current or past) may include infective 26 27,28, metabolic/ endocrine 29,&#xD;
      autoimmune 30, toxic/ drug related 31 and seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing (NP): Standardized, well-validated tests will be used to assess&#xD;
      emotional, behavioral and neuropsychological functioning where possible. Clinician completed&#xD;
      ratings of autism symptoms will be completed, as well as parental rating scales for autism,&#xD;
      general behavioral issues, and quality of life. In addition, each participant will undergo&#xD;
      brief face-to face evaluations when catatonic symptoms do not preclude testing covering the&#xD;
      domains of intellectual functioning, academic achievement, receptive language, executive&#xD;
      functioning, and motor skills. These domains are typically included in neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing protocols, are brief, and place minimal demands on participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests: Laboratory work up required for the purpose of this study will include CBC,&#xD;
      CMP, free T4, TSH, thyroid antibodies, ANA, ASO, CRP, urine toxicology, urine or serum&#xD;
      organic acids, Cu and ceruloplasmin, anti-NMDAR receptor antibodies, CMA (chromosomal&#xD;
      microarray), fragile X, and EEG. If labs have been performed and are in the participant's&#xD;
      medical record, they may be used as part of this study and not re-requested based upon&#xD;
      physician judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA: one 8ml vial of blood will be drawn and stored for future DNA analysis. DNA will be&#xD;
      stored as part of the Heinz C. Prechter Genetics Repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy: a skin biopsy will be obtained from a subset of participants who meet inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Standardized interviews and questionnaires will be completed by the participant&#xD;
      or their representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability: will be established between the interviewers, at the level of the interview and&#xD;
      by best estimate diagnosis. All available sources of clinical information, including medical&#xD;
      records, informant data, the ADOS and the ADI-R, will be independently reviewed by a&#xD;
      non-interviewing psychiatrist or psychologist. Reviewers' &quot;best-estimate&quot; diagnoses will be&#xD;
      established at regular investigator meetings. If all are in agreement, the consensus&#xD;
      diagnosis is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance: The PI and co-investigators will review all interviews to check for&#xD;
      completeness and accuracy. Interviewers will be given feedback and subjects will be&#xD;
      re-contacted as needed to correct problems or complete questions. This will reduce errors and&#xD;
      missing data.&#xD;
