      A trial investigating the effects of pyridostigmine (mestinon) versus a placebo in a&#xD;
      double-blind cross over trial in patients with hereditary proximal spinal muscular atrophy&#xD;
      (SMA) types 2, 3 and 4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-over trial we will investigate the effects of pyridostigmine (mestinon) versus&#xD;
      a placebo on fatigability in patients with hereditary proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)&#xD;
      types 2, 3 and 4 (aged 12 and older) The study participants will be using a placebo during 8&#xD;
      weeks and mestinon during 8 weeks. Both investigators and patients are blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation in both periods. Patients will be randomly assigned to use placebo or&#xD;
      mestinon first. At the end of the study, patients will have used both mestinon and a placebo&#xD;
      during 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases (periods) of the cross over study, study medication dosage will slowly be&#xD;
      increased to a maximum dosage of 6 mg/kg/day (spread over 4 doses daily) in order to either&#xD;
      prevent side effects or to manage them as good as possible. This scheme allows us to assist&#xD;
      our participants in case side effects do occur early. Although we strive to have all patients&#xD;
      on the same dosage per kg of body weight, serious side effects will obviously lead to&#xD;
      lowering the dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of medication use (either placebo or pyridostigmine), baseline measurements&#xD;
      will be taken: a physical examination and data concerning both primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      (MFM, MRC scores, fatigability tests, etc.) will be collected. After use a drug&#xD;
      (mestinon/placebo) for 8 weeks these tests will be repeated, to evaluate possible medication&#xD;
      effect. After a wash-out period of approximately 1-2 weeks the same scheme is used for the&#xD;
      second study period (i.e. the cross-over design). Unblinding follows after the entire study&#xD;
      is completed (i.e.: last included patients finishes participation).&#xD;
