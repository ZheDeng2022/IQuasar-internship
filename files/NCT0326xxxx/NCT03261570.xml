  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), is the chronic form of orthostatic intolerance&#xD;
      associated with excessive upright tachycardia, and occurs predominantly in young females&#xD;
      (&gt;85%). Among its most troubling symptoms are lightheadedness, fatigue, and decreased memory&#xD;
      often called &quot;brain fog&quot; by patients. Task-related neurovascular coupling (NVC) links neural&#xD;
      activity to an increase in CBF known as &quot;functional hyperemia&quot;. Although memory task&#xD;
      performance and NVC deteriorated with angle of tilt in POTS but not healthy controls,&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) remained similar to control. Instead, the investigators observed&#xD;
      extensive narrow band low frequency (0.07-0.13 Hz) oscillations in BP (OBP) that entrained&#xD;
      and amplified oscillations in CBF (OCBF). OBP and OCBF increased with tilt angle and caused&#xD;
      impaired working memory and reduced functional hyperemia. The cardiovagal baroreflex couples&#xD;
      BP to HR to buffer BP changes. The investigators hypothesize that the cardiovagal baroreflex&#xD;
      becomes progressively impaired with orthostasis in POTS, but not in healthy volunteers, and&#xD;
      accounts for OBP, OCBF, and loss of NVC; further, improving the baroreflex reduces OBP, OCBF&#xD;
      and Brain Fog in POTS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthostatic intolerance is defined by debilitating upright symptoms that are relieved by&#xD;
      sitting or lying. Symptoms include upright lightheadedness, fatigue, confusion, and decreased&#xD;
      memory called 'Brain Fog' by patients. The most common chronic form is Postural Tachycardia&#xD;
      Syndrome (POTS), characterized by excessive upright tachycardia without hypotension. Of note,&#xD;
      &gt;85% of POTS patients are female. The proposal that Brain Fog was caused by reduced cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (CBF) has been disproven, because graded incremental upright tilt failed to&#xD;
      demonstrate difference in mean CBF compared to healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, memory task&#xD;
      performance deteriorates with angle of tilt as does task-related neurovascular coupling&#xD;
      (NVC), which links neural activity to an increase in CBF known as &quot;functional hyperemia&quot;. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously observed that large low frequency (0.07-0.13 Hz) oscillations&#xD;
      in BP (OBP), which entrained and amplified oscillations in CBF (OCBF), increased with tilt&#xD;
      angle and were associated with impaired working memory and reduced functional hyperemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sympathetic baroreflex remains intact and HR is excessively increased in the absence of&#xD;
      parasympathetic counterregulation. The cardiovagal baroreflex couples BP to HR to buffer BP&#xD;
      changes. Large low frequency BP oscillations, representing a resonance within the sympathetic&#xD;
      baroreflex loop, occur if there is central hypovolemia, an intact sympathetic baroreflex, and&#xD;
      reduced parasympathetic buffering of BP by HR; conditions found in upright POTS. This leads&#xD;
      to the following hypothetical paradigm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ↓Cardiovagal Baroreflex → ↑OBP → ↑↑OCBF → ↓NVC → ↓working memory. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      application, the investigators hypothesize that the cardiovagal baroreflex is impaired in&#xD;
      POTS while supine, becomes further impaired with orthostasis, and accounts for OBP, OCBF, and&#xD;
      loss of NVC. Further, the investigators propose that improving the cardiovagal baroreflex&#xD;
      improves hemodynamics and Brain Fog in POTS patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Cardiac output measure by inert gas breathing technique</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output measure by inert gas breathing technique. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. The technique uses the Innocor system in which the relative levels of two inert gases - one blood soluble and one insoluble component - are measured over a few respirations (about 5 breaths or 15 seconds). The rate of disappearance of the soluble gas from the alveolar space is proportional to the flow of blood perfusing the lungs and equals the cardiac output.</description>

The arterial pressure is reported as an aggregate of 3 extracted quantities: the systolic blood pressure which is the maximum blood pressure over a cardiac cycle; the diastolic blood pressure which is the minimum blood pressure over a cardiac cycle; and the mean blood pressure which is the average blood pressure over a cardiac cycle.</description>
