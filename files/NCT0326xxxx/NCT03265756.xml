  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a major cause of illness in young children. The investigators are developing and&#xD;
      testing a new thermometer like device called Multimometer, to measure the respiration rate&#xD;
      (RR), temperature, heart rate (HR) and the degree of blood oxygenation (SpO2) of children who&#xD;
      may suffer from pneumonia. These are called vital signs and their measurements greatly help&#xD;
      to diagnose pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, and in order to optimize and better align the size of the&#xD;
      device with the face, the investigators will measure the average size and dimensions of young&#xD;
      children's face. In the second part of the study, the investigators will compare the vital&#xD;
      signs measurements with measurements obtained by other commonly used devices in ill children&#xD;
      who are suspected to suffer from pneumonia.&#xD;

      A. Improve the universality of the mouth-interface using facial anthropometry techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this first part of the study, the investigators will use a portable 3D camera (as&#xD;
      previously used by our group) to acquire 250 3D facial images of healthy children under 5yrs&#xD;
      of age in the DRC. While in hospital/clinic, the investigators will use a three-dimension&#xD;
      (3D) special camera to obtain an image of the child's face. The child can sit on the lap of&#xD;
      the parent and we will take the image. The image acquisition takes less than 30 seconds.&#xD;
      There are no specific requirements from the child, and the image can be taken if the child is&#xD;
      asleep or awake, cry or settled. No medical or identifying information will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the computerized images will be cluster analyzed (using previously established&#xD;
      methodologies from the Technion, Israel) and three 3D average faces of all small, medium and&#xD;
      large faces will be constructed. The investigators will use these &quot;faces&quot; to design better&#xD;
      Multimometers with improved mouth-interface for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Integrate into the current device a reflexive pulse oximeter sensor which will allow&#xD;
      measurements of oxygen saturation and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the addition of HR and SpO2 measurements, the investigators will integrate a reflective&#xD;
      pulse oximetry chip into the probe. Together with the manufacturer (RespiDx Inc., Israel) the&#xD;
      investigators will design and manufacture optimal prototype devices suitable for performing&#xD;
      clinical trials on this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Compare vital signs measurements by Multimometer® to simultaneous vital signs measurement&#xD;
      using conventional devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this part of the study, repeated (x5 times) measurements of the 4 vital signs in 50 young&#xD;
      children (under 5 yrs) in hospital/clinics in Butembo DRC with suspected pneumonia, will be&#xD;
      recorded using the Multimometer. These signs will also be measured at the same time, by&#xD;
      conventional methods (regular thermometers for temperature, observed respiratory rate using&#xD;
      recorded chest movements and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) for respiratory rate, standard&#xD;
      pulse oximeters for oxygen saturation and heart rate). All these measurements take less than&#xD;
      5 minutes. The investigators will repeat these sets approximately 5 times during the same day&#xD;
      in the hospital or during a clinic visit. The vital signs will be compared between the two&#xD;
      methods using Pearson's correlation coefficient and using Bland-Altman plots for agreement.&#xD;
