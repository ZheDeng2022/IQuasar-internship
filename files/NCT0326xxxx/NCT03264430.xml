      This study will be carried out in Assiut University Hospitals, General Surgery Operative room&#xD;
      and Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 60 adult participants (ASA I&amp;II) scheduled for minor perianal surgery&#xD;
      (perianal fistula, haemorrhoids or both). After approval of ethics committee and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will exclude participants with classic contraindications to spinal block,&#xD;
      pre-existing systemic disease (such as cardiovascular, respiratory or renal diseases),&#xD;
      coagulopathy and participants taking any medications that could influence the haemodynamic&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected participants will be divide into two groups (30 participants for each group),&#xD;
      ketamine group and placebo (control) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ketamine group will receive intrathecal bupivacaine (7.5 mg) in 1.5 ml (Marcaine, Astra&#xD;
      Zeneca, France, 0.5%) and ketamine (25mg) in 0.5 ml (Ketam, EIPICO, Egypt, 50 mg/mL),. Total&#xD;
      volume is 2 ml will injected. The control group will receive only intrathecal bupivacaine&#xD;
      (7.5 mg) in 1.5 ml plus 0.5ml normal saline to achieve total volume of 2 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants will receive oral medication 60 minutes preoperatively with 0.5 mg/kg of&#xD;
      midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After arrival at the OR, an intravenous (IV) 18-20G catheter was placed and infusion of 20&#xD;
      ml/kg NaCl 0.9% will start. Standard monitoring electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2), and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dural puncture was made in the sitting position with a 25 gauge spinal needle using a median&#xD;
      approach. After aspiration, the dose of anaesthetic as indicated in the envelope was injected&#xD;
      over two minutes. The time of Dural puncture was used as the Primary starting point of&#xD;
      assessment. The medications injection will be over 10 s with no barbotage and the needle&#xD;
      orifice cephaled. After intrathecal injection, participants will kept sitting for 10 minutes,&#xD;
      after that the patient will lie in the lithotomy position and received 100% O2 (4 L/min) with&#xD;
      face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten minutes after the Dural puncture, participants will asked to lie down and the level of&#xD;
      sensory block will tested with an alcohol swab. Motor block was tested by modified Bromage&#xD;
      scale (0 = no motor block, 1 = able to flex ankle and bend knees, 2 = able to flex ankle, and&#xD;
      3 = full motor block) [21], and surgery in the supine position will allow to started. In case&#xD;
      of failed block, general anaesthesia will be induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive BP taken every 5 minutes and HR were assessed in the OR. Reduction of mean BP&#xD;
      (MAP) and HR &gt;20% from baseline was judged clinically significant. A decrease in systolic BP&#xD;
      below 90 mmHg will be treated with 5 mg of IV ephedrine, HR&lt;45 beats per minute (bpm) will be&#xD;
      treated with 0.5 mg of IV atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (age, gender, type of surgery); duration of anesthesia (from the moment of&#xD;
           dural puncture until patient left the OR) and surgery in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of success (failed block, number of attempts made, ease of performance scale 1-3,&#xD;
           where 3 = easy to perform, 2 =moderate, 1 = difficult, multiple attempts needed);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  level of sensory (dermatomes) and motor (Bromage scale) block10 minutes after dural&#xD;
           puncture, at the end of surgery, and in the ward every 30 minutes until resolution of&#xD;
           the block and afterwards at 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 hours postoperatively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MAP and HR every 5 minutes in the OR, then every 4 hours for postoperative 24 hours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications during performance of anesthesia: paresthesias, toxic reactions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of postoperative pain on a written VAS scale (0-10 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of 1st analgesic request, and number of requests for each patient will be recorded&#xD;
           in the 1st 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of rescue analgesia; if VAS is ≥ 5 in the form of 30 mg intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
           repeated twice as patient satisfaction and 0.1mg of morphine for up stocking of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Urinary retention (0-2 scale, where 0 = normal urination, 1 = difficult spontaneous&#xD;
           urination, and 2 = unable to urinate, catheterization needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV; 0-3 scale, where 0 = no nausea, 1 = slight&#xD;
           nausea, 2 = nausea and single vomiting, and 3 = multiple vomiting) [15],&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) at day 1 postoperatively and 10 days later by phone&#xD;
           call at home,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transient neurologic symptoms (TNS), backache, itching, allergic reactions, time of&#xD;
           postoperative recovery, time to urinate, duration of sensory and motor block, and time&#xD;
           to stand and walk unsupported&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be recorded on and analyzed using SPSS-12. The results will be presented as&#xD;
      Mean ±SD or percent of patients. For proportions, Pearson test or Fisher's test will be used.&#xD;
      Student's t-test being used for quantitative variables. A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      to show statistical significance.&#xD;
