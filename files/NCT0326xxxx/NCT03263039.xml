  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the RESPONDER study, the role of the immune evasive mechanisms combined with genomic&#xD;
      characterization will be explored in urothelial cancer patients treated with second-line&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined profiling of immune and molecular status is novel and may contribute to improved&#xD;
      patient stratification and provide rationale for future treatment strategies containing&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibodies that target the crosstalk between immune and cancer cells by inhibiting programmed&#xD;
      death 1 (PD-1, Pembrolizumab and Durvalumab) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1,&#xD;
      Atezolizumab) have shown promising results as second-line treatments in phase II studies with&#xD;
      response rates of about 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although urothelial cancer is prone to immune checkpoint blockade, better understanding of&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms is necessary to improve patient selection. The efficacy of immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial cancer may be affected by both tumor specific and&#xD;
      environmental factors. In order to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in urothelial&#xD;
      cancer, drivers of local immune suppression need to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective translational multicenter study, clinical data, peripheral blood and&#xD;
      sequential tumor biopsies are collected from urothelial cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      second-line treatment with pembrolizumab to identify the role of immune evasive mechanisms&#xD;
      combined with genomic characterization. A pre-treatment tumor biopsy and blood sample will be&#xD;
      obtained and subsequently whole genome sequencing and whole genome RNA sequencing is&#xD;
      performed. Both tumor tissue as well as peripheral blood will be investigated for immune and&#xD;
      molecular profiling. A biopsy will also be taken after start of treatment (at 6 weeks) and at&#xD;
      progression (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For future research projects, longitudinal blood samples will be collected for isolation of&#xD;
      immune cells, cytokine/chemo-attractants and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).&#xD;

    <description>Peripheral blood and sequential tumor biopsies are collected before start of treatment, during treatment, and (optionally) at progression.&#xD;
Immune profiling using in situ multiplex immunofluorescence will be performed to identify tumor epithelial and stromal cells, effector immune cells, T cell co-inhibition, T cell recruitment and immune-suppressive cells. Furthermore, serum samples will be assessed for levels of cytokines/chemoattractants. Finally, longitudinal blood samples will be collected for isolation of immune cells, cytokine/chemo-attractants and ctDNA.&#xD;
A qualified pathologist will determine tumor cell percentage in the obtained biopsies. DNA will be obtained from both cancer cells (biopsy tissue) and normal white blood cells (peripheral blood) and will be submitted for whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
The obtained data will contribute to identifying potential biomarkers in patients with clinical benefit.</description>

    <description>Combined profiling of immune and molecular status (as described in outcome 1) during treatment and at disease progression will reveal different mechanisms by which urothelial cancer evades pembrolizumab.&#xD;
Additional bio-informatic analyses will be done to detect the somatic structural variants and copy number changes. The genome data will be used to explore potential correlations between specific pathway aberrations, total number of somatic variants and pattern of mutational load characteristic of the DNA mutational agent and clinical outcome. Moreover, we will perform whole genome RNA sequencing, an essential part of the genomic analysis to identify tumor specific neo-antigens.&#xD;
The obtained data will contribute to identifying mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to pembrolizumab.</description>

    <time_frame>End of study (pembrolizumab will be given for a maximum of 24 months), which is anticipated to be within 3 years after start inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The following definitions and response evaluation criteria will be used to assess potential correlation: immune related response criteria (irRC), duration of response according to RECIST and irRC, duration of clinical benefit (CR-complete response/PR-partial response/SD-stable disease) according to RECIST and irRC, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
By combining the data from the profiling of immune and molecular status (as described in outcome 1) with the additional data from bio-informatic analyses (as described in outcome 2) and the clinical activity (as described above), correlations between biomarkers and clinical activity can be identified.</description>
