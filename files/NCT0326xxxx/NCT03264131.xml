  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare form of cancer found mostly among people from&#xD;
      the Caribbean islands, Western Africa, Brazil, Iran, and Japan. Most cases of this disease in&#xD;
      the United States occur along the East Coast due to emigration from the Caribbean islands.&#xD;
      There is currently no standard treatment for ATLL. Research shows that patients who go into&#xD;
      first time remission (respond completely or partially to treatment) and have a bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant have the best outcomes. Traditional chemotherapy treatments have generally not&#xD;
      worked well in patients with ATLL. Additionally, not all patients will be eligible for a bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see how well individuals with ATLL respond to an&#xD;
      investigational cancer treatment. This investigational treatment combines a drug called&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin with a standard chemotherapy treatment made up of cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone. This treatment is considered investigational because&#xD;
      it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment&#xD;
      of ATLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris, is approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain types of lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas when combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone in patients whose&#xD;
      cancer cells express a type of marker called CD30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody that also has a chemotherapy drug attached to it.&#xD;
      Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. They can stick to and attack&#xD;
      specific targets on cancer cells. The antibody part of brentuximab vedotin sticks to a target&#xD;
      called cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) that is located on the outside of the cancer&#xD;
      cells. Normal cells have little or no CD30 on their surface. ATLL cancer cells often have a&#xD;
      larger amount of CD30 on their surface than normal cells. However, CD30 is found in different&#xD;
      amounts on ATLL cancer cells. This study will also test the amount of CD30 found on each&#xD;
      participant's cancer cells. Researchers will be looking to see if the response to the study&#xD;
      treatment varies based on the amount of CD30 found on the outside participants' cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, brentuximab vedotin was combined in another study with cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, and prednisone. The study included patients with various types of T-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas. Two of the patients enrolled in that study had ATLL. Both had a complete response&#xD;
      (no evidence of disease). The researchers in this study (LCCC 1637) have added etoposide to&#xD;
      the combination of brentuximab vedotin with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone.&#xD;
      They predict that the addition of etoposide will improve patient outcomes. Research shows&#xD;
      that etoposide helps improve outcomes in patients with certain types of T-cell lymphomas who&#xD;
      undergo chemotherapy treatment. This investigational combination of brentuximab vedotin with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone is called BV-CHEP.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To define the proportion of subjects with CR after 4-6 cycles of&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and&#xD;
      prednisone (BV-CHEP) in the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) with 4-6 cycles of BV-CHEP therapy in patients&#xD;
      with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for BV-CHEP in patients with adult T-cell&#xD;
      leukemia/lymphoma who received or did not receive BV maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine duration of response to BV-CHEP in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma&#xD;
      who received or did not receive BV maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine overall survival (OS) of patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma treated&#xD;
      with BV-CHEP who received or did not receive BV maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of BV-CHEP and BV maintenance therapy via the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v4.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Note: After completion or withdrawal from BV-CHEP therapy, patients will segregate into one&#xD;
      of the following groups: 1) those who progressed on BV-CHEP; 2) those who completed 4-6&#xD;
      cycles of BV-CHEP and went on to allogeneic transplant; 3) those who completed 6 cycles of&#xD;
      BV-CHEP but were CD30 negative and ineligible for maintenance therapy; and 4) those who&#xD;
      completed 6 cycles of BV-CHEP, were CD30 positive, but continued study treatment on BV in the&#xD;
      maintenance phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for CR after 4-6 cycles of BV-CHEP will be based on the International Workshop to&#xD;
      standardize response criteria for malignant lymphomas (ie, Lugano Criteria per Cheson, et al.&#xD;
      J Clin Oncol. 2014;32(27):3059-68).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for overall response will be based on the International Workshop to standardize&#xD;
      response criteria for malignant lymphomas (ie, Lugano Criteria per Cheson, et al. J Clin&#xD;
      Oncol. 2014;32(27):3059-68).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS is defined as time from D1 of treatment until disease progression (based on Lugano&#xD;
      criteria) or death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of response is defined as the time from documentation of tumor response per Lugano&#xD;
      criteria to disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
      OS is defined as the time from D1 of treatment until death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity and tolerability of therapy will be assessed via the NCI CTCAE v4.03&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo screening to see if they are eligible. If eligible, participants will&#xD;
      start by receiving 2 cycles of BV-CHEP (cycles 1 and 2). After 2 cycles of BV-CHEP,&#xD;
      participants will have a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) or a CT&#xD;
      scan to assess their disease. If the scan shows the cancer has stayed the same or gotten&#xD;
      better, participants may continue taking BV-CHEP for two more cycles (cycle 3 and 4). If, at&#xD;
      any time during study treatment, a participant's disease gets worse, the participant will end&#xD;
      study treatment and other treatment options will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant continues on BV-CHEP, at the beginning of cycle 5, the participant will have&#xD;
      a PET/CT scan. If the cancer has gotten better and the participant is eligible for a bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant, he/she will have the transplant. If the participant is not eligible for a&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant and the cancer has stayed the same or gotten better, the participant&#xD;
      may continue on BV-CHEP for two more cycles (cycles 5 and 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of cycle 6 of BV-CHEP, participants will have another PET/CT scan. If the scan&#xD;
      shows the cancer has gotten better and the participant is eligible for a bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant, he/she will have the transplant. If a participant is not eligible for a bone&#xD;
      marrow transplant and his/her cancer cells did not test positive for CD30, the participant&#xD;
      will end study treatment. The study doctor will discuss other treatment options that are not&#xD;
      part of this study with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue on brentuximab vedotin alone as maintenance therapy if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are not eligible for a bone marrow transplant,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their cancer cells tested positive for CD30, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their cancer has not gotten worse after taking BV-CHEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be removed from BV maintenance therapy if their cancer get worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF THERAPY Therapy in LCCC 1637 involves up to 6 cycles of treatment with&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin (BV) with a chemotherapy treatment made up of cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone (CHEP). Each cycle is 21 days long. Participants may&#xD;
      continue on BV alone as maintenance therapy after 6 cycles of BV-CHEP if they meet the&#xD;
      requirements outlined above. Each cycles of BV maintenance therapy is 21-day long. BV&#xD;
      maintenance therapy may continue until a participant's disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP PERIOD Participants will be followed for survival for up to 5 years.&#xD;
      They will also have a PET/CT or CT scan and a blood test every 6 months for 2 years after&#xD;
      study treatment ends.&#xD;
