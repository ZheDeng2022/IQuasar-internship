  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in three weeks of the bionic pancreas in the insulin-only&#xD;
      configuration. Each week, subjects will use a different rapid acting insulin analog --&#xD;
      Humalog, Novolog, or BC222 insulin lispro -- in a randomized cross-over order.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that differences in the PK characteristics of insulin analogs&#xD;
      will lead to differences in glycemic outcomes when delivered by the insulin-only&#xD;
      configuration of the bionic pancreas. Specifically, the investigators predict that insulin&#xD;
      analogs that have faster absorption (numerically lower Tmax and/or T½max) and insulin analogs&#xD;
      that have faster clearance (numerically lower terminal half-life) will result in lower mean&#xD;
      glucose and/or a lower percentage of time in the hypoglycemic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects will participate in three 7-day study arms using insulin lispro, insulin&#xD;
      aspart, and BC222 lispro in the bionic pancreas in random order. The co-primary outcomes will&#xD;
      be mean CGMG and fraction of time spent with CGMG &lt;54 mg/dl with comparisons made between&#xD;
      arms for individual participants. Secondary analyses will include time in glycemic ranges&#xD;
      (&lt;50, &lt;60, &lt;70, 70-120, 70-180, &gt;180, &gt;250 mg/dl), coefficient of variation, mean&#xD;
      postprandial excursion (difference in CGMG from the time of meal announcement to the peak&#xD;
      CGMG in the first 4 hours after the meal announcement) for both mixed meal challenges, number&#xD;
      of symptomatic hypoglycemic events, grams of carbohydrate consumed to treat hypoglycemia, and&#xD;
      TDD of insulin, between arms for individual subjects.&#xD;

             last year), or treatment with anti-psychotic medications that are known to affect&#xD;
             glucose regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrically powered implants (e.g. cochlear implants, neurostimulators) that might be&#xD;

             hypoglycemia requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral (e.g. thiazolidinediones, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitinides, DPP-4&#xD;
             inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors) or non-insulin injectable (GLP-1 agonists, amylin)&#xD;
             anti-diabetic medications&#xD;

             the safe completion of the study&#xD;
