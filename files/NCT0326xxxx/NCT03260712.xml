  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-centre, phase II study in biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients.&#xD;
      The main objective is to detect an increase in progression-free survival rate at 6 months&#xD;
      (according to RECIST version 1.1) from 60% in patients with BTC treated with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy (CT) approach to 75% when treated with CT combined with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the treatment efficacy in terms of overall survival, immune related&#xD;
           progression-free survival, response rate (according to RECIST version 1.1), safety,&#xD;
           symptom control and quality of life (QoL) (according to EORTC QoL C30 and BIL 21)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory objectives include assessment of immunological response (cytokines,&#xD;
           lymphocyte phenotype, immunoglobulins), and evaluation of pathological and clinical&#xD;
           predictive factors for response/toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translational research will focus on biomarkers for prediction of response and toxicity.&#xD;

      Primary endpoint: PFS rate at 6 months according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best overall response rate (according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response duration and stable disease duration (according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS rate at 6 months according to iRECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity of treatment (Common Toxicity Criteria CTCAE 5.0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety analysis: A safety analysis will be done when at least 10 patients have completed&#xD;
           at least one cycle of the three- drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events of clinical interest for this safety analysis are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least Grade 2 or higher CTCAE 5.0 signs of acute renal failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 liver dysfunction defined as elevation of liver transaminases (AST and ALT)&#xD;
           and alkaline phosphatase, increased bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal disorders specifically colitis, diarrhea and stomatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea, dry cough and pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity If 4 out of these 10 patients experience any of the above,&#xD;
           this will trigger an IDMC review. This cut-off is based on: 1) previous ABC-02 study&#xD;
           where 57% of patients experienced a grade 3 or 4 toxicity at 12 weeks of treatment; and&#xD;
           2) KEYNOTE 028 where 17% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity The primary&#xD;
           analysis of efficacy endpoints will be performed in the protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS rate at 6 months will be estimated using Kaplan Meier estimate at the time point of&#xD;
           interest. The lower bound of the one-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) will be&#xD;
           calculated by Greenwood's estimation of the standard deviation. If the lower bound of&#xD;
           the one-sided 90% CI is above 60%, it will be concluded that the new treatment is&#xD;
           effective enough to warrant further evaluation in a phase III trial. Assuming&#xD;
           exponential distributions for both PFS and for the risk of drop-out, power with a total&#xD;
           sample size of 50 patients when the primary test is performed using Kaplan Meier&#xD;
           analyses will be around 82% for a drop-out rate of 5% at 6 months and still above 80%&#xD;
           for a drop-out rate of 10% at 6 months. The one-sided type I error will be respectively&#xD;
           9.33% and 9.02%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS rate at 6 months according to iRECIST will be estimated using Kaplan Meier estimate&#xD;
           and the one-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated by Greenwood's&#xD;
           estimation of the standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BOR rate according to RECIST 1.1 and iBOR rate according to iRECIST will be displayed&#xD;
           (point estimate) with their exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Response duration&#xD;
           and stable disease duration according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST will be graphically&#xD;
           displayed using swimmer plots and bar charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST and overall survival&#xD;
           curves will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. The safety analyses will be&#xD;
           performed in the Safety population. The worst toxicity grade per patient over the&#xD;
           treatment period according to the CTCAE criteria version 5.0 will be displayed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy - patients may have received prior radiotherapy (with or without&#xD;
             radiosensitising low-dose chemotherapy) for localised disease. However, there must be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localized disease only with no evidence of metastatic&#xD;
             disease - patients may have received prior PDT, provided the patient has fully&#xD;
             recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the PDT and there is clear evidence&#xD;
             of disease progression at the local site or disease or at a new metastatic site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PDT for localised disease to relieve biliary obstruction in the presence of metastatic&#xD;
             disease - patients may have received prior PDT provided the patient has fully&#xD;
             recovered and at least 28 days have elapsed since the PDT. Patients may enter trial&#xD;
             provided the non-PDT treated lesion(s) only are followed for response assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially&#xD;
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient before enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
