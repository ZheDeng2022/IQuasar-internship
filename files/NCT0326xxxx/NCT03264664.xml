    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are any of the pre-specified drug-related toxicities (any toxicities considered related to E7386) occurring during Cycle 1 as assessed by the investigator. DLTs will be assessed to determine the maximum tolerated dose.</description>

    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>RP2D will be selected based on an integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and any available pharmacodynamic (PD) data for all dose levels or all available data according to pre-specified guidelines.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial responses (PR) or complete response (CR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in the short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of the first documentation of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression, per RECIST 1.1, is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

The dose will be escalated in cohorts of participants subject to safety data and the absence of DLTs. Based on the emerging data after completion of Dose Escalation Part, identifying MTD or RP2D, or after a decision is made to evaluate more than one potential RP2D level, a Dose Expansion Part will be initiated. Participants will continue to receive study treatment in extension phase until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of E7386 development by the sponsor.</description>
