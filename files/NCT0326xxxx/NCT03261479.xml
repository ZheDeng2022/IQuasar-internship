  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a two-stage, prospective, cohort study of 138 subjects &gt; 28&#xD;
      days old and &lt; 18 years old with respiratory distress, already getting a chest x-ray as part&#xD;
      of their routine clinical care, who will get thermal pictures of their chest at the&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Emergency Department, Pediatric Wards, and Pediatric&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit. The thermal cameras will measure skin temperature, by taking a picture,&#xD;
      in a non-contact way. The investigators will recruit 138 patients using the FLIR ONE thermal&#xD;
      imaging camera for iPhone and the newly designed irPNA application. The FLIR ONE thermal&#xD;
      imaging camera will be attached to a study-designated iPhone which will only have the ability&#xD;
      to take pictures. This phone will not have the capability to make calls or use the internet.&#xD;
      The iPhone will be password protected, as encrypted by Partners regulations. Demographic and&#xD;
      diagnostic data will be collected from patient charts.&#xD;

      I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Historical Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every day 16,000 children under the age of 5-years die. Although strides have been made&#xD;
           in early diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia, it still accounts for about 15% of deaths&#xD;
           of children under 5-years (1). Unfortunately care providers in low- and middle-income&#xD;
           countries (LMICs) are limited due to lack of resources and training. Chest x-rays are&#xD;
           especially difficult to obtain in these LMICs (14). Ironically, smartphones are readily&#xD;
           available. Since its development in 1960, Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras have&#xD;
           made several technological strides. Notably they are now more affordable and compact,&#xD;
           attaching to smartphones. FLIR cameras now have the potential to aid in early diagnosis&#xD;
           and subsequent treatment of childhood pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FLIR imaging was first developed in 1956 with military funding at the University of&#xD;
           Chicago. From the 1960s into the 1970s, FLIR technology was modified independently by&#xD;
           both the Air Force and Texas Instruments Inc. for use by military planes (2). Wendell&#xD;
           Smith first documented the use of thermal imaging in medical diagnosis in 1964. Smith&#xD;
           required 6 minutes to take each thermograph of the horses he was studying (3). Multiple&#xD;
           veterinary studies have been performed since then, and now thermal imaging has been&#xD;
           validated as a means to assess musculoskeletal injuries in animals (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous Clinical Studies Supporting the Proposed Research&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interestingly, very few clinical studies have been performed to validate the use of&#xD;
           thermal imaging in medical diagnosis for human diseases. The use of thermography to&#xD;
           diagnose lung disease was studied in Russia in 1976, 1981, and 1991 in three separate&#xD;
           studies, but these studies were neither controlled nor randomized (6-8). In 1970 Potanin&#xD;
           demonstrated through a case series that patients with pneumonia had increased overlying&#xD;
           chest temperatures and patients with pulmonary embolism had decreased overlying chest&#xD;
           temperatures (12). The most recent and impactful study evaluating pneumonia with thermal&#xD;
           imaging was a case series performed by Wiecek et al. (2001), which showed that patients&#xD;
           with pneumonia demonstrated a reduction in thermographic signal as they positively&#xD;
           responded to treatment (13). More modern studies have attempted to validate infrared&#xD;
           thermal imaging in measuring the size of brain tumors intra-operatively (9), screening&#xD;
           for fever in children (10), and predicting length of recuperation after burn injuries&#xD;
           (11), among others. However, there has not been a modern study validating thermal&#xD;
           imaging in diagnosing pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale behind Proposed Research and Potential Benefit to Society&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is one of the primary contributors to under-five mortality worldwide. Imaging to&#xD;
      support the diagnosis of pneumonia can be very difficult to obtain in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings due to lack of equipment and trained staff. Easy-to-access imaging of pneumonia with&#xD;
      thermal imaging technology may allow practitioners to diagnose pneumonia earlier and more&#xD;
      accurately, which would lead to decreased morbidity and mortality. In LMICs where x-ray&#xD;
      availability is already limited in peripheral centers, excessive use of these facilities can&#xD;
      lead to consumption of limited medical resources. Validating thermal imaging in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of pneumonia would likely lead to cost savings, and obviation of side effects of&#xD;
      antimicrobials and excessive radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the FLIR ONE camera can be used to detect differences in a&#xD;
           temperature spectrum that is clinically applicable. Temperature as measured by a&#xD;
           temporal artery thermometer on hospitalized patients can vary from less than 96°&#xD;
           Fahrenheit to over 104° Fahrenheit. The basis of the FLIR ONE camera and the irPNA&#xD;
           application is to detect asymmetry of temperatures. The investigators hope to&#xD;
           demonstrate that this technology has the capability to demonstrate this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate thermal imaging with the FLIR ONE camera and irPNRA application as a&#xD;
           sensitive modality to diagnose pneumonia. The investigators hope to demonstrate that&#xD;
           there are few false negatives when using this modality to diagnose pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate thermal imaging with the FLIR ONE camera and irPNRA application as a&#xD;
           specific modality to differentiate pneumonia from other pulmonary processes, such as&#xD;
           asthma, pulmonary embolism, and bronchiolitis. The investigators hope to demonstrate&#xD;
           that there are few false positives when using this modality to diagnose pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. SUBJECT SELECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                Inclusion criteria are 1) patients 28-days to 17-years of age, 2) who have&#xD;
                respiratory distress, and 3) who receive a chest x-ray. The investigators will&#xD;
                exclude patients with known chronic lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Source of Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will acquire consent from patients and parents in the Pediatric&#xD;
           Intensive Care Unit, (PICU) Pediatric Emergency Department (ED), and Pediatric Wards at&#xD;
           the Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
           IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Methods of Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
                Trained clinical research staff will be present in the MGH PICU, pediatric wards,&#xD;
                and ED and identify potential subjects through providers. Additionally, the EPIC&#xD;
                electronic medical record system will be used by qualified research staff (research&#xD;
                assistants, coordinators, managers) to electronically identify patients who may be&#xD;
                potential candidates for the study. Subjects having a chest x-ray taken will be&#xD;
                approached for study participation. This study will not interfere with the&#xD;
                subject's medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
                If a patient appears to be eligible, the patient's provider will first approach the&#xD;
                subject and ask if they are willing to be approached about a research study. If the&#xD;
                potential subject declines, no further attempts will be made to enroll the subject.&#xD;
                If the subject agrees to speak to someone about research, a study staff member will&#xD;
                approach him or her about participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Recruitment will not involve restrictions on socio-demographic factors including&#xD;
                ethnic characteristics. Recruitment will be devoid of any procedures, which could&#xD;
                be construed as coercive.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Procedures for Obtaining Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
                At enrollment, in a private room, the investigator/designee will obtain written&#xD;
                informed consent from participants' parent(s) or guardian for this study. During&#xD;
                this encounter, the investigators will remind participants that they are free to&#xD;
                choose to take part in the research or not. The investigators will use a General&#xD;
                Consent Form for the parents/guardians of the patients. Children 14-17 can provide&#xD;
                assent by co-signing the General Template consent form when able. The investigators&#xD;
                will obtain Assent from the subjects verbally, when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment Assignment and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatments or changes in the health care plan will not be made based on this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
           V. STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study Parameters to be Measured&#xD;
&#xD;
                In addition to obtaining thermal images with the FLIR ONE camera, The investigators&#xD;
                will obtain several patient data points. These include 1) chief complaint, 2)&#xD;
                temporal artery temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5)&#xD;
                respiratory rate, 6) oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data,&#xD;
                8) discharge diagnosis, and 9) disposition. Additional chest x-rays will not be&#xD;
                obtained, the investigators will use x-rays already procured as part of the patient&#xD;
                diagnosis and treatment approach and plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Drugs to be Used&#xD;
&#xD;
                None&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Devices to be Used&#xD;
&#xD;
                FLIR ONE camera, attached to an encrypted iPhone. The investigators will also use&#xD;
                the irPNRA application on the iPhone designed by research team member Jim Lewis to&#xD;
                help direct the thermal imaging. The iPhone is encrypted by Partners regulations&#xD;
                and cannot connect to a phone network or the Internet. The iPhone will remain in&#xD;
                'airplane mode' at all times. Biomed has already investigated and approved these&#xD;
                devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Procedures/Surgical Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
                None&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Data to be Collected and when the Data is to be Collected&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will obtain FLIR ONE thermal images within 4 hours of the subject's&#xD;
           chest x-ray. The investigators will also collect the following data: 1) chief complaint,&#xD;
           2) temporal artery temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5)&#xD;
           respiratory rate, 6) oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data, 8)&#xD;
           discharge diagnosis, and 9) disposition. The vitals will be obtained at the time nearest&#xD;
           to the chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient data will be collected prior to being de-identified. The investigators will use&#xD;
           the patient name and medical record number to access their chart in the EMR. Then the&#xD;
           following data will be obtained from the chart: 1) chief complaint, 2) temporal artery&#xD;
           temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4) ambient temperature, 5) respiratory rate, 6)&#xD;
           oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray results and relevant data, 8) discharge diagnosis, and&#xD;
           9) disposition. The x-rays will be obtained, uploaded to the LifeImage application,&#xD;
           de-identified, and then sent to the radiologist on our research team with the&#xD;
           appropriate study ID. The patient information will then be de-identified and replaced&#xD;
           with a study ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Specific Data Variables to be Collected&#xD;
&#xD;
                The investigators will collect the following variables from the patient chart: 1)&#xD;
                chief complaint, 2) temporal artery temperature, 3) cutaneous temperature, 4)&#xD;
                ambient temperature, 5) respiratory rate, 6) oxygen saturation, 7) chest x-ray&#xD;
                results and relevant data, 8) discharge diagnosis, and 9) disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The investigators will collect the following identifiers from the patient record&#xD;
                prior to de-identifying them: 1) name, 2) DOB, 3) age, 4) gender, and 5) MRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Interpretation of the x-rays will be blinded. The x-rays will be uploaded to&#xD;
                LifeImage, de-identified, and then sent to the radiologist on our research team.&#xD;
                The de-identified x-ray images will then be evaluated by the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
                The investigators will assess for temperature asymmetry with the FLIR ONE thermal&#xD;
                camera with images taken of the chest. The investigators will compare these results&#xD;
                with the results of a chest x-ray taken within the last 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
                The investigators will compare chest x-ray results to FLIR ONE thermal imaging&#xD;
                results. The investigators will use sensitivity and specificity calculations based&#xD;
                on the positive and negative results from those studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Power Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the standard α = 0.05, sample size = 31, observed false positive (TI+|CXR-) rate&#xD;
           =0.38 and the observed false negative (TI-|CXR+) rate = 0.20, the power (β-1) for the&#xD;
           test applied to the overall population was calculated at 0.26. In order to achieve a&#xD;
           power of 0.80 with the conditions encountered in this study, The investigators would&#xD;
           require 138 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORT:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complications of Surgical/Non-Surgical Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
                None&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Drug Side Effects and Toxins&#xD;
&#xD;
                None&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Device Complications and Malfunctions&#xD;
&#xD;
                The FLIR ONE device is a thermal camera that attaches to an iPhone. Complications&#xD;
                of the device will not affect the patient. If it malfunctions, the investigators&#xD;
                will fix or replace it.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Psychosocial (non-medical) Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
                The risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by using study IDs on study&#xD;
                documentation to identify subjects. The list linking the study subjects to the&#xD;
                study IDs will be kept in a secure location, with access limited only to staff&#xD;
                directly involved with the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Radiation Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no known radiation risks. As mentioned above, only x-rays obtained as part of&#xD;
           the patient diagnostic and treatment plans will be used. No additional x-rays will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Potential Benefits to Participating Individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
                Participants will not receive any direct benefit from their participation in the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Potential Benefits to Society&#xD;
&#xD;
           Worldwide, pneumonia is one of the leading causes of mortality in children in the first&#xD;
           5 years of life. In both developed countries and resource poor settings, detection of&#xD;
           bacterial pathogens by culturing blood or other specimens is time consuming, lacks&#xD;
           sensitivity and ranges from difficult in the U.S. to impossible in the developing world.&#xD;
           In the U.S., the inability to determine which children have a bacterial infection&#xD;
           results in excessive use of antibiotics and increased risk of infection with multi-drug&#xD;
           resistant organisms. In the developing world, the consequences are delays in timely&#xD;
           initiation of antibiotic therapy and excessive referral of children for hospitalization&#xD;
           that overwhelms referral facilities. Regardless of setting, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
           point of care diagnostics to determine which children likely have bacterial pneumonia&#xD;
           and will benefit from administration of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, aiding diagnosis of pneumonia with thermal imaging may obviate chest x-rays&#xD;
           as the primary diagnostic tool and reduce unnecessary exposure of patients to radiation.&#xD;
           In the PICU and the Wards, it is not uncommon that some patients require daily or even&#xD;
           more frequent chest x-rays. If The investigators are able to validate thermal imaging as&#xD;
           a tool to detect pneumonia, the investigators could potentially minimize the radiation&#xD;
           exposure of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Independent Monitoring of Source Data&#xD;
&#xD;
                Given the relatively small size of this study and the lack of an investigational&#xD;
                agent, there will not be a data and safety monitoring committee set up for the&#xD;
                purpose of evaluating data and safety of the participants. The principal&#xD;
                investigator, as well as the Partners IRB, shall provide oversight and review of&#xD;
                the study protocol throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Safety Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
                There will be no official safety monitoring. The investigators anticipate the risks&#xD;
                of participation in this research study to be minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Outcomes Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
                There will be no outcomes monitoring. Treatments or changes in the health care plan&#xD;
                will not be made based on this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
           The principal investigator will review all reports of safety or other concerns within 24&#xD;
           hours of being notified and communicate these to the IRB as per Partners IRB policy&#xD;
           &quot;Reporting Unanticipated Problems Including Adverse Events&quot;. The investigators will not&#xD;
           require a DSMB for this study.&#xD;
