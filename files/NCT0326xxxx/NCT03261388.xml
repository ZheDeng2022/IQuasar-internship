  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute, rehabilitation for individuals with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI) is being led by the NIH funded NeuroRecovery Network (NRN) Community Fitness and&#xD;
      Wellness Program through the Activity-Based Locomotor Exercise Program (ABLE). Any individual&#xD;
      with a spinal cord injury who is eligible for the ABLE Program is eligible for participation&#xD;
      in the NeuroRecovery Network Research Project (NRN). The purpose of the ABLE POWER Study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of activity-based locomotor exercise programs in individuals&#xD;
      with SCI through a wait-list controlled design. Individuals who have a spinal cord injury and&#xD;
      are on the wait list for ABLE will be enrolled in this project for a year while they wait for&#xD;
      an opening in the ABLE program. Changes that occur while participants are on the wait list&#xD;
      will be compared to changes that occur after they are enrolled in ABLE. A difference in the&#xD;
      rate of improvement after enrollment in the intervention would be attributed to the ABLE&#xD;
      intervention. Individuals participating in the ABLE program will receive the ABLE&#xD;
      intervention regardless of participation in the ABLE POWER research study. In this design,&#xD;
      there will be two measures in the year prior to enrollment in ABLE, and two measures in the&#xD;
      year after enrollment, and the two time periods would be compared to the data collected at&#xD;
      enrollment into ABLE.&#xD;

    <description>The NRS measures motor function in individuals with SCI without allowing compensatory motions. This 15 item measure is collected while the participants are on the mat, in sitting, standing, and on the weight supported treadmill. Items include upper extremity function, lower extremity function, sitting, sit to stand, standing, and locomotor items.</description>

    <description>The COPM is a client-centered measure of performance and satisfaction using client identified meaningful activities and has been used with individuals who have SCI as a means to identify personally meaningful goals</description>

        Participants for this research study will be recruited from adults with spinal cord injury&#xD;
        (SCI) on the wait list for the Neurorecovery Network (NRN) research study. These&#xD;
        individuals have injuries at all spinal levels and categories of completeness.&#xD;
