  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiotocography (CTG) is widely used during labour wards in industrialised countries and&#xD;
      consists of fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring. The main aim is to identify&#xD;
      fetuses that are being poorly oxygenated during labour and require medical intervention to&#xD;
      revert the situation or expedite delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for technical development of CTG is well-recognized, as some of the existing&#xD;
      techniques are prone to signal loss and contamination from the maternal heart rate, while&#xD;
      others are invasive and have established contra-indications. They also limit maternal&#xD;
      mobilisation, contributing to maternal dissatisfaction, and possibly to adverse maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New techniques for CTG acquisition will shortly be made available by a leading technological&#xD;
      company, providing non-invasive monitoring and allowing full maternal mobilisation, and with&#xD;
      the potential to change the way labour is conducted in high-resource countries. There is a&#xD;
      need for a systematic evaluation of their clinical performance and benefit.&#xD;

      First phase of the study will start in October 2017 in labor wards at Hospital de Santa&#xD;
      Maria, Lisbon where performing continuous cardiotocographic fetal monitoring with&#xD;
      conventional Doppler technology is the routine procedure. Through a collaboration with&#xD;
      Phillips (Boeblingen, Germany) we will have access to a transabdominal ECG/EHG recorder that&#xD;
      has high accuracy/reliability and Bluetooth technology providing mobility and and more&#xD;
      comfort for mothers. This new device works through five disposable electrodes that are&#xD;
      positioned on the maternal abdomen in a standardized manner: one electrode is placed near the&#xD;
      umbilicus, a second is placed above the symphysis pubis in a vertical line from the&#xD;
      umbilicus, a third and a fourth are placed on opposite sides of the abdomen horizontal to the&#xD;
      umbilicus; the ground is placed on the upper right side. Women will be informed of the study&#xD;
      by posters and leaflets distributed during the antenatal period and on arrival at labor&#xD;
      wards. The inclusion criteria are singleton term pregnancies, spontaneous or&#xD;
      induced/augmented labor, cephalic presentation, &gt; 18 years of age, able to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent, no contraindications to internal FHR monitoring and no known&#xD;
      contraindication to vaginal delivery. Patients with risk factors for intrapartum hypoxia will&#xD;
      also be included. After giving written informed consent, women will be simultaneously&#xD;
      monitored with scalp electrode, Doppler, trans-abdominal ECG, abdominal EHG and TOCO, as soon&#xD;
      as internal monitoring is possible. The maternal abdominal skin will be prepared for low&#xD;
      impedance by gentle excoriation of the surface skin cells. Monitoring will be maintained&#xD;
      until as close to delivery as possible, and the three FHR signals will be conveyed to a&#xD;
      computer acquisition storage system for offline analysis. We aim a sample size of 100&#xD;
      participants. EHG and TOCO will be compared for signal loss, contraction frequency, and&#xD;
      contraction area. Transabdominal ECG and Doppler will be compared in terms of signal loss,&#xD;
      and with internal ECG regarding signal accuracy. The signal quality will be analysed&#xD;
      separately for each monitoring method for the time during which the FHR recorded. As the two&#xD;
      FHR modalities do not share a common time clock, synchronisation should be achieved by cross&#xD;
      correlating the two heart rate files and locating the peak correlation. The clinical&#xD;
      management of labour will be uniquely on the basis of external Doppler ultrasound CTG&#xD;
      recordings. Both signals will also be compared for coincidences with MHR determined by&#xD;
      maternal ECG with FHR determined by internal ECG. The abdominal fECG monitor calculates the&#xD;
      MHR as well as the FHR simultaneously. It uses the height and the width of the QRS complex,&#xD;
      both of which are linked to the size of the heart, to differentiate between the fetal and&#xD;
      maternal heart signals. Women will be encouraged to perform a sequence of standardized&#xD;
      exercises, in the presence of the investigator, and the periods when the mother is lying&#xD;
      down, sitting, standing and walking will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup analysis will be performed in the different stages of labour, particularly during&#xD;
      maternal pushing, as well as in women with different skin colour and body mass index&#xD;
      categories and in the different positions they adopt. Both umbilical cord arterial and venous&#xD;
      blood sampling will be performed for the diagnosis of newborn metabolic acidosis, as soon as&#xD;
      possible after birth. Data on basic demographic characteristics, pregnancy complications,&#xD;
      course of labor, and neonatal outcome will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, we want to know if the different traces acquired from the&#xD;
      same fetus through transabdominal ECG and Doppler CTG may have different interpretations and&#xD;
      may lead to different obstetric attitudes. In order to do that we will retrospectively&#xD;
      analyze all the independent traces through a computer analysis (Omniview-SisPorto program).&#xD;
      This system emits visual and sound alerts when features associated with poor fetal&#xD;
      oxygenation are detected and has been shown to provide analysis that is in good agreement&#xD;
      with a consensus of experts. The main outcome will be the agreement of alerts displayed by&#xD;
      each signal acquisition technique regarding the same fetus.&#xD;
