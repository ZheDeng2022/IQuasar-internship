      Purpose: To conduct a randomized controlled pilot study investigating the use of high dose&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) thiamine to prevent delirium and mitigate the long-term effects of delirium,&#xD;
      including health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      outcomes, in patients admitted to University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospital for allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 60 adult inpatients admitted to the UNC Bone Marrow Transplant Unit for&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participants will be admitted for allogeneic HSCT and on the day after&#xD;
      transplant randomized to seven days of high dose IV thiamine or placebo. Thiamine levels will&#xD;
      be measured weekly and participants will be assessed for evidence of delirium using validated&#xD;
      measures. Validated measures will also be used to assess cognitive function, depression,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress symptoms, functional status, and HRQOL prior to hospitalization and at&#xD;
      one, three, and six months after transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common and potentially preventable neuropsychiatric complication in cancer&#xD;
      patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that has profound&#xD;
      consequences. Among cancer patients hospitalized for HSCT, delirium occurs in approximately&#xD;
      40% of patients and increases the risk of mortality. Long-term, delirium in this population&#xD;
      results in worse physical health, mental health, and quality of life. Though strategies to&#xD;
      prevent delirium have the potential to significantly improve the lives of people living with&#xD;
      cancer, research in this area is extremely limited. Thiamine deficiency is also ubiquitous&#xD;
      during HSCT and a known contributor to the development of delirium in other patient&#xD;
      populations. High dose intravenous (IV) thiamine is an evidence-based and promising treatment&#xD;
      for delirium, but no one has studied IV thiamine as a prevention strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial in participants undergoing allogeneic HSCT&#xD;
      to determine if high dose IV thiamine can prevent delirium and minimize the deleterious&#xD;
      impact of delirium on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, and other&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric outcomes. The investigators will recruit 60 patients admitted for allogeneic&#xD;
      HSCT at UNC, randomize them to treatment with high dose IV thiamine (n = 30) versus placebo&#xD;
      (n = 30), and systematically evaluate all participants for delirium and related&#xD;
      comorbidities. The investigators will use the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) to measure the&#xD;
      severity and duration of delirium immediately prior to transplant and after HSCT until 30&#xD;
      days post-transplant or discharge. If delirium is identified, the DRS will be administered&#xD;
      daily until delirium resolves. The investigators will obtain thiamine levels and other&#xD;
      laboratory parameters associated with delirium the day after transplant, and continue to&#xD;
      monitor thiamine levels weekly thereafter. The investigators will also monitor HRQOL,&#xD;
      functional status, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and cognitive function prior&#xD;
      to transplant and at one, three, and six months after transplant to elucidate the persistent&#xD;
      impact of delirium in this population and the potential for thiamine to mitigate these&#xD;
      negative outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Delirium incidence will be measured using the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). The DRS is a is a 10-item, clinician-rated scale that rates the severity of delirium symptoms over a 24-hour period using all available information from the patient interview, mental status examination, medical history and tests, nursing observations, and family reports. The maximum possible score is 32. Higher scores suggest more severe symptoms. A cut-off score of &gt; 12 has been suggested to distinguish patients with delirium from patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders.

The maximum possible score is 32. Higher scores suggest more severe symptoms. A cut-off score of &gt; 12 has been suggested to distinguish patients with delirium from patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Delirium incidence will be defined as at least one assessment with DRS &gt; 12.</description>

        <title>Delirium Duration</title>
        <description>Delirium duration will be measured using the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS). The DRS is a is a 10-item, clinician-rated scale that rates the severity of delirium symptoms over a 24-hour period using all available information from the patient interview, mental status examination, medical history and tests, nursing observations, and family reports. The maximum possible score is 32. Higher scores suggest more severe symptoms. A cut-off score of &gt; 12 has been suggested to distinguish patients with delirium from patients with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Delirium duration will be reported as number of consecutive days during which DRS &gt; 12.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessments will occur in the week prior to transplant, then 3 times weekly post-transplant until 30 days post-transplant or discharge, whichever comes first.</time_frame>

        <description>HRQOL will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT). The FACT-BMT is a 47-item self-administered assessment which asks individuals to rate questions related to physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being on a 5-point Likert Scale (0, not at all to 4, very much). Scores are summed across the items, resulting in a score from 0 to 148, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Negative change scores indicate worse HRQOL with time.</description>

        <title>Change in Depression Scores (Month 1)</title>
        <description>Depression will be assessed using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Depression (PROMIS-D) 8a short form. Scores for all PROMIS measures are reported on the T-score metric in which the mean=50 and standard deviation (SD) = 10 are centered on the general population means. Higher scores represent greater degrees of mood symptoms. Positive change scores indicate worse mood over time.</description>
