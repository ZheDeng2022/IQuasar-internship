    <textblock>
      Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy of INVAC-1, a DNA plasmid encoding a modified human&#xD;
      telomerase reverse transcriptas (hTERT) protein, at a dose of 800 µg for 6 cycles 4 weeks&#xD;
      apart on Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) eradication rate in the bone marrow, either as a&#xD;
      single agent in a high risk &quot;watch and wait&quot; group (group 1 - 42 patients) or in combination&#xD;
      with ibrutinib (group 2 - 42 patients), in patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics and safety will also be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a phase II, open label, single-arm trial of INVAC-1 at a dose of 800 µg in&#xD;
      patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to achieve MRD negativity in each group. 42 patients are to&#xD;
      be included in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Untreated high risk &quot;watch and wait&quot; Newly diagnosed patients not eligible for any&#xD;
      approved treatment (using NCI Working Group criteria), but having some poor prognosis&#xD;
      characteristics (defined by MD Anderson Cancer Center nomogram criteria). Patients will be&#xD;
      treated by INVAC-1 for 6 doses at 4-week intervals and then MRD will be assessed. Patients&#xD;
      will subsequently be managed as per usual care. For MRD negative patients after INVAC-1 who&#xD;
      become MRD+ during follow-up, INVAC-1 can be resumed for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Ibrutinib treated patients Patients who are receiving ibrutinib as 1st or 2nd line&#xD;
      treatment. After at least 12 months of ibrutinib, patients will be assessed for MRD.&#xD;
      MRD-positive patients will be treated with ibrutinib + INVAC-1 for 6 months and at the end of&#xD;
      the combined treatment period, MRD will be assessed. MRD-negative patients (defined as &lt;0.01%&#xD;
      of CLL cells in total cells analyzed) will have the option to stop or continue ibrutinib.&#xD;
      Then, they will be followed-up regularly for two years. Patients who become MRD-positive&#xD;
      after being MRD-negative will resume ibrutinib single agent.&#xD;
