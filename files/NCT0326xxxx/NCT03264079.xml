  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study the impact of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence crossover pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a screening visit within 28 days of Study Day 1. Subjects must qualify&#xD;
      for the study based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. For Period 1, all qualified subjects&#xD;
      shall receive a single oral dose of bardoxolone methyl (10 mg) on Day 1. For Period 2,&#xD;
      following a washout of 14 days, itraconazole (SPORANOX®) capsules (100 mg) will be&#xD;
      administered as a 200-mg single daily dose on Study Days 15 through 27, with bardoxolone&#xD;
      methyl (10 mg) administered on Day 18 (1 hour after itraconazole administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bardoxolone methyl doses will be administered under fasted conditions. Itraconazole will be&#xD;
      administered under fed conditions on Study Days 15-17, and Study Days 19-27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study Day 18, itraconazole will be administered under fasted conditions. Subjects will be&#xD;
      confined beginning on Study Day -1 through the last blood sample collection on Study Day 9&#xD;
      during Period 1, and from Study Day 14 through the last PK blood draw on Study Day 28 during&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;
