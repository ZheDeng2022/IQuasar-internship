      This study is a Phase II controlled clinical trial that will obtain comprehensive, serial&#xD;
      assessments of respiratory muscle strength and architecture to understand the evolution of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill children, and test whether a&#xD;
      novel computer-based approach (Real-time Effort Driven ventilator management (REDvent)) can&#xD;
      preserve respiratory muscle strength and reduce time on MV. REDvent offers systematic&#xD;
      recommendations to reduce controlled ventilation during the acute phase of MV, and uses&#xD;
      real-time measures from esophageal manometry to adjust supported ventilator pressures such&#xD;
      that patient effort of breathing remains in a normal range during the ventilator weaning&#xD;
      phase. This phase II clinical trial is expected to enroll 276 children with pulmonary&#xD;
      parenchymal disease, anticipated to be ventilated &gt; 48 hrs. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      REDvent-acute vs. usual care for the acute phase of MV (interval from intubation to first&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)). Patients in either group who fail their first Spontaneous&#xD;
      Breathing Trial (SBT), will also be randomized to REDvent-weaning vs. usual care for the&#xD;
      weaning phase of MV (interval from first SBT to passing SBT). The primary clinical outcome is&#xD;
      length of weaning (time from first SBT until successful passage of an SBT or extubation&#xD;
      (whichever comes first)). Mechanistic outcomes surround multi-modal serial measures of&#xD;
      respiratory muscle capacity (PiMax), load (resistance, compliance), effort (esophageal&#xD;
      manometry), and architecture (ultrasound) throughout the course of MV. Upon completion, this&#xD;
      study will provide important information on the pathogenesis and timing of respiratory muscle&#xD;
      weakness during MV in children and whether this weakness can be mitigated by promoting more&#xD;
      normal patient effort during MV via the use of REDvent. This will form the basis for a&#xD;
      larger, Phase III multi-center study, powered for key clinical outcomes such as 28-day&#xD;
      Ventilator Free Days.&#xD;

      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1: To determine if REDvent acute and/or weaning phase protocols can shorten the duration of&#xD;
      weaning from MV (Primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: To determine if changes to direct measures of respiratory muscle strength, load, effort,&#xD;
      and architecture throughout the duration of MV are related to weaning outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3: To determine if patient effort of breathing during both acute and weaning phases of MV&#xD;
      is independently associated with the development of respiratory muscle weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Single-center randomized controlled trial (138 children per arm) using REDvent&#xD;
      (intervention arm) as compared with usual care ventilator management including a standardized&#xD;
      daily SBT (control arm). Acute phase randomization will occur upon study enrollment, and&#xD;
      patients who fail the first SBT will undergo a weaning phase randomization. The investigators&#xD;
      will obtain serial measurements of respiratory system capacity, load, effort of breathing,&#xD;
      and diaphragm architecture throughout the course of MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Phase: The acute phase is defined as the time from intubation until the patient meets&#xD;
      weaning criteria, passes the initial oxygenation test (decrease PEEP to 5 cmH2O and FiO2 to&#xD;
      0.5, maintains SpO2 &gt; 90%), and undergoes a Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention Arm (REDvent-acute): Patients will be managed with pressure control plus&#xD;
           pressure support ventilation using a computerized decision support tool that will&#xD;
           recommend changes to ventilator settings approximately every 4 hr (with or without a new&#xD;
           blood gas). If the patient is spontaneously breathing, it will incorporate real-time&#xD;
           measures of effort of breathing (esophageal manometry) to keep it in a target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Arm (Control-acute): Ventilator management will be per usual care until the&#xD;
           patient meets weaning criteria and passes the oxygenation test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning Phase: The weaning phase is defined as the time from the first Spontaneous Breathing&#xD;
      Trial (SBT) until the patient successfully passes an SBT or is extubated (whichever comes&#xD;
      first). Patients who pass the initial SBT at the end of the acute phase will not undergo&#xD;
      weaning phase randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention Arm (REDvent-weaning): Patients will be managed in a pressure support/CPAP&#xD;
           mode of ventilation with assessments or changes to the level of pressure support every 4&#xD;
           hours, targeting maintaining effort of breathing (esophageal manometry) in a normal&#xD;
           range. An SBT will be conducted daily, and the weaning phase will continue until the&#xD;
           patient passes the SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Arm (Control-weaning): Ventilator management will be per usual care. An SBT will&#xD;
           be conducted daily, and the weaning phase will continue until the patient passes the&#xD;
           SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan and Sample Size Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The primary outcome is weaning duration. Sample size has been determined to adequately&#xD;
      power 3 separate comparative analyses: (a) REDvent-acute versus Acute Phase control (b)&#xD;
      REDvent-weaning phase versus Weaning Phase control (c) REDvent both phases versus control&#xD;
      both phases. Power is based on 2 planned methods for analysis: cox proportional hazard ratios&#xD;
      for multivariable analysis and univariate analysis with an independent t-test using log&#xD;
      transformation (as needed) to account for the expected distribution of weaning duration. For&#xD;
      all three of the planned comparisons above, with the proposed sample size the investigators&#xD;
      would be adequately powered (&gt;0.8) to detect a difference in weaning duration of ≥ 1 day, or&#xD;
      a hazard ratio of ≥ 1.4 between groups. The secondary outcomes are ventilator free days and&#xD;
      extubation failure. Directly comparing control only patients to REDvent only patients, with&#xD;
      an expected standard deviation for VFDs between 5 to 9 days, the investigators will be able&#xD;
      to detect a 2-day change in VFDs between groups with a power between 0.35 and 0.82.&#xD;
      Re-intubation rates are expected to be 10%, allowing the investigators to confirm that&#xD;
      REDvent is not inferior to usual care in regards to re-intubation with a non-inferiority&#xD;
      margin of 0.10 with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The primary outcome of this aim is weaning duration. For respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
      the investigators will compare the first measured aPiMax (after resolution of the acute&#xD;
      phase, before the first SBT), the trajectory and value of the daily aPiMax during the weaning&#xD;
      phase prior to extubation, the lowest and highest measured aPiMax, and aPiMax on the day of&#xD;
      extubation against weaning duration. For analysis, aPiMax will be dichotomized at 30 cmH2O,&#xD;
      and weaning duration will be compared between patients with aPiMax &gt; 30 versus ≤ 30 cmH2O&#xD;
      using a t-test with or without log-transformation, or Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the&#xD;
      distribution. From preliminary data, it is anticipated at least 35% of patients (n=84) will&#xD;
      have aPiMax ≤ 30 cmH2O. Based on a similar power analysis as presented above, this would&#xD;
      allow the investigators to determine whether low aPiMax is associated with a ≥ 1-day increase&#xD;
      in weaning duration, with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      identical analysis for ePiMax. Diaphragm Thickness analysis will compound daily ultrasound&#xD;
      measures to detect the relative change in diaphragm thickness from study day 1 until passage&#xD;
      of an SBT. The investigators will compare the change in thickness after resolution of the&#xD;
      acute phase (on the day of the first SBT) against weaning duration, in a similar manner as&#xD;
      proposed above for aPiMax. In addition to weaning duration, the investigators will also&#xD;
      examine whether the respiratory measures taken just prior to or during each SBT are&#xD;
      associated with the patient passing the SBT. For example with aPiMax and ePiMax, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine if there is a dose response relationship between PiMax measured&#xD;
      just before the SBT and the rate of passage of the subsequent SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The primary outcome of this aim is aPiMax &lt; 30 cmH2O.The analysis will focus on&#xD;
      determining whether the degree of patient effort of breathing is independently associated&#xD;
      with the development of respiratory muscle weakness. For the acute phase, the investigators&#xD;
      will generate a time-weighted average PRP during the acute phase and graph it against aPiMax&#xD;
      at the first SBT. They will subsequently dichotomize aPiMax at the first SBT and compare mean&#xD;
      time weighted average PRP in the acute phase between aPiMax groups (&gt; 30 vs. ≤ 30 cmH2O). For&#xD;
      the weaning phase, the investigators will graph the changes in aPiMax throughout the weaning&#xD;
      phase (from first failed SBT until successful SBT) against time-weighted average PRP, with&#xD;
      the anticipation that low PRP will be associated with either further reductions in aPiMax, or&#xD;
      no improvement, while PRP in the physiologic range of 150-400 will be associated with&#xD;
      improvement in aPiMax. The investigators will subsequently dichotomize aPiMax (at 30 cm H2O)&#xD;
      at the time of successful passage of an SBT and compare time-weighted average PRP in the&#xD;
      weaning phase between aPiMax groups. Subsequently, the investigators will build a&#xD;
      multivariable logistic regression model on the outcome of aPiMax ≤ 30 cmH2O to determine if&#xD;
      time-weighted PRP in the acute phase, weaning phase or both have an independent association&#xD;
      with preserving aPiMax, after controlling for confounding variables.&#xD;
