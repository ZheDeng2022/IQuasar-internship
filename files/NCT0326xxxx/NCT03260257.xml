    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia affects 2.4 million Americans and causes significant individual and societal&#xD;
      costs. Cognitive deficits including poor working memory arise early in the course of illness,&#xD;
      account for poor long-term outcomes and have been difficult to treat with available&#xD;
      treatments. The investigators are proposing to develop a novel, computer-based brain training&#xD;
      to improve working memory in schizophrenia patients, which, if successful could have&#xD;
      significant personal, societal, and economic impact.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic debilitating mental disorder that affects 2.4 million&#xD;
      Americans and leads to considerable individual and societal costs. In patients with SCZ,&#xD;
      cognitive deficits (CD) occur early in the course of the illness, are associated with more&#xD;
      severe illness, and are the best predictor of functional outcomes. Nonetheless, to date, CD&#xD;
      have been difficult to treat using available treatments. Recent studies suggest CD in&#xD;
      patients with SCZ may arise from abnormal synchronization of distributed neural networks.&#xD;
      Synchronization or synchronous firing of neurons, binds cortical areas into functional&#xD;
      networks in a task and state-dependent manner. Thus novel therapies that improve abnormal&#xD;
      neural synchrony may improve previously refractory symptoms arising from disordered brain&#xD;
      networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural synchrony or coherence in the gamma band (GBR, 30-45Hz) plays a central role in&#xD;
      top-down attention, multisensory processing, perceptual binding and working memory (WM).&#xD;
      Patients with SCZ exhibit abnormal GBR, and the magnitude of impairment is associated with&#xD;
      the severity of cognitive disorganization. Given these results, improving GBR should improve&#xD;
      CD, including WM in SCZ. This hypothesis has been tested and confirmed using repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Additionally, EEG-based neurofeedback (NFB) is&#xD;
      hypothesized to improve GBR and cognitive function in patients with SCZ. NFB is a low-cost,&#xD;
      easily administered and well-tolerated treatment. In healthy controls, Gamma-NFB improves GBR&#xD;
      and cognitive function including WM. Thus, the investigators propose testing the feasibility&#xD;
      and effectiveness of improving GBR using gamma-NFB in patients with SCZ using the framework&#xD;
      of the R61/R33 mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first trial (R61) is a proof-of-concept study designed to assess target engagement and&#xD;
      dose response curve. Thirty SCZ patients will receive G-NFB training for 12 weeks (2 weekly&#xD;
      sessions of 30minute duration) and be assessed for 1) evidence of training, 2) Change in GBR,&#xD;
      3) Change in WM and 4) Change in community functioning. The second trial (R33) aims to&#xD;
      confirm target engagement based on training parameters obtained from R61, and to assess&#xD;
      whether G-NFB is superior to an active-placebo neurofeedback intervention in improving GBR,&#xD;
      WM and community functioning.&#xD;
