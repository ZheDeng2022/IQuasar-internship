  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed studies is to examine a reading intervention for fourth grade&#xD;
      students with reading difficulties that integrate work in mindset (beliefs about whether&#xD;
      abilities are innate or can be developed) with the academic component of reading.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will examine the extent to which integrating mindset&#xD;
      intervention improves student response to reading intervention. The investigators will use&#xD;
      previous research in intensive reading intervention for students with reading difficulties in&#xD;
      the upper elementary grades to examine an intervention that addresses reading skill deficits,&#xD;
      while also providing mindset training along with (Study 1) or embedded in (Study 2) the&#xD;
      reading intervention. It is hypothesized that students in the reading intervention with&#xD;
      mindset conditions will improve their reading outcomes more than students in the reading&#xD;
      intervention only and business as usual groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed studies is to examine a reading intervention for fourth grade&#xD;
      students with RD that integrates the psychosocial component of mindset with the academic&#xD;
      component of reading. Specifically, the investigators will examine the extent to which&#xD;
      integrating mindset intervention improves student response to reading intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will use previous research in intensive reading intervention for students with&#xD;
      RD in the upper elementary grades to examine an intervention that addresses reading skill&#xD;
      deficits, while providing mindset training along with (Study 1) or embedded in (Study 2) the&#xD;
      reading intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the effects of intensive reading intervention with mindset&#xD;
      training (Reading Intervention Plus Mindset) relative to reading intervention alone and&#xD;
      business as usual comparison on the academic outcomes of fourth grade students with or&#xD;
      at-risk for reading disabilities. The proposed study will target students with or at-risk for&#xD;
      reading disabilities in fourth grade to examine the effects of reading intervention with&#xD;
      mindset training relative to reading intervention alone and business as usual comparison on&#xD;
      students' mindset, general academic achievement, phonological awareness, word reading,&#xD;
      fluency, and reading comprehension outcomes. Students will be randomly assigned to condition&#xD;
      with students in the Reading Intervention Plus Mindset condition receiving the mindset&#xD;
      training along with their reading intervention. Students assigned to the Reading Intervention&#xD;
      will receive the same reading intervention but without the mindset training. Students in the&#xD;
      Business as Usual condition will continue to receive their typical school services which will&#xD;
      be carefully documented. It is hypothesized that students in the Reading Intervention Plus&#xD;
      Mindset condition will improve their reading outcomes more than students in the Reading&#xD;
      Intervention only and Business as Usual groups by continuing to develop a growth mindset to&#xD;
      work through the challenges in their reading development and, thus, being able to progress&#xD;
      more efficiently in the reading intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To determine the effects of embedding mindset training in an intensive&#xD;
      reading intervention on the mindset and academic outcomes of fourth grade students with or&#xD;
      at-risk for reading disabilities. The proposed study will use the results from Specific Aim 1&#xD;
      to further examine the effects of an intensive reading intervention with mindset embedded in&#xD;
      the content with a new cohort of fourth grade students with or at-risk for reading&#xD;
      disabilities. Embedding mindset practices directly in the content area of difficulty for&#xD;
      students with learning difficulties could be more powerful than separate mindset training.&#xD;
      Students will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (Embedded or Business as Usual).&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the effects of intervention on students' mindset, word&#xD;
      reading, fluency, and reading comprehension measures. It is hypothesized that embedding&#xD;
      mindset training directly in the reading content will further improve student reading&#xD;
      outcomes by allowing students to directly apply a growth mindset to their work in the area of&#xD;
      difficulty, reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To link student characteristics to response to intervention. The proposed&#xD;
      study will link students' initial reading achievement, initial mindset, vocabulary ability,&#xD;
      behavior/attention as well as race, sex, socioeconomic status, and parents' educational&#xD;
      background to student response to intervention. It is hypothesized that students with lower&#xD;
      initial reading achievement, higher initial levels of fixed mindset, higher vocabulary, lower&#xD;
      parent educational background or socioeconomic status, and/or higher levels of problem&#xD;
      behavior/attention initially will benefit more from the mindset intervention, particularly&#xD;
      the embedded mindset intervention. It is hypothesized that no differences based on gender or&#xD;
      race.&#xD;
