      Fever is one of most common presenting complaints in clinics in tropical countries.&#xD;
      Rickettsial infections, enteric fever and leptospirosis are common and important causes of&#xD;
      undifferentiated fever in Southeast Asia. Scrub typhus is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi&#xD;
      and humans are typically infected by a bite of an infected chigger (trombiculid mite larva).&#xD;
      Clinical diagnosis is unreliable for identifying scrub typhus, unless a tick eschar is&#xD;
      present which is almost pathognomonic for the disease in Southeast Asia. A combination of&#xD;
      culture, paired serology and PCR has been proposed as the gold-standard method for detection.&#xD;
      As a result laboratory confirmation is not widely available and the diagnosis is missed&#xD;
      frequently in clinical practice. Some progress has been made in developing such a test and&#xD;
      one promising candidate is the Scrub Typhus Detect IgM Rapid Test (InBios International Inc).&#xD;
      We plan to use to this test in this study to estimate the prevalence of scrub typhus in&#xD;
      selected febrile patients presenting to clinics in Myanmar .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for one week to check for resolution of symptoms.&#xD;

      Title: A multicenter observational study to describe the prevalence of scrub typhus defined&#xD;
      as s positive rapid diagnostic test among selected patients presenting with fever to clinics&#xD;
      in Myanmar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational and objectives of the study Fever is one of most common presenting complaints in&#xD;
      clinics in tropical countries. Rickettsial infections, enteric fever and leptospirosis are&#xD;
      common and important causes of undifferentiated fever in Southeast Asia. The largest and&#xD;
      earliest reports of scrub typhus in Myanmar were made during World War II when this disease&#xD;
      afflicted numerous troops, particularly those serving close to the border with India. Scrub&#xD;
      typhus is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and humans are typically infected by a bite of an&#xD;
      infected chigger (trombiculid mite larva). Clinical diagnosis is unreliable for identifying&#xD;
      scrub typhus, unless a tick eschar is present which is almost pathognomonic for the disease&#xD;
      in Southeast Asia. A combination of culture, paired serology and PCR has been proposed as the&#xD;
      gold-standard method for detection. As a result laboratory confirmation is not widely&#xD;
      available and the diagnosis is missed frequently in clinical practice. Some progress has been&#xD;
      made in developing such a test and one promising candidate is the Scrub Typhus Detect IgM&#xD;
      Rapid Test (InBios International Inc). In laboratory-based evaluations using stored sera&#xD;
      collected from patients recruited in a study in Thailand with confirmed scrub typhus this&#xD;
      test had a sensitivity of ~80% for the detection of the disease compared to serological&#xD;
      methods. We plan to use to this test in this study to estimate the prevalence of scrub typhus&#xD;
      in selected febrile patients presenting to clinics in Myanmar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To describe the prevalence of scrub typhus defined as a positive rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic test among selected patients presenting with fever to clinics in Myanmar&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess inter-observer agreement when interpreting the tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the ease-of-use of the tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To direct future research efforts into rickettsial disease in Myanmar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To raise awareness of the presence of scrub typhus in Myanmar Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Male or female &gt;1 year of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Fever defined as &gt; 38 °C tympanic temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Duration of fever &gt;48h&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Written informed consent (by legally acceptable representative in case of&#xD;
                children), and assent for children age 10-17 year&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Eschar (60 patients only) Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria confirmed by RTD or microscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin/soft tissue infection, dysentery or urinary tract infection probable cause of fever&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Methodology The study will be carried out to describe the prevalence of scrub&#xD;
      typhus defined as a positive rapid diagnostic test among patients presenting with fever to&#xD;
      six participating clinics in Myanmar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients coming with fever to participating clinics will be routinely assessment by attending&#xD;
      physician. Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study will be&#xD;
      invited and enrolled to the study after getting informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid diagnostic test and laboratory procedure A scrub typhus rapid test will be performed on&#xD;
      site by using the InBios Scrub Typhus Detect IgM Rapid Test. Tests will be read by two&#xD;
      independent readers and results recorded as positive, negative or invalid. In case of invalid&#xD;
      test result, another test will be performed using a new test strip. If there is any&#xD;
      disagreement between two readers, the lead investigator at the site will decide the test&#xD;
      result and the test will be photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a skin eschar a sterile surgical blade will be used to gently scrape the&#xD;
      surface of the eschar. Scrapings will be stored in a cryotube containing 95% ethanol and&#xD;
      stored at -80°C for future analysis (PCR genotyping ± whole genome sequencing) to confirm the&#xD;
      presence of Orientia tsutsugamushi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Physicians will be advised to formulate a treatment plan according to their usual&#xD;
      practice but it will be recommended that treatment for scrub typhus be added to the regimen&#xD;
      if the test is positive i.e. doxycycline 100mg bd for seven days in adults or 4mg/kg day in&#xD;
      two divided doses in children older than eight years. Doxycycline is contraindicated in&#xD;
      pregnant women and children eight years old or below and these groups should be prescribed&#xD;
      azithromycin (500mg single dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Patients will be reassessed at one week to check for resolution of fever and&#xD;
      symptoms . Any patient with ongoing symptoms will be re-assessed by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and Study Sites Patients will be recruited 1 year starting from December 2017 to&#xD;
      November 2018 in six sites: Yae township hospital, No.2, 1000 Bedded Military Hospital (Nay&#xD;
      Pyi Taw), No.20, 100 Bedded Military Hospital (Tha Beik Kyin), NAP-MAM clinics (Kawkareik and&#xD;
      Putao township), No.2, 300 Bedded Military Hospital (Ann, Rakhine State).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and benefits This is a low risk study. Finger prick for RDT and scrapping from eschar&#xD;
      (for patients who have eschar) may cause slight discomfort. Some patients may receive&#xD;
      antibiotics they would not have otherwise been prescribed as a result of having the test.&#xD;
      However this is most likely to benefit them as these tests have been shown to be sensitive&#xD;
      and specific for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in similar settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incentives and Compensation There will be no incentives or compensation for study&#xD;
      participation. Confidentiality The study will ensure that the participants' anonymity is&#xD;
      maintained. The participants will be identified only by initials and a study number on the&#xD;
      CRF and the study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication The research findings will be disseminated to policy-makers and other interested&#xD;
      parties inside Myanmar. If there are any publications resulting from the results all those&#xD;
      who have made a substantial contribution will be co-authors.&#xD;
