&#xD;
               -  Patient has life threatening hypertriglyceridemia and has had &gt;8 episodes of&#xD;
                  pancreatitis, requiring weekly plasmapaheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has Type 1 diabetes melltus with HbA1c &gt; 10%. Age and Reproductive Status&#xD;

             lesions, determined as part of a screening comprehensive skin evaluation performed by&#xD;
             a qualified dermatologist. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening&#xD;
             period will be biopsied and results known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the&#xD;
             pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient may need to be excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
