  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the utility of Brain Network Activation (BNA)&#xD;
      analysis in patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BNA technology is based on a network model to depict functional connectivity. The descriptive&#xD;
      network model approach provides insights regarding inter-connectivity of brain networks and&#xD;
      can describe the temporal-spatial brain activation patterns applied to various types of&#xD;
      data-sets including EEG, MEG and fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it is proposed that synchronization in brain activity may be disrupted in&#xD;
      patients who experience frequent seizures and may correspond to functional impairments (e.g.,&#xD;
      memory, processing speed). As such, BNA analysis may provide additional data that complement&#xD;
      current functional assessments, inform clinical assessment and management of epilepsy, and&#xD;
      identify subgroups of patients that might be at risk for poor treatment outcomes.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited from the long-term EEG monitoring floor and outpatient EEG&#xD;
        laboratory. Controls will be recruited in response to advertisements. All participants will&#xD;
        be given the BNA Auditory Go/NoGo task. Patient identity will be coded with a master record&#xD;
        kept on a password protected computer in the laboratory. Deidentified data will be sent to&#xD;
        ElMindA for scoring of the BNA test. Patient data from electronic medical records will be&#xD;
        extracted along with patient MRI data processed.&#xD;
