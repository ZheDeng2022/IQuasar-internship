  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people develop chronic abdominal pain with diarrhea or constipation after an episode of&#xD;
      acute bacterial gastroenteritis. These symptoms can be consistent with post-infectious&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and can last long after the acute infection is over. The exact&#xD;
      reason why certain individuals develop these symptoms whereas others don't is not exactly&#xD;
      clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are studying changes in gastrointestinal permeability (movement of contents&#xD;
      across the lining of the intestine) and transit (movement of food through the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract). The researchers are also studying if there are any genetic risk&#xD;
      factors that are associated with development of this disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6&#xD;
      Americans (or 48 million people) contact food-borne illnesses. The CDC also estimates that&#xD;
      between 20 and 40% of individuals traveling to a developing country get traveler's diarrhea.&#xD;
      There is morbidity from these illnesses, even after the acute episode is over. Thus, up to a&#xD;
      third of patients suffering from acute infectious gastroenteritis (IGE), most often resulting&#xD;
      from a food-borne outbreak or travel develop chronic gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses such as&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In addition, recent studies are suggesting that military&#xD;
      personnel who suffered from IGE during deployment are more likely to suffer from IBS&#xD;
      post-deployment. This disorder has been described as post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with PI-IBS suffer from recurrent, debilitating abdominal pain and altered bowel&#xD;
      function (diarrhea and/or constipation) and symptoms can be present for over 8 years after&#xD;
      the acute IGE episode is over. It is estimated that up to 15% of the United States population&#xD;
      suffers from IBS. This disorder creates significant impact on patient's daily functioning,&#xD;
      overall quality of life and causes loss of work productivity. Despite the impact of this&#xD;
      illness, treatment options for IBS have limited success, with a significant unmet need. Lack&#xD;
      of understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms has hampered development of&#xD;
      effective treatment. More studies are required to enhance understanding of this disorder.&#xD;
      Development of PI-IBS after an episode of acute IGE serves as a unique model to study&#xD;
      risk-factors and mechanisms underlying PI-IBS and IBS in general. The researchers propose to&#xD;
      study the epidemiological risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      development of IBS among individuals suffering from episodes of acute IGE in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormalities of GI motility, sensation, mucosal defense,&#xD;
      immune function and psychosocial factors. The researchers propose to investigate overall risk&#xD;
      and patient demographic, pathogen and illness related characteristics as predictors for&#xD;
      development of PI-IBS among patients who had suffered from acute IGE. In addition, the&#xD;
      researchers want to determine pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the development of&#xD;
      this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve these goals, the researchers propose to establish collaboration with the&#xD;
      Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) which conducts active surveillance for bacterial and&#xD;
      parasitic cases of acute IGE and other reportable illnesses in Minnesota, as part of the&#xD;
      mandate to detecting outbreaks and prioritize control efforts. We plan to establish&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective cohorts in this proposal. A randomly selected sub-set of these&#xD;
      patients will be invited to Mayo Clinic for detailed investigations including assessment of&#xD;
      GI motility, permeability, endoscopic examination for colon biopsies, and diverse blood and&#xD;
      stool assays using techniques that are all validated to provide information about the&#xD;
      mechanism of PI-IBS. The researchers will also investigate variations in the barrier function&#xD;
      pathway genes in tissues of PI-IBS patients and to understand the contribution of these&#xD;
      genetic variations in immune activation and control of barrier function to increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to PI-IBS.&#xD;

    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>
