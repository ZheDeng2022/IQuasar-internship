      Horizontal strabismus includes esotropia and exotropia where there is inward or outward&#xD;
      deviation of visual axes of the eyes respectively. The most common initial treatment of&#xD;
      horizontal strabismus is either bilateral rectus muscle recessions or unilateral recession&#xD;
      resection surgery. For large angle deviations (&gt;50 prism diopters [PD]), surgery on 2 muscles&#xD;
      alone may not be adequate with high reoperation rates. Approaches to these patients included&#xD;
      large bilateral muscle recessions, supramaximal unilateral recession resection procedure,&#xD;
      three or four horizontal muscle surgery, or botulinum toxin augmented surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin augmentated strabismus surgery was reported in several studies. Owens et&#xD;
      al.reported successful botulinum toxin augmentation of monocular recession-resection&#xD;
      surgeries in 3 large-angle exotropia patients with successful results in two of the 3&#xD;
      patients. Khan reported 8 patients with &gt; 60 PD esotropia treated with botulinum-augmented&#xD;
      surgery. Six of 8 had deviations of 10 PD or less following surgery. Özkan et al used&#xD;
      botulinum augmentation in a group of older patients with large angle esotropia of different&#xD;
      etiologies, with a success rate of 57%. Lueder et al evaluated the long-term outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with infantile esotropia. The results were good, with a 74% success rate. Based on&#xD;
      historical comparisons, this technique appears equally as effective as 3- or 4-muscle surgery&#xD;
      and more effective than large bilateral medial rectus recessions alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, a prospective randomized study should be performed to more definitively determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of intraoperative botulinum toxin augmentation compared to surgery alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strabismus is defined as inability of the two eyes to align their visual axes to a common&#xD;
      object of regard. Horizontal strabismus may be in the form of esotropia or exotropia&#xD;
      depending on whether the visual axes and the eyes are converging or diverging respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple surgical techniques used to treat horizontal strabismus with the main goal&#xD;
      being to align the visual axes so that binocular vision may develop. The most common initial&#xD;
      treatment is either bilateral rectus muscle recessions or unilateral recession resection&#xD;
      surgery. For large angle deviations (&gt;50 prism diopters [PD]), surgery on 2 muscles alone may&#xD;
      not be adequate to correct the strabismus with high reoperation rates. Approaches to these&#xD;
      patients have included large bilateral muscle recessions, supramaximal unilateral recession&#xD;
      resection procedure, three or four horizontal muscle surgery, or botulinum toxin augmented&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin exerts its effect by interfering with release of acetylcholine at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction, thus inhibiting muscle contraction. Although the pharmacologic effect&#xD;
      of botulinum toxin is temporary, permanent results in patients with strabismus may occur.&#xD;
      These effects include a change in the length-tension curves of the muscles and permanent&#xD;
      changes in sarcomere density and myosin heavy chain composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin alone has been advocated by McNeer and associates as a primary treatment for&#xD;
      infantile esotropia in children with smaller angles of deviation. The advantage of this&#xD;
      approach is that incisional surgery is not required. However, it was found that botulinum&#xD;
      alone was less effective in establishing binocularity when compared to standard surgery. This&#xD;
      is likely because multiple injections are often needed, which prolongs the duration of&#xD;
      misalignment. On the other hand, the concomitant use of botulinum toxin and surgery allowed&#xD;
      for rapid establishment of alignment. Other advantages of botulinum augmentation are that&#xD;
      only 2 muscles are operated upon, thus decreasing anesthesia duration and the risk of&#xD;
      surgical complications, and the lateral rectus muscles are preserved for additional surgery,&#xD;
      if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin augmentation of strabismus surgery was reported in several previous studies.&#xD;
      Owens et al. reported the successful intraoperative use of botulinum toxin to augment&#xD;
      monocular recession-resection surgeries in three large-angle exotropia patients. Two of these&#xD;
      patients had orthotropia ±10 PD at their final examinations, while the third patient&#xD;
      demonstrated a stable 18 PD exotropia which was cosmetically satisfactory. Khan reported 8&#xD;
      patients with &gt; 60 PD esotropia treated with botulinum-augmented horizontal muscle surgery.&#xD;
      Six of 8 had deviations of 10 PD or less following surgery, with an average follow-up of 9&#xD;
      months. Özkan et al. used botulinum augmentation in a group of older patients (age range 5-50&#xD;
      years) with large-angle esotropia of different etiologies, with a success rate of 57% and an&#xD;
      average follow-up of 14 months. Minguini et al. compared the results of surgery alone versus&#xD;
      surgery plus treatment with botulinum toxin for treatment of 23 patient with large angle&#xD;
      strabismus. Lueder et al. evaluated the long-term outcomes in patients with infantile&#xD;
      esotropia who had been followed for more than 2 years after treatment. The results were good,&#xD;
      with a 74% success rate. This study demonstrated that this procedure is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for infants with large-angle infantile esotropia, with stable results over time2.&#xD;
      Based on historical comparisons, it appears equally as effective as 3- or 4-muscle surgery&#xD;
      and more effective than large bilateral medial rectus recessions alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, a prospective randomized study should be performed to more definitively determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the addition of intraoperative botulinum toxin compared to surgery&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
