      Purpose. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether lung ultrasound, in addition to&#xD;
      physical examination, leads to a reduction of the admission rate for acute decompensated&#xD;
      heart failure of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) followed in the outpatients heart&#xD;
      failure clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This is a prospective randomized study. The planned sample size consists of 440&#xD;
      patients with chronic HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: (1) male and female aged between 18 and 90 years (2) signed&#xD;
      written informed consent (3) history of HF for at least six months, (4) left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction &lt; 45%, (5) adequate medical therapy for HF for at least two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are: (1) concomitant enrollment in other clinical studies, or&#xD;
      treatment with experimental drugs or devices within 30 days of clinical assessment, (2)&#xD;
      inability to undergo to the planned follow-up and procedures (3) documented pulmonary&#xD;
      infections (3) interstitial lung disease and class 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      according to GOLD classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized in two groups: group A, patients undergoing to lung ultrasound and&#xD;
      physical examination; and group B, patients undergoing to physical examination only. Patients&#xD;
      are evaluated at baseline and after three months with medical history, Quality of Life test,&#xD;
      physical examination, blood sample for hematochemical (creatinine, electrolytes,&#xD;
      BNP/NTpro-BNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diuretic therapy is then optimized according to the presence and severity of B-lines in&#xD;
      group A and physical examination in group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients enrolled in group A undergo to a lung ultrasound examination to assess the&#xD;
      extent of pulmonary congestion, through its evidence of B-lines. B-lines originate from the&#xD;
      contrast between air-filled structures and water-thickened pulmonary interlobular septa. This&#xD;
      leads to linear echogenic vertical artefacts that spread from the pleural layers downwards in&#xD;
      the screen. The ultrasound examination is performed with a handheld echocardiography device.&#xD;
      The physician carries out a scan of the pulmonary fields, from basal towards mid and apical&#xD;
      fields, through the midaxillary line while the patient lies supine. The quantification of&#xD;
      B-lines is performed according to their extent over the lung fields. All the information are&#xD;
      recorded in dedicated forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are evaluated according to the following criteria. The primary end-point is a&#xD;
      significant reduction of hospitalizations for acute decompensated HF in group A during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. The secondary end-points are changes of NT-proBNP values, quality of life&#xD;
      test (QLT) score and cardiac mortality.&#xD;
