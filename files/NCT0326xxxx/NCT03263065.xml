      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of dietary fibre in human health is a topic of both debate and research.&#xD;
      Interpreting evidence is complicated by changes in the definition of fibre. In the UK the&#xD;
      Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has recently proposed a definition of &quot;all&#xD;
      carbohydrates that are neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and have a degree&#xD;
      of polymerisation of three or more monomeric units, plus lignin&quot;. They have also called for&#xD;
      further research into the physiological effects of fibre of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nottingham GI MRI group has been at the forefront of elucidating the effects of poorly&#xD;
      digested carbohydrates on gastrointestinal physiology. The investigators have published&#xD;
      techniques to measure free water in the small bowel and assessment of the physical form of&#xD;
      chyme in the colon using MR relaxometry. This includes the demonstration that fructose&#xD;
      ingestion on its own leads to increased free water in the small bowel compared to&#xD;
      co-ingestion with glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bran is often confused with dietary fibre. Although it contains fibre, the term actually&#xD;
      refers to the outer husk of seeds and grains. It has been shown to accelerate oro-caecal&#xD;
      transit (OCT) with scintigraphy. Bran can also be shown to increase small bowel water&#xD;
      content, possibly by mechanical stimulation, one of the most powerful stimuli for small&#xD;
      intestinal secretion, which may be a mechanism to prevent blockage. In the past bran's high&#xD;
      fibre content led to the hypothesis that its effect derived from holding water in the lumen&#xD;
      but a comparison study of 17 different fibres found an inverse relationship between their&#xD;
      water-holding properties and effect on faecal weight, with bran holding the least water but&#xD;
      inducing the largest weight changes. Rather, weight change appeared to relate to the amount&#xD;
      of undigested fibre present in the faeces and the associated changes in bacterial numbers,&#xD;
      which account for most of dry stool weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, psyllium husk contains a fibre that binds water effectively. On this basis it&#xD;
      has been used as a laxative for thousands of years. In fact, there is little evidence that&#xD;
      psyllium accelerates whole gut transit time as might be expected of a laxative. Work within&#xD;
      the investigating group has shown that psyllium increases water in both the small bowel and&#xD;
      the faeces, leading to softer, looser stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nopal is a Mexican dietary product derived from cactus. It contains a different mix of fibre,&#xD;
      2/3rds of which is insoluble like bran fibre and 1/3rd soluble like psyllium. It is the&#xD;
      subject of several health claims. The investigating group has recently been awarded a grant&#xD;
      by the Newton Fund, through the Medical Research council, to study its effects on gut&#xD;
      function. The aim of the Newton Fund is to stimulate collaborative research with&#xD;
      middle-income countries such as Mexico. Part of the project plan is to invite a Mexican&#xD;
      radiologist, Dr Alfonso Gil-Valadez, to Nottingham to learn about the MRI techniques used by&#xD;
      our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to gather pilot data on the effect of Nopal on intestinal water&#xD;
      content, in comparison to bran and psyllium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to gather pilot data on the change from baseline in small bowel&#xD;
      water content in healthy volunteers after a meal containing nopal, in comparison to meals&#xD;
      containing psyllium or bran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to gather pilot data on the effects of the fibre-containing&#xD;
      meals on the physical form of colonic chyme, colonic volume and breath markers of&#xD;
      fermentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meals will lead to differences in post-prandial water in the small bowel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meals will lead to differences in the post-prandial volume and physical composition&#xD;
      of chyme in the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meals will not lead to change in breath markers of fermentation.&#xD;
