  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who join a study in the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic (DTC) have tests. These&#xD;
      include blood draws and biopsies. Researchers collect data from these samples. Some people&#xD;
      take part in more than one study at the DTC. At this time, data are connected only with one&#xD;
      single study. Researchers want to access people s medical records. This will allow them to&#xD;
      link the research data from all their studies they have or will take part in. Researchers&#xD;
      also want to collect medical data about their diagnosis and treatment history. This will&#xD;
      allow them to see how their cancer reacted to different drugs over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enter people into a master protocol to connect research sample and treatment data across&#xD;
      DTC studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who are being evaluated or treated for cancer in the DTC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will allow researchers to look at all the data from their research samples. This&#xD;
      includes those from their current, past, and any future NIH studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will allow researchers to access some of their medical data. This includes age,&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment history, and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide no new samples.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research samples and data collected on a treatment-intent protocol are discrete items&#xD;
      associated with that protocol up until the patient comes off study, usually due to disease&#xD;
      progression. These data are not stored in the patient s medical records, but are essential to&#xD;
      understand tumor response to different drugs over time. Patients in the Developmental&#xD;
      Therapeutics Clinic (DTC) often start other clinical trials; this protocol provides a&#xD;
      mechanism to connect research data about that patient from one trial to the next as long as&#xD;
      the patient remains eligible and has given his or her informed consent. No new analysis will&#xD;
      be performed under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is research interest in collecting pre- and post-dose research biopsies and other&#xD;
      samples such as circulating tumor cells to measure dynamic drug-specific target effects&#xD;
      (e.g., changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage response, or&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic cell infiltration), and then to evaluate molecular changes before and&#xD;
      during disease progression to understand why the tumors initially respond but then became&#xD;
      resistant to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this, we will connect research results from consecutive trials with limited&#xD;
      patient information (age, gender, disease, prior therapies, protocol number/drug regimen,&#xD;
      response, and duration of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient who consents to participate in this non-treatment, longitudinal sample protocol&#xD;
      agrees to allow his or her Medical Record Number (MRN) to be used to track participation on&#xD;
      DTC clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be entered onto this &quot;master&quot; longitudinal protocol to connect research sample&#xD;
      and treatment data across consecutive DTC clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy samples collected at time of disease progression on one research trial will be&#xD;
      evaluated for use as the baseline sample for the next research trial, potentially obviating&#xD;
      the need for additional biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients who are being evaluated for and/or treated for cancer at the DTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No samples will be collected under this longitudinal protocol, no treatment decisions will be&#xD;
      made based on data collected, and no new analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens for research purposes, as outlined in this protocol, will be those obtained from&#xD;
      tests and procedures that are done as required by the primary research protocols that a given&#xD;
      patient is enrolled in. Tissue collected under DTC tissue procurement protocol 06-C-0213 will&#xD;
      not be used or tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample location and use will be managed in the Repository at the Frederick National&#xD;
      Laboratory for Cancer Research using LabMatrix software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may remain on this longitudinal protocol for the duration of their consent.&#xD;
