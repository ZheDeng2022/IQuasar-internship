  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The histaminergic system is phylogenetically one of the oldest parts of the nervous system&#xD;
      but it is a relatively recent discovery. It is involved with several vegetative functions&#xD;
      like sleep, attention and learning, feeding and satiety, working memory, cognition,&#xD;
      depression, and most of all arousal and energy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      1. Establish in an open label clinical trial the tolerability and safety of various doses&#xD;
           of l-histidine and lodosyn that may increase levels of l-histidine and histamine in the&#xD;
           serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform pharmacokinetic studies in serum and CSF of study subjects the levels of&#xD;
           l-histidine and histamine after treatment with various combination of l-histidine and&#xD;
           lodosyn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preliminary information will also be collected on the effects of this intervention on&#xD;
           alleviation of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study go beyond the effects of histamine on fatigue. If central&#xD;
      histamine can be increased by the strategy outlined above, a number of other vegetative&#xD;
      hypothalamic functions intricately associated with fatigue including sleep, cognition and&#xD;
      satiety need to be examined in MS patients in future studies.&#xD;

    <description>At the conclusion of the study, each individual would have completed a screening and baseline visit without any intervention and two weekly visits during intervention with the study medications. The two evaluations off drug will be compared to the two evaluations on drug. A drop of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score by 1 point or more will be considered a response. Once the information is converted into a binary function of response / no response, the data is amenable to conditional logistic regression analysis.</description>

If a subject withdraws the trial, the study will continue and enrolling subjects until 15 of them complete the trial. The subject composition (MS patient/Normal subject) 4 MS and 1 normal will be tested on a dose of L-Histidine 250 mg plus Lodosyn 50 mg BID for seven days. If there are no safety concerns, the next 5 patients will be recruited 4 MS and 1 normal to test the dose of 500 mg with Lodosyn 50 mg bid for seven days. If there are no safety concerns, then L-histidine 1,000 mg plus Lodosyn (Carbidopa) 50 mg bid will be tested in the next 5 subjects 4 MS and 1 normal for seven days.</description>
