      Comparison of standard post-operative cesarean surgery pain management with regional post-op&#xD;
      pain control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of a postoperative analgesia strategy&#xD;
      that incorporates quadratus lumborum block (QLB) in conjunction with a multi-modal&#xD;
      post-cesarean analgesia strategy. The investigators hypothesize that QLB will provide&#xD;
      superior post-cesarean analgesia compared to the current standard of care, multi-modal&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, analgesia following cesarean section using QLB compared to the current standard of care&#xD;
      alone will be further investigated. Current practice for cesarean surgical intervention&#xD;
      consists of multi-modal analgesia (i.e., Intrathecal morphine (ITM) and scheduled&#xD;
      post-operative non-opioid oral analgesics, with oral opioid analgesics reserved for&#xD;
      breakthrough pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will measure side-effects associated with each strategy: Standard of care&#xD;
      methods consisting of intrathecal morphine (ITM) plus scheduled non-opioid analgesics in&#xD;
      conjunction with prn opioid analgesics for breakthrough pain will be utilized for both. The&#xD;
      experimental treatment arm will entail standard of care in addition to QLB. The sham&#xD;
      comparator will entail standard of care in addition to QLB with saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each strategy, we will measure and model associated economic ramifications; such factors&#xD;
      will include drug costs, procedure costs, and costs associated with length of stay and&#xD;
      re-admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is similar to the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block,&#xD;
      but differs slightly in regards to the anatomical region where local anesthetic is injected.&#xD;
      Since the quadratus lumborum (QL) is more posteriorly located, it theoretically confers&#xD;
      greater safety due to enhanced visualization. The TAP block has been studied extensively for&#xD;
      post-cesarean delivery pain, consistently showing that it is not superior to ITM for&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia; however, it may prove to be helpful in patients with breakthrough&#xD;
      pain despite the use of ITM, or in patients who were unable to receive ITM (e.g. general&#xD;
      anesthesia for cesarean, contraindications to neuraxial morphine). Thus, ITM is superior to&#xD;
      TAP alone for post-cesarean analgesia, but it is associated with a dose-dependent increased&#xD;
      risk for opioid related side effects. In 2015, Blanco et. al. published a study specifically&#xD;
      using the QLB for postoperative pain after cesarean delivery. In this study, they compared a&#xD;
      true QLB to a sham QLB all in patients who did not receive ITM, and found that the QLB&#xD;
      provided improved pain control and decreased the need for post-operative opioids. Another&#xD;
      study in 2016 demonstrated that the QLB is superior to the TAP block in regards to decreasing&#xD;
      post-operative pain following c-section. Unfortunately, neither study compared the QLB to ITM&#xD;
      (part of the current gold standard for post-cesarean delivery pain, multimodal analgesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gap in knowledge regarding the utility of QLB as part of a multimodal analgesic approach&#xD;
      including ITM for cesarean section warrants further investigation. Clinicians are constantly&#xD;
      searching for methods to provide patients with the most effective medical interventions that&#xD;
      provide maximal benefit and minimal harm. Post-operative pain control following cesarean&#xD;
      delivery is an area that is important to patients and to providers, and the introduction of&#xD;
      the QLB for this purpose has the potential to improve analgesic benefit.&#xD;
