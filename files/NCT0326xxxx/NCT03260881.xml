  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the visceral fat of the heart. EAT could locally affect&#xD;
      the coronary arteries through local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EAT plays a role&#xD;
      in the development of the coronary artery disease (CAD). EAT is a highly enriched with genes&#xD;
      involved in inflammation. Given its rapid metabolism and simple measurability, as first&#xD;
      developed by Iacobellis, EAT serves as target for medications targeting the fat.&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1A) are anti-diabetic medications with recently&#xD;
      suggested cardio-protective properties. Liraglutide, a GLP-1A, has recently shown to reduce&#xD;
      the cardiovascular risk. Iacobellis'group found that EAT thickness decreased by an&#xD;
      unprecedented 36% after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. Remarkably, Iacobellis'group&#xD;
      found for the first time that human EAT express GLP-1 Receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1A effects may&#xD;
      be therefore visceral fat specific and target EAT. Based on these preliminary data, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide will significantly and rapidly reduce EAT&#xD;
      inflammation. Decreased EAT inflammation can reduce the burden of the coronary plaques. We&#xD;
      will test our hypothesis in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      interventional study in 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and CAD, with an&#xD;
      acceptable glycemic control on their current diabetes regimen who require elective coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass graft (CABG) regardless of their participation in the study. A minimum time&#xD;
      frame of 4-week treatment will be considered to detect significant changes in the study&#xD;
      endpoints. Inclusion criteria for body fat markers will rule out the confounding effect of&#xD;
      different body fast distribution at baseline. Study subjects will be randomized in two groups&#xD;
      of 20 patients to receive additional liraglutide or to remain on current treatment/ placebo&#xD;
      prior to cardiac surgery. CAD subjects not allocated to liraglutide will be started on a&#xD;
      supervised low calorie diet (LCD) to achieve approximately 5% of weight loss after from a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 weeks up to 12 weeks to avoid the confounding effect of weight loss on the study&#xD;
      outcomes. EAT samples will be collected during cardiac surgery and processed for analysis of&#xD;
      mRNA and protein expression of EAT inflammatory genes such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and GLP-1R.&#xD;
