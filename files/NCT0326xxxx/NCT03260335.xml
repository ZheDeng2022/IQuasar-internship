  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore whether feedback from a physical monitoring device (electronic&#xD;
      watch) to prompt patients to use an anxiety management strategy can help prevent challenging&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multiple baseline &quot;A-B-A&quot; single case experimental design will be adopted with baseline,&#xD;
      intervention, and return to baseline phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear the portable monitoring device with heart rate monitor, pedometer and&#xD;
      global positioning system (GPS) functions. A pre-calculated algorithm, developed using&#xD;
      machine learning software will be used to predict challenging behaviour episodes 2-4 hours in&#xD;
      advance of the event. Recent research has developed a best predictor model with a sensitivity&#xD;
      of 82% and specificity of 42%, when averaged across two participants (in press). The device&#xD;
      will communicate with a smart phone, via Bluetooth connectivity, when an event has been&#xD;
      predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrolment in the study, participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment start&#xD;
      time, which will follow from an initial baseline phase. During the baseline phase,&#xD;
      participants will wear a commercially available smart watch with physiological monitoring&#xD;
      capability, for at least one month in order to gather behaviour frequency data, and&#xD;
      associated physiological dataÍ¾ no prompts will be provided. During this period, behavioural&#xD;
      and physiological data will be sent to a secure server where a machine learning algorithm&#xD;
      will examine the relationships between data streams and 'self-tune' to improve its prediction&#xD;
      of challenging behaviour episodes. In the treatment phase, participants and staff will&#xD;
      receive a biofeedback prompt in text, or graphic form (e.g. mood light), on the smart&#xD;
      watch/connected mobile phone, when an event has been predicted. This will prompt participants&#xD;
      to implement a proactive anxiety management strategy, and will prompt staff to support the&#xD;
      participant in completing this, if required. The strategy used will be predetermined in the&#xD;
      participant's standard care plan e.g. breathing relaxation, reframing the problem,&#xD;
      behavioural redirection. Details will be recorded using an adapted version of the Overt&#xD;
      Aggression Scale-Modified for Neurorehabilitation (OAS-MNR), describing the situation in&#xD;
      which the biofeedback prompt occurred, participant and staff responses to the biofeedback&#xD;
      prompt, and any resulting behaviours, including the occurrence of challenging behaviour.&#xD;
      Following the intervention phase, participants will return to a baseline phase for one month,&#xD;
      in which no prompts will be provided. Again, details of any challenging behaviour will be&#xD;
      recorded via the OAS-MNR.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants who have sustained a severe injury to the brain, as determined by length&#xD;
             of unconsciousness (greater than 24 hours), a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3 to 8 and a Post&#xD;
             Traumatic Amnesia period greater than 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants who are resident in the Graham Anderson House, Brain Injury&#xD;
             Rehabilitation (BIRT) Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants presenting with challenging behaviour, during the recruitment period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants will NOT be excluded on the basis of comorbid psychiatric disorders or&#xD;
             drug/alcohol use, in order to provide conclusions representative of the clinical&#xD;
             population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  participants will NOT be excluded on the basis of being unable to provide informed&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a level of cognitive impairment that would prevent individuals from understanding the&#xD;
