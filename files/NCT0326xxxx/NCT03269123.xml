  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic blepharospasm (IB) is a rare but well characterised adult onset focal dystonia&#xD;
      that may cause severe visual disability. The most effective treatment is with periodic&#xD;
      injections of botulinum toxin into the pre-tarsal and / or pre-septal orbicularis oculi&#xD;
      muscles bilaterally. However, even with treatment, practical visual function often remains&#xD;
      compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of IB sufferers find that eye opening improves with focal unilateral digital&#xD;
      pressure usually on a specific point on the temple. The Investigators have developed a&#xD;
      spectacle mounted spring-loaded prosthesis (the &quot;Pressop&quot; device) to apply continuous&#xD;
      individually localised focal pressure on the temple to mimic the effect of finger pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators recommended a trial of this simple safe device in those IB patients who&#xD;
      report improvement in eye opening with focal digital temple pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic blepharospasm is a rare chronic neuro-ophthalmic disorder that causes substantial&#xD;
      visual handicap &amp; compromises quality of life. It affects adults, women more than men,&#xD;
      usually beginning in the 5th or 6th decade and consists of repeated forceful bilateral spasms&#xD;
      of eye closure with photophobia and ocular surface discomfort. In up to a third of cases&#xD;
      there are synchronous mid and / or lower facial spasms and the spectrum of disorder extends&#xD;
      to cranial dystonia involving jaw &amp; neck muscle spasms (e.g. antecollis or retrocollis).&#xD;
      Practical visual function is variably affected but most patients will have to stop driving,&#xD;
      many cannot work, manage the house or even leave the house unaccompanied. Leisure activities&#xD;
      such as reading &amp; watching television are compromised or impossible, and secondary mood&#xD;
      dysphoria and depression are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, patients have discovered that applying focal finger pressure, usually to the&#xD;
      temple, relieves or even abolishes the spasms for the duration of the application. It is,&#xD;
      however, difficult for the patient to sustain the finger pressure and impossible to apply it&#xD;
      during activities when eyesight is important e.g. driving, typing or other bimanual tasks.&#xD;
      The phenomenon can be regarded as the equivalent of the sensory trick (ST or geste&#xD;
      antagonistique) seen in some cases of spasmodic torticollis whereby finger tip pressure on&#xD;
      the chin prevents or reduces the muscle spasms in the neck and allows the head to be held&#xD;
      straight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Investigators explored the hypothesis that the benefit of the finger-tip&#xD;
      pressure sensory trick could be replicated by a spring-loaded, spectacle mounted device&#xD;
      applying focal pressure to the temple. Following preliminary design trials, the investigators&#xD;
      commissioned a manufacturer to develop a light easily handled pressure device that could be&#xD;
      fixed to the frame of most spectacles. The &quot;Pressop&quot; device fulfils these criteria and was&#xD;
      adopted for the trial.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any adult patient with Blepharospasm of sufficient severity to necessitate repeated&#xD;
             Botulinum injections can be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is not essential for participants to be spectacle wearers (having a refractive&#xD;
             error) as prescription free (zero power) spectacles can be provided for the purposes&#xD;
             of being able to trial the device .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participants may or may not be currently having Botulinum Toxin injections. Some&#xD;
             of these patients will be known to use the &quot;Geste Antagoniste&quot; phenomenon. Patients&#xD;
             who may not know of this potential therapeutic effect will also be invited to trial&#xD;
             the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to wear spectacles due to any reason (as the device has to be mounted on the&#xD;
             spectacle frame).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have spasms and twitches of the eyes caused by a different pathology e.g.&#xD;
             Hemi facial Spasm, Parkinson's disease will also be excluded from this trial.&#xD;
