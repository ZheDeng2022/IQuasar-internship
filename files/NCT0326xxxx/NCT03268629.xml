      The primary objective of this proposed three-year (June 01, 2018 to May 31,2020) project is&#xD;
      to verify the effect of 'Mindfulness Based Joyful Sleep' (MBJS) intervention on young and&#xD;
      middle-aged individuals with insomnia in China and preliminarily explore inflammatory&#xD;
      response for the intervention of insomnia applied by it. Previous researches show that&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Interventions may relieve insomnia, it is hypothesized that MBJS will be an&#xD;
      effective, feasible and affordable insomnia intervention program in China.&#xD;

      Background：Insomnia is a public health problem attracting extensive attention. Due to the&#xD;
      risks of side effect and drug dependence from the drug treatment of insomnia, the non-drug&#xD;
      treatment has gradually drawn the attention of clinician. In recent years, Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Interventions originating from the Eastern culture has created a trend in the application and&#xD;
      research of psychological and physical health fields in western countries, and been found to&#xD;
      be capable of effectively curing or alleviating many psychosomatic diseases and possibly&#xD;
      results in the reversion of gene operation mode and the reduction of inflammation risk.&#xD;
      Researches show that Mindfulness-Based Interventions may relieve insomnia, but existing&#xD;
      research samples and strict randomized controlled trial are insufficient and its application&#xD;
      mechanism is full of uncertainty. In China, empirical research strictly designed is even&#xD;
      scarce in such field. At the earlier stage, investigators have designed a intervention scheme&#xD;
      for insomnia intervention ('Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep') with mindfulness-based&#xD;
      meditation and Tai Chi as core technology, and in combination with Chinese culture and have&#xD;
      made preliminary application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives：This study is expected to verify the effect of 'Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep'&#xD;
      program on young and middle-aged patients with insomnia in China and preliminarily explore&#xD;
      the genetic level inflammation mechanism for the intervention of insomnia applied by it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Investigators will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention for insomnia ('Mindfulness-Based Joyful sleep').&#xD;
      Patients with insomnia at the age of 18-59 in China will be recruited for this study.The two&#xD;
      steps to be implemented include: 1) conducting a pilot study to finalize the design of&#xD;
      'Mindfulness-Based Joyful sleep'program and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary outcomes of the'Mindfulness-Based Joyful sleep' program: The final sample is&#xD;
      expected to include18 patients who meet inclusion criteria. Participants will receive 8-week&#xD;
      'Mindfulness-Based Joyful sleep' intervention. The efficacy of 'Mindfulness-Based Joyful&#xD;
      sleep' program will be assessed by PSQI, and feasibility and acceptability of 'Joyful Sleep'&#xD;
      program will be examined by attendance, completion of homework and feedback of participants&#xD;
      on the feeling of the program collected by a focus group. 2) conducting a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of ''Mindfulness-Based Joyful sleep'' program: The&#xD;
      final sample is expected to include 70 patients who meet inclusion criteria. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups, receiving'Mindfulness-Based Joyful&#xD;
      sleep'intervention, or receiving 'Cognitive Behavior Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)'.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at 3 time points by PSG, Sleep Diary, self-reported measures&#xD;
      including PSQI, ISI, CPSS, BDI, STAI and bio-indicator (NF-κB) at baseline, the end of the&#xD;
      Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This proposed study has important implications in providing valuable insights&#xD;
      into bridging the gap between need and services received for insomnia interventions in China.&#xD;
      If the 'Mindfulness-Based Joyful Sleep' Intervention can be used effectively, it can also be&#xD;
      popularized to many other patients with insomnia in China in future.&#xD;

    <description>NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) is a collective name for inducible dimeric transcription factors composed of members of the Rel family of DNA-binding proteins that recognize a common sequence motif. NF-κB is found in essentially all cell types and is involved in activation of an exceptionally large number of genes in response to infections, inflammation, and other stressful situations requiring rapid reprogramming of gene expression. NF-κB is clearly one of the most important regulators of proinflammatory gene expression.</description>
