  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many adjunctive treatments for the additional clinical benefits to scaling&#xD;
      and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Topical hydrogen peroxide&#xD;
      (HP) delivered in a custom fabricated tray has been shown to improve pocket depth (PD) and&#xD;
      inflammation. The purpose of this study is to assess the adjunctive treatment outcome of HP&#xD;
      gel in custom tray application in individuals with chronic periodontitis receiving SRP. The&#xD;
      purpose of this investigator-initiated study is to evaluate and compare the clinical effects&#xD;
      of scaling and root planing (SRP) combined with local delivery of 1.7% hydrogen peroxide (HP)&#xD;
      gel in customized trays to that of SRP alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydrogen peroxide (HP) has been used in for wound debridement and oral rinses in dentistry&#xD;
      for a few decades. It is widely available in a bottle of 3% in liquid. The use of hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide in gel type in 1.7% as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy has been&#xD;
      introduced but there are limited information on the efficacy. The current study is to design&#xD;
      to evaluate the adjunctive treatment outcome of hydrogen peroxide gel in custom tray&#xD;
      application in individuals with chronic periodontitis receiving non surgical therapy, scaling&#xD;
      and root planing(SRP). To test the adjunct effect of HP gel in tray, there will be three&#xD;
      parallel arms, one with the gel for the period of 26 week, one with the gel for 13 weeks and&#xD;
      control group without the gel.&#xD;
