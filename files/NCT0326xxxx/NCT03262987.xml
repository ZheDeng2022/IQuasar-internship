      May-Thurner syndrome is the result of compression of the left common iliac vein between the&#xD;
      right common iliac artery and overlying vertebrae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In This Study , We will detect the role of color doppler US in the diagnosis of May-Thurner&#xD;
      Syndrome in comparison to Direct CT Venography&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a venous compression syndrome in which the left common iliac&#xD;
      vein is compressed between the lower lumbar spine and the right common iliac artery. While&#xD;
      asymptomatic compression is very common, the process can lead to morbidity in selected&#xD;
      individuals, most commonly deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and the sequelae thereof.&#xD;
      Radiologists must recognize the diagnosis because of the unique management, which differs&#xD;
      from DVT without iliac vein compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common clinical presentation is unilateral leg swelling due to acute DVT. It can&#xD;
      also present as chronic venous insufficiency or chronic thrombosis with symptoms of venous&#xD;
      hypertension and venous stasis namely claudication, pain, swelling, varicose veins and / or&#xD;
      ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional invasive catheter venography remains the gold standard for diagnosis,but the&#xD;
      decision to undertake invasive venography should be made only after reviewing all available&#xD;
      clinical data and alternative, less invasive imaging options have been exhausted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When visualization of the common iliac veins is possible, MTS may be diagnosed with&#xD;
      transabdominal color Doppler U/S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDCT with IV contrast is a fast, widely available examination for the diagnosis of MTS and&#xD;
      accompanying complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR venography is an attractive modality for the&#xD;
      diagnosis, However, MRI is expensive, time consuming, has more limited availability than&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound, and may be impossible in select patients.&#xD;
