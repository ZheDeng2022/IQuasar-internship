  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer related deaths in Taiwan. Of the 10,248 new colorectal patients diagnosed each year&#xD;
      approximately 60% will develop liver metastasis during the course of their disease. In&#xD;
      approximately 30% of these patients who develop liver metastasis the metastatic disease will&#xD;
      remain confined to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 70-75% of colorectal patients with colorectal liver metastasis not suitable for&#xD;
      hepatic resection or similarly ablative therapy with curative intent, systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      is the standard initial management. However, after a patient has failed first- line and in&#xD;
      some cases second-line chemotherapy, response rates fall to as low as 12% (Chen HX 2006).&#xD;
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with microsphere is an alternative treatment because&#xD;
      normal liver tissue receives most of its blood supply from the portal vein, while colorectal&#xD;
      liver metastases derive most of their flow from the hepatic artery. Several clinical trials&#xD;
      have explored the feasibility and the efficacy of TACE with microsphere as a treatment for&#xD;
      patients with colorectal liver metastasis. HepaSphere represents a novel drug delivery system&#xD;
      for chemoembolization, which can add two benefits to embolization therapy. First, by&#xD;
      ionically binding the doxorubicin throughout the microspheres, more drug can be delivered&#xD;
      into the tumor, with less escape into peripheral circulation. Second, conformability to the&#xD;
      architecture of the vessel lumen, providing more contact surface area with the embolic&#xD;
      material and the vessel intima, leading to a more complete occlusion. However, there are&#xD;
      limited experiences in using HepaSphere TACE for colorectal liver metastasis in Taiwan. In&#xD;
      this pilot study, we will evaluate the initiate safety and efficacy of Hepasphere&#xD;
      microspheres loaded with a chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      who have failed first-line and second-line systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative study aimed to evaluate the safety profiles and&#xD;
      efficacy of patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases treated by selective TACE&#xD;
      (transarterial chemoembolization) using HepaSphere load with doxorubicin. Total of 15&#xD;
      patients will be planned to recruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedures will consist of a screening period in which patient eligibility will be&#xD;
      determined. Patients meeting the study entry criteria will receive one HepaSphere treatments.&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) will be done 4 weeks after treatment to determine tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic progression free survival will be followed from the date of first study HepaSphere&#xD;
      procedure until a date of target liver tumor progression is obtained or the patient is lost&#xD;
      to follow-up. Treatments for liver metastases after the study HepaSphere treatments are&#xD;
      complete will be documented during the survival period to the extent possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate subjects' previous treatments and response, and determine to&#xD;
      use doxorubicin for subjects. 100 mg doxorubicin will be loaded onto the HepaSphere&#xD;
      Microspheres (through ionic bonding when the spheres are exposed to doxorubicin solubilized&#xD;
      in non-ionic contrast medium) and delivered via microcatheter. No ethiodized oil is used with&#xD;
      the microspheres. The occlusion endpoint will be stasis to the second or third branches. If&#xD;
      stasis has not been reached when the target dosage of doxorubicin has been delivered,&#xD;
      additional bland embolic agent will be used to achieve a consistent endpoint. Other&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy, such as Xeloda, 5-fluorouracil but not limited, can be used in&#xD;
      combination with HepaSphere Tx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate safety throughout the protocol specified treatment phase of the&#xD;
      investigation by assessing adverse events, as well as changes from baseline in laboratory&#xD;
      values, findings on physical examination including vital signs and Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Concomitant medication usage will also be assessed.&#xD;
