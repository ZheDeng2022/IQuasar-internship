      In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the incidence of vena cava inferior&#xD;
      diamater on ultrasound guidance of intravascular volume before diagnosis of contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      - enhanced CT for diagnostic purposes in ileus patients and to investigate the incidence and&#xD;
      risk of developing contrast nephropathy due to contrast - enhanced CT.&#xD;

      Our work will be carried out in Kocaeli Derince Education and Research Hospital Emergency&#xD;
      Service. Patients who are scheduled to receive abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans in the emergency room, who are over 18 years of age, who are referred to Kocaeli&#xD;
      Derince Education and Research Hospital Emergency Department for the study, will be&#xD;
      calculated and recorded. The Mehran risk scores will be calculated and recorded in our&#xD;
      clinic. 3 ml / kg IV physiological saline (SF) is applied first and then 1 ml / kg / hr IV SF&#xD;
      is applied for at least 6 hours after shots. In addition, patients with contrasted abdominal&#xD;
      CT underwent emergency surveillance ultrasound imaging (including the measurement of the vena&#xD;
      cava diameter for evaluation of the patient's volume status). Patients who were admitted to&#xD;
      our general surgery and not followed up for at least 48 hours, patients with contrast&#xD;
      allergies, patients with renal replacement therapy, pregnancies, patients with&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced CT scans within the last 10 days, and patients not informed will not be&#xD;
      taken to the study. All Emergency Physicians will be informed about the study. Less than 100&#xD;
      mL of hypoosmolar, non-ionic contrast material will be used for all CT shots. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated for the development of contrast nephropathy according to biochemical assays&#xD;
      48-72 hours after CT acquisition. Physicians evaluating patients in the emergency and general&#xD;
      surgery services will be required to record blood tests that they consider necessary for&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and no extra blood will be collected for use in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>Place the patient in the supine position. The degree of elevation of the head of the bed has not been shown to make a significant difference in measurements. The diameter of the IVC for calculation of the caval index should be measured 2 cm from where it enters the right atrium .An alternative way to visualize respiratory variation is to use M-mode, with the beam overlying the IVC 2 cm from the right atrium.The inspiratory and expiratory diameter can then be measured on the M-mode image, at the smallest and largest locations, respectively.</description>
