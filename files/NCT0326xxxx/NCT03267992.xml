  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of undertaking CLN0020, which was a Substudy of the European Coil registry&#xD;
      (CLN0014), was to investigate the use of COPD Co-Pilot AIR™, a COPD disease management&#xD;
      program manufactured and operated by HGE Health Care Solutions, LLC, in participants&#xD;
      undergoing the PneumRx Endobronchial Coil Treatment in a post-market setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ combines a digital respiratory symptom reporting participant application&#xD;
      (an &quot;app&quot;) with facilitation of rapid personalized clinical recommendations made by the&#xD;
      participant's health care provider and communicated to the participant through the&#xD;
      application. COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ provides early identification of an increase in a&#xD;
      participant's respiratory symptoms relative to the participant's own baseline symptom profile&#xD;
      which in turn enables health care providers to rapidly implement modified treatment plans.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant has read, understood, and signed a CLN0020 informed consent form prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant is appropriate for Coil treatment per the Conformité Européene (European&#xD;
             Conformity [CE])-Mark Approved RePneu Instructions for Use (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has been enrolled in and scheduled for treatment(s) with the PneumRx&#xD;
             Endobronchial Coil procedure in the CLN0014 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant's PneumRx Endobronchial Coil procedure is scheduled to occur no fewer than&#xD;
             14 days from enrollment, providing enough time to establish a baseline of their daily&#xD;
             symptoms. Ten days minimum of baseline data are required, which is defined as the&#xD;
             Run-in period going forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant is willing and able to use a smart phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant has undergone a Coil procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has had an acute exacerbation of COPD that required hospitalization or&#xD;
             emergency room visit or treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics during the&#xD;
             28 days prior to CLN0020 enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant has a COPD exacerbation or respiratory illness during the Run-in period&#xD;
             that in the judgment of the investigator requires medical intervention (for example,&#xD;
             treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is suffering from terminal illness expected to adversely affect survival&#xD;
             in the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has a history of non-compliance with medical therapies.&#xD;
