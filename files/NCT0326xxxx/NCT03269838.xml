  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most frequent cause of death. Over seven&#xD;
      million people every year die from CAD, accounting for 12.8% of all deaths. Every sixth man&#xD;
      and every seventh woman in Europe die from myocardial infarction. The in-hospital mortality&#xD;
      of STEMI patients in the national registries of the European society of cardiology (ESC)&#xD;
      countries varies between 6% and 14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) generally results from intraluminal thrombus&#xD;
      formation and occlusion of a ruptured or an unstable plaque .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of therapy in STEMI is to restore microvascular flow and sustain the myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is aimed at achieving prompt&#xD;
      restoration of myocardial perfusion to maximize preservation of the electrical and mechanical&#xD;
      integrity of the jeopardized myocardium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has&#xD;
      increased the rate of successful recanalization of infarct-related arteries (IRAs) to &gt;90% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of markers including ECG and coronary angiography have been utilized to assess&#xD;
      myocardial reperfusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolongation of QRS duration,evaluated by a standard 12-lead ECG, is a marker of&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction and has been associated with a poor prognosis in STEMI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      QT-interval parameters are potentially proposed as available non-invasive markers for&#xD;
      assessing the ventricular homogeneity as well as for predicting electrical instability ,QT&#xD;
      interval (QTI) is defined as the longest interval from the beginning of the QRS complex to&#xD;
      the end of the T-wave; QT dispersion (QTd) is defined as the difference between the longest&#xD;
      and shortest QTI, and reflects electrical activity of the ventricles . .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prolongation of the latter parameter is a main predictor for fatal arrhythmia in patients&#xD;
      with myocardial infarction (MI) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of QTI and QTd parameters are dependent on heart rate and can be corrected by&#xD;
      the QT correction formulas, which are termed the corrected QTI (QTc) and QTd (QTcd) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial blush grade (MBG) is validated measurement of myocardial perfusion . The MBG is&#xD;
      used to assess the washout of myocardial blush during angiography. Grade 0 is defined as the&#xD;
      failure of the contrast to enter the microvasculature. In grade 1 cases, contrast enters&#xD;
      slowly, but fails to exit the microvasculature. Grade 2 defines delayed entry and exit from&#xD;
      the microvasculature. Finally, grade 3 indicates normal entry and exit from the&#xD;
      microvasculature .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG is a necessary, simple, rapid and non invasive tool for the diagnosis of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and evaluation of myocardial reperfusion that still to be investigated . QT&#xD;
      dispersion is a crude and approximate measure of a general abnormality of repolarization; it&#xD;
      reflects inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization . This measurement is an attempt to&#xD;
      distinguish between myocardium that is homogeneous from myocardium that displays&#xD;
      inhomogeneity, which is accompanied by increased dispersion of the ventricular recovery times&#xD;
      and prolongation of repolarization&#xD;
