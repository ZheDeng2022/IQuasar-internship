  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have had a stroke benefit from opportunities to practice the activities they need&#xD;
      to re-learn. It is common practice to give patients written exercises to guide their practice&#xD;
      out of therapy session. Whilst more practice is better, it is important that the activities&#xD;
      are practiced accurately, to ensure that the right movement patterns are re-learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study, is to evaluate whether an intervention providing in-patients who have&#xD;
      had a stroke an opportunity to use a simple video guide to help them perform their exercises&#xD;
      accurately would improve clinical outcomes. Watching an activity being performed helps you to&#xD;
      learn the activity more effectively. The focus of this study is arm rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be adult in-patients in Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, and will have&#xD;
      had a first time stroke that has left them with some arm weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be matched according to the severity of their weakness, then randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either a treatment as usual group, or an intervention group. Those in the&#xD;
      intervention group will have their exercises for their arm and hand recorded onto a tablet&#xD;
      during their normal therapy session. They will then be lent the tablet for the duration of&#xD;
      the trial, so they can have a visual guide to help them throughout the trial period. Ward&#xD;
      staff will be shown how to use the tablet to help any participants who struggle with the&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be made before and after the trial period to look at ability to move the&#xD;
      arm and hand, quality of movement, self-efficacy and time spent exercising. Participants and&#xD;
      staff will be asked for their experiences of the intervention or normal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a small single blind RCT. The outcome assessor will be blinded to the participants&#xD;
      status as either in the treatment as usual group or the intervention group. As a feasibility&#xD;
      study conducted as part of the development, and planned larger evaluation, of a complex&#xD;
      intervention we have drawn heavily on the MRC guidance on complex interventions and process&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have the capacity to make an informed decision to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who are suitable to be included in the study will be consented by the&#xD;
      student researcher (with support from the Speech and language therapist if needed). This will&#xD;
      be done in accordance with the process described in section A27-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the possibility of patients who have severe impairment or other excluding factors&#xD;
      being approached an initial screening will have occurred by the direct clinical care team of&#xD;
      the potential participants medical notes. This occurs as part of their normal initial&#xD;
      assessment of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight patients with mild upper limb impairment will be recruited and eight with moderate&#xD;
      upper limb impairment. (Three of each category for both treatment as usual and intervention&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tally will be kept of those with mild and moderate weakness in their upper limb, and&#xD;
      recruitment will cease once eight participants of each category have been consented. The&#xD;
      trial period will commence as a rolling start, with each person starting the trial period as&#xD;
      soon as their 'matched pair' has been recruited. Each of the matched pair will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into either control or intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants have been consented, they will undergo their baseline assessments. This&#xD;
      will be carried out by an experienced neurological physiotherapist from another ward (Blinded&#xD;
      to the randomisation into the control or intervention group). The assessment session will be&#xD;
      carried out in one of the ward rehabilitation rooms, and is predicted to take no more than&#xD;
      half an hour, though more time will be allowed should the participant have further questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the control group will then have their therapy programme as normal for the&#xD;
      next four weeks, or until discharge, whichever comes sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the intervention group will have their next therapy session in the normal&#xD;
      manner, but during or at the end of the session,(whichever is most appropriate) the exercises&#xD;
      prescribed by the therapist will be filmed onto a tablet. It will consist of the therapist&#xD;
      performing the exercise three times to allow the participant to get the idea of the correct&#xD;
      movement, and then the participant performing the action three times with the therapist&#xD;
      giving verbal prompts to correct the movement.For the intervention group the therapist will&#xD;
      be asked to film any upper limb exercises prescribed onto an i-pad, which will provided (one&#xD;
      for each patient). Filming will be from two to three feet away, and from whatever angle the&#xD;
      physiotherapist feels is most appropriate. The video need not include all of the patient or&#xD;
      physiotherapist demonstrator, but should include as much of their body as the therapist feels&#xD;
      is needed for guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-pad can then be taken by the patient to be used by their bedside. Participants will be&#xD;
      given a prompt sheet for playing back their exercises, and the I-pad interface will have been&#xD;
      developed with The University of Leeds School of Medicine technology department to make it as&#xD;
      intuitive as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both patient groups, if the therapist would normally provide a written exercise sheet&#xD;
      this will also be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercises prescribed will be updated by the therapist as deemed appropriate according to&#xD;
      the participants needs, either by re-recording them in a subsequent session, and/or updating&#xD;
      written exercise sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the intervention group will have access to the tablet they are using for&#xD;
      the duration of the study, labelled and kept in their private bedside locker. Ward staff will&#xD;
      be prompted to ensure that during the day if a patient wishes to do their exercises they are&#xD;
      'set up' to do so, either by ensuring exercise sheets are to hand, or the tablet is within&#xD;
      reach, and if necessary switched on and opened, with prompts how to start the video (as the&#xD;
      technology may be unfamiliar to the patients.) Ward staff will also ensure the tablets are&#xD;
      regularly charged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the four week period, or up to 72 hours before discharge, the baseline&#xD;
      assessment barrage will be repeated by the baseline assessor (still blinded, participants&#xD;
      prompted not to divulge group allocation) In order to evaluate the experience of exercising&#xD;
      out of therapy sessions, the research physiotherapist will conduct a one to one interview&#xD;
      with some of the patient participants. They will be selected via purposive sampling,&#xD;
      accounting for initial weakness category and previous experience of using tablet technology.&#xD;
      Open ended questions will be used to find out how easy they found it to exercise their&#xD;
      affected arm out of therapy time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions asked will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors made it difficult to exercise out of therapy time?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How did you cope using the tablet? (intervention group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the video guide influence how you performed the exercises?(intervention group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What suggestions do you have to make using the tablet or video guide better?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy staff will be asked in a focus group setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How useful do you think the video guide was in helping your patients carry out practice&#xD;
           out of therapy sessions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How did filming the exercises impact on their normal therapy sessions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do they think this intervention could work in practice?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What would need to change to make it work?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with patient participants will be carried out in the treatment rooms or by the&#xD;
      patients bed if this is their preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physiotherapy team focus group will be carried out in one of the available treatment&#xD;
      rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participants will be asked if they wish to have feedback on the study, and if so home&#xD;
      or discharge destination contact details will be recorded, and kept securely, so the&#xD;
      participants can receive a written summary of the outcome after the student write up.&#xD;
