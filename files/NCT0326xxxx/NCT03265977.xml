  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and prevention of Mtb infection,&#xD;
      (measured by IGRA conversion) of H56:IC31 in remotely BCG vaccinated adolescents. A TB&#xD;
      vaccination strategy incorporating H56:IC31 in adolescents or young adults, if found to&#xD;
      prevent Mtb infection, would likely have a major impact on TB disease, TB transmission, and&#xD;
      control of the epidemic. If vaccination with H56:IC31 is shown to prevent infection with Mtb&#xD;
      in this proof of concept study in adolescents, additional larger scale studies examining the&#xD;
      impact on TB disease in more diverse populations would be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety profile of H56:IC31 compared to placebo in HIV-uninfected,&#xD;
           remotely BCG vaccinated adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate prevention of Mtb infection by H56:IC31 compared to placebo, as measured by&#xD;
           rates of conversion using an ESAT-6 free IGRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate prevention of Mtb infection by H56:IC31 compared to placebo, as measured by&#xD;
           rates of sustained conversion using an ESAT-6 free IGRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate trends in ESAT-6 free IGRA prolonged/sustained conversions and late&#xD;
           reversions (i.e., through more than 6 months post initial conversion) in ESAT-6 free&#xD;
           IGRA converters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the immunogenicity of H56:IC31 in HIV-uninfected, remotely BCG vaccinated&#xD;
           adolescents.&#xD;
