  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to observe the performance of a cosmetic product, AO+Mist, on&#xD;
      the appearance of arm skin in subjects with atopic dermatitis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, bilateral, placebo-controlled study in subjects with&#xD;
      Atopic Dermatitis affecting both sides of the body. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a 2 week washout period prior to the Baseline procedure. Follwoing the&#xD;
      Baseline visit assessments, subjects will be asked to apply &quot;AO+ Mist&quot; or placebo to the&#xD;
      affected area of the arm twice a day (morning and night) for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 30 day initial study period, subjects will automatically be rolled over to&#xD;
      participate in the extension of the trial for another 30 days using only AO+Mist on the body&#xD;
      parts affected by Atopic Dermatitis.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects receive 2 bottles of product at the Baseline visit for left and right side application. One bottle will contain Placebo only, the other bottle will contain &quot;AO+Mist&quot;.&#xD;
Label on each bottle will indicate the arm the product is to be applied to. Subjects will be instructed in the use of the spray bottle and asked to self-administer the Test Product as follows:&#xD;
LEFT arm where skin is affected: 4 pumps of Spray which is labeled accordingly must be applied twice-a-day to the area on the arm affected by AD- once in the morning and once in the evening for 30 days.&#xD;
RIGHT arm where skin is affected: 4pumps of Spray which is labeled accordingly must be applied twice-a-day to the area on the arm affected by AD- once in the morning and once in the evening for 30 days.</description>
