  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence against women is a well understood devastating global pandemic, and human right&#xD;
      violation. One in three women experienced intimate partner violence worldwide. In Ethiopia,&#xD;
      the level of domestic violence against women is one of the highest in the world. However,&#xD;
      Ethiopia is signatory for various conventions and incorporate into the constitution and other&#xD;
      legal frameworks. Nevertheless, effective implementation of the existing policy documents,&#xD;
      and engaging different stakeholders is very limited. There is paucity of evidence on piloting&#xD;
      the feasibility of implementing community based preventive intervention programs. Therefore,&#xD;
      the main aim of this study is to pilot feasibility and implement existing research evidence&#xD;
      and policy documents at community level to prevent domestic violence against women in Awi&#xD;
      zone, northwestern Ethiopia This study will be conducted in three districts of the Awi zone,&#xD;
      Amhara regional state, Northwestern Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective:The overall aim of this study is to assess the outcome of community based&#xD;
      interventions implementation to prevent domestic violence against women, enhance community&#xD;
      response and determinants among women (15-49 years) in Awi Zone, Northwestern Ethiopia from&#xD;
      November, 2017 to November, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the baseline level of domestic violence against women in the study area&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify associated factors of domestic violence against women&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To design intervention implementation strategy to tackle domestic violence against women&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To implement culturally appropriate/acceptable interventions to address bottlenecks and&#xD;
           domestic violence against women&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the outcome of community based intervention on domestic violence against women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can prevent domestic violence against women through community based intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the bottlenecks of prevention intervention implementation at community level?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can implementers engage stakeholders to mobilize community and resource to implement&#xD;
           existing evidence based interventions to transform gender norm?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Null hypothesis (Ho): this community based prevention intervention will not have effect&#xD;
           (difference) on the level of domestic violence against women as compared with control&#xD;
           (standard program).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative Hypothesis (HA): community based prevention intervention will have a better&#xD;
           effect to make an improvement on the level of domestic violence against women than&#xD;
           control (standard services).&#xD;

      Sample Size Determination The sample size is determined considering both the intervention and&#xD;
      control group proportion. The sample size for dichotomous outcome is recommended based on an&#xD;
      assumption of superiority trial hypothesis testing. The hypothesis of the researcher is that&#xD;
      implementation of the new community based prevention intervention program to prevent domestic&#xD;
      violence against women will have significant effect than the standard (existing) prevention&#xD;
      program in public health point of view. So the corresponding null hypothesis (Ho) is that:&#xD;
      the new community based preventive intervention is not more efficacious to prevent domestic&#xD;
      violence against women than the comparison group based on public health relevance. In&#xD;
      addition, the sample size is determined considering an assumption of 5% margin of error, 95%&#xD;
      significance level and 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where; N is the sample size of each group, P is prevalence in standard intervention/control&#xD;
      arm, d: the real difference between two treatment effect (d= Po-Px); 22%-9%=13%=0.13); δ0: a&#xD;
      statistical acceptable margin (5%); ɑ: is the significance level which is 95% confidence&#xD;
      level (ɑ=1-0.95=0.05=1.645), ß: is 80% power (ß=1-0.8= 0.2 = 0.845, and adding Then,&#xD;
      considering 10% for potential non-achieved rate compensation. The calculated sample size for&#xD;
      a group is 364. Eventually, as a result of the complex sampling design (multistage,&#xD;
      stratified and systematic sampling), design effect is considered increase power and precision&#xD;
      of the study. Design effect was computed using a finding from complex sampling design study&#xD;
      conducted in Ethiopia (Fagitalekoma district) reported that the prevalence of DVAW was 78%,&#xD;
      and a clustered randomized control trial done in Uganda indicated that 22% of women&#xD;
      experienced physical IPV in the standard intervention group. The final sample size for the&#xD;
      three arms was 1,758 women that mean 586 for each group. The number of participant in the&#xD;
      qualitative study will be determined by information saturation during interviews and or&#xD;
      focused group discussions (FGD). A minimum of two FGD (one male group and one female group)&#xD;
      which comprise 8 to 10 discussants will be held at each selected kebeles. The local leaders&#xD;
      or other person who are in-charge will be participated on the selection of qualitative study&#xD;
      participants until information saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multistage, stratified and systematic sampling will be used to select study participant to&#xD;
      this study. First, contextual assessment will be employed among purposefully selected study&#xD;
      participants from Awi zonal admisntration, district offices and community representatives.&#xD;
      Stakeholders such as local politicians, health office, women and children affair office&#xD;
      in-charges, local leaders, police, health care providers, non-governmental organization&#xD;
      representatives and other concerned bodies will be participated to involve on advocacy&#xD;
      meeting and contextualization. Then, multi-stage stratified probability sampling methods will&#xD;
      be used to select study sites (kebeles) in the three districts among nine districts in Awi&#xD;
      zone. Three districts will be selected for three experimental group. One district will be&#xD;
      selected for comprehensive intervention. The second district will be assigned for partial&#xD;
      intervention group, and the third district will be taken as comparison (control). Then, six&#xD;
      kebeles (two kebeles from each district) will be selected from three districts purposefully&#xD;
      considering appropriateness for intervention, resource, and geographical proximity to control&#xD;
      information contamination between intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, kebeles will be stratified into urban and rural Kebele in respective district.&#xD;
      Stratification will use to control the awareness level, access to information, and community&#xD;
      tradition gender norm variability between urban and rural dwellers. After that, proportional&#xD;
      to size allocation (ni) of the sample size will be done to each stratum. Eventually,&#xD;
      systematic sampling will be employed to select actual study participants at household level&#xD;
      based on kth interval. Confidential code will be given strictly to households that will be&#xD;
      selected for interview for intervention monitoring and endline evaluation purpose. In the&#xD;
      meantime, if two married women present in one household with one husband (polygamy), only one&#xD;
      woman will be selected using lottery method for interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to qualitative study, purposive sampling method will be used to select study&#xD;
      participants for in-depth interview, key informant interview (KII) and FGD. The community&#xD;
      leaders will be consulted and actively involved on the recruitment of the most knowledgeable&#xD;
      and respected community representatives for in-depth interview, key informant interview (KII)&#xD;
      and FGD. The purpose of the study will be explained in detail to the community leaders who&#xD;
      will participate on the recruitment of qualitative study participants. It will be conducted&#xD;
      to assess individual perception towards DVAW mainly focused on sex negotiation, decision&#xD;
      making, community gender norm, and wife beating attitudes with in the community. In addition,&#xD;
      community sanction (response) against DVAW will be assessed qualitatively. It will mainly&#xD;
      involve by taking from people who are in position (authority) such as local leaders,&#xD;
      religious fathers, elders, police, women affair office, women association, health&#xD;
      professionals, health extension workers, and women lawyers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed data collection method will be carried out using structured and semi structured&#xD;
      questionnaires, that adapted from various literature. The tool will be pretested, modified to&#xD;
      the local context and suite to the study objectives. The tool will consisted of demographic,&#xD;
      socio-economic characteristics of couples (women self-reported profile), relationship level,&#xD;
      community level and societal level factors of domestic violence. In addition, the tool will&#xD;
      comprise questions about the experience of psychological, physical, sexual violence. In&#xD;
      addition, semi structured questionnaire will be designed for qualitative study. Similarly,&#xD;
      interview guide will be used to assess and dig-out the underlying bottlenecks in the&#xD;
      community that hinder implementation of preventive interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using sequential explanatory mixed method for baseline, intervention&#xD;
      monitoring/tracking and endline implementation evaluation. Here below is the flow chart of&#xD;
      the mixed data collection process adapted from other study. Two quantitative (1 and 2) and&#xD;
      qualitative (1 and 2) process will be sequentially implemented to gather necessary data .&#xD;
      Face-to-face interview method among married or cohabited women, key informant interview,&#xD;
      in-depth interview, focus group discussion, meeting and training time data capturing will be&#xD;
      carried out to have relevant information. In addition to the domestic violence assessment&#xD;
      tool, the alternative questionnaire will be prepared and provide to data collectors to secure&#xD;
      confidentiality issue if incase of third person might come suddenly during interview time.&#xD;
      Very confidential place for women will be arranged by data collectors as per the training and&#xD;
      WHO VAW research ethics recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then qualitative data collection (KII, in-depth interview and FGDs) will be held to explore&#xD;
      community perception, attitudes, norms and beliefs about domestic violence. However, mini&#xD;
      (quick) qualitative data collection for contextualization has been done among officially in&#xD;
      the districts and zone administrative level. On the other hand, it will use to find out&#xD;
      community mobilization strategies, existing legal sanctions, available training guidelines,&#xD;
      collaboration and integration of implementation activity. This will also help to design&#xD;
      appropriate tool for main study, to design correct and culturally compatible intervention&#xD;
      materials to tackle the problem. The KII will be held among women representative, district&#xD;
      council members, women affair office, police officers, lawyers, elders, local&#xD;
      politicians/leaders, health care providers, nongovernmental organization, and religious&#xD;
      leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender specific focused group discussion will be held on group of men and women to assess&#xD;
      societal perception about domestic violence against women. Each focus group discussion will&#xD;
      consisted of eight to ten participants. All participants' sociodemographic data will be&#xD;
      captured using anonymously coded structured questionnaire. The FGDs will be facilitated by a&#xD;
      group of three people (moderator, note taker and principal investigator). Voice recorder,&#xD;
      note taking and nonverbal communication (physical gestures) during the discussion will be&#xD;
      recorded as much as possible to capture necessary information. An estimate of 60 to 90&#xD;
      minutes will be taken to conduct one FGD. Moreover, implementation of domestic violence&#xD;
      against women preventive intervention activities will be monitored/tracked using ongoing&#xD;
      qualitative study method. Eventually, intervention implementation endline evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out using as same structured questionnaire, data collectors and supervisors as of the&#xD;
      formative assessment. Data will be collected by exclusively twelve female health&#xD;
      professionals (Nurse, Midwifery or public health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Allocation: Allocation of study participants in the intervention and control&#xD;
      group will be considered geographic proximity to minimize information contamination.&#xD;
      Representative sample will be taken using scientifically sounded procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate Data Collectors recruitment: Data will be collected by twelve trained Diploma and&#xD;
      above qualification female Nurses, Midwives and or public health officers who are not local&#xD;
      resident in the community for trustworthiness and ethical concerns. Four supervisor who have&#xD;
      Master of Public Health (MPH) with good previous field survey experience will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collectors Training: A five days training will be given for research assistants by the&#xD;
      principal investigator. The training will mainly focus on the purpose of the study, data&#xD;
      collection procedure, interview techniques, sampling methods, strict protection of&#xD;
      confidentiality, ethical issues of VAW research and data quality assurance. Ethical&#xD;
      sensitiveness of VAW will be explained to research assistants to maintain confidentiality and&#xD;
      also quality of data. Brief explanation will be provided on biomedical research ethical&#xD;
      principles and WHO (2001) gender based violence research ethical guideline recommendations&#xD;
      called &quot;women's safety first&quot;. Refreshment training and short orientation/debriefing will be&#xD;
      provided regularly to research assistants during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretest: Pretest will be done among 5% of the sample size among married women from nearby&#xD;
      district to check the compatibility of the data collection tool. The pretest will address&#xD;
      sensitive words in the question, time, data collection procedure, interview techniques,&#xD;
      sequence of questions, consent taking from study participants, and FGD facilitation skill and&#xD;
      note taking. Necessary amendment will be taken according to feedback from study participant&#xD;
      (verbal and non-verbal expression during pretest interview) and comment from research&#xD;
      assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training of Implementers: intensive training and supportive supervision will be given for&#xD;
      implementers. Two implementation facilitators and 6 community health extension workers will&#xD;
      be recruited and hired for one year (12 months) contract employment. Implementers will be&#xD;
      participated on the intervention tool validation to be familiar with the tool. Regular&#xD;
      discussion and close supportive supervision will be given by principal investigator and&#xD;
      facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Processing and Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, monitoring and end-line gathered data will be checked and edited for incompleteness&#xD;
      and inconsistency at field as well as at office. Explanatory and outcome variables will be&#xD;
      clearly predefined prior to data entry. During data entry if woman will report at least one&#xD;
      type of experience of either physical, psychological or sexual violence items coded as &quot;Yes =&#xD;
      1&quot; and &quot;No = 0&quot;. On the other hand, women acceptance to violence or gender inequity norm will&#xD;
      be measured using six questions/measurements, and also if women respond at least one&#xD;
      justifies of wife beating. Similarly women autonomy will be measured in four components&#xD;
      autonomy indicators such as women's economic decision-making autonomy, familial health care&#xD;
      and family planning decision-making autonomy, extent of freedom of movement autonomy, and&#xD;
      women's attitudes toward partner's violence. After completing the definition and coding of&#xD;
      raw data. Data entry template will be designed on Epi data window version 3.5.1, and data&#xD;
      entry will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then data will be exported to SPSS window version (23.0) for further analysis. Data cleaning&#xD;
      will be performed computing frequency using box plot to explore outliers and other data&#xD;
      anomalies. Multiple imputation will be done to handle missing data. Different statistical&#xD;
      assumptions will be checked for data distribution and suitability for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be computed to determine prevalence (proportion), mean, median,&#xD;
      and standard deviation of some independent variables as necessary. Cross tabulation&#xD;
      (chi-square) will be employed. Binary logistic regression will be carried out to confirm the&#xD;
      association of explanatory variable with DVAW. Explanatory variable which will have score of&#xD;
      p-value less than 0.25 in binary logistic regression will be included into the multiple&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis to determine the independent determinants of domestic violence&#xD;
      by controlling the confounding variable. In addition, Intention to Treat Analysis (ITTA) will&#xD;
      be carried out to compute the overall changes on the level of DVAW. Moreover, Difference in&#xD;
      Difference (DID) will be calculated to determine the net intervention effect. The DID will be&#xD;
      computed as subtracting intervention arm outcomes from baseline data to endline minus&#xD;
      difference of control arm outcomes from baseline to endline. Finally, statistical&#xD;
      significance of intervention effect will be measured using adjusted prevalence ratio,&#xD;
      adjusted odd ratio/adjusted risk ratio at 95% CI and p value less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be transcribed through playing and replaying the voice recorder and&#xD;
      also referring the note taken during interview or FGD. The voice recorder audio will be&#xD;
      listen multiple times as much as possible at very quiet place. It will be transcribed&#xD;
      independently by research assistant and principal investigator according to the verbatim of&#xD;
      participants. Then transcribed qualitative data will be translated from local language&#xD;
      (Amharic) into English. In the meantime, the qualitative data will be read and reread to&#xD;
      understand what they want to say. The quotes will be narrated and cited using participant's&#xD;
      code. All the qualitative data gathered from interview and FGD will be arranged into thematic&#xD;
      areas. Similar ideas will be color coded, and then merged accordingly. Qualitative Data&#xD;
      Analysis (QDA) software like Nvivo will be used to arrange or organize manually coded&#xD;
      qualitative data.&#xD;
