  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate safety and antitumor activity of U3-1402 in two parts:&#xD;
      Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Dose Escalation, U3-1402 will be evaluated in participants with metastatic or unresectable&#xD;
      NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation after disease&#xD;
      progression during/after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Dose Expansion, U3-1402 will be evaluated in participants with metastatic or unresectable&#xD;
      NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation or squamous or non-squamous NSCLC (ie, without&#xD;
      EGFR-activating mutations) with disease progression during/after systemic treatment for&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of U3-1402 in the study&#xD;
           population and to determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of U3-1402 in the&#xD;
           study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Dose Expansion, to investigate the antitumor activity of U3-1402&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study&#xD;
      treatment (for approximately 36 months) until they decide not to (withdraw consent), their&#xD;
      disease gets worse [progressive disease (PD)], or side effects become unacceptable&#xD;
      (unacceptable toxicity) or other stopping reasons have been met.&#xD;

          8. Has any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of&#xD;
             resting electrocardiogram (ECG), eg, complete left bundle branch block, third-degree&#xD;
             heart block, second-degree heart block, or PR interval &gt; 250 milliseconds (ms)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a mean corrected QT interval using Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF)&#xD;
             prolongation to &gt; 470 ms for females and &gt; 450 ms for males in three successive&#xD;
             Screening measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Unable or unwilling to discontinue concomitant drugs that are known to prolong the QT&#xD;
             interval&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has any factors that increase the risk of corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation or&#xD;
             risk of arrhythmic events, such as congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long&#xD;

             relatives.&#xD;
