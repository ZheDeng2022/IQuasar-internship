  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the number of Chronic Critical İllnes, an iatrogenic condition, increases&#xD;
      all over the world. The prevalence of Chronic Critical Illness in Turkey is unknown. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to evaluate the etiology, comorbid conditions, demographic data,&#xD;
      prevalence, mortality and costs of these patient in intensive care units in Turkey. In this&#xD;
      multi-centered study, The investigators will retrospectively review the last 1 year of&#xD;
      patients receiving treatment at the Adult Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who survive an acute critical illness in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) may be&#xD;
      delayed in a situation where they are sometimes totally independent before hand due to&#xD;
      iatrogenic causes such as infections, dysfunctions, psychological disorders. This can take&#xD;
      weeks, sometimes months. This disease is called &quot;Chronic Critical Illness&quot; (CCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most researchers associate CCI with the need for prolonged acute mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
      the opening of tracheostomy for prolonged acute mechanical ventilation. There is no single&#xD;
      condition that does not require an extended mechanical ventilation from CCI. In conclusion,&#xD;
      CCI is characterized by long-term care requiring survival and it is predicted that the cost&#xD;
      of these patients will increase with the new patients whose cost will be added in the coming&#xD;
      years. In the United States, the number of CCI is around 250,000, and this figure has&#xD;
      increased by 50-100% in the last 10 years. At least 50% of these patients die in one year and&#xD;
      less than 12% recover and become discharged. The annual cost of these patients' health care&#xD;
      system is over $ 20 billion. The prevalence of CCI in Turkey is still unknown. In this study,&#xD;
      it was aimed to investigate the prevalence of patients with Chronic Critical Syndrome in&#xD;
      intensive care units in Turkey.&#xD;
