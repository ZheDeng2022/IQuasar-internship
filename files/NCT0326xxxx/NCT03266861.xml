  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, the measurement of the transcutaneous oxygen pressure during walking is the&#xD;
      only continuous method that estimates the importance of ischemia, bilaterally and segment of&#xD;
      limb by segment of limb. The determination of the lactates concentration, with micro method&#xD;
      from earlobe sampling, is very widely validated in physiology and exercise physiopathology;&#xD;
      and it is widely used, by laboratories, for exercise investigation in athletes. We use it in&#xD;
      routine to evaluate the presence of functional limitation during tcpO2 tests on a treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study hypothesises a significant relationship between lactatemia variation&#xD;
      (difference between lactatemia after 3 minutes of recovery from walking and the value at&#xD;
      rest) and tcpO2 &quot;decrease from rest of oxygen pressure (DROP) values for patients with&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease (PAD).&#xD;

      Lactates sample (100 microliter) will be collected at rest Ankle brachial index is measured&#xD;
      at rest transcutaneous oxygen pressure is measured at the chest, calves and buttocks and&#xD;
      results will be expressed as the minimal value of the DROP index (Limb changes minus chest&#xD;
      changes) Patients walk on treadmill (2MPH 10% slope) until exertional limb pain. Lactates&#xD;
      sample (100 microliter) will be collected at minute 3 of recovery from walking Correlation of&#xD;
      lactate increase to the sum of DROP values wil be studied&#xD;
