  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningioma is the most common central nervous system (CNS) tumor and accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 30% of all CNS tumors. For meningioma recurring after surgery and radiation&#xD;
      therapy, there is no effective medical therapy. Repeat surgery or radiation therapy may be&#xD;
      possible, but they are temporizing measures with limited durable relief. PD-L1 expression in&#xD;
      meningioma is increased for recurrent tumors or prior radiation therapy, and a recent case&#xD;
      study reported significant reduction of an intracranial meningioma after 6 months of PD-L1&#xD;
      blockade. Radiation has been shown to augment immune response when combined with PD-L1&#xD;
      blockade. Proton radiation therapy has higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and may&#xD;
      further amplify the above immunological signals. Combination of proton radiation therapy&#xD;
      administered concurrently with PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize immune response for recurrent&#xD;
      meningioma. However, confirmation of the increased immunogenicity or increased tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes using the combination of radiation therapy and PD-L1 blockade have&#xD;
      not been confirmed in patients. The proposed study will be a single institution, single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label, phase Ib study to combine neoadjuvant avelumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) with&#xD;
      hypofractionated proton therapy of 20 CGE (cobalt gray equivalent) over 5 fractions followed&#xD;
      by planned surgery for recurrent radiation-refractory meningioma. This study is designed to&#xD;
      provide proof of concept to demonstrate on-target effect of the combination to increase&#xD;
      immunogenicity by directly examining the resected tumor for immune response and to evaluate&#xD;
      preliminary clinical efficacy&#xD;
