    <textblock>
      Background: The importance of cecal pathologies lie in the fact that being the first part of&#xD;
      large intestine, any disease involving the cecum affects overall functioning of the large&#xD;
      bowel. Primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen have not been described in any&#xD;
      previous study in terms of presentation, management and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the reported causes of primary cecal&#xD;
      pathologies presenting as acute abdomen and the various causes presenting in Indian setting,&#xD;
      to discuss morbidity and mortality associated with cecal pathologies and to critically&#xD;
      analyse the various management modalities employed in emergency setting.&#xD;

      The importance of cecal pathologies lie in the fact that being the first part of large&#xD;
      intestine, any disease involving the cecum affects overall functioning of the large bowel.&#xD;
      Primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen often pose a challenge to their optimal&#xD;
      management due to requirement of urgent intervention in most cases and being a common source&#xD;
      of misdiagnosis. These pathologies often mimic acute appendicitis and commonly misdiagnosed&#xD;
      as one. This misdiagnosis can lead to under-treatment of the underlying pathology and this&#xD;
      results in high morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions. So the accurate&#xD;
      identification of such conditions is required so that the patients can be optimally managed&#xD;
      and patient outcome can be improved.&#xD;

        All adult patients presenting in the emergency department with acute abdomen were included&#xD;
        in study in whom cecal pathology as the cause of acute abdomen was suspected clinically&#xD;
        and/or on imaging and further confirmed per-operatively and/or on histopathological&#xD;
        examination (HPE) or on imaging.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adult patients presenting in emergency department with acute abdomen were included&#xD;
             in study in whom cecal pathology as the cause of acute abdomen was suspected&#xD;
             clinically and/or on imaging and further confirmed per-operatively and/or on&#xD;
             histopathological examination (HPE) or on imaging. Patients identified with primarily&#xD;
             a cecal pathology who had acute pain abdomen as the initial symptom but who didn't&#xD;
             presented immediately due to various reasons were also included in the study as it is&#xD;
             a well-documented fact that patients in developing countries like India, especially&#xD;
             those who live in rural areas or who are illiterate often resort to indigenous methods&#xD;
             of treatment or take symptomatic treatment from local practitioners before presenting&#xD;
             to a tertiary centre for definitive treatment. Also, only those patients who were&#xD;
             operated within 24 hours of index admission in the emergency operation theatre (EOT)&#xD;
             by a registrar or faculty member after initial resuscitation were included in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with sub-acute, intermittent or chronic pain; when predominant symptoms were&#xD;
             attributable to some other cause even with concomitant presence of a cecal pathology;&#xD;
             when predominant pathology was not cecal and patients with cecal pathology operated as&#xD;
             an elective case were excluded from this study. Thus patients diagnosed to be having&#xD;
             appendiceal stump blowout, perforation of base of appendix, ileocecal tuberculosis or&#xD;
             intussusception were not included.&#xD;
