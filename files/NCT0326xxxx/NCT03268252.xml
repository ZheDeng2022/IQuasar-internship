  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard regimen for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in PNG is annual&#xD;
      administration of two drugs at the same time. The two drugs are called &quot;DEC&quot;&#xD;
      (Diethylcarbamazine, 6 mg/kg body weight) and &quot;ALB&quot; (Albendazole 400 mg for all individuals&#xD;
      regardless of weight), which are given one time per year for five to seven years with the aim&#xD;
      to interrupt transmission that occurs through local mosquito vectors. These drugs kill the&#xD;
      larval forms of the parasite in the blood that are necessary for continuing transmission of&#xD;
      infection by the mosquito vector. The two drugs were previously thought to have little effect&#xD;
      on adult worms, the stage of the parasite which is responsible for production of the larval&#xD;
      forms that appear in the blood of infected people. Recent data, however, suggest that DEC and&#xD;
      ALB can kill or render adult worms unable to produce the larval forms (sterilization).&#xD;
      Therefore, giving these drugs twice per year for three consecutive years may increase the&#xD;
      rate of killing or sterilizing of adults worms over regimens that involve administration of&#xD;
      the same drugs only one time per year. The overall goal of this research is to compare the&#xD;
      anti-parasite activity of DEC plus ALB given one time per year, the current standard for MDA&#xD;
      to eliminate LF, to DEC plus ALB given two times per year (at 6-month intervals) in order to&#xD;
      reduce the total duration and cost of MDA to eliminate LF in PNG. Adults (18 years and older)&#xD;
      and minors (age 5 to 17 years) will be invited to participate in this study. Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to give finger stick blood samples to check LF infection status&#xD;
      and stool samples to determine how well the drugs eliminate intestinal worm infections.&#xD;
      Sampling will be done by repeated cross-sectional surveys in the same communities, but not&#xD;
      necessarily the same persons, one time per year over a 3-year period. As part of the annual&#xD;
      treatment infection surveillance the study team will also collect demographic data (place of&#xD;
      residence, family relationship, age, use of bed nets), history of swelling of the arms and&#xD;
      legs (elephantiasis), scrotal swelling (hydrocele), acute filarial fever accompanied by&#xD;
      extremity swelling, and history of prior treatment for LF.&#xD;

      This research will conduct a population-based field studies to determine whether the relative&#xD;
      cost and efficacy of semi-annual versus annual administration of MDA using DEC (6 mg/kg body&#xD;
      weight) plus ALB 400 mg (for all individuals regardless of weight) will be more successful in&#xD;
      elimination of LF and reduction in the burden of soil transmitted helminth (worm) infections.&#xD;
      The study involving participation of human subjects is observational in nature, uses drugs&#xD;
      that are the standard approved treatment for LF in PNG and elsewhere in the Pacific and Asia,&#xD;
      and does not involve administration of drugs by the investigators. Diagnosis of LF and&#xD;
      administration of anti-LF drugs will be the responsibility of those authorized by the PNG&#xD;
      Department of Health to perform this activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is repeated cross-sectional surveys examining each subject once. Some&#xD;
      subjects may be included in more than one annual population survey, but this is not a&#xD;
      longitudinal study. Approximately 3,200 individuals will participate per year at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study and at years 1, 2 and 3 (a total of 4 cross-sectional surveys). The&#xD;
      study will include both females and males 5 years of age and older who live in a LF endemic&#xD;
      area of PNG. Subject selection will not be based on health status. The study aims to&#xD;
      determine the relative impact and cost effectiveness of annual versus twice yearly MDA (DEC 6&#xD;
      mg/kg body plus Alb 400 mg for all individuals) for elimination of LF and reduction in soil&#xD;
      transmitted helminthic infection burdens in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is comprised of repeated annual cross-sectional surveys in sentinel communities&#xD;
      before and after initiation of MDA for LF. The surveys will be conducted over a period of 3&#xD;
      years at the following times: 0 (pre-treatment baseline), 1, 2, and 3 years corresponding to&#xD;
      annual treatment times. Government health officials as part of the GPELF will administer the&#xD;
      MDA (standard regimen recommended by WHO is DEC + ALB). Part of the government-sponsored&#xD;
      program will be to screen for LF using ICT card screening and finger stick bloods for&#xD;
      measuring the density of blood born microfilaria (MF). The current protocol will assist in&#xD;
      collection of these data. As part of the annual treatment infection surveillance the study&#xD;
      team will also collect demographic data, history of lymphedema, scrotal swelling (hydrocele),&#xD;
      acute filarial fever or adenolymphangitis, and history of prior treatment for LF.&#xD;

      Any remaining from the finger stick/stool samples will be cryopreserved for subsequent&#xD;
      testing for presence of other infections that have public health importance in PNG (e.g.,&#xD;
      malaria) using molecular or serological assays. Genetic testing of samples for the LF,&#xD;
      malaria or common blood borne or intestinal infections will be performed using microsatellite&#xD;
      markers or highly polymorphic genes as confirmatory diagnostic tests and/or to assess the&#xD;

        The study population (3,200/survey) will include male and female subjects &gt;=5 years of age&#xD;
        living in East Sepik Province, PNG. If unexpected logistical problems should arise, other&#xD;
        study areas have been identified in Madang Province. The proposed study area will be in the&#xD;
        Dreikikier Rural Local Level Government (LLG, approx pop 20,000) and Gawanga Rural, LLG&#xD;
        (approx pop 13,000). Residents of villages previously treated with MDA will not be included&#xD;
        in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children &lt;5 years of age from community studies excluded because prevalence rates for LF&#xD;
        tend to be very low in young children and because of difficulties associated with&#xD;
        collecting clinical specimens from this population. Pregnancy will not be an exclusion&#xD;
        criteria because DEC and ALB are considered safe in pregnancy.&#xD;
