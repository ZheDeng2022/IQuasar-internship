  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      data for the commercially available G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell belongs to the G7 multi-bearing platform. It was&#xD;
      developed to provide an additional surgical option for patients in need of a total hip&#xD;
      replacement. The aim of the G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell is to increase hip function while&#xD;
      reducing pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled post market&#xD;
      surveillance study involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hip arthroplasty procedures. A&#xD;
      minimum of 4 and a maximum of 5 sites will be involved in this study. This number of clinical&#xD;
      centers will permit assessment of consistency among a multitude of investigators. 140-175&#xD;
      implants will be included into the study. Each site will be allowed to enroll 35 patients.&#xD;
      All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and performance of the G7 BiSpherical Acetabular Shell will be assessed as&#xD;
      following: implant survivorship based on revision with removal of the study device; safety&#xD;
      based on incidence and frequency of adverse events; and clinical efficacy measured by overall&#xD;
      pain and function, quality of life data and radiographic evaluation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient capable of understanding the surgeon's explanations and following his&#xD;
             instructions, able and willing to participate in the follow-up program and who gave&#xD;
             consent to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient aged of 18 years or more whose skeleton reached bone maturity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Noninflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular&#xD;
             necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Correction of functional deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment of non-union, femoral neck fracture, and trochanteric fractures of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The Biomet G7 Freedom Constrained Liner is indicated for use as a component of a total&#xD;
             hip prosthesis in primary and revision patients at high risk of dislocation due to a&#xD;
             history of prior dislocation, bone loss, joint or soft tissue laxity, neuromuscular&#xD;
