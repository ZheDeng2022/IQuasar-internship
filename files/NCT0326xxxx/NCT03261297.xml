      Chronic diarrhea is defined as stool volume of more than 10g/kg/day in toddlers/infants and&#xD;
      greater than 200 g/day in older children that lasts for 14 days or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic diarrhea has many of causes can calcified as infectious &amp; noninfectious causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infectious causes as: - Escherichia coli, Giardia Lamblia, tuberculosis, Clostridium&#xD;
           difficile &amp; Shigella.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Noninfectious causes as(Abnormal digestive processes- Nutrient Mal -absorption- Immune/&#xD;
           inflammatory- Defects of electrolyte And metaboliteTransport- Motility disorders-&#xD;
           Diarrhea associated With exogenous substances)&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four basic pathophysiological categories of diarrhea: as ( osmotic diarrhea-&#xD;
      secretory diarrheas- motility related diarrhea- Inflammatory diarrhea)&#xD;

      Infectious diarrhea caused by invasive bacteria (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter) or a&#xD;
      cytotoxic organism result ting in mucosal histologic damage and inflammation (Entamoeba&#xD;
      histolytica). (Hedberg etal., 1994)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Giardia lamblia Transmission is via the faecal oral route or via ingestion of contaminated&#xD;
      water sources. Symptoms of Giardia infection include diarrhea, malaise, flatulence, foul&#xD;
      smelling greasy stools, bloating/ distention and, less commonly, nausea, anorexia and&#xD;
      vomiting. (Dib etal., 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebiasis. The majority of patients will&#xD;
      have asymptomatic or low level disease with a gradual onset of diarrhea with generalized&#xD;
      abdominal tenderness. Fever is not usually associated with amoebic disease. Mucus and/or&#xD;
      blood may be present if the organism penetrates the bowel wall and causes mucosal damage.&#xD;
      (Van Hal etal., 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn disease &amp; ulcerative colitis ,cause chronic&#xD;
      diarrhea that is often associated with abdominal pain, elevated inflammatory markers, and&#xD;
      increased concentrations of fecal calprotectin. The severity of the symptoms is highly&#xD;
      variable with a pattern characterized by long periods of well-being followed by exacerbations&#xD;
      (Bunn etal., 2001)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactose is the sugar found in milk .Because lactose is not digested properly in the small&#xD;
      intestine of individuals who are lactose intolerant; it passes whole into the large intestine&#xD;
      or colon. Upon reaching the colon it is broken down by the normal colon bacteria. This&#xD;
      breakdown results in the production of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gases. The gas production&#xD;
      can lead to (Abdominal distension, excess gas and diarrhea, watery and explosive bowel&#xD;
      movements, urgency). The severity of symptoms is usually proportional to the amount of the&#xD;
      milk sugar ingested with more symptoms following a meal with higher milk sugar content.&#xD;
      (Marsha, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four basic pathophysiological categories of diarrhea:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In osmotic diarrheas, osmotically active substances draw fluids from the plasma into the&#xD;
      jejunum along the osmotic gradients through the highly permeable jejunal epithelium. Examples&#xD;
      of chronic diarrhea due to an osmotic cause include malabsorption states such as celiac&#xD;
      disease, bacterial overgrowth, osmotic laxatives including salts, and lactulose and&#xD;
      maldigestion as occurs in disaccharidase deficiency and pancreatic exocrine&#xD;
      insufficiency.Osmotic diarrheas might result in steatorrhea (passage of fat in to the stool).&#xD;
      (Pardi etal., 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In secretory diarrheas, there is secretion of isoosmolar fluid into the intestine. In this&#xD;
      situation, other electrolyte abnormalities might coexist. Thus, hypokalemia and acidosis are&#xD;
      associated with Verner-Morrison syndrome or VIPoma; Examples of secretory diarrheas include&#xD;
      congenital abnormalities such as congenital chloridorrhea, in which an abnormality in the&#xD;
      genetic control of chloride-bicarbonate exchange in the ileum results in the loss of chloride&#xD;
      into the stool. (Long etal., 1981) Secretory diarrhea might be associated with altered motor&#xD;
      functions induced by the hormone or transmitter produced by the tumor, as in carcinoid&#xD;
      diarrhea. (Von etal., 1993) The typical features of secretory diarrhea include the&#xD;
      persistence of the diarrhea with fasting and the absence of steatorrhea, hypokalemia and&#xD;
      acidosis typically suggest VIPoma syndrome (Camilleri etal., 1982)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In motility related diarrhea, Motility disorders cause diarrhea by either accelerating&#xD;
      gastrointestinal transit (e.g., post vagotomy diarrhea) or by slowing transit, thereby&#xD;
      predisposing to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (e.g., scleroderma).The most&#xD;
      prevalent forms of motility-related diarrheas is IBS-D, Rapid small-bowel transit is a&#xD;
      relatively common finding in patients with diabetes or autonomic neuropathies, or patients&#xD;
      who have undergone upper gastrointestinal tract surgery. (Posserud etal., 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border,&#xD;
      which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these&#xD;
      lost fluids. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic&#xD;
      infections, or autoimmune problems. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and&#xD;
      enteritis (Camilleri etal., 2014)&#xD;
