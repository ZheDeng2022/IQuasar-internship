    <textblock>
      Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of a program promoting HIV self-testing (HIVST) with&#xD;
      online real-time counselling (HIVST-online) among men who have with men (MSM) in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Inclusion criteria are: i) Hong Kong Chinese speaking males aged ≥ 18 years old,&#xD;
      ii) self-report having had anal sex with at least one man in the last six months, iii)&#xD;
      willing to leave contacts (mobile phone and/or social media account), and iv) having access&#xD;
      to online face-to-face communication tools like Line, Skype, or Facetime. Those having been&#xD;
      diagnosed as HIV positive will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A total of 350 eligible MSM will be recruited and invited to participate the program,&#xD;
      including 120 HIVST-online users in a HMRF project (ref#11120791) (re-testers), and 230 new&#xD;
      prospective HIV testers (new-testers) through outreaching at gay venues (bars and saunas),&#xD;
      internet and social media, and referrals made by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief baseline telephone survey will be conducted among all participants they are exposed&#xD;
      to the components of the health promotion program. All participants will be followed up at&#xD;
      Month 6 by phone/social media for outcome and process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures The primary outcome is whether the participant has taken up our&#xD;
      HIVST-online service during a 6-month follow-up period. This behavioural outcome will&#xD;
      recorded objectively by the HIVST administrators. Among those who had not taken up HIVST at&#xD;
      Month 6, they will be contacted by social media to ask a few questions to assess secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, which include: 1) whether having taken up any form of HIV testing other than&#xD;
      HIVST-online and 2) intention to take up HIVST-online or other forms of HIV testing in the&#xD;
      next six months. Process evaluation of the health promotion components (e.g., online video,&#xD;
      MI, and project webpage) and the HIVST-online service (e.g., delivery of the HIVST kits,&#xD;
      appointment making with HIVST administrators, pre- and post-test counseling) will also be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives The investigators had developed an innovative home-based HIVST service&#xD;
      (HIVST-online), which includes mailing a free HIVST kit and providing online real-time&#xD;
      instructions and pre-test/post-test counseling via online live-chat applications to users&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To promote men who have sex with men (MSM) who have never used the HIVST-online to use&#xD;
           it for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To promote MSM who have used to HIVST-online to use it again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Target participants and recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A total of 350 eligible MSM will be recruited and invited to take up the HIVST-online&#xD;
           service. Inclusion criteria are: i) Hong Kong Chinese speaking males aged ≥ 18 years&#xD;
           old, ii) self-report having had anal sex with at least one man in the last six months,&#xD;
           iii) willing to leave contacts (mobile phone and/or social media account), and iv)&#xD;
           having access to online face-to-face communication tools like Line, Skype, or Facetime.&#xD;
           Those having been diagnosed as HIV positive will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As a continuation, the 172 MSM who have used the HIVST-online service in our previous&#xD;
           project will be invited to use HIVST-online again if they remain sexually active, as&#xD;
           international recommendations suggest that sexually active MSM should take up HIV&#xD;
           testing on a regular basis (e.g. once every six months). Modifications of the promotion&#xD;
           messages will be made for these re-testers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The target is to contact at least 70% of the 172 testers (n=120) and have 70% performing&#xD;
           HIVST-online again (n=84). Therefore, the collaborating NGO will recruit about 230 new&#xD;
           prospective HIV testers through outreaching at gay venues (bars and saunas), internet&#xD;
           and social media, and referrals made by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health promotion Provision of health promotion of HIVST-online to prospective testers who are&#xD;
      not users of previous HIVST-online services (i.e. not &quot;re-testers&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective testers, who are not &quot;re-testers&quot;, will be sent via social media a link to access&#xD;
      a webpage created for this project. They will then be exposed to the following components of&#xD;
      health promotion which have shown to be effective in our previous project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Viewing a promotion video and a demonstration video: Through the webpage, they will&#xD;
           access an online video of about seven minutes in length promoting HIVST-online. The&#xD;
           video had been used effectively in the previous HMRF HIVST-online project. The carefully&#xD;
           design contents were guided by Health Belief Model. For instance, health communication&#xD;
           messages are presented to increase viewers' perceived susceptibility of HIV infection&#xD;
           and perceived benefit of HIVST-online. As the Social Cognitive Theory suggests that&#xD;
           observational learning is effective in inducing health-related behaviors, the video also&#xD;
           includes short testimonials about good experiences of HIVST-online made by a peer&#xD;
           HIVST-online user. Another video demonstrating the use of HIVST (two minutes) will be&#xD;
           sent to prospective participants; such a video is available from the ongoing project.&#xD;
           Knowing that HIVST is easy to use would increase perceived confidence and hence&#xD;
           self-efficacy (a Health Belief Model construct) in taking up HIVST-online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brief motivational interviewing (MI): The MI will be provided over phone or via social&#xD;
           media by the research assistant(s) upon appointment and packaged as 'explaining the&#xD;
           program' to the MSM interested in considering HIVST-online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visiting the HIVST-online webpage: The aforementioned videos can be accessed via this&#xD;
           webpage. (i) Besides, it will contain a description of the project, knowledge and&#xD;
           benefit of the HIVST, contact of the project team (phone, social media, and email), and&#xD;
           information about HIV that promotes perceived susceptibility and perceived severity&#xD;
           (constructs of the HBM). (ii) A discussion forum will be created to contain positive&#xD;
           feedbacks of previous HIVST-online users (e.g. process evaluation of the previous RCT&#xD;
           project), and those given by users of the proposed project. These testimonials provide&#xD;
           cue to action (a construct of the Health Belief Model) and create a new subjective norm&#xD;
           (a construct of the Theory of Planned Behavior) supporting the use of HIVST-online. As&#xD;
           an incentive, a lucky draw will be made to those who leave encouraging comments to this&#xD;
           forum. (iii) Participants and project team will add 'LIKE' or further comments to the&#xD;
           webpage. (iv) Participants may post their questions in private, which will be answered&#xD;
           by the project staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Receiving a free self-testing kit: Through phone and/or social media interactions,&#xD;
           prospective users will provide a mailing address, and the investigators will send them a&#xD;
           free HIVST kit (Aware TM Oral) in a plain envelope without any identification of the&#xD;
           project. Participants will be given two alternative options for receiving the HIVST kit:&#xD;
           1) the investigators can warp the HIVST kit in a parcel without any identification of&#xD;
           the project and send it to a Seven-Eleven store suggested by the participant by express.&#xD;
           It is a common practice for people in HK to pick up their express from such stores. Upon&#xD;
           receiving the express, a reminder SMS will be sent to the recipient by the store.&#xD;
           Participants can pick up the parcel by showing the SMS they received without any&#xD;
           additional charge; 2) the kit will be dispatched to them by volunteers. Receiving the&#xD;
           test-kit is a strong cue to action (Health Belief Model, HBM) that may induce action.&#xD;
           The practice was implemented smoothly in our HMRF project, for which we sent out about&#xD;
           200 self-test kits and most of those receiving the kit took up HIVST-online. The mailing&#xD;
           of a free kit also removes logistic barriers required to buy or to collect a&#xD;
           self-testing kit and cost concern (HBM). HIV rapid testing now being provided by the&#xD;
           local NGOs and the government are also free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up reminders: Up to three weekly reminders will be sent by SMS/social media to&#xD;
           those who had been sent a HIVST kit but have not registered for taking up HIVST-online&#xD;
           (cue to action of the HBM). A hotline number answered by the research assistant will&#xD;
           also be made available for those who need to discuss with us about their concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of health promotion of HIVST-online to &quot;re-testers&quot; As compared to the health&#xD;
      promotion components for prospective testers who are not &quot;re-testers&quot;, the &quot;re-testers&quot; will&#xD;
      be exposed to a new and modified promotion video designed for them. Other components, such as&#xD;
      the demonstration video, the project webpage, request for spreading the health promotion&#xD;
      messages, receiving the free HIVST kits and follow-up reminders will be similar. As those who&#xD;
      had used HIVST-online in the past have already shown motivation in using the service, they&#xD;
      will not receive MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actual implementation of the HIVST-online After being exposed to the various components of&#xD;
      health promotion afore-mentioned, those MSM who decide to take up HIVST-online will contact&#xD;
      the investigators and initiate the testing service. The following steps, which have been&#xD;
      taken in the previous HMRF project, will be processed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Testers will make an appointment with the investigators by phone/social media after they&#xD;
           have received the HIVST kits by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Through a communication tool (e.g., Line, Skype, Facetime or Whatsapp), the HIVST&#xD;
           administrator will explain to the participants in detail how to use the HIVST. If&#xD;
           necessary, the aforementioned demonstration video will be sent again to the testers. It&#xD;
           is guaranteed that all information will be kept confidential. Participants are anonymous&#xD;
           and do not need to show their faces if desired and no taping will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The standard-of-care pre-test (risk assessment) and post-test counseling (e.g.,&#xD;
           interpretation of testing results and HIV prevention) of the HTC service will be&#xD;
           implemented by a HIVST administrator (NGO staff), who will be trained by the HIVST&#xD;
           administrator of our previous HMRF project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The administrator will guide the tester to use the oral fluid based HIVST kit correctly.&#xD;
           The HIVST kit to be used in this study (AwareTM Oral) is a brand of the Calypte&#xD;
           Biomedical Corporation of the U.S., and is being manufactured by a subsidiary company of&#xD;
           the Calypte Biomedical Corporation in Beijing. It has a proven sensitivity/specificity&#xD;
           of &gt;99.8% and has been approved for marketing by the State of Food and Drug&#xD;
           Administration (SFDA) in China. It is now being used by CDC in China nationwide. This&#xD;
           kit is available online at a price of 200HKD. The project team can obtain the kits at a&#xD;
           discounted price at 80HKD per kit (liaison has been made with the manufacturer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. It takes about 20 minutes to know about the screening result. The entire testing and&#xD;
           counseling process will take about 60 minutes, which is comparable to that needed for a&#xD;
           traditional HTC in NGO or governmental clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Those screened positive will be given immediate online psychological support. It will be&#xD;
           emphasized that they have to take up a free confirmatory HIV antibody testing to be&#xD;
           offered by the Department of Health. Referrals will be made whenever needed. The&#xD;
           investigators may accompany them to visit the NGO (AIDS Concern) or the Department of&#xD;
           Health if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Baseline survey A brief anonymous telephone survey will be conducted among all&#xD;
      participants before they are exposed to the health promotion components of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background variables: 1) socio-demographic characteristics, 2) sexual orientation, 3)&#xD;
           sexual behaviours in the last three months (type of male sex partners and female sex&#xD;
           partners, and frequency of unprotected anal sex) and 4) substance use before/during&#xD;
           sexual intercourse in the last three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HIV testing history: 1) HIV testing in lifetime and in the last three years, 2) types of&#xD;
           HIV testing utilized in the last three years and in the last six months, and 3)&#xD;
           behavioral intention to use any and specific types of HIV testing in the next six&#xD;
           months. For re-testers, they will be asked additional questions about their satisfactory&#xD;
           of the HIVST-online service provided by previous HMRF project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perceived risk of HIV infection in the next six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Perceptions related to HIV self-testing: 1) positive attitudes toward HIV self-testing&#xD;
           (e.g., convenient, privacy, etc.), 2) negative attitudes toward HIV self-testing (e.g.,&#xD;
           difficulty to interpret testing results by oneself, inadequate accuracy, etc.), 3)&#xD;
           perceived subjective norm related to HIV self-testing (e.g., whether significant others&#xD;
           would support them using HIV self-testing), 4) perceived behavioral control in using HIV&#xD;
           self-testing, 5) behavioral intention to use HIV self-testing under different scenarios,&#xD;
           6) perceived importance of online real-time counseling supporting HIV self-testing and&#xD;
           7) preference of HIV self-testing kits (blood based or oral fluid based).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 6 follow-up evaluation Participants will be followed up by phone or social media for&#xD;
      outcome and process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is whether the participant has taken up our HIVST-online service during a&#xD;
      6-month follow-up period. This behavioral outcome is recorded by us objectively. Among those&#xD;
      who had not taken up HIVST at Month 6, they will be contacted by phone/social media to ask&#xD;
      several brief questions to assess secondary outcomes, which include: 1) whether having taken&#xD;
      up any form of HIV testing other than HIVST-online and 2) intention to take up HIVST-online&#xD;
      or other forms of HIV testing in the next six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation All participants will be asked some questions through phone/social media&#xD;
      as a process evaluation of the health promotion components (e.g., online video, MI, and&#xD;
      project webpage). All testers of the HIVST-online will be asked additional questions rating&#xD;
      their satisfaction of various aspects of the HIVST-online service (e.g., delivery of the&#xD;
      HIVST kits, appointment making with HIVST administrators, pre- and post-test counseling).&#xD;
