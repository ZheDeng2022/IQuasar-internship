    <textblock>
      This study uses the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) and Dietary Approach to&#xD;
      Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores to compare diet quality between U.S.-born (n=3,837) and&#xD;
      foreign-born (n=406) non-Hispanic Black adults aged 22-79y, based on pooled nationally&#xD;
      representative data (NHANES 2003-2012); as well as by length of U.S. residency. Association&#xD;
      between nativity and diet quality was done using multivariable-adjusted linear regression for&#xD;
      the continuous total diet quality scores and their components, or multinomial (polytomous)&#xD;
      logistic regression for categorical tertiles (low, medium, or high) of the total scores and&#xD;
      their components. The study found that foreign-born Blacks had significantly higher AHEI-2010&#xD;
      and DASH scores compared to U.S-born Blacks, and more favorable intakes for many of the score&#xD;
      components. Among foreign-born Blacks, diet quality did not significantly differ by length of&#xD;
      residency. Foreign-born Blacks were more likely to be in the high than low tertile for fruit&#xD;
      (including and excluding fruit juice), vegetables (excluding starchy vegetables), percent&#xD;
      whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids. Overall, the study suggests that foreign-born Blacks&#xD;
      have better diet quality compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. Considering nativity among&#xD;
      U.S. Blacks in nutrition research and public health efforts may therefore improve accuracy of&#xD;
      characterizing dietary intakes and facilitate development of targeted nutrition interventions&#xD;
      to reduce diet-related diseases in the diverse Black population in the U.S.&#xD;

        The study population comprised 4,243 non-Hispanic Blacks, including 3,837 U.S.-born (90.4%)&#xD;
        and 406 foreign-born (9.6%). Compared to U.S.-born Blacks, a higher proportion of&#xD;
        foreign-born Blacks were male, had attained a higher level of education, were classified as&#xD;
        normal or overweight, had never been a smoker, engaged in physical activity, and had lower&#xD;
        energy intake. In comparison to those who were in the U.S. for &lt;10 years, more foreign-born&#xD;
        Blacks who were in the U.S. for ≥30 years were current smokers (14.8% vs. 5.0%,&#xD;
        respectively), had higher income (IPR of ≥4.00: 43.5% vs 7.9%, respectively), and a higher&#xD;
        percent with a college degree or higher (39.4% vs. 18.3%, respectively). Foreign-born&#xD;
        Blacks residing in the U.S. for ≥30 years reported higher BMI in comparison to those&#xD;
        residing in the U.S. for &lt;10 years (28.8 vs. 26.7 kg/m2).&#xD;
