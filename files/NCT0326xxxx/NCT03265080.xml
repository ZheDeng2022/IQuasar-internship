  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of ADXS-NEO administered alone and in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
      This study will be performed in 2 phases, a safety phase (Part A and Part B) and an efficacy&#xD;
      phase (Part C).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutation-derived tumor antigens, which are often unique to each patient's tumor, represent a&#xD;
      new source of targets for cancer immunotherapy. These mutations, which arise during&#xD;
      tumorigenesis, are expressed only by the tumor and, as such, may be recognized as newly&#xD;
      formed antigens, or neoantigens, by the patient's T cells. The lack of expression of&#xD;
      patient-specific tumor mutations in nonmalignant cells suggests that vaccines targeting these&#xD;
      tumor mutations have a low risk of autoimmunity and may represent a safer therapeutic&#xD;
      approach than many of those currently available. The development of a Listeria monocytogenes&#xD;
      (Lm)-based vaccine that expresses these patient-specific tumor antigens and that activates&#xD;
      tumor-killing T cells has the potential to be a highly effective form of immunotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition, the Lm platform, because it mediates tumor control through multiple mechanisms, may&#xD;
      exhibit more robust anti-tumor activity than other vaccine platforms. Thus, the targeting of&#xD;
      patient-specific mutation-derived tumor antigens and the concurrent stimulation of host&#xD;
      immunity provides a rational approach for boosting anti-tumor immunity, as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Screening tumor biopsy must be adequate for the identification of NSMs by whole exome&#xD;
             sequencing and for the development of ADXS-NEO. Biopsies may be repeated for subjects&#xD;
             whose Screening biopsies are found to be inadequate for the development of ADXS-NEO.&#xD;
             Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is&#xD;
             generally inadequate.&#xD;

                  sub-types, metastatic SCCHN or metastatic NSCLC that have progressed or have&#xD;
                  become intolerant to standard therapy, and whose disease may allow management&#xD;
                  with other available therapies (or a treatment break, if appropriate) for up to&#xD;
                  approximately 12 weeks following Screening tumor biopsy. More than one form of&#xD;
                  anti-tumor therapy is allowed during this interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For metastatic CRC, up to 4 lines of approved therapy in the advanced or&#xD;
                  metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibody and targeted agent&#xD;
                  therapy. Subjects may be eligible if they have received additional lines of&#xD;

                  histologies with neuroendocrine or small cell components may be eligible upon&#xD;
                  discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Prior exposure to immunotherapy including, but not limited to, anti-PD1 or&#xD;
                  anti-PDL1 antibodies is allowed but not required. Subjects who received prior&#xD;
                  treatment with such agents must meet the following criteria: (a) Full resolution&#xD;
                  of prior checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events and no treatment for these&#xD;
                  adverse events for at least 3 weeks prior to the first infusion of ADXS-NEO; and&#xD;
                  (b) no history of severe immune related adverse events (irAE) from prior exposure&#xD;
                  to checkpoint inhibitors. Severe irAEs are defined as any CTCAE Grade 4 toxicity&#xD;

                  corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose)&#xD;
                  for greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject population for Part B and Part C (ADXS-NEO + pembrolizumab) is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Histological or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC, SCCHN, urothelial carcinoma, or&#xD;
                  melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject has received, and then progressed or been intolerant to up to 3 lines of&#xD;
                  prior therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting, including approved&#xD;

         18. Monoclonal antibody or biologic therapy within 5 half-lives or 28 days, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter, prior to first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or pembrolizumab (Part B and Part&#xD;
             C). Subjects undergoing therapy with pembrolizumab at the time of Screening (Part B)&#xD;
             may continue pembrolizumab without the above-mentioned washout period if stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Received anticancer chemotherapy, surgical treatment, and/or radiation therapy (except&#xD;
             palliative radiation therapy for disease-related pain in consultation with the&#xD;
             Sponsor's medical monitor) within 3 weeks of first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or&#xD;
             pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Because of a possible interaction between attenuated Lm and PI3K inhibitor (may be&#xD;

             inhibitor within 3 weeks of first dose of study treatment, or are expected to receive&#xD;
             such agents at any time during the treatment period, are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or&#xD;
             pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Major surgery, including surgery for a new artificial implant and/or medical device,&#xD;
             which is permitted by the protocol, within 6 weeks prior to initiation of ADXS-NEO&#xD;
             (Part A) or pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C). NOTE: All toxicities and/or&#xD;
             complications must have recovered to baseline or Grade 1 prior to the initiation of&#xD;
             study treatment. Consult with the Sponsor prior to enrolling participants who recently&#xD;
