  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of ADXS-NEO administered alone and in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
      This study will be performed in 2 phases, a safety phase (Part A and Part B) and an efficacy&#xD;
      phase (Part C).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutation-derived tumor antigens, which are often unique to each patient's tumor, represent a&#xD;
      new source of targets for cancer immunotherapy. These mutations, which arise during&#xD;
      tumorigenesis, are expressed only by the tumor and, as such, may be recognized as newly&#xD;
      formed antigens, or neoantigens, by the patient's T cells. The lack of expression of&#xD;
      patient-specific tumor mutations in nonmalignant cells suggests that vaccines targeting these&#xD;
      tumor mutations have a low risk of autoimmunity and may represent a safer therapeutic&#xD;
      approach than many of those currently available. The development of a Listeria monocytogenes&#xD;
      (Lm)-based vaccine that expresses these patient-specific tumor antigens and that activates&#xD;
      tumor-killing T cells has the potential to be a highly effective form of immunotherapy. In&#xD;
      addition, the Lm platform, because it mediates tumor control through multiple mechanisms, may&#xD;
      exhibit more robust anti-tumor activity than other vaccine platforms. Thus, the targeting of&#xD;
      patient-specific mutation-derived tumor antigens and the concurrent stimulation of host&#xD;
      immunity provides a rational approach for boosting anti-tumor immunity, as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.&#xD;

                  sub-types, metastatic SCCHN or metastatic NSCLC that have progressed or have&#xD;
                  become intolerant to standard therapy, and whose disease may allow management&#xD;
                  with other available therapies (or a treatment break, if appropriate) for up to&#xD;
                  approximately 12 weeks following Screening tumor biopsy. More than one form of&#xD;
                  anti-tumor therapy is allowed during this interval.&#xD;

                  corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose)&#xD;
                  for greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject population for Part B and Part C (ADXS-NEO + pembrolizumab) is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Histological or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC, SCCHN, urothelial carcinoma, or&#xD;
                  melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject has received, and then progressed or been intolerant to up to 3 lines of&#xD;
                  prior therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting, including approved&#xD;
