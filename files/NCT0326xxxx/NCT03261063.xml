      The study is a prospective, single arm, non-blinded, multi-site study conducted in mainland&#xD;
      China.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the China Evera MRI® study is to confirm safety of the Evera MRI ICD System in&#xD;
      the clinical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) environment when subjects receive MRI scans up&#xD;
      to 2W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) without positioning restrictions (MRI scans may occur&#xD;
      anywhere on the body). Long-term device effects, such as long-term lead integrity, will not&#xD;
      be assessed in the China Evera MRI® study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are indicated for implantation of an ICD at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are able to undergo a pectoral implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are able and willing to undergo elective MRI scanning without sedation ,&#xD;
             .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are geographically stable and available for follow-up at the study site&#xD;
             for the length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are at least 18 years of age (or older, if required by local law).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of significant tricuspid valvular disease that precludes the&#xD;
             ability to place the RV lead. .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who may be contraindicated to the dexamethasone sodium phosphate and/or&#xD;
             dexamethasone acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require a legally authorized representative to obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with abandoned or capped leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require an indicated MRI scan, other than those specifically described in&#xD;
             the China Evera MRI® study, before the one-month post-MRI follow-up (approximately 4&#xD;
             months post-implant).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a non-MRI compatible device (such as neurostimulators) or material&#xD;
             implant (e.g., non-MRI compatible sternal wires, neurostimulators, biostimulators,&#xD;
             metals or alloys).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with medical conditions that preclude the testing required by the CIP or&#xD;
             limit study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are enrolled or intend to participate in another clinical trial (of an&#xD;
             investigational drug or device, new indication for an approved drug or device, or&#xD;
             requirement of additional testing beyond standard clinical practice) during the China&#xD;
             Evera MRI® study. Co-enrollment in concurrent trials is only allowed when documented&#xD;
             pre-approval is obtained from the Medtronic study manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient who is pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not on a reliable&#xD;
             form of birth control. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within seven (7) days prior to device implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g., age, breastfeeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are diagnosed with terminal disease with life expectancy less than 4&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
