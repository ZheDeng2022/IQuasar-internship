  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839&#xD;
      and how well it works with panitumumab and irinotecan hydrochloride (phase I only) in&#xD;
      treating patients with RAS wildtype colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body and does not respond to treatment. Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 with panitumumab and&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CB839 in combination with panitumumab and&#xD;
      irinotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Determine the efficacy of CB-839 in combination with panitumumab as measured by the&#xD;
      objective response rate (RR) in patients with previously EGFR treated RAS wildtype colorectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives of Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival&#xD;
           (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate radiological features of pre- and post-treatment carbon C 11 glutamine&#xD;
           (11C-glutamine) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and fluorine&#xD;
           F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) PET/CT with clinical outcome and&#xD;
           biological correlates (tissue gene signature, plasma glutamate levels, exosomes). (Phase&#xD;
           II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect pre-treatment biopsy tissue and prospectively correlate clinical outcome with a&#xD;
           glutamate-biased gene set. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify exosomal content in the plasma (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood samples during each radiotracer injection to assess pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate radiological features of pre- and post-treatment 11C-Glutamine PET/CT and&#xD;
           18F-FSPG PET/CT with clinical outcome. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate radiological features of pre- and post-treatment 11C-Acetate PET/CT with&#xD;
           clinical outcome (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Phase I is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 in combination&#xD;
      with standard doses of panitumumab and irinotecan hydrochloride. Phase II will study efficacy&#xD;
      of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 in combination with standard doses of panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28,&#xD;
      panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, and irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and 15 (Phase I only). Courses repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;
