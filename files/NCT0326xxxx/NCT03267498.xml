    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and chemoradiotherapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab,&#xD;
      may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Chemoradiotherapy is the&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and may prevent the cancer from spreading&#xD;
      when combined with nivolumab. Giving nivolumab and chemoradiotherapy may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the feasibility of treatment completion of a combined&#xD;
      chemoradiation-nivolumab regimen followed by adjuvant nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate at 1 year from completion of therapy, as determined&#xD;
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the locoregional control rate at 1 year post-treatment. III. To determine&#xD;
      the distant metastasis rate at 1 year post-treatment. IV. To determine the overall survival&#xD;
      rate at 1 year post-treatment. V. To determine the rate of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) clearance at end of chemoradiation and at 1 year post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess patients' quality of life from baseline through 1 year post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine the acute and late toxicity rates according to Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5, including immune-related adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of courses 1-5 and&#xD;
      7-12. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at course 2, patients undergo radiation therapy once daily&#xD;
      (QD) 5 days per week and receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 7 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days, at 1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months for up to 1 year, and then every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
