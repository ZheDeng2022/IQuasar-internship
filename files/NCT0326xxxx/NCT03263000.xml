      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people who have increased blinking may later develop blepharospasm. Blepharospasm is a&#xD;
      neurological disorder that causes involuntary closing of the eyes. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      more about how eyes close in response to different stimuli. They want to study this in&#xD;
      healthy people, people with increased blinking, and people with blepharospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how light exposure affects people with blepharospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with blepharospasm or increased blinking, and healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 5 visits. The number of visits will depend on the number of&#xD;
      tests they opt to have. They can opt to have up to 4 tests. Visits last 60-90 minutes. They&#xD;
      cannot drink alcohol or caffeinated drinks for at least 12 hours before visits. Visits could&#xD;
      include the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of eyelid movements. This will be video recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography: Small sticky electrodes are placed on the lower eyelid skin. These are&#xD;
      attached to wires. Muscle activity is recorded during blink reflex procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation: An electrode is placed close to the eyebrow. It will deliver small&#xD;
      electrical shocks. The strength of the shocks will be enough to provoke a blink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photic stimulation: A lamp is placed in front of the face. It will deliver single or paired&#xD;
      flashes. The flashes will be at various intervals and intensities. Participants will wear a&#xD;
      patch over one eye during this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of electrical and photic stimulation&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of the first study of this protocol is to improve understanding of the role&#xD;
           played by light sensitivity in the pathophysiology of blepharospasm (BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a characteristic feature of BPS, the electrocutaneous blink reflex recovery cycle&#xD;
           (EBR rc) shows an increased recovery index of R2 compared with healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first study proposed under this protocol we will study the recovery cycle of the&#xD;
           blink reflex evoked by a light stimulus (PBR rc) and the effect of a light stimulus on&#xD;
           the EBR (MBR rc) in patient with BPS. Since photophobia and increased blinking are&#xD;
           common symptoms in this group of patients, we will look for possible correlations&#xD;
           between neurophysiological data and the Light Sensitivity Questionnaire (LSQ) or the&#xD;
           Blink rate (Brt). The second study proposed under this protocol will explore the PBR rc&#xD;
           and the MBR rc in patients with increased blinking alone, a condition indicated as a&#xD;
           possible precursor of BPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit 24 patients with blepharospasm, 24 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 24&#xD;
      patients with increased blinking alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two different studies, we will compare all the results from the EBR rc, PBR rc and MBR rc&#xD;
      between BPS patients (first study) or increased blinking patients (second study) and HVs. We&#xD;
      will also look for possible correlation between the neurophysiologic data and the clinical&#xD;
      scales acquired during a clinical assessment. In the EBR rc procedure, the supraorbital nerve&#xD;
      will be stimulated with paired electrical stimuli at varying ISIs and the EMG response from&#xD;
      the orbicularis oculi muscles will be recorded. In the PBR rc procedure, paired light stimuli&#xD;
      will be given at varying interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and the EMG responses from the&#xD;
      orbicularis oculi will be recorded. In the MBR rc study a weak light stimulation will be&#xD;
      given at varying ISIs before an electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve. Each&#xD;
      experimental procedure will last about 1 hour. There will be one screening visit and up to 4&#xD;
      testing visits per participant. However, participant can either undergo all the experimental&#xD;
      procedures or participate in only some of them and will be allowed to participate in two&#xD;
      experimental procedures per testing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EBR rc, PBR rc, MBR rc: the electromyography (EMG) responses at different interstimulus&#xD;
           intervals (ISIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blink rate: number of eye blinks per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LQs: the total score of the Light Questionnaire Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will be compared between the two patient groups and HVs. We will look for&#xD;
      possible correlations between neurophysiological and clinical data.&#xD;
