  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study about Neuropsychological function and OSAS in Taiwan. Although the&#xD;
      correlation between OSAS and neuropsychological abnormalities had been reported, it is worth&#xD;
      to understand more about the detailed domains that involved in our cohort. After this,&#xD;
      investigators can dissect the cause of mental retardation in DS and help for further&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common cause of mental retardation with incidence of 1 in 848&#xD;
      (Lin, Hu et al. 1991). Although prenatal Down syndrome and Amniocentesis had been applied for&#xD;
      years, in the survey of 2005, current birth incidence of DS is 1.6 in 10,000 live birth,&#xD;
      meaning a 30-50 new cases per year (Jou, Kuo et al. 2005). Patients with DS will have&#xD;
      multisystemic manifestations including short stature, mental retardation, dysmorphism,&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, congenital anomaly of gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract,&#xD;
      abnormal endocrine function, leukemia and leukemoid reaction. Beside mental retardation,&#xD;
      other anomalies could be treated or controlled by current medical care. The IQ of DS is&#xD;
      around 20-80 with significant cognitive, language, and behavior problems (Dierssen,&#xD;
      Ortiz-Abalia et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) had been observed in DS people with&#xD;
      prevalence about 45-79% in the literature (de Miguel-Diez, Villa-Asensi et al. 2003; Dyken,&#xD;
      Lin-Dyken et al. 2003; Shott, Amin et al. 2006; Fitzgerald, Paul et al. 2007), which is much&#xD;
      higher than the 1-3% prevalence rate in general population (Holmes 1993; Gislason and&#xD;
      Benediktsdottir 1995). The reasons of DS people prone to have OSAS are due to the combination&#xD;
      of anatomical and physiological factors. In DS people, facial dysmorphism (midfacial&#xD;
      hypoplasia, mandibular hypoplasia), macroglossia, small hypopharynx, pharyngeal hypotonia,&#xD;
      tonsil and adenoid enlargement, obesity, laryngomalacia, and tracheomalacia contributed to&#xD;
      upper airway obstructions in DS people (Trois, Capone et al. 2009; Pandit and Fitzgerald&#xD;
      2012). In addition, DS people has increased incidence of lower respiratory tract diseases&#xD;
      including gastroesophageal reflux, immunological dysfunction, tracheal bronchus, airway&#xD;
      malacia, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary hypoplasia, which will predispose to OSAS.&#xD;
      While growing up, DS people still have generalized hypotonia with increasing risk of&#xD;
      developing hypothyroidism and obesity, which are also risk factors for OSAS (Trois, Capone et&#xD;
      al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been noted that sleep disordered breathing is associated with neurocognitive deficit,&#xD;
      particularly of memory, learning, attention, hyperactivity, executive functioning, cognitive&#xD;
      capacity, and poor school performance (Beebe 2006; Pandit and Fitzgerald 2012). And a number&#xD;
      of studies have reported improved attention, executive functioning, analytical thinking,&#xD;
      verbal functioning, memory and academic progress at 6-12 months post- adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      (Chervin, Ruzicka et al. 2006). In DS, study demonstrated that a higher number of apneic&#xD;
      episodes on polysomnography was correlated to the decreased visuoperceptual skill in DS&#xD;
      (Andreou, Galanopoulou et al. 2002). Similarly, presence of snoring in DS was associated with&#xD;
      a much higher rate of disruptive school behavior than without snore (Carskadon, Pueschel et&#xD;
      al. 1993). Although learning disability and memory defect had been globally known in DS, the&#xD;
      behavior, cognitive, and developmental impairment caused by OSAS is especially concerning&#xD;
      because it might adversely affect their ability, even the social adaptation (Rihtman,&#xD;
      Tekuzener et al. 2010) . Therefore, investigators would like to know the correlation between&#xD;
      severity of OSAS and Neurocognitive and behavior in DS people in Taiwan. Also, investigators&#xD;
      would like to follow the Neurocognitive and behavior changes in those who had been treated&#xD;
      for OSAS, including tonsillectomy or Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure.&#xD;
