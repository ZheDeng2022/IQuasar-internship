  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral nutritional therapy, fed through the gastrointestinal tract via a catheter, tube,&#xD;
      catheter, or stoma, delivers the nutrients distally to the oral cavity and may reduce&#xD;
      intrahospital malnutrition. Enteral probes are inserted, at the bedside, through the nose or&#xD;
      mouth into the stomach or duodenum. Among the main complications of the use enteral probes,&#xD;
      we can mention: displacement of the probe and administration of diet in the respiratory tract&#xD;
      or microaspirations. To prevent displacement, enteral probes are attached to the skin on the&#xD;
      nose or forehead by the use of micropore-type adhesive. In the probe the adhesive tape is put&#xD;
      in the form of &quot;tie&quot; and again fixed to the nose of the patient. The enteral probes&#xD;
      displacement rates with this technique are around 62%; in addition, the adhesive tape can&#xD;
      cause discomfort, nasal necrosis, skin lesions and skin sensitivity reactions to the patient.&#xD;
      More recently the nasal bridle, an anchor of the enteral feeding tube located around the&#xD;
      nasal septum or nasal septum, has been described as more effective in securing enteral probes&#xD;
      position over traditional tape attachment, but is not available in our environment. In&#xD;
      Brazil, the feeding tube attachment device (FTAD) is available. Until now, the performance of&#xD;
      FTAD in relation to enteral probe safety and accidental exit rates has not been described in&#xD;
      the literature. Material's FTAD is composed of a layer of hydrocolloid that is adhered to the&#xD;
      skin on the back of the nose and a polyurethane clamp that secures the enteral probe. Thus,&#xD;
      there was a need to evaluate the actual success in using the traditional mode of probe&#xD;
      attachment. It should be noted that very little scientific evidence is available in the&#xD;
      literature on such care, and this is due to the lack of well-designed studies on the subject.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group consisting of the use of the&#xD;
      feeding tube attachment device (FTAD) or the control group that will use the conventional&#xD;
      method of attachment with micropore adhesive tape and tape . The data will be compared by&#xD;
      Student's t test or Mann-Whitney and Pearson's chi-square, according to their distribution.&#xD;
      The project was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de&#xD;
      Porto Alegre. Daily will be accessed through the diet map, available in the hospital&#xD;
      application, patients who are in use enteral nutrition. These data will be tabulated in the&#xD;
      screening worksheet, those who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study and requested the reading and signing of the informed consent by the patient or&#xD;
      guardian. The study investigator will inform the allocation group to the guest patient.By&#xD;
      means of a structured questionnaire, socio demographic and clinical information will be&#xD;
      collected: age, gender, reason for current hospitalization, comorbidities and information&#xD;
      related to enteral probe (type of probe, place and date of insertion, number of medications&#xD;
      in use via enteral probe, type and the date of the last fixation change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional fixation with micropore and plaster is routinely performed by the nursing staff&#xD;
      every 24 hours or whenever necessary. The procedure will be performed as described in the&#xD;
      study protocol (item 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feeding tube attachment device (FTAD) contains a layer of hydrocolloid that will attach&#xD;
      to the skin and a clamping clamp around the probe. The placement of the catheter fixation&#xD;
      device will be performed by the research nurses, these will be previously trained by the&#xD;
      manufacturer of the material. The fixing procedure is described in item 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included will be evaluated daily for study outcomes up to the suspension of enteral&#xD;
      nutrition prescription, hospital discharge, death or up to 35 days of follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      starting enteral probe use on Saturday and Sunday can be up to 48 hours with the traditional&#xD;
      method of fixation and later will be randomized to the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Control Group After inclusion in the study, initial evaluation and information to the&#xD;
      patient, the attending nurse will follow up on the exchange of the traditional enteral probe&#xD;
      fixation device that occurs according to the standard operating protocol in the institution&#xD;
      that recommends micropore fixation according to the &quot;tie&quot; technique and exchange Every 24&#xD;
      hours and whenever it is loose or with presence of dirt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Intervention Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion in the study and the initial evaluation, the patient will be informed of the&#xD;
      intervention to be submitted. The care nurse will place the catheter fixation device, which&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer, should follow the following instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wash the patient's nose with soap and water that does not release residue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rinse vigorously and dry thoroughly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the paper that isolates the adhesive barrier (step 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Position the device so that the fastener is approximately 1 cm below the tip of the&#xD;
           nose. Apply the barrier to the patient's nose, pressing the barrier surface gently&#xD;
           against the skin for 60 seconds (step 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasten the feeding probe, closing the clamp around it, and firmly tighten the arms to&#xD;
           fully engage the serrated teeth (step 3);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To remove, raise clamp. Place the tip of one finger over the ledge on the opposite arm&#xD;
           and turn the arm to open (step 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exchange of the device should be every 7 days, in the presence of dirt or if material&#xD;
      deterioration occurs.&#xD;
