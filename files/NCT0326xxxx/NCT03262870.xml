      Multiple sclerosis is a pro-inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      The etiology of MS is complex and poorly understood. Both genetic and environmental factors&#xD;
      play a role and recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota is one of the key environmental&#xD;
      factors. Gut microbiota is increasingly being seen an important environmental risk factor for&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, and strategies to correct an imbalance in intestinal flora.The first&#xD;
      study, &quot;Multiple sclerosis patients have a distinct gut microbiota compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls,&quot; published in Scientific Reports, found that people with relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;
      have altered fecal microbiota and may have microbial dysbiosis. People with MS had reduced&#xD;
      levels of a protein called aryl hydrocarbon receptor circulating in their blood.Aryl&#xD;
      hydrocarbon receptor is involved in many biological processes, including inflammation. The&#xD;
      researchers found that gut microbiota play a role in turning tryptophan, and amino acid found&#xD;
      in food, into Aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists, which act on cells of the nervous system&#xD;
      called astrocytes and limit inflammation of the central nervous system. Low levels of Aryl&#xD;
      hydrocarbon receptor in multiple sclerosis patients may explain how microbial dysbiosis could&#xD;
      be causing the condition.Increased constipation and fecal incontinence and increased gut&#xD;
      permeability in multiple sclerosis patients, and increased occurrence of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases in MS patients and their families suggest an important gut-central nevus system&#xD;
      connection.Interestingly, gut bacteria can also influence the blood brain barrier integrity.&#xD;
      These studiesimplicate that gut microbiota may potentially be operational in predisposition&#xD;
      to or modification of the disease course of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will included 40 cases of MS according to Diagnostic criteria of multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis they classified into two types of Multiple sclerosis ,Relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;
             (group 1), and Primary progressive MS, Secondary progressive MS, and Progressive&#xD;
             relapsing MS (group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient was submitted to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Expanded disability status scale score between 1 and 6 and functional system score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Demographic and clinical data (Age, sex, age of onset, severity of disease, clinical&#xD;
        symptoms and signs, Types of treatment, duration of treatment, number of attacks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The general exclusion criteria included prior surgeries, any patients or controls&#xD;
             currently taking antibiotics or probiotic supplements,or having a known history of&#xD;
             disease with an disease such, rheumatoid arthritis,type-1-diabetes, and IBD, were also&#xD;
             excluded from the study.Microbial DNA was extracted from fecal material of each&#xD;
             sample.&#xD;
