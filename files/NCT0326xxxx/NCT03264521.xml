      The study aims to advance pain research by exploring feasibility of crowdsourcing patient&#xD;
      pain data via Amazon Mechanical Turk, the largest and most studied crowdsourcing platform in&#xD;
      the U.S. We will leverage an existing NIH/NCCIH grant as a comparison data (RAND Center of&#xD;
      Excellence in Research on CAM; CERC) to conduct a feasibility study of new methods for&#xD;
      gathering and analyzing data on chronic pain and engaging pain patients in health policy.&#xD;

      The study aims to advance the pain research by exploring the crowdsourcing approach for&#xD;
      eliciting and analyzing the way in which individuals experience and understand chronic pain.&#xD;
      Investigators will leverage an existing NIH/NCCIH grant (RAND Center of Excellence in&#xD;
      Research on CAM; CERC) to conduct a feasibility study of new methods for gathering and&#xD;
      analyzing data on chronic pain and engaging pain patients in health policy processes through&#xD;
      three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Inclusion): Gain access to chronic pain patients using crowdsourcing platform Amazon&#xD;
      Mechanical Turk (MTurk). This aim explores whether crowdsourcing provides a credible method&#xD;
      for patient inclusion. People with low back pain will be accessed via the crowdsourcing&#xD;
      platform MTurk and asked to take health surveys that were also administered to a national&#xD;
      clinical sample of chiropractic patients within a RAND study. Equivalency of validated,&#xD;
      self-reported measures of low back pain obtained from crowdsourced versus &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      data from the RAND study will be assessed. Similarities and differences between demographics&#xD;
      and other pain and function variables between crowdsourced and RAND data will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Subsamples of crowdsourced data will be analyzed to assess reliability of the extent to which&#xD;
      data yields the same results across repeated crowdsourced samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Participation): Engage chronic pain patients in inclusion criteria setting for&#xD;
      national pain treatment programs. This aim will intends to facilitate patient participation&#xD;
      in NIH criteria-setting for program inclusion. Crowdsourced patients will assist with&#xD;
      qualitative coding of data responses to the question, &quot;What does chronic pain mean to you?&quot;&#xD;
      Investigators will explore whether crowdsourcing provides a valid method by which coding may&#xD;
      be conducted, first measuring reliability across crowd samples, second testing the accuracy&#xD;
      of participant coding as compared with expert coders at RAND Corporation. A method of&#xD;
      assessing face validity will be tested as participants may create additional codes and give&#xD;
      feedback by rating the importance of each dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess efficiency and quality of crowdsourced data as compared to CERC data.&#xD;
      Investigators will draw quantitative comparisons of cost (labor/incentives), time, data&#xD;
      quality (amount of text, missing data) across online crowdsourced and CERC study samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study utilizes the resources of an existing NIH grant by exploring the&#xD;
      feasibility of using innovative online methods for eliciting patient perspectives on chronic&#xD;
      pain and for engaging patients in analyses procedures. The study provides an opportunity to&#xD;
      determine whether patient chronic pain experiences and perspectives can be gathered through&#xD;
      crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), in a valid, replicable, and resource&#xD;
      efficient way. Although focused on chronic low back pain, the study findings will have broad&#xD;
      implications for patient engagement more generally. If the crowdsourcing methods produce data&#xD;
      that is comparable to &quot;gold standard&quot; methods used in the RAND Study entitled, &quot;Center of&#xD;
      Excellence in Research on Chiropractic&quot; (RAND/CERC Study), this new experimental system has&#xD;
      the potential to provide low-cost and time-efficient methods to advance&#xD;
      democratically-oriented research, evaluation, policy and ultimately patient-centered clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
