      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of aldesleukin when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of&#xD;
      the body. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to avoid&#xD;
      recognition by immune cells. Giving aldesleukin and pembrolizumab may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of aldesleukin (IL-2) combined with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess preliminary antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination with IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the association of PD-L1 protein expression by pretreatment tumor with&#xD;
      response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the association of regulatory T cell (Treg) frequency and Treg to effector&#xD;
      T cell (Teff) ratios in peripheral blood and tumor tissue with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the association of de novo serological and cellular responses against the&#xD;
      ubiquitous RCC tumor antigen 5T4 with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate the association of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) repertoire&#xD;
      clonality with response to therapy and to assess the detection of dominant TIL clones within&#xD;
      peripheral blood over time in responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To investigate the association of whole genome copy number alterations measured on&#xD;
      pretreatment archived, formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor with response to&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also&#xD;
      receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) 5 days per week for 6 weeks; or aldesleukin IV on&#xD;
      days 2-6 of pembrolizumab cycles 1 and 2. Pembrolizumab treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4&#xD;
      cycles per treatment course in the absence of clinical disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up via surveillance scans for&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 1 year or until disease progression.&#xD;
