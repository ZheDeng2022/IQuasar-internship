    <textblock>
      Researchers at MCW have discovered a new pathway that links the type of bacteria present in&#xD;
      the intestines to the severity of heart attacks. This discovery of a relationship between&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria, bacterial metabolites, and severity of heart attacks means that for the&#xD;
      first time, the investigators may be able to determine a person's probability of having a&#xD;
      heart attack via non-conventional risk factors. This may provide opportunities for novel&#xD;
      diagnostic tests as well as a potential for therapeutic intervention. The link between gut&#xD;
      microbiota and the severity of heart attacks may also lead to novel therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      (probiotics, non-absorbable antibiotics) to prevent heart attacks from happening. The studies&#xD;
      proposed will test the hypothesis that altered intestinal microbiota are mechanistically&#xD;
      linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The investigator's objective is to&#xD;
      determine whether inflammatory markers in the blood are decreased and endothelial cell&#xD;
      function improved by a probiotic in patients with established coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators wish to elucidate a mechanism by which the gut microbiota&#xD;
      regulates serum inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific Aim 1 will determine the impact of a probiotic on circulating leptin and TMAO&#xD;
           levels, conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (total&#xD;
           cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, oxidized LDL, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, serum&#xD;
           amyloid A, fibrinogen and adiponectin, glucose-dependent- insulinotropic polypeptide&#xD;
           (GIP), glucagon-like-peptide (GLP-1), glucagon, insulin), and their relationship to the&#xD;
           intestinal microbiota (15 representative microbial groups) as non conventional risk&#xD;
           factors. Several blood samples will be collected to measure biomarkers. Participants&#xD;
           will provide periodic stool samples in order to measure gut bacterial biodiversity.&#xD;
           Lastly, endothelial cell function (flow mediated dilation) will be measured in order to&#xD;
           assess blood vessel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim 2 will determine the impact of a probiotic on metabolites derived from the&#xD;
           intestinal microbiota as candidates for non-conventional risk factors of cardiovascular&#xD;
           disease. The relationship between metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota,&#xD;
           endothelial cell function and risk factors for cardiovascular disease identified in&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1 will be correlated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a direct link between intestinal microbiota, dietary phosphatidylcholine, and&#xD;
      promotion of cardiovascular disease has been elegantly demonstrated. In this study, broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics were employed to disrupt the intestinal microbiota, and metabolomic&#xD;
      analysis identified 3 metabolites of phosphatidylcholine, including TMAO, linked to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. However, the impact of intestinal dysbiosis on the heart and its&#xD;
      susceptibility to injury from ischemia/reperfusion has not been known until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel work has demonstrated a mechanistic link between changes in the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      and severity of myocardial infarction. Treatment of Dahl S rats with the commercially&#xD;
      available probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, and a non-absorbed antibiotic&#xD;
      vancomycin to alter abundance of multiple microbiota reduced circulating leptin levels,&#xD;
      reduced myocardial infarct size, and improved recovery of post-ischemic mechanical function.&#xD;
      Pretreatment with leptin abolished cardioprotection by the probiotic and the antibiotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings also show the reach of the intestinal microbiota extends far beyond local&#xD;
      effects to remote organ systems such as the heart and provide support for the metabolomic&#xD;
      studies to be conducted in Specific Aim 2. The prior discovery of a relationship between&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota, their metabolites and myocardial infarction provides opportunities for&#xD;
      novel therapeutic approaches (probiotics, non-absorbable antibiotics and/or microbial&#xD;
      metabolites) for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies indicate an important role of leptin in signaling between the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and the heart. Supplementation of the diet with active cultures of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum 299v leads to significant reductions in fibrinogen and LDL-cholesterol, and leptin&#xD;
      concentrations in smokers. These clinical studies demonstrate that a probiotic is capable of&#xD;
      decreasing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Note that neither leptin nor TMAO levels,&#xD;
      per se, are recognized cardiovascular risk factor. This is currently an area with enormous&#xD;
      potential for gaining new mechanistic insight and may lead to a therapeutic product or&#xD;
      clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired endothelial function is recognized as an early and modulating process in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, it has been shown that&#xD;
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus exhibit endothelial dysfunction and that this&#xD;
      phenotype precedes development of frank hyperglycemia. Endothelial function is easily&#xD;
      measurable by non-invasive means and endothelial dysfunction measured non-invasively&#xD;
      independently predicts future cardiovascular risk in patients both with and without&#xD;
      clinically apparent cardiovascular disease. Conduit vessel endothelial function in humans is&#xD;
      commonly quantified by measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery,&#xD;
      which represents the endothelium-dependent relaxation of a conduit artery - typically the&#xD;
      brachial artery - due to an increased blood flow. FMD correlates with impaired&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent relaxation in the coronary arteries and is a commonly recognized&#xD;
      &quot;barometer&quot; of cardiovascular risk. Taken together, these data suggest brachial FMD is an&#xD;
      ideal surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk to monitor the effects of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      plantarum 299v as proposed in this work. Michael Widlansky has extensive experience in the&#xD;
      use of FMD to measure endothelial function.&#xD;
