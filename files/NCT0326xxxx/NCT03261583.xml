      Blood transfusion is expensive, and has medical and safety consequences for patients who&#xD;
      benefit from it. In cardiac surgery, the data concerning the level of perioperative&#xD;
      transfusion are very heterogeneous from one center to another. In a large US cohort study of&#xD;
      798 cardiac surgery centers and 102,470 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery,&#xD;
      the rate of blood transfusion varies from 8 to 93% depending on the center. It would appear&#xD;
      that the largest and most experienced centers have a blood transfusion rate of around 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its beneficial role in reducing mortality induced by deep or poorly tolerated&#xD;
      anemia, current data from the literature also raise morbidity and mortality related to blood&#xD;
      transfusion. Murphy et al. Have shown, in an English cohort of cardiac surgery, that&#xD;
      transfusion of CGR was correlated with the occurrence of postoperative infections and&#xD;
      ischemic events, as well as early and late excess mortality. These effects appear as early as&#xD;
      the first transfused red blood cell, which is confirmed by a prospective Brazilian study with&#xD;
      a hazard ratio of death occurrence of 1.2 for each RBC transfused after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative anemia is found in 25% of patients in programmed cardiac surgery and its&#xD;
      etiologies are varied. Iron deficiency appears to be at the forefront, especially in coronary&#xD;
      patients for whom studies report up to 48% iron deficiency anemia. It may also be vitamin B12&#xD;
      deficiency or folate, chronic pathologies such as renal insufficiency, or any other common&#xD;
      cause of anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest European recommendations, iron deficiency should be defined as &lt;100&#xD;
      ng / mL ferritin or &lt;300 ng / mL ferritin combined with a transferrin saturation &lt;20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cardiac surgery, iron deficiency affects 37% of preoperative patients and is associated&#xD;
      with more frequent preoperative and postoperative anemia. It is an independent risk factor&#xD;
      for postoperative blood transfusion, even in the absence of preoperatively associated anemia&#xD;
      It is currently recommended to seek iron deficiency preoperatively during the discovery of&#xD;
      any microcytic anemia and to achieve iron substitution if found. And also to seek&#xD;
      supplemental iron deficiency in all patients with cardiac insufficiency.&#xD;
