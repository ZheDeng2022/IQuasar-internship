    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of&#xD;
      ASP8374 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
      Also primary purpose is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP8374 when&#xD;
      administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Last primary purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP8374 when administered&#xD;
      as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor effect (objective response&#xD;
      rate [ORR], duration of response [DOR], persistence of response after discontinuation, and&#xD;
      disease control rate [DCR]) of ASP8374 when administered as a single agent and in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP8374 as a&#xD;
      single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. After discontinuation of study drug&#xD;
      treatment (initial treatment and re-treatment), all participants will complete an end of&#xD;
      treatment visit along with 30-day and 90-day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of&#xD;
      ASP8374. Participants will be enrolled in respectively escalation cohorts or expansion&#xD;
      cohorts. The 90-day safety follow-up visit is optional for participants who discontinue due&#xD;
      to progressive disease or initiate new anticancer treatment after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation cohorts: Approximately 60 participants may be enrolled in the escalation cohorts&#xD;
      (approximately 30 participants for monotherapy and 30 participants for combination therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion cohorts: The total number of subjects in the expansion cohorts will depend on the&#xD;
      observed pharmacokinetic and antitumor activity. It is estimated that approximately 240&#xD;
      participants may be enrolled in the monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the number of participants in the escalation cohorts and the expansion cohorts will depend&#xD;
      on the observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity,&#xD;
      approximately 300 participants are expected to be enrolled.&#xD;

             serial slides obtained within 56 days prior to first dose of study treatment, or&#xD;
             subject is an appropriate candidate for tumor biopsy and is amenable to undergoing a&#xD;
             tumor biopsy (core needle biopsy or excision) during the screening period.This does&#xD;
             not apply to subjects with mCRPC without measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject in any expansion cohort, is an appropriate candidate for tumor biopsy and&#xD;
             consents to undergoing a tumor biopsy (core needle biopsy or excision) during the&#xD;
             treatment period as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject weighs &lt; 45 kg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received investigational therapy (other than an investigational epidermal&#xD;
             growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) in a subject with EGFR&#xD;
             activating mutations or ALK inhibitor in a subject with an ALK mutation) within 21&#xD;
             days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects&#xD;
             using a physiologic replacement dose of hydrocortisone or its equivalent (defined as&#xD;
             up to 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone up to 10 mg per day of prednisone) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or subject has&#xD;
             evidence of unstable CNS metastases even if asymptomatic (e.g., progression on scans).&#xD;
             Subjects with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if subject is clinically&#xD;
             stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to start of study treatment and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic&#xD;
             steroids (&gt; 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone or &gt; 10 mg per day of prednisone or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has known history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to a known ingredient&#xD;
             of ASP8374 or pembrolizumab or severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has an infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days prior to study drug&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             the start of study treatment or currently has an uncontrolled illness including, but&#xD;
             not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac&#xD;
             disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.&#xD;
