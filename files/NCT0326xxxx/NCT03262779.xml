      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab&#xD;
      after primary resistance to anti- programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis therapy can lead to&#xD;
      objective radiographic tumor regression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 percent of unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) and progression during or after standard first line chemotherapy will experience&#xD;
      tumor response to nivolumab. Treatment options for patients who are not responsive to&#xD;
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis inhibitor therapy are limited, and the mechanisms of primary&#xD;
      resistance are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced melanoma based on superiority to either agent alone5. The results of a phase I study&#xD;
      evaluating combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      (NCT01454102) were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)&#xD;
      meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6&#xD;
      weeks yielded an objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 of 39%, with one-year survival rate of 69% and grade 3-4&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse event rate of 33%. These results prompted an ongoing phase III&#xD;
      study comparing this regimen to standard first line chemotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy or&#xD;
      combination therapy with chemotherapy and nivolumab for patients with advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      (NCT02477826).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab&#xD;
      after primary resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor&#xD;
      regression. It is hypothesized that ipilimumab will enable more effective immune priming in&#xD;
      some patients, resulting in the trafficking of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to the tumor,&#xD;
      as well as depletion of tumor-permissive T regulatory cells. With concurrent nivolumab, PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition in the tumor will enable effective anti-tumor attack by tumor-specific T cells.&#xD;
      Serial tumor biopsies and blood collections will allow interrogation of changes in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (and periphery) that support this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will primarily enroll patients who have experienced progression of NSCLC&#xD;
      after anti-PD-1- axis therapy without initial response to such therapy ('primary&#xD;
      resistance'). A smaller cohort of patients with acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy&#xD;
      (i.e. progression after initial response) will additionally be accrued.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Signed Informed Consent B. Ability to comply with the protocol C. Age ≥18 years D.&#xD;
        Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., Stage&#xD;
        IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or recurrent) NSCLC (per the&#xD;
        American Joint Committee /AJCC staging system) E. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 F.&#xD;
        Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can be counted&#xD;
        as target lesions if clearly progressing after radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Chemotherapy-naive and treated patients will be eligible, with no limit on number of&#xD;
        prior therapies. Patients with NSCLC known to harbor an ALK rearrangement, or EGFR mutation&#xD;
        known to be sensitive to FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are only eligible&#xD;
        after experiencing disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to an FDA&#xD;
        approved EGFR TKI or ALK TKI, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with TKI-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR T790M tumor&#xD;
             must have received prior osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with crizotinib-treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a next&#xD;
             generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib or brigatinib) H. Prior palliative&#xD;
             radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        I. Anti- PD-1 Axis therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab,&#xD;
        atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) must be the most recent systemic anti-tumor treatment&#xD;
        received in all patients, with documented progressive disease. Last administration of&#xD;
        anti-PD-1 axis therapy must have been at least 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Patients to be enrolled to the primary cohort (primary resistance) must have had&#xD;
        progressive disease or stable disease less than 24 weeks as the best clinical response to&#xD;
        anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy b. Patients to be enrolled to the exploratory cohort (acquired&#xD;
        resistance) must have had stable disease for at least 24 weeks, partial response, or&#xD;
        complete response as the best clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy, with&#xD;
        subsequent progression of disease J. At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional,&#xD;
        core or forceps (transbronchial) biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo tumor biopsies&#xD;
        before starting trial therapy, and 9 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. If the initial biopsy will be excisional, the excised tumor cannot be counted as a&#xD;
        target lesion and there must be another lesion amenable to incisional, excisional, core or&#xD;
        forceps biopsy. In this scenario, the second biopsy can only be excisional if the lesion to&#xD;
        be excised is not a target lesion. b. Cytology tumor specimens (e.g. from fine-needle&#xD;
        biopsies, or drainage of pleural/ pericardial or ascites fluid) are not acceptable.&#xD;
        Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue component are also not acceptable&#xD;
        (i.e. decalcified tumor samples are not acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        K. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of&#xD;
        childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective&#xD;
        form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [&lt;1% per year] when&#xD;
        used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose&#xD;
        of trial therapy. Highly effective contraception is one with a failure rate of &lt;0.1%. Birth&#xD;
        control pills on their own do not achieve that rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine)&#xD;
             within 72 hours of the start of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who have recently given birth must no longer be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        L. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory results&#xD;
        obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:&#xD;

        2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥75,000/μL (transfusion to achieve this level is not permitted within 2&#xD;
             weeks of the first study drug administration)&#xD;

             liver metastases: AST and/or ALT≤5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum&#xD;
             bilirubin level ≤3 x ULN may be enrolled)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months&#xD;
        or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that&#xD;
        requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved&#xD;
        childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects who require&#xD;
        intermittent use of inhaled steroids or local steroid injections would not be excluded from&#xD;
        the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, or psoriasis not&#xD;
        requiring systemic therapy (within the past 3 years) will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
