      Condorde main objective is to evaluate the correlation between EGFR mutational status&#xD;
      determined after tumor biopsy and EGFR mutational status analyzed on ctDNA after liquid&#xD;
      biopsy. EGFR status will be assessed by real time PCR (rtPCR), digital PCR (dPCR) and Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) in patients with chemotherapy naive lung carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newest therapeutic breakthrough are often based on molecular analysis of tumoral tissue&#xD;
      before treatment initiation or after emergence of resistance. Tumoral tissue is commonly&#xD;
      obtained by biopsy. However, tumor biopsy is an invasive, scarcely repeatable and costly&#xD;
      technics. Moreover, tumor samples, obtained by biopsy, doesn't represent tumor heterogeneity&#xD;
      and cannot inform about tumor evolution over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent improvement have been done in detection and characterization of blood circulating&#xD;
      tumoral DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA reach regularly the blood stream after tumoral cell apoptosis or&#xD;
      necrosis and could be extract and sequenced by some molecular biology technics such as real&#xD;
      time PCR (rtPCR), digital PCR (dPCR) or next generation sequencing (NGS). Interesting,&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate that some genomic alterations of solid cancer can be&#xD;
      characterized after sequencing of ctDNA. Other experiments pointed that ctDNA level could be&#xD;
      linked to tumor stage and patient prognostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These progress lead to the development of a new non invasive method for extraction of ctDNA&#xD;
      called liquid biopsy (LB). LB could be useful for monitor tumoral genotype, assess tumor&#xD;
      response to treatment and detect residual tumor cells after curative treatment. Moreover LB&#xD;
      could be an essential method for study of tumor cells molecular alterations mechanisms during&#xD;
      targeted cancer therapies, when clinical resistance occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequently diagnosticated type of lung cancer.&#xD;
      Regular first line chemotherapy is based on the use of platinum salts. However, some&#xD;
      mutations in the EGFR gene could add sensitivity of NSCLC to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such&#xD;
      as gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib. Consequently, the search for molecular mutations in&#xD;
      genome of NSCLC cells is of prior interest for patients with clinically advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some studies demonstrate that mutational EGFR status of NSCLC was sharply&#xD;
      correlated between tumoral tissue, obtained by classical biopsy, and ctDNA, collected by&#xD;
      liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results provide promising data encouraging the use of LB for study of NSCLC ctDNA.&#xD;
      However some experimentations are needed to ensure these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that reason, CONCORDE clinical trial will evaluate the correlation between EGFR&#xD;
      mutational status determined after tumor biopsy and EGFR mutational status analyzed after&#xD;
      liquid biopsy. EGFR status will be assessed by real time PCR (rtPCR), digital PCR (dPCR) and&#xD;
      Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in patients with chemotherapy naive lung carcinoma.&#xD;
