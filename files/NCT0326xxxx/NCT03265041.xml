    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an effective treatment of complex, multi-vessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease(1) .The majority of these patients receive left internal mammary&#xD;
      artery (IMA) grafts to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and saphenous vein&#xD;
      grafts (SVGs) or other conduits to the remaining vessels. Based on small studies of selected&#xD;
      groups of patients, it is generally believed that SVGs have a 40% to 50% 10-year patency and&#xD;
      that the LIMA has a 90% to 95% 10-year patency The success of coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG) is dependent on the long-term patency of the arterial and venous grafts.(2) Graft&#xD;
      failure is a surrogate marker for future cardiac events, including repeat revascularization,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction ,and death(3)(4). Vein graft occlusion in the perioperative period is&#xD;
      due to thrombosis resulting from technical problems. Vein graft occlusion within the first&#xD;
      year is attributed to intimal proliferation, although after 1 year, atherosclerosis is&#xD;
      thought to be the dominant factor (5) . LIMA graft failure was defined as diffuse and &gt;95%&#xD;
      conduit narrowing (&quot;string sign&quot; When IMA graft failure occurs, technical error is the most&#xD;
      common cause in the early postoperative period, while late (and rare) IMA failure include&#xD;
      progressive fibro-intimal proliferation and atherosclerosis either in the IMA graft or in the&#xD;
      native LAD vessel)(6) Traditionally, graft patency has been evaluated with coronary&#xD;
      angiography (ICA) but, since the advent of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), the&#xD;
      temptation to use a noninvasive and widely available technique to study coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft (CABG) patients has been stronger. The introduction of scanners like 64-slice&#xD;
      and 128-slice upwards-along with new scan protocols opens new perspectives in non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of graft patency.(7) The pooled sensitivity and specificity of detecting complete&#xD;
      graft occlusions - according to( Barbero et al ,2016) ,was 99% and 99% respectively as&#xD;
      compared to the standard of coronary angiography. (8) Computed tomographic angiography,&#xD;
      labeled as Appropriate test for evaluation of bypass grafts and coronary anatomy (9)&#xD;
