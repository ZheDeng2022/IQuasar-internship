  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermatomyositis (DM) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) cause inflammation in the muscles.&#xD;
      People with DM and JDM can develop calcium deposits in places they should not, known as&#xD;
      calcinosis. Calcinosis can be painful and cause disabilities and other problems. Researchers&#xD;
      want to learn more about calcinosis to find treatments for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if sodium thiosulfate (STS) can treat people with DM with calcinosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 7 and older who have moderate or severe calcinosis. They must have stable DM and&#xD;
      calcium deposits in the torso or at least 2 limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength and function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have several visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7-day pre-treatment visit about 10 weeks before starting STS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment visits over 10 weeks. They will get STS 3 times a week through IV infusion.&#xD;
           They may be hospitalized the whole time. If they tolerate the drug, they may be&#xD;
           discharged at certain times. During these times, they will return for the infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3- to 5-day post-treatment visits 24 weeks and 62 weeks after starting STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits may include repeats of screening tests and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may be injected with&#xD;
           a radioactive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durometry: A small instrument applies pressure on the skin or exposed calcinosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of blood flow in the arms and fingernail blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calcinosis aspiration: A needle placed into areas of calcinosis removes liquid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcinosis, a serious complication of dermatomyositis, involves deposition of calcium&#xD;
      (carbonate apatite) in soft tissue, and can result in negative impacts on quality of life and&#xD;
      physical function. To date, there are no known effective therapies that are approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of dermatomyositis-associated calcinosis, and there is no consensus within the&#xD;
      medical community on the optimum treatment strategy for this often-debilitating condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few reports in the literature describe treatment successes with a variety of therapeutics;&#xD;
      however, these data are from anecdotal reports or case series and thus provide limited&#xD;
      scientific evidence of effectiveness. Recently published reports as well as personal&#xD;
      observations within our group have suggested that intravenous sodium thiosulfate treatment&#xD;
      may benefit calcinosis patients. In order to gather more robust data on the utility of this&#xD;
      medication in the treatment of calcinosis associated with adult and juvenile dermatomyositis,&#xD;
      we propose to evaluate its effects in the context of a prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll participants at a single center into a single-arm, open-label study, with&#xD;
      the overall objective of evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravenous sodium thiosulfate&#xD;
      use in patients with moderate to severe extensive calcinosis associated with juvenile and&#xD;
      adult dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll a maximum of 18 participants over 4 years into the full study, but up&#xD;
      to 250 patients may screen for study entry. Eligible patients will be age 7 or older, and&#xD;
      will have extensive calcinosis (defined as calcinosis involving the torso or 2 extremities)&#xD;
      and moderate to severe calcinosis (indicated by a calcinosis activity visual analogue scale&#xD;
      score of greater than or equal to 3.5 cm out of 10 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate evaluations performed at the NIH prior to initiation of therapy will be used as&#xD;
      baseline data to compare in a pairwise manner to the change in assessments following&#xD;
      treatment with sodium thiosulfate, with all other medications remaining stable. Study&#xD;
      treatment will be 16 g/m2 sodium thiosulfate administered 3 times weekly over a period of 10&#xD;
      weeks at the NIH. Subjects who complete 10 weeks of treatment or reach the primary end point&#xD;
      by week 6 will be considered completers. Following the treatment period, all participants&#xD;
      will return to the NIH for evaluations at weeks 24 and 62.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be change in calcinosis activity visual analogue scale score from&#xD;
      week 0 to week 10 on therapy, compared to the baseline change in calcinosis activity visual&#xD;
      analogue scale score from week -10 to week 0 pre-treatment. Secondary measures will evaluate&#xD;
      safety and changes in components of the Calcinosis Assessment Tool, clinical assessments of&#xD;
      calcinosis, Mawdsley Calcinosis Questionnaire, quality of life, functional disability, muscle&#xD;
      testing (manual and quantitative), laboratory parameters (muscle enzymes, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and endothelial activation markers), gene expression, calcification pathogenesis,&#xD;
      time to improvement, and imaging. Myositis disease activity and damage will also be assessed&#xD;
      by validated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of research studies will be incorporated into this clinical trial in an attempt to&#xD;
      understand the immunologic markers associated with calcification in dermatomyositis as well&#xD;
      as the immunologic effects of sodium thiosulfate treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Is taking any concomitant medications that are thought to alter sodium thiosulfate s&#xD;
             effects or pharmacokinetics. Once patients have met all other inclusion criteria and&#xD;
             no other exclusion criteria this criteria will be checked. A PharmD will evaluate the&#xD;
             patient's current medication list for medications with the potential for interaction&#xD;
             with sodium thiosulfate. Methodology is as follows: He or she will perform a search in&#xD;
             two individual validated medication interaction software programs. He or she will also&#xD;
             perform a literature search via PubMed for case reports of interactions with sodium&#xD;
             thiosulfate. As an additional safeguard, the PharmD will evaluate the medication list&#xD;
             utilizing principles of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics to attempt to identify any&#xD;
             potential interactions not yet documented in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has any health conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, significantly&#xD;
             increase the risk of taking sodium thiosulfate or participating in any of the study&#xD;
             procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Weighs less than 26 kilograms.**&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has a regimen of pulse steroids or IVIG that is at an interval besides every 1, 2, or&#xD;
             5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has a chronic infection that makes assessment of muscle disease difficult including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, hepatitis, HIV, HTLV 1, and HTLV 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has had a severe complication of diabetes in the past year prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Anemia with a HgB less than 10 at time of screening or deemed to be too low to safely&#xD;
             complete study by hematology consult team.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  We will attempt to enroll patients at a weight greater than 28 kg as these&#xD;
                  patients will be able to obtain all lab work for the study. Patients weighing 26&#xD;
                  to 28 kg will only be able to obtain some of the research blood work. Patients&#xD;
                  less than 26 kg of body weight will be unable to obtain all safety labs, so will&#xD;
                  not be able to enroll.&#xD;
