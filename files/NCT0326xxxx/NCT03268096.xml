  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of the evolution of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its long-term prognostic factors is&#xD;
      essential to guide the therapeutic management. However, it remains partial and concerns above&#xD;
      all data collected during the first years of the disease. The evolution towards disability&#xD;
      can only be assessed after a follow-up of more than 10 years and does not depend solely on&#xD;
      the initial inflammatory activity of the disease. We propose to realize a standardized&#xD;
      clinical assessment, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) and a cerebral MRI 15 years after&#xD;
      the first clinical manifestation of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and paraclinical assessment will consist in the realization of additional MRI&#xD;
      sequences in order to obtain more precise information on cerebral lesions (unconventional&#xD;
      parameters). Optical coherence tomography (new generation device) will also be performed on&#xD;
      both eyes to describe the thickness of the different layers of the retina. A clinical&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to describe the current clinical situation of patients (e.g. percentage of patients with&#xD;
           moderate or severe disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to explore the associations between MRI parameters, those measured with OCT and clinical&#xD;
           characteristics (disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to explore clinical and paraclinical prognostic factors of pejorative evolution&#xD;
           (disability, severe cerebral atrophy, etc.)&#xD;

    <description>Disability assessment will be carried out using the EDS (Expanded Disability Status) Scale.&#xD;
This scale ranges from 0 to 10. Binary or ordered variables will be considered with various thresholds (for example, a score equal to 3 corresponds to moderate disorders ; a score equal to 6 corresponds to major disorders (need of a stick to walk 100 meters)).</description>

    <description>Clinical and paraclinical assessment (cerebral MRI and Optical Coherence Tomography) will be carried out on the same day. Paraclinical evaluation consists in the realization of additional MRI sequences in order to obtain more precise information on brain lesions (unconventional parameters).
