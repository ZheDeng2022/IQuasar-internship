      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to compare transcutaneous CO2 (TCCO2) levels&#xD;
      measured non-invasively using the SenTec Transcutaneous CO2 Monitor to PaCO2 levels measured&#xD;
      on arterial blood gas (ABG) samples in neonatal patients being treated for respiratory&#xD;
      distress in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Memorial University Medical Center.&#xD;

      Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies Carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement is part of&#xD;
      the fundamental respiratory evaluation in an ICU, as both high and low values of CO2 can have&#xD;
      detrimental effects on neonatal health. The partial pressure of CO2 reflects ventilation,&#xD;
      which is the elimination of carbon dioxide. The ABG sample is the clinical tool most commonly&#xD;
      used to evaluate acid-base physiology at the bedside. It directly measures the pH, arterial&#xD;
      partial pressure of oxygen, and arterial partial pressure of CO2. Though direct measurement&#xD;
      of CO2 in the arterial blood is the most accurate way to assess the amount of CO2, it&#xD;
      requires blood sampling from the arteries and does not provide continuous monitoring of CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive tool for measuring PaCO2, such as the SenTec monitor, can help decrease blood&#xD;
      draws, thereby decreasing the incidence of iatrogenic anemia and the need for neonatal blood&#xD;
      transfusions. Blood samples are collected through arterial lines, capillary heel sticks, or&#xD;
      peripheral arterial punctures which are invasive and can be painful for the patient and may&#xD;
      potentially result in injury. Although an ABG in neonates typically only requires 0.3mL-0.5mL&#xD;
      of arterial blood, the need for frequent ABG sampling (every two to six hours) may result in&#xD;
      a significant amount of iatrogenic blood loss. A newborn has a total blood volume of only&#xD;
      80mL/kg. In addition, the transcutaneous sensor has potential monitoring advantages as&#xD;
      measurements are continuous rather than representative of a single point in time, as seen in&#xD;
      ABGs. Continuous monitoring can help to avoid fluctuations in CO2 levels which can&#xD;
      potentially result in neurologic injury in preterm babies, such as intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. One of the most beneficial aspects of the SenTec&#xD;
      monitor is that it displays CO2 levels in real time, allowing clinicians to monitor trends&#xD;
      and to intervene sooner if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have been conducted on transcutaneous monitors in newborns. One such study&#xD;
      evaluated the CO-OXSYS Digital Sensor (also known as the V-Sign Digital Sensor) made by&#xD;
      SenTec. 25 patients between the ages of 10 months to 79 years of age were studied. Each&#xD;
      sensor was placed on the tragus of each patient's ear. An ABG was obtained fifteen minutes&#xD;
      after sensor application and TCCO2 measurements were recorded at the same time. ABG samples&#xD;
      were analyzed with a Rapidpoint 405 analyzer. A reliable correlation was found between the&#xD;
      TCCO2 and the PaCO2 readings (R2-0.61, p=&lt;0.001). It was noted that age and temperature did&#xD;
      not affect the accuracy of the CO2 readings. This study concluded that with more sampling,&#xD;
      the CO-OXSYS Digital Sensor would be useful in a variety of clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second study was performed assessing the SenTec monitor during neonatal High Frequency&#xD;
      Oscillatory Ventilation. Fourteen neonatal patients were studied. The digital sensor was&#xD;
      applied to each patient on varying body parts that included the left chest, right chest, and&#xD;
      liver. Fifteen minutes after sensor application, an ABG was obtained and the simultaneously&#xD;
      displayed TCCO2 measurement was recorded. ABG measurements were subsequently analyzed using a&#xD;
      Siemens Rapidpoint 405 analyzer. A clinically acceptable correlation was found between the&#xD;
      TCCO2 and PaCO2 readings (R2=0.807, p=&lt;0.001). This study suggested the monitor could&#xD;
      certainly be used as an alternative to ABGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004 a study reviewed the TOSCA monitor, made by Linde Medical Sensors, which combined&#xD;
      pulse oximetry and TCCO2 monitoring. This machine used a single ear sensor which worked at 42&#xD;
      degrees C to enhance blood flow in capillaries below the sensor. This study included 60&#xD;
      neonates who had an ear sensor placed on the right earlobe. Ten minutes after placement, an&#xD;
      ABG was performed and compared to the TCCO2 reading. The transcutaneous readings were found&#xD;
      to be clinically acceptable when compared to the ABGs. A secondary benefit of the&#xD;
      transcutaneous monitoring on the earlobe was a decrease in the head movement of the neonate&#xD;
      to aid in maintaining a patent airway. In addition, the sensor did not have to be removed for&#xD;
      chest radiographs or while the parent was bonding with his or her infant in their lap (also&#xD;
      known as &quot;kangaroo care&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently completed study used the actual SenTec monitor I will be using. A total of 15&#xD;
      patients were included in this study with the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current weight &gt; =1000grams Need for mechanical ventilation Arterial access Signed informed&#xD;
      consent by parents/legal guardians The sensor was placed on the abdominal wall and when a&#xD;
      routine ABG sample was obtained, the reading from the transcutaneous device was recorded.&#xD;
      Photographs were also taken throughout the study to evaluate any injury to the skin from the&#xD;
      monitor. The photographs were randomized and a blinded reviewer rated the photographs as&#xD;
      normal, mild erythema, or burn/blistering. The reviewer of the photographs confirmed that&#xD;
      there were no adverse skin changes. It was concluded that the TCCO2 measurements obtained&#xD;
      correlated with the PaCO2 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims This research study is designed to assess the accuracy of SenTec transcutaneous&#xD;
      monitors for CO2 monitoring in neonatal patients. The data from this research may be used to&#xD;
      implement the SenTec monitors as part of the regular monitoring equipment used in the NICU at&#xD;
      Memorial University Medical Center. These results will contribute to my course of study by&#xD;
      aiding in my future research paper publication and poster presentation (to other ICU&#xD;
      attendings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative Organization The Level III NICU at Memorial University Medical Center will be&#xD;
      the sole participating unit. Registered nurses and/or respiratory therapists within the NICU&#xD;
      will be collecting the routine ABG samples. Respiratory therapists within the NICU will&#xD;
      analyze the ABG samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The design of the study will be an open-label, correlational prospective study.&#xD;
      The study population will be any neonate weighing greater than one kg at birth requiring an&#xD;
      arterial catheter for monitoring for cardiorespiratory distress. At the end of my study, if&#xD;
      it is found that the SenTec digital monitor is as accurate and valid as the ABG samples&#xD;
      collected and that no adverse skin changes are observed, I hope that the SenTec monitoring&#xD;
      system will be implemented into Memorial's regular NICU monitoring equipment. With approval&#xD;
      from the SenTec manufacturer, I will aim to write a paper and submit it to an appropriate&#xD;
      neonatal or critical care journal for future publication. In addition to the paper, I plan to&#xD;
      create a poster for presentation to critical care (PICU and NICU) unit staff (physicians,&#xD;
      RTs, RNs, and NPs) at Memorial University Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures The sampling plan will include any neonate with a birth weight over 1000g,&#xD;
      requiring an arterial line. Patients with significant pre-existing skin breakdown over the&#xD;
      abdominal area will be excluded from the study. Recruitment will occur exclusively in the&#xD;
      NICU. Consent will be obtained in the NICU once the arterial line has been placed. As the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, I, and/or other Dr. Daniel Sandler will obtain consent. We will&#xD;
      provide the patient's parents with a summary of the protocol of the study and brochures&#xD;
      providing information about the sensor and its manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no placebo study agents. This is going to be a validation study. The sensor&#xD;
      will be stored in the NICU. The sensor will be placed on the patient by the patient's bedside&#xD;
      RN. Potential adverse effects should be minor and limited to mild, local skin reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial TCCO2 measurements will be compared to PaCO2 levels measured on arterial blood gas&#xD;
      (ABG) samples obtained simultaneously on these patients. The sensor will be calibrated and&#xD;
      applied to the skin according to manufacturer instructions. Whenever an arterial blood gas is&#xD;
      collected for clinical indications, the transcutaneous monitor's reading will be&#xD;
      simultaneously recorded in a data log including the patient's initial diagnosis, gestational&#xD;
      age, sex, sensor location, birth weight, and body temperature. The skin of each infant will&#xD;
      be closely inspected for injury (such as irritation or breakdown) before the skin probe is&#xD;
      applied, and after each time that the probe is removed. Application skin sites will also be&#xD;
      photographed on entry to and exit from the study, and whenever the probe is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photographs taken and the data log will be stored in an Excel document on a Memorial&#xD;
      University Medical Center computer in the NICU. All study information will be password&#xD;
      protected. Only the investigators (Charli Cohen, Dr. Daniel Sandler), and Eric Clayton, the&#xD;
      study statistician, will have access to the study data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Plan There is a slight risk for minor skin reactions from the probe. This&#xD;
      sensor has been tested in newborns and it seems that any adverse skin events have been&#xD;
      minimal. The probe has not yet been tested in extremely premature babies (weighing less than&#xD;
      one kilogram at birth). We will constantly be monitoring the patient's safety during routine&#xD;
      unit checks. The study investigators, with the assistance of NICU staff members, will&#xD;
      identify, document, and report adverse events. A patient will be removed from the study if&#xD;
      the skin reaction becomes severe. To carefully monitor for skin changes, photographs will be&#xD;
      taken before and after application of the probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Observed mean difference between PaCO2 and TCCO2 &lt; 10 mmHg. Ha: Observed mean difference&#xD;
      between PaCO2 and TCCO2 &gt; 10 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be analyzed using the Bland Altman technique for assessing agreement&#xD;
      between two methods of clinical measurement6. Consistency between the PaCO2 and TCCO2 methods&#xD;
      will be quantified by constructing limits of agreement (LoA). These limits are determined by&#xD;
      using the observed mean and standard deviations of the differences between the two methods. A&#xD;
      scatterplot will be constructed in which the Y-axis contains the differences in the paired&#xD;
      measurements for each case (TCCO2 - PaCO2) and the X-axis contains the means of the same&#xD;
      paired measurements ((TCCO2 + PaCO2)/2). A line representing the observed mean difference&#xD;
      will be constructed parallel to the X-axis, as will two more lines at the points ± 1.96SD of&#xD;
      the mean difference. These lines represent the LoA. 95% confidence intervals for the upper&#xD;
      and lower LoA will be calculated. The pre-defined maximum acceptable difference between the&#xD;
      methods of measurement has been determined as 10 mmHg. If the upper 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      of the upper LoA and the lower 95% confidence interval of the lower LoA are both less than 10&#xD;
      mmHg from the observed mean difference, the H_0 will be accepted and the two measurement&#xD;
      methods will be said to be in agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the published data and sample size methods, with α=0.05, β=0.20, expected mean&#xD;
      difference (D = -3.21 mmHg), expected standard deviation (SD = 3.01 mmHg), and the clinically&#xD;
      significant maximum allowed difference between the methods (δ=10 mmHg), the required minimum&#xD;
      number of paired measurements is 266.&#xD;
