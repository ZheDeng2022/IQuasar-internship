    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial aims to determine if cells from a patient's own adipose tissue&#xD;
      is safe and capable of helping regenerate the femoral head in patients with osteonecrosis.&#xD;
      The standard of care is known as hip decompression which simply removes dead tissue from the&#xD;
      femoral head and creates a new cavity to be filled in by healthy bone. This trial will use&#xD;
      hip decompression in one hip and hip decompression supplemented with adipose derived&#xD;
      regenerative cells in patients with osteonecrosis in both of their hips.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data suggest that ADRC may serve as a safe and efficacious adjuvant&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of ON. However, to the authors knowledge no RCT in the United States&#xD;
      has formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor&#xD;
      of this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the&#xD;
      femoral head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Celution 800/GP System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from&#xD;
      lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an&#xD;
      orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a CE Mark registration in&#xD;
      Europe and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a&#xD;
      clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by&#xD;
      either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of&#xD;
      original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of&#xD;
      relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution 800/GP System&#xD;
      is the only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling&#xD;
      multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (Celase®) is of a&#xD;
      clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of&#xD;
      mammalian products.&#xD;
