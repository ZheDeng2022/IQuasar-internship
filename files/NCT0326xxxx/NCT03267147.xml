      Non-interventional, prospective, observational study to assess the relative risk of anti-CCP&#xD;
      positive patients to develop (subclinical) signs of inflammation in accordance with early&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in a population without pre-classified RA but new1 onset of&#xD;
      non-specific musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms in general practices in Germany and subsequent 36&#xD;
      months follow-up by rheumatologists&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies of early arthritis cohorts have shown that a large number of early arthritis patients&#xD;
      cannot be accurately diagnosed at their first visit, and hence are often referred as&#xD;
      undifferentiated arthritis patients. If patients are found to be anti-CCP(+) when referred to&#xD;
      the clinician, however, more than 90% develop RA within 3 years - in contrast to only 30% of&#xD;
      the anti-CCP(-) patients. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies in undifferentiated arthritis&#xD;
      therefore accurately predicts development of RA. Anti-CCP antibodies are very specific for&#xD;
      RA, and they are produced at significant level very early in disease. The specificity of&#xD;
      anti-CCP antibodies for the diagnosis of RA is high (94.1-99.0%). Moreover, it has been&#xD;
      reported that anti-CCP antibodies can be present many years before the first visit to the&#xD;
      clinic (up to 18 years). Furthermore, the presence of anti-CCP antibodies at the first visit&#xD;
      to the clinician predicts radiographic progression, as demonstrated by many studies that have&#xD;
      shown a strong association of anti-CCP positivity with the development of bone erosions.Early&#xD;
      diagnosis of RA coupled with rational use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD)&#xD;
      has been shown to have a favourable effect on the course of the disease. Early and accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis has therefore become increasingly important. Implementing anti-CCP quick tests in&#xD;
      general practices could facilitate an early detection of RA or the allocation to a high risk&#xD;
      RA group. This, in turn, would guarantee an early referral of the patient to a rheumatologist&#xD;
      and together with other clinical examinations can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
      As has been shown in many studies an early intervention is vital to preserve joint function&#xD;
      and to improve patient care. In this study, we want to assess the relative risk for patients&#xD;
      derived from GPs in Germany with new onset of non-specific MSK symptoms and anti-CCP test&#xD;
      positivity to develop (subclinical) signs of inflammation in accordance with early RA. Those&#xD;
      patients will be identified in general practices and will be tested for anti-CCP status.&#xD;
      Anti-CCP positive patients will then be introduced to a rheumatologist to validate anti-CCP&#xD;
      status and examine presence of clinical signs of early RA in addition to subclinical signs of&#xD;
      MSK inflammation. Furthermore, to focus on the possibility of early detection of anti-CCP&#xD;
      before the onset of clinically active arthritis, patients will be followed-up by a&#xD;
      rheumatologist until detection of early RA or up to 36 months in total. Early RA will be&#xD;
      examined using standard of care for signs of inflammation including clinical examination for&#xD;
      swollen and tender joints. In addition, ultrasound will be performed to assess joint&#xD;
      inflammation as well as fluorescence optical imaging technique (Xiralite®) to sensitively&#xD;
      illustrate changes in microvascularisation as a marker of subclinical inflammation. In cases&#xD;
      of RA diagnosis, the study ends with the date of diagnosis and patients will receive&#xD;
      treatment according to local guidelines earlier and medical care will be continued in&#xD;
      clinical routine care conditions outside of the study. Moreover, the cooperation status&#xD;
      between GPs and rheumatologists will be evaluated using qualitative interviews. Feasibility&#xD;
      of the diagnosis of early RA in at risk patients as well as the feasibility of the&#xD;
      transferral of these patients from the general practice to the rheumatologist will be&#xD;
      assessed. Training of GPs for detection of early RA will be improved. Overall, the hypothesis&#xD;
      of the study is that patients with new onset of unspecific MSK-symptoms and who are positive&#xD;
      for anti-CCP, which both are risk factors for developing RA, will be earlier introduced to&#xD;
      and monitored by a rheumatologist for proper clinical examination and potential treatment&#xD;
      when establishing RA, which in turn will not only improve patient care, disease outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life, but might also be cost effective.&#xD;
