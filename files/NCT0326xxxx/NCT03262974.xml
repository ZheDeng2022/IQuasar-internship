    <textblock>
      Imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used for treatment of Philadelphia positive&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite its efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, there&#xD;
      is a large inter-individual variability in imatinib plasma concentrations, which may lead to&#xD;
      treatment failure and disease progression. Polymorphisms in genes related to absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of imatinib may affect the bioavailability and&#xD;
      consequently the response to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms in certain&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes [CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP2C8*3 (rs11572080 and rs10509681)] and membrane&#xD;
      transporters [ABCB1 2677G&gt;T/A (rs2032582) and SLC22A1 1222A &gt; G (rs628031)] by PCR on the&#xD;
      plasma level (by HPLC-UV) and molecular response (MMR) of imatinib in patients with CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to provide CML patients with a personalized treatment option, thereby&#xD;
      probably improving the response and reducing the side effects.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease with an incidence of one to&#xD;
      two cases per 100,000 adults. It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of&#xD;
      leukemia in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in the early 21st century&#xD;
      is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of CML. In the vast majority of patients,&#xD;
      treatment with imatinib induces cytogenetic and even molecular responses with very low or&#xD;
      undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. These patients remain free from progression to blast&#xD;
      crisis. However, imatinib does not cure the disease because it is unable to eradicate the&#xD;
      leukaemic stem cells, which therefore provides a potential reservoir for relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, there is a large inter-individual&#xD;
      variability in imatinib plasma concentrations, which may lead to treatment failure and&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphisms in genes related to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of&#xD;
      imatinib may affect the bioavailability and consequently the response to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the possible effect of genetic polymorphisms in certain&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes [CYP3A5 * 3 (rs 776746), CYP2C8 * 3 (rs 11572080 and rs 10509681)] and&#xD;
      membrane transporters [ABCB1 2677 G&gt;T/A (rs 2032582) and SLC22A1 1222 A &gt; G (rs 628031)] on&#xD;
      the plasma level and molecular response (MMR) of imatinib in patients with CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These polymorphisms were selected based on their relevance to the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      imatinib and on their frequency in Caucasians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also aims to provide CML patients with a personalized treatment option, thereby&#xD;
      probably improving the response and reducing the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with documented hematological, cytogenetic and molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis of chronic phase CML, who are on continuous treatment with 400 mg oral dose of&#xD;
      imatinib per day for at least 12 month at Medical Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (SECI), Assiut. Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are: duration of imatinib therapy less than 12 months, poor compliance to&#xD;
      treatment and identification of gene mutation(s) in the kinase domain of BCR- ABL1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided into 2 groups according to their molecular response to imatinib&#xD;
      as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: CML patients with MMR Group II: CML patients without MMR Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will be compared as regard the plasma level of imatinib and the selected genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three blood samples (3 ml for each) will be collected into EDTA-containing tubes by&#xD;
      venipuncture for measurement of imatinib plasma level, measurement of BCR- ABL1 transcription&#xD;
      level and for genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Imatinib trough level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected after 24 hours from the previous dose (trough) and after at&#xD;
      least 5 days of regular use of the drug to ensure that the steady state is reached. Within 1&#xD;
      hour of collection, the blood samples will be centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room&#xD;
      temperature and will be stored at -20°C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma level of imatinib will be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with&#xD;
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) according to the method described by Barratt et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of BCR- ABL1 transcription level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA will be extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes by the available RNA extraction&#xD;
      kits. The BCR- ABL1 transcription level will be quantified by using real-time polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) analysis to assess the molecular response to imatinib after 12 months of&#xD;
      treatment with imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA will be extracted from leukocytes by the available DNA extraction kits and will be&#xD;
      stored at -80°C until genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping will be performed for CYP3A5 * 3 (rs 776746), CYP2C8 * 3 (rs 11572080 and rs&#xD;
      10509681), ABCB1 2677 G&gt;T/A (rs 2032582) and SLC22A1 1222 A &gt; G (rs 628031) by the PCR&#xD;

    <description>A major molecular response (MMR) to imatinib therapy is defined as a BCR-ABL1 RNA level ≤ 0.1% on the International Scale (a consensus standardized measurement scale intended to allow direct comparison of BCR-ABL1 RNA levels in any laboratory adopting its use). The International Scale was specifically designed so that, by definition, 100% is the median pretreatment baseline level of BCR-ABL1 RNA in early chronic phase CML and a 1,000-fold reduction from baseline is defined as 0.1% (MMR) (Press,</description>
