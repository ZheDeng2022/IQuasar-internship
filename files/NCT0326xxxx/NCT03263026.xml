    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study is planned to enroll approximately 235&#xD;
      treatment-naïve subjects with high-risk Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to R-CHOP plus enzastaurin or R CHOP (plus placebo during induction). All&#xD;
      subjects will receive up to 6 cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of treatment. PET/ CT will be used&#xD;
      to assess radiographic response at the end of treatment. Each subject's treatment assignment&#xD;
      will be unblinded after initial phase of treatment. Subjects randomized to the enzastaurin&#xD;
      arm who have a response will be offered maintenance treatment of the study drug for up to 2&#xD;
      additional years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common of the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas,&#xD;
      accounting for between 30%-40% of all cases. The incidence of DLBCL generally increases with&#xD;
      age and roughly half of all patients are over the age of 60 at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL is classified as an aggressive lymphoma meaning that its clinical course can progress&#xD;
      rapidly to death. Nevertheless, patients with DLBCL can be cured with the appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. The current standard of care treatment for DLBCL consists of rituximab added to&#xD;
      the anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (NCCN Treatment Guidelines). This regimen is referred&#xD;
      to as R-CHOP immunochemotherapy. For DLBCL as a whole, R-CHOP immunochemotherapy has resulted&#xD;
      in cure rates of approximately 60%. However, for individual patients 5-year survival rates&#xD;
      can range from 90% for low-risk patients to less than 50% for high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most important, for those subjects refractory to R-CHOP therapy less than 10% achieve a&#xD;
      durable remission with secondary therapy. Thus, while R-CHOP remains the standard treatment&#xD;
      for high-risk, advanced-stage DLBCL, approximately 30-40% of patients fail front-line therapy&#xD;
      with most not achieving complete response or with early relapse. An essential step to move&#xD;
      forward and improve the outcomes of these patients is to increase the rate of complete&#xD;
      response to front-line R-CHOP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, there has been a great deal of effort placed on attempting to define disease&#xD;
      characteristics that predispose patients to a poorer prognosis with R-CHOP therapy. Molecular&#xD;
      and gene expression profiling of tumors and a variety of clinical prognostic indices have&#xD;
      been used to identify patients at higher risk of failing R-CHOP immunochemotherapy. While&#xD;
      this work has identified subgroups of patients who do not respond well to R-CHOP, to date&#xD;
      these efforts have not resulted in substantial gains in response to front-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denovo Biopharma (Denovo) has pioneered an alternative approach to this challenging problem.&#xD;
      Denovo has developed a model that employs sophisticated pharmacogenomic testing to detect&#xD;
      somatic biomarkers that identify those subjects who responded to a particular study treatment&#xD;
      with the aim of re-studying the drug of interest, in this case enzastaurin, in an enriched&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying this technology to archived DNA samples from completed studies of enzastaurin in&#xD;
      subjects with DLBCL, Denovo has identified a somatic biomarker that reliably identified&#xD;
      subjects for whom the study treatment significantly prolonged survival. Enzastaurin is an&#xD;
      oral serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, that targets the PKC, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K) and AKT pathways to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and&#xD;
      suppress tumor-induced angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to prospectively assess the effect on survival of adding&#xD;
      enzastaurin to R-CHOP immunochemotherapy in the front-line treatment of an enriched&#xD;
      population of subjects with DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzastaurin, an acyclic bisindolylmaleimide, is a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC-beta.&#xD;
      At plasma concentrations achieved clinically, enzastaurin and its metabolites suppress&#xD;
      signaling not only through PKC, but also through the PI3K/AKT pathway; these pathways promote&#xD;
      tumor-induced angiogenesis, as well as tumor cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly,&#xD;
      inhibition of signaling pathways by enzastaurin suppresses the phosphorylation of glycogen&#xD;
      synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3-beta) at ser9, induces cell death (apoptosis), and suppresses&#xD;
      proliferation in cultured cell lines from human colon cancers, glioblastoma and lymphomas.&#xD;
      Oral dosing with enzastaurin to achieve exposure levels similar to that in human clinical&#xD;
      studies suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and the&#xD;
      growth of human colon cancer and glioblastoma xenografts. These studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that enzastaurin can suppress tumor growth through multiple mechanisms: the direct effect of&#xD;
      inducing tumor cell death, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, and the indirect effect of&#xD;
      suppressing tumor-induced angiogenesis.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following: R-CHOP plus enzastaurin or R-CHOP plus placebo, during two treatment periods: induction and maintenance. Induction phase: all subjects will receive R-CHOP for up to six, 21-day cycles. Subjects in the enzastaurin arm will receive a 1125 mg loading dose on Day 2 followed by 500 mg daily. Subjects in the placebo arm will take an identical number of tablets.&#xD;
After 4-&lt;6 cycles of induction therapy treatment assignment will be unblinded. Subjects in the enzastaurin arm who have achieved a response will have the opportunity to continue in the single-agent, maintenance phase of the study, and will receive single-agent enzastaurin at 500 mg/day for up to 2 years. Eligible subjects must begin the maintenance phase of the study within 6 weeks of completing induction therapy.</intervention_model_description>
