    <textblock>
      Alpha-Mannosidosis is a rare lysosomal storage disorder of the Glycoprotein family of&#xD;
      diseases and is closely related to Mucopolysaccharidoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha-Mannosidosis was first described by Dr Oekerman, from Lund in Sweden in 1967. There is&#xD;
      another variant known as Beta-Mannosidosis, which is extremely rare and has produced a wide&#xD;
      range of clinical abnormalities in the few patients described with this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Alpha-Mannosidosis is a rare inherited disorder that causes problems in many organs and&#xD;
      tissues of the body. Affected individuals may have intellectual disability, distinctive&#xD;
      facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Characteristic facial features can include a&#xD;
      large head, prominent forehead, low hairline, rounded eyebrows, large ears, flattened bridge&#xD;
      of the nose, protruding jaw, widely spaced teeth, overgrown gums, and large tongue. The&#xD;
      skeletal abnormalities that can occur in this disorder include reduced bone density&#xD;
      (osteopenia), thickening of the bones at the top of the skull (calvaria), deformations of the&#xD;
      bones in the spine (vertebrae), bowed legs or knock knees, and deterioration of the bones and&#xD;
      joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Affected individuals may also experience difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia);&#xD;
      muscle weakness (myopathy); delay in developing motor skills such as sitting and walking;&#xD;
      speech impairments; increased risk of infections; enlargement of the liver and spleen&#xD;
      (hepatosplenomegaly); a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocepha-lus); hearing loss; and a&#xD;
      clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract). Some people with Alpha-Mannosidosis experience&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, or hallucinations; episodes of psychiatric&#xD;
      disturbance may be triggered by stressors such as having undergone surgery, emotional upset,&#xD;
      or changes in routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signs and symptoms of Alpha-Mannosidosis can range from mild to severe. The disorder may&#xD;
      appear in infancy with rapid progression and severe neurological deterioration. Individuals&#xD;
      with this early-onset form of Alpha-Mannosidosis often do not survive past childhood. In the&#xD;
      most severe cases, an affected fetus may die before birth. Other individuals with&#xD;
      Alpha-Mannosidosis experience milder signs and symptoms that appear later and progress more&#xD;
      slowly. People with later-onset alpha-mannosidosis may survive into their fifties. The&#xD;
      mildest cases may be detected only through laboratory testing and result in few if any&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha-mannosidosis is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 500,000 people worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the MAN2B1 gene cause Alpha-Mannosidosis. This gene provides instructions for&#xD;
      making the enzyme alpha-mannosidase. This enzyme works in the lysosomes, which are&#xD;
      compartments that digest and recycle materials in the cell. With-in lysosomes, the enzyme&#xD;
      helps break down complexes of sugar molecules (oligo-saccharides) attached to certain&#xD;
      proteins (glycoproteins). In particular, alpha-mannosidase helps break down oligosaccharides&#xD;
      containing a sugar molecule called mannose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the MAN2B1 gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-mannosidase enzyme to&#xD;
      perform its role in breaking down mannose-containing oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides&#xD;
      accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Tissues and&#xD;
      organs are damaged by the abnormal accumulation of oligosaccharides and the resulting cell&#xD;
      death, leading to the characteristic features of Alpha-Mannosidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future&#xD;
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose&#xD;
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry 2,7 ml&#xD;
      EDTA blood or a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct Mannosidosis&#xD;
      diagnosis in those patients where up to the en-rollment in the study no genetic testing has&#xD;
      been done, sequencing of Manno-sidosis disease will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be done at the Centogene AG Am Strande 7 18055 Rostock Germany&#xD;
