  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) also known as kala-azar is a public health problem in Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Since 2005 a national kala-azar elimination program is going on in the country. The program&#xD;
      has preparatory, attack, consolidation and maintenance phases. The target of the program is&#xD;
      to reduce the VL incidence less than 1 per 10,000 people at upazila (sub-district) level in&#xD;
      VL endemic upazilas of the country. The program is heading successfully to its consolidation&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During attack phase house to house search for VL suspects and also suspects with&#xD;
      Post-kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) was the tool for early diagnosis of VL and PKDL&#xD;
      cases. Indoor residual spraying with insecticide (Deltamethrin) was the method for sand fly&#xD;
      control to reduce the transmission of the disease. Since in the consolidation phase the VL&#xD;
      case load is many times less than that in the attack phase, house to house search for VL and&#xD;
      PKDL cases and IRS for vector control is no more cost-effective for the program. Therefore&#xD;
      there is a need for alternative methods for active search of VL and PKDL cases and method for&#xD;
      sand fly control, appropriate for the consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators propose to investigate the efficacy of Inesfly 5AIGRNG&#xD;
      TM containing Alphacypermethrin 0.7%; D-Allethin 1.0% and Pyriproxyphen (0.063%), commercial&#xD;
      available durable wall lining (DWL), impregnated of existing bed-net with insecticide tablet,&#xD;
      KO TAB 123, indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Delthamethrin against a control group&#xD;
      Methods: A cluster randomized controlled design to measure sand fly density reduction at&#xD;
      intervention household as well as sand fly mortality by entomological methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables: reduction of sand fly density at intervention household and sand&#xD;
      fly corrected mortality on intervention surfaces compare to control households/conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the efficacy Inesfly 5AIGRNG TM containing&#xD;
      Alphacypermethrin 0.7%; D-Allethin 1.0% and Pyriproxyphen (0.063%), and other intervention&#xD;
      with control group. The formulation is vinyl paint with an aqueous base, with the active&#xD;
      ingredients residing within Ca CO3 and resin microcapsules, allowing a gradual release of&#xD;
      active ingredients. Microcapsules range from one to several hundred micrometers in size.&#xD;
      Inesfly has been tested for control of malaria and chagas disease vector with encouraging&#xD;
      results. The product is effective even against vectors, resistant to pyrethroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized control trial will be performed with Inesfly 5AIGRNG TM containing&#xD;
      Alphacypermethrin 0.7%; D-Allethin 1.0% and Pyriproxyphen (0.063%), commercial available&#xD;
      durable wall lining (DWL), impregnated of existing bed-net with insecticide tablet, KO TAB&#xD;
      123, indoor residual spraying (IRS) with Delthamethrin against a control group (study with 5&#xD;
      arms). The study will be carried out in villages located in Mymensingh District , one of the&#xD;
      high VL endemic district in Bangladesh. The VL burden of the villages will be estimated using&#xD;
      the VL case reports in the last 12 months. Four high endemic villages will be selected for&#xD;
      the study. As per sample size calculation the investigators need minimum 31 households to see&#xD;
      the efficacy of the interventions (see sample size calculation part below). The investigators&#xD;
      will include 50 households for each intervention and 50 for control (No intervention).&#xD;
      Twenty-five households (HHs) from each village will be selected randomly which will be&#xD;
      considered as a cluster. Field Research Assistant will be listed all the study households.&#xD;
      Only subjects who agree to participate and freely signed the consent form will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Household roster and household head interview for socio-demographic,&#xD;
      socio-economic and knowledge about VL and VL vectors will be done. Based on sample size&#xD;
      calculation, 18 HHs from each cluster will be selected randomly for entomological analysis&#xD;
      which includes sand fly density measurement (base line and 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 15, 18, 21 and 24&#xD;
      months after intervention), WHO Cone bioassay on the intervention surfaces and control&#xD;
      surfaces at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months after intervention After performing&#xD;
      baseline sand fly density measurements, clusters will be redefined with High density (sand&#xD;
      fly density =&gt;50th percentile), and low (sand fly density (&lt;50th percentile). One cluster&#xD;
      will be selected randomly from each density group for the intervention with Inesfly,&#xD;
      commercial DWL, and the control group with no intervention. All groups will receive the&#xD;
      routine vector control services by the national program. Acceptability survey of the&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted at 6 weeks since intervention to see the community acceptance&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entomological methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sand fly collection and density measurement For the entomological activities for objective 2&#xD;
      and objective 3 HH head will be informed and his/her informed, written voluntary consent will&#xD;
      be obtained before the start of any activities. HH head and members will be requested one day&#xD;
      before by the research team to make space for conduct installation of DWL / wall paining with&#xD;
      Inesfly by removing materials including furniture to a safe place. They also will be informed&#xD;
      that for entomological activities i.e. for collection of sand fly by CDC light trap research&#xD;
      team will visit the HH for two consecutive days as on day one they will visit in the evening&#xD;
      to place CDC light trap in a corner of the main room and to take it out on the following&#xD;
      morning. As sand fly collection will be done before intervention and at 1 month, 6 months and&#xD;
      12 months after intervention research team will visit the HH 4 times for sand fly collection.&#xD;
      In addition to conduct the WHO Cone bioassay test which will be done again at 1 month, 3&#xD;
      months and 12 months since intervention the HH will be visited again 3 times by the research&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sand flies will be collected on two consecutive nights with CDC light traps by trained&#xD;
      personnel with guidance from a member of the study team. Light traps will be kept in a corner&#xD;
      from 6 pm to 6 am, 2 inch away from the wall with a distance of 6 inches between the floor&#xD;
      and the bottom of the sac. The sand fly density will be expressed as number of P. argentipes&#xD;
      per light trap per night. Sand fly identification will be done as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon collection, sand flies will be segregated and labeled by batch indicating the date&#xD;
           and the pre-printed batch numbers. Sand fly numbers and sex will be identified under&#xD;
           microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphological identification will be done in the field using the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Phlebotomus argentipes Pa: Black thorax+silvering shining of the tarsal tip of the&#xD;
      leg+3mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii. Phlebotomus papatasi Pp: Brown to yellow thorax+3mm. viii. Sergentomyia sp Sr:I1-2mm c.&#xD;
      Sex and physiological status ix. Males: external genitalia with claspers x. Females: without&#xD;
      claspers, Blood-fed, unfed, gravid (no undigested blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO Cone Bioassay Test The WHO cone bioassays will be performed using the cone method (WHOPES&#xD;
      2005.11) on treated and non-treated bed-nets with wild caught (manually collected) sandflies&#xD;
      at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after intervention. Bioassays will be carried out at room&#xD;
      temperature at 25o- 29oC and 75-85% humidity. Resting sandflies will be collected manually by&#xD;
      aspirator during early morning and evening. In each net, 10-12 female sand flies will be&#xD;
      introduced in each of the cones placed against the DWL / Wall for 30 minutes. The sand flies&#xD;
      will be then transferred from each cone to a paper cup for observation. They will be observed&#xD;
      over 24 hours to calculate the mortality. The mortality rates of sand flies will be corrected&#xD;
      with Abbot's formula (WHOPES 2005.11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of efficacy of interventions: Efficacy will be defined by the reduction of&#xD;
      sandfly density by intervention compared to control measured by sandfly density at 1 months,&#xD;
      6 months and 12 months after intervention; percentage mortality of sand-fly assessed by WHO&#xD;
      Cone Bioassay test on DWL and wall after 1 months, 6 months and 12 months following&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
