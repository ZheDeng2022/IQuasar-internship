  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK525762 is a novel inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins. Trametinib is&#xD;
      a potent inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins (MEK1 and MEK2).&#xD;
      GSK525762 and trametinib are critical for growth and survival of tumor cells. This will be&#xD;
      the first study demonstrating the synergistic effect of BET inhibitor and MEK inhibitor&#xD;
      administered together against tumor cell growth. This study aims to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of combination of GSK525762 and trametinib&#xD;
      when administered concomitantly to subjects with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and rat&#xD;
      sarcoma virus oncogene homolog (Ras) mutated solid tumors. The study will be conducted in two&#xD;
      parts; part 1 will consists of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts and part 2 will&#xD;
      consists of four disease specific cohorts (SCLC, Ras-mutated adenocarcinoma [RMAC] of the&#xD;
      colon [Ras-mutated colorectal cancer {RMCRC}] and/or rectum, Ras-mutated non small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer [RMNSCLC], Ras-mutated pancreatic adenocarcinoma [RMPAC]) and an optional &quot;basket&quot;&#xD;
      cohort (Ras-pathway activated solid tumors [RAST]). Part 1 will focus on selection of the&#xD;
      Part 2 dose based on safety/tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy. Part 2 will investigate the&#xD;
      overall response rate and clinical response. The total duration of study will be&#xD;
      approximately three years (nine to twelve months for part 1 and two years for part 2).&#xD;
      Approximately 138-156 subjects will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
