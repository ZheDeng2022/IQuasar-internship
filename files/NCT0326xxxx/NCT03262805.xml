  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to assess the pain relieving effect of 4-weeks ingestion of&#xD;
      this commercialized dietary supplement (Lanconone®, Enovate Biolife, LLC, 1000 mg twice per&#xD;
      day) in mild to moderate OA subjects. Also, the current study intends to assess the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of long term administration of Lanconone in larger sample size as compared to&#xD;
      the earlier studies.15,16 The study also intends to analyse the effect on joint stiffness and&#xD;
      function by means of self-reported WOMAC &amp; Lequesne questionnaire.The effect of IP on&#xD;
      clinically proven biomarker, hs-CRP will be analyzed in comparison with placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been planned to evaluate the efficacy of Lanconone® in enhancing the overall&#xD;
      joint health in the population of ≥ 40 years of age during the daily life activities by the&#xD;
      reduction of the joint pain and discomfort. Assessment of pain is the primary objective which&#xD;
      will be done by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).&#xD;
      It is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health&#xD;
      professionals to evaluate the severity of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The early onset of action (3 days after&#xD;
      commencement of the IP administration) for pain relief which was not captured in the past&#xD;
      studies, will be captured in the current study by the telephonic assessment of the study&#xD;
      subjects. Lequesne et al developed an index of severity for osteoarthritis for the knee which&#xD;
      can be used to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Unlike the earlier&#xD;
      studies, we will use the Lequesne Functional Index (LFI) to assess the extent of joint health&#xD;
      degeneration. In relation to OA, elevated levels of hs-CRP have been correlated with symptoms&#xD;
      of joint pain and stiffness. Hence, we decided to analyze the hs-crp levels as one of the&#xD;
      secondary objectives. Also, the rescue medication consumption has been limited to lower per&#xD;
      day consumption compared to earlier studies to avoid the placebo effect influence on the&#xD;
      study results. The efficacy of the IP in sustaining the pain relieving effect will be&#xD;
      analyzed on day 35, i.e. one week after the end of the treatment.&#xD;
