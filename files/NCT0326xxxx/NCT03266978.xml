  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction damages the regional myocardium that undergoes ischemia&#xD;
      and necrosis, resulting in impairment of both systolic and diastolic functions of the heart.&#xD;
      Left ventricular function and myocardial infarct size both serve as the main determinants Of&#xD;
      patients' outcome after myocardial infarction. Timely management of ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, using reperfusion therapy, including fibrinolysis and primary percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention, leads to a better outcome for these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reperfusion failure is attributed to different factors, including diabetes. Several&#xD;
      mechanisms have been proposed for the harmful effects of hyperglycemia after acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Association of hyperglycemia with the activation of blood coagulation has been&#xD;
      well studied; it could induce a shortening of the fibrinogen half-life, increase in&#xD;
      fibrinopeptide A, fragments of pro-thrombin in factor VII, and platelet aggregation, all of&#xD;
      which could lead to increased activation of thrombosis. Hyperglycemia at admission is&#xD;
      associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers, enhanced expression of cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-cells, and reduced expression of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, indicating&#xD;
      its association with increased inflammatory immune process after acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      It also could be associated with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and possibly,&#xD;
      abolition of protective ischemic preconditioning. Other possible mechanism of harmful effects&#xD;
      of acute hyperglycemia is microvascular dysfunction after coronary revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the influence of diabetes mellitus on clinical outcome in the thrombolytic era of&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, GUSTO-I trial showed that patients with diabetes mellitus have a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of both early and late mortality, which may be attributed to&#xD;
      more advanced coronary artery disease and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the HORIZONS-AMI study showed that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      had similarly poor prognosis after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction patients as those with previously established diabetes mellitus, newly&#xD;
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus was based on HgbA1c levels following admission and did not assess&#xD;
      for blood glucose levels at admission or during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the effect of diabetes mellitus on left ventricular systolic function, diabetic&#xD;
      patients with first ST-elevation myocardial infarction had reduced left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      function, measured with speckle-tracking strain, compared with non-diabetic patients at&#xD;
      baseline and at 6-month follow up, despite similar left ventricular ejection fraction in both&#xD;
      groups. Similarly, according to the ischemic cascade, diastolic function is expected to be&#xD;
      affected with variable degrees among diabetic, prediabetic and non-diabetic ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timmer et al, studied the effect of admission stress hyperglycemia and that of chronic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia (elevated levels of HbA1c in patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus) on&#xD;
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention; both elevated glucose and HbA1c levels were associated with adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      However elevated glucose but not elevated HbA1c was associated with larger enzymatic infarct&#xD;
      size and high early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Ota et al, demonstrated the association between stress hyperglycemia and the&#xD;
      development of microvascular obstruction using late gadolinium enhancement - cardiovascular&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting that hyperglycemic control immediately after admission&#xD;
      might reduce the incidence of microvascular obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to explore the impact of the glycemic state on the in-hospital and&#xD;
      short term outcomes of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy in two separate arms; those with known diabetes mellitus and those&#xD;
      without known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and then comparing results among those with&#xD;
      controlled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and newly diagnosed diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
