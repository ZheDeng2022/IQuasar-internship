      Early detection of anaerobic bacteria to avoid its serious comlications&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria are common and may be serious and&#xD;
      life-threatening.Obligately anaerobic bacteria do not grow on solid media in room air (0.04%&#xD;
      carbon dioxide and 21% oxygen); facultatively anaerobic bacteria can grow in the presence or&#xD;
      absence of air. Microaerophilic bacteria do not grow at all aerobically or grow poorly, but&#xD;
      grow better under 10% carbon dioxide or anaerobically. Anaerobic bacteria can be divided into&#xD;
      strict anaerobes that can not grow in the presence of more than 0.5% oxygen and moderate&#xD;
      anaerobic bacteria that are able of growing between 2 and 8% oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria&#xD;
      usually do not possess catalase, but some can generate superoxide dismutase which protects&#xD;
      them from oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaerobes are the predominant components of the bacterial flora of normal human skin and&#xD;
      mucous membranes, and are therefore a common cause of bacterial infections of endogenous&#xD;
      origin. Infections due to anaerobic bacteria can evolve all body systems and sites . The&#xD;
      predominant ones include: abdominal, pelvic, respiratory, and skin and soft tissues&#xD;
      infections. Because of their fastidious nature, they are difficult to isolate from infectious&#xD;
      sites and are often overlooked. Failure to direct therapy against these organisms often leads&#xD;
      to clinical failures. Their isolation requires appropriate methods of collection,&#xD;
      transportation, and cultivation of specimens. Treatment of anaerobic bacterial infection is&#xD;
      complicated by the slow growth of these organisms, which makes diagnosis in the laboratory&#xD;
      possible only after several days, by their often polymicrobial nature and by the growing&#xD;
      resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost all anaerobic infections originate from the patient's own microflora. Poor blood&#xD;
      supply and tissue necrosis lower the oxidation-reduction potential and favor the growth of&#xD;
      anaerobes. Any condition that lowers the blood supply to an affected area can predispose to&#xD;
      anaerobic infection. Therefore, foreign body, malignancy, surgery, edema, shock, traum and&#xD;
      vascular disease may predispose to anaerobic infection. Previous infection with aerobic or&#xD;
      facultative organisms also may make the local tissue conditions more favorable for the growth&#xD;
      of anaerobic organisms. The human defense mechanisms also may be impaired by anaerobic&#xD;
      conditions .&#xD;
