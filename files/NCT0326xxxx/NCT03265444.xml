    <textblock>
      The purpose of conducting phase 1 trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells(CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple&#xD;
      System Atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of DLT by carotid artery(intra-arterial) injection according to dose-escalating in&#xD;
      Multiple System Atrophy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which is&#xD;
      accompanied by signs of autonomic imbalance (orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems,&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction), Parkinson's symptoms (movement decreases, limb tremors) and cerebellar&#xD;
      ataxia symptoms (grogginess, pronounced incorrectly). It shows signs similar to Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic drugs and occurs at&#xD;
      any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, public phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If that subject's written consent to participate in this clinical trial will be conducted the&#xD;
      required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and be administered a drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And check the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the&#xD;
      investigational drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR)&#xD;
      by the visit after 1 days, 14 days and 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule. As a result of&#xD;
      evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance with the CTCAE&#xD;
      (Version 4.0) standards.&#xD;
