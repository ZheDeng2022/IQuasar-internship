  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a U.S.-based, 1 site (with 4 clinical settings), randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Antibiotic&#xD;
      Resistance Solutions Initiative) that will be implemented to evaluate traditional directly&#xD;
      observed therapy (DOT) and electronic forms of DOT (eDOT) for tuberculosis (TB) treatment.&#xD;
      The trial will assess whether eDOT that employs electronic communication methods, such as&#xD;
      video via computer or cellphone, is a non-inferior approach to monitor TB treatment&#xD;
      adherence, compared to traditional in-person DOT (ipDOT), in which a trained person is in the&#xD;
      physical presence of patients as anti-TB drugs are ingested. ipDOT is the single best&#xD;
      intervention proven to be successful when it comes to TB patients' adherence to therapy&#xD;
      (which reduces risk of acquired drug resistance). However, ipDOT is resource intensive and&#xD;
      many times challenging to facilitate in-person. If eDOT is found to be non-inferior to ipDOT,&#xD;
      health departments and other clinicians might be able to provide eDOT to certain populations&#xD;
      of TB patients in a more flexible and potentially cost-saving manner.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is among the most common infectious diseases and cause of death worldwide.&#xD;
      The bacteria that causes TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is spread when a person with&#xD;
      TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the&#xD;
      air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air&#xD;
      containing these TB bacteria can become infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 9.6 million became ill with TB in 2014.&#xD;
      Among this group, approximately 480,000 persons became ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR&#xD;
      TB), which is TB caused by bacteria that are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin,&#xD;
      the two most potent TB drugs used to treat persons with TB disease. Extensively drug&#xD;
      resistant (XDR) strains of TB were reported by 105 countries in 2015. As such, the National&#xD;
      Strategy for Combatting Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (CARB) has designated Mtb a SERIOUS&#xD;
      threat level pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of treatment by persons with TB disease represents the optimal path to the&#xD;
      prevention of morbidity and mortality, cure of the patient, interruption of transmission, and&#xD;
      prevention of acquired drug resistance. The single best intervention in this regard has&#xD;
      proven to be directly observed therapy (DOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOT provides frequent interactions between the patient and the patient's healthcare team.&#xD;
      This enables better monitoring and efficient response to medication side effects. This is&#xD;
      especially important as medication side effects are among the top reasons patients are lost&#xD;
      to follow-up during treatment therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience in the U.S. in the 1990s demonstrated the efficacy of this intervention in the&#xD;
      prevention and control of drug-resistant tuberculosis.Studies in the past 15 years in&#xD;
      international settings have challenged the utility of DOT, but have been criticized for&#xD;
      imperfect to poor design or implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOT entails a trained &quot;observer&quot; acceptable to both the patient and the health system being&#xD;
      present to monitor treatment adherence as patients swallow anti-TB drugs. In the United&#xD;
      States, DOT remains a cornerstone of TB control. While DOT represents the treatment standard,&#xD;
      the implementation of DOT has been modified by some programs in an effort to reduce costs and&#xD;
      conserve program resources. In the U.S., efforts recently have sought to utilize advances in&#xD;
      communication technology to facilitate the implementation of DOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate traditional approaches to DOT compared to DOT by electronic methods.&#xD;
      The study will be based within, and primarily conducted by the New York City Department of&#xD;
      Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), Bureau of Tuberculosis Control (BTBC) clinics. This&#xD;
      will enable the study to be to be conducted in a programmatic setting and reflect &quot;real-life&quot;&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Directly observed therapy (DOT) that employs electronic communication methods&#xD;
      (eDOT) is a non-inferior approach to monitor treatment adherence, compared to traditional&#xD;
      forms of DOT, in which a trained person is in the physical presence of patients as anti-TB&#xD;
      drugs are ingested (ipDOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This will be a U.S.-based, 1 site (with 4 clinic settings), randomized, cross-over,&#xD;
      2-arm, non-inferiority trial with randomization to either traditional in-person DOT (ipDOT)&#xD;
      or electronic DOT (eDOT)*, at the time outpatient treatment begins within participating&#xD;
      health department clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Secondary analyses will evaluate DOT conducted in &quot;real time&quot; or &quot;live&quot; (eDOT-live) compared&#xD;
      to DOT that uses a recorded video (eDOT-recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:Patients newly diagnosed with drug-sensitive or non-rifamycin resistant TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site: Four clinics of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Bureau of&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Duration per participant is approximately 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Intervention: After providing written informed consent, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the following DOT study group assignments: (1) traditional&#xD;
      in-person DOT (ipDOT) or (2) electronic DOT (eDOT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Patients and their providers will discuss and choose the type of eDOT they will use.&#xD;
      The two options are: (2a) eDOT conducted &quot;live&quot; in which TB program staff interact with&#xD;
      patients in real-time via a computer or phone application as they ingest their medication&#xD;
      (eDOT-live), and (2b) eDOT in which patients record themselves ingesting their TB medication&#xD;
      using &quot;time-stamped, recorded&quot; videos for TB program staff to review within 1 business day&#xD;
      (24 hours), and verify that patients ingested their medication doses as scheduled&#xD;
      (eDOT-recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 20 observable medication doses under an initial DOT study group assignment&#xD;
      participants will be assigned (crossed-over) to the opposite DOT method to collect data on&#xD;
      another 20 observable medication doses. Specifically, participants who initially received&#xD;
      ipDOT will switch to eDOT. Participants initially assigned to eDOT will switch to ipDOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of this Cross-Over Period with 40 observable medication doses, participants&#xD;
      will continue treatment using their preferred DOT method.&#xD;

    <description>Electronic DOT is the use of electronic communication methods to observe patients swallow anti-TB drugs and monitor for medication side effects. This study will use two variations of electronic communication methods, referred to as &quot;electronic directly observed therapy&quot; or &quot;eDOT&quot;. This includes: (1) eDOT conducted &quot;live&quot; in which TB program staff interact with patients via a computer or phone application as they ingest their medication (eDOT-live), and (2) eDOT conducted using &quot;time stamped, recorded&quot; videos in which TB program staff log into an electronic system and review videos recorded by patients in order to verify that patients ingested their medication doses as scheduled (eDOT-recorded).</description>
