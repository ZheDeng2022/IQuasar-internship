  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of the Cambridge Medical&#xD;
      Technologies, LLC LabPatch Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System compared to a&#xD;
      laboratory glucose analyzer (YSI 2300 STAT Plus) and 2 commercial glucometers, OneTouch Verio&#xD;
      and Freestyle Lite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LabPatch system includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The LabPatch circuit chip which lies in the center of a circular push-button. The&#xD;
           circuit is in the form of a small chip (approximately 15.7 mm [0.618&quot;] x 15.7 mm&#xD;
           [0.618&quot;]) placed in contact with the skin. The chip has a telescopic micropipette which&#xD;
           draws interstitial fluid to be analyzed for glucose levels. The chip is also able to&#xD;
           measure skin temperature to ensure appropriate skin contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Lab Patch holding device (blue box).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A wire that connects the chip to a laptop that continuously captures glucose data.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional, pilot, precision, single center, single-arm study, enrolling 30&#xD;
      adult subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes treated with insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include both a screening visit and a single study visit.The accuracy of the&#xD;
      LabPatch CGM will be evaluated during the study visit, comparing to YSI 2300 STAT Plus,&#xD;
      OneTouch Verio and FreeStyle Lite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the informed consent process, screening evaluation will determine subject&#xD;
      eligibility for enrollment, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics- including age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, dominant hand, and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes History - including type of diabetes, date of diagnosis or length of diabetes,&#xD;
           history of DKA and severe hypoglycemia, current treatment [type of insulin and type of&#xD;
           insulin delivery (injections or insulin pump)], insulin doses, and when applicable:&#xD;
           basal rates, correction factors, glucose targets, insulin duration, insulin to&#xD;
           carbohydrate ratios, sliding scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current and Past Medical History - including current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and vital signs- including height, weight, blood pressure, pulse,&#xD;
           assessment of venous access for repeated blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit (visit window: screening visit + 0 to 30 Days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will arrive at the clinical research center at Joslin Diabetes Center during the&#xD;
      day, no later than 10:00 AM and the following will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study team will confirm the absence of fever, nausea or vomiting that might occur&#xD;
           within 24 hours before the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit the following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of BP and anthropometric parameters will be taken and include, weight,&#xD;
           height and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An intravenous line will be inserted through which all blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study team will prepare the sensor and its connectors appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fasting blood sample will be collected for measurement plasma glucose, A1C and&#xD;
           complete blood count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A breakfast meal will be given followed 3-4 hours later by a lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin will be injected before breakfast and lunch based on the blood glucose value&#xD;
           before the meal using the same insulin regimen by the subject in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 15 minute intervals, subject will sit down at a mobile &quot;overbed&quot; table that has the&#xD;
           LabPatch CGM. Then, they will press with their major finger on a circular push-button&#xD;
           for about 15 seconds for each measurement of glucose. When pressed, the LED ring light&#xD;
           illuminates in blue, indicating that the glucose measurement has commenced. The finger&#xD;
           will remain in place until a beep is heard, then lifted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty to 22 blood samples will be drawn during the study visit. The samples will be&#xD;
           drawn at the following intervals: baseline, every 15 minutes for 2 hours after&#xD;
           breakfast, every 30 minutes till the lunch time, and every 15 minutes for 2 hours after&#xD;
           lunch. A total of about 110 mL of blood will be drawn during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If all admission criteria are not met, the subject will be rescheduled. If all of the&#xD;
           admission readiness conditions are met, the subject will be admitted to the Clinical&#xD;
           Research Center (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finger-stick glucose will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If plasma glucose is &lt;70 mg/dL, 15 gm of carbohydrates will be given to raise the&#xD;
           glucose to ≥100 mg/dL and blood glucose will be checked after 15 min and another&#xD;
           carbohydrates dose is given if blood glucose is still &lt;70 mg/dL. Subject will be only&#xD;
           allowed to go home when the blood glucose is &gt;100 mg/dL and stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Instructions prior to the visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to admission, subjects should check their blood glucose, if it is &lt;70 mg/dL or&#xD;
           subject feels hypoglycemic symptoms, then they should eat a snack prior to coming to the&#xD;
           visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Visit Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total duration of the inpatient visit is approximately 6 hours with screening visit&#xD;
           being approximately 2 hour. The study time may be extended for glucose stabilization&#xD;
           prior to discharge.&#xD;
