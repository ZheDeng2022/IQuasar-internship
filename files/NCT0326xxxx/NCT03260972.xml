      Objective The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that instillation of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal chloroprocaine during cesarean deliveries is associated with decreased&#xD;
      postoperative pain and nausea compared to placebo, without increasing intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators plan to randomize about 150 women undergoing primary and repeat&#xD;
      cesarean deliveries to intra-abdominal chloroprocaine versus placebo prior to abdominal&#xD;
      closure. Women will be excluded if they have ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity to&#xD;
      the ester type and major anesthetics; if they have chronic pelvic pain or if they refuse to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The investigators' primary outcome measure will be postoperative&#xD;
      pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) at 1 hour after skin closure. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include objective pain as measured by VAS at 2, 6, 24 and 48 hours at rest and&#xD;
      during mobilization, adverse effects of chloroprocaine (gastrointestinal side effects,&#xD;
      pruritus), concomitant analgesic requirement, hospital readmissions and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. Analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be studying the concentration/effect (PKPD) relationship of&#xD;
      chloroprocaine use for pain control in the postpartum period. The time courses of the plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of chloroprocaine will be analyzed with mixed effects&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain relief is an important consideration during and after cesarean section.&#xD;
      Although many different methods have been described for proper pain relief, it remains not&#xD;
      sufficient and satisfactory in some patients.1,2 The overprescribing of opioids has reached a&#xD;
      critical level worldwide, and cesarean section may be the trigger for long-term opioid use in&#xD;
      many patients.1,2,3 The optimal strategy for perioperative pain control consists of&#xD;
      multimodal therapy to minimize the need for opioids, with the goals of perioperative pain&#xD;
      management being to relieve suffering, achieve early mobilization after surgery, reduce&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and achieve patient satisfaction. Currently, most obstetricians use&#xD;
      a combination of opioids and NSAIDs for pain control postpartum. These pain control regimens&#xD;
      take into account medical, psychological, and physical condition of women, age, level of fear&#xD;
      or anxiety, allergies and personal preference at the time of cesarean section. Due to several&#xD;
      aspects such as maternal and neonatal wellbeing, postoperative pain relief in cesarean&#xD;
      delivery is crucial. Therefore, providing a proper regimen with very quick onset of action,&#xD;
      devoid of renal or gastrointestinal complications, and devoid of complications of neonatal&#xD;
      abstinence syndrome (NAS) becomes necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anesthetics have been extensively used at the time of cesarean section. Chloroprocaine&#xD;
      (Nesacaine) is an ester-type local anesthetic (active ingredient - benzoic acid,&#xD;
      4-amino-2-chloro-2-(diethylamino) ethyl ester, monohydrochloride that has been used as an&#xD;
      anesthetic and analgesic in obstetrics &amp; gynecology. It has a rapid onset time of action&#xD;
      (usually within 6 to 12 minutes; 9.6 min ± 7.3 min at 40 mg dose; 7.9 min ± 6.0 min at 50 mg&#xD;
      dose) and a motor block action lasting for 40 minutes to 2 hours.4 Chloroprocaine, like other&#xD;
      local anesthetics, blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by&#xD;
      increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation&#xD;
      of the nerve impulse and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general,&#xD;
      the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity&#xD;
      of affected nerve fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of intra-abdominal chloroprocaine absorption is dependent upon the total dose and&#xD;
      concentration administered and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the anesthetic&#xD;
      injection. Epinephrine usually reduces the rate of absorption and plasma concentration of&#xD;
      local anesthetics and is sometimes added to local anesthetic injections in order to prolong&#xD;
      the duration of action. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of chloroprocaine can be&#xD;
      significantly altered by the presence of hepatic or renal disease, addition of epinephrine,&#xD;
      factors affecting urinary pH, renal blood flow, and the age of the patient. Chloroprocaine is&#xD;
      rapidly metabolized in plasma by hydrolysis of the ester linkage by pseudocholinesterase. The&#xD;
      hydrolysis of chloroprocaine results in the production of ß-diethylaminoethanol and&#xD;
      2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid, which inhibits the action of the sulfonamides. The kidney is&#xD;
      the main excretory organ for chloroprocaine and its metabolites. Urinary excretion is&#xD;
      affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Due to its short duration of&#xD;
      action, favorable safety profile, and very low toxicity, it has been used extensively for&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia at the time of cesarean section.5,6 It has also been used for skin&#xD;
      infiltration to reduce pain post cesarean section in patients who cannot receive spinal&#xD;
      analgesia due to contraindications.7 However, despite its advantages as an analgesic and&#xD;
      anesthetic, it has never clinically evaluated to be used intra-abdominally at the time of&#xD;
      cesarean section. Although its occasional use has been considered and employed in certain&#xD;
      clinical circumstances, clinical evaluation has not been attempted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to employ a well-designed randomized controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of intraabdominal chloroprocaine administration versus placebo (sterile&#xD;
      saline) for pain control at the time of cesarean section. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      intra-abdominal chloroprocaine administration at the time of cesarean delivery is associated&#xD;
      with decreased postoperative pain and nausea compared to non-administration of&#xD;
      chloroprocaine. Patients admitted for cesarean section and meeting inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for consent. Consented patients will then be randomized into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: (intraabdominal chloroprocaine administration): These participants will have&#xD;
      intraabdominal chloroprocaine administration at the time of cesarean section before fascial&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: (Intraabdominal instillation of placebo (sterile saline): These participants will&#xD;
      have placebo (sterile saline) administered at the time of cesarean delivery before fascial&#xD;
      closure. Cesarean delivery will continue traditionally, including fascial and skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment will be performed by opening a sequentially numbered opaque envelope containing&#xD;
      computer-randomized individual allocations. The envelope will be opened by the circulation&#xD;
      nurse in the operating room and silently viewed by the surgeons prior to surgery.&#xD;
      Instructions will be given to not verbalize the treatment arm revealed. The original&#xD;
      randomization will be performed by research staff before the initiation of the study using a&#xD;
      random number table generator, and the participants will be blinded to treatment once&#xD;
      assigned. Information regarding basic demographic data, interventions during the cesarean&#xD;
      delivery and postpartum course will be obtained from the participant's charts after discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. The patients will be assessed for pain control, nausea and vomiting after&#xD;
      cesarean section. The protocol for labor management and fetal monitoring will be the same for&#xD;
      both groups, including continuous electronic fetal monitoring prior to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo inspection of the uterine incision, with or without closure of the&#xD;
      vesicouterine peritoneum (bladder flap), abdominal peritoneum, or rectus muscles per&#xD;
      attending preference. Both groups will undergo standard closure of the abdominal fascia,&#xD;
      consisting of suturing with a running non locking delayed absorbable suture. Irrigation of&#xD;
      the subcutaneous tissues superior to the closed fascia will be performed in both groups.&#xD;
      Staples or absorbable suture will be used for skin closure. In addition, all participants&#xD;
      will receive a standardized dose of 1-2 g cefazolin intravenously as antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      before the start of surgery. Participants with cefazolin allergy will receive 900 mg&#xD;
      clindamycin.&#xD;
