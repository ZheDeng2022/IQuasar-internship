  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern for women Veterans. IPV is&#xD;
      associated with numerous physical and mental health conditions. VHA is implementing IPV&#xD;
      screening programs to identify female patients who experience past-year IPV. Despite strong&#xD;
      evidence that screening increases detection of IPV, less is established about how to&#xD;
      intervene following IPV disclosure in health care settings, in order to improve health&#xD;
      outcomes. Existing healthcare-based interventions result in minimal effects on health and&#xD;
      well-being, likely because they are too brief and generic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, the PI has developed Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment&#xD;
      (RISE), based on the IPV-related health care needs and preferences of women Veterans. RISE is&#xD;
      designed to be delivered in primary care and is an individualized, variable-length,&#xD;
      modular-based intervention that addresses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety planning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  education on the health effects of IPV and warning signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increasing coping skills and self-care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enhancing social support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  making difficult decisions; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  connecting with resources. This study is aimed at refining and evaluating RISE for use&#xD;
           with female VA patients who have experienced past-year IPV. This brief counseling&#xD;
           intervention is intended to be administered in conjunction with primary care, as this is&#xD;
           a frequent point of healthcare contact for women Veterans and where disclosure of IPV is&#xD;
           most prevalent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women are the fastest growing group of VHA patients, with their population recently&#xD;
      increasing by 80%. Women Veterans (WV's) are at higher risk for IPV than their non-Veteran&#xD;
      peers, with that 1 in 3 WVs report lifetime IPV, compared to 1 in 4 women in the general U.S.&#xD;
      population. Research reports up to 30% of WVs experience past-year IPV. As a result, WVs are&#xD;
      considered an important population for IPV screening and counseling interventions. In&#xD;
      response, VHA Women's Health Services (WHS) and the IPV Assistance Program of Care Management&#xD;
      and Social Work Services (CMSWS) are implementing IPV screening programs for women and are&#xD;
      seeking an effective intervention to implement into care. Extant brief counseling&#xD;
      interventions for IPV result in minimal effects on patients' health and safety. A recent&#xD;
      review of IPV screening trials highlighted insufficient intensity of post-disclosure&#xD;
      counseling interventions, concluding that existing interventions are too brief, unstructured,&#xD;
      and generic. Such minimal intervention effects of the current standard of care have led&#xD;
      leaders in the field to call for the development and testing of new and more comprehensive&#xD;
      IPV interventions, especially for delivery in conjunction with primary care. The Recovering&#xD;
      from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) intervention fills this need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI, a clinical psychologist and health services researcher with expertise in and national&#xD;
      recognition for IPV research and care, has developed an innovative IPV intervention to&#xD;
      respond to this need. Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) is based&#xD;
      on the healthcare needs and preferences of WVs who have experienced IPV. RISE was developed&#xD;
      using rigorous methods, building on the evidence base from the applicant's HSR&amp;D CDA and on&#xD;
      input of VHA primary care and behavioral health experts. RISE is based on empowerment, a&#xD;
      highly relevant intervention model for women who experience IPV. It is an individualized,&#xD;
      variable-length, modular-based intervention addressing key factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  safety planning,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  educating about the health effects of IPV and warning signs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improving coping and self-care,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enhancing social support,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  making difficult decisions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  connecting with resources. RISE is rooted in empowerment and incorporates aspects of&#xD;
           Motivational Interviewing, an evidence-based approach designed to facilitate behavior&#xD;
           change that is widely used in VHA for numerous health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This timely research project addresses the critical gap in current IPV care. It will refine&#xD;
      and formally evaluate RISE using established methods for rapid and efficient effectiveness&#xD;
      testing, including a Hybrid 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate RISE that&#xD;
      simultaneously gathers information on barriers to and facilitators of implementation. The&#xD;
      study is guided by the first two phases of the Replicating Effective Programs (REP)&#xD;
      framework, pre-conditions and pre-implementation. These phases emphasize tailoring&#xD;
      interventions with stakeholder input and iterative cycles of pilot testing within routine&#xD;
      practice conditions. Use of the REP framework will maximize the likelihood that RISE-should&#xD;
      its effectiveness be demonstrated-can easily be integrated into routine care in VHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tailor and refine RISE to accommodate differences in service structures and personnel in&#xD;
           different primary care settings through input from a Stakeholder Advisory Board, focus&#xD;
           groups with WVs (four groups; n=24-32), and qualitative interviews with providers&#xD;
           (n=24).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a formative evaluation of RISE with WVs (n=up to 20) to inform the development&#xD;
           of a user-friendly, tailored implementation protocol and intervention manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the effects of RISE on WVs' (n=60) individual psychosocial outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
           empowerment, self-efficacy, health symptoms, service use, and quality of life) in an RCT&#xD;
           that compares RISE to an information/referral condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RISE in the context of the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provides the groundwork to examine the effectiveness of RISE. The data will be&#xD;
      used to demonstrate whether the effects of RISE appear promising to support a future-large&#xD;
      scale effectiveness-implementation RCT, including the range of effect sizes that would be&#xD;
      reasonable to expect in a future trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project was originally conducted at two Women's Health Practice-Based Research Network&#xD;
      (PBRN) sites that have adopted IPV screening - the Women's Health Centers (WHC) at VA Boston&#xD;
      Healthcare System and VA Connecticut Healthcare System. RCT study enrollment was discontinued&#xD;
      at VA Connecticut in July 2019 due to low enrollment. The VA Boston Healthcare System serves&#xD;
      as the sole site for data collection from July 2019 on and is the sourced of the RCT data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in modifications to IRB protocol to switch from in-person&#xD;
      enrollment, assessments and sessions. There were several women actively involved in the trial&#xD;
      during the initial shut-down. New recruitment and enrollment were temporarily hauled during&#xD;
      early months of COVID-19, with virtual enrollment beginning as of July 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment were completed in September 2020 because the enrollment goals were&#xD;
      met and the planned sample size was obtained (N=60).&#xD;
