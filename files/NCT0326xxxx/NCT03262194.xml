  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading cause of neonatal viral infection and can have a&#xD;
      significant impact on the neurosensory development of newborns and especially premature&#xD;
      infants. CMV infection can result from materno-fetal transmission during pregnancy&#xD;
      (congenital infection) or postnatal transmission. The prevalence of congenital CMV infection&#xD;
      in the newborn is estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.5%. Among the newborns in utero infected&#xD;
      by CMV, it is estimated that 10-15% will present symptoms at birth (hypoacousia / unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral deafness, microcephaly, chorioretinitis, psychomotor retardation, etc.) and 0.5%&#xD;
      of them will die. 20% of infected infants, mainly symptomatic newborns, suffer permanent&#xD;
      sequelae, mainly loss of hearing. Many asymptomatic children at birth will present hearing&#xD;
      loss and other delayed neurological complications. A progressive neurosensory hearing loss&#xD;
      may develop for 13-15% of asymptomatic newborns at birth. Deafness is bilateral in 50% of&#xD;
      cases, severe in more than 50% of cases, and its occurrence is often delayed. The hearing&#xD;
      loss has a significant impact on the future life of the child, mainly on language acquisition&#xD;
      and school performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic CMV screening is not currently recommended at birth due to the frequency of&#xD;
      asymptomatic forms, difficulty in fetal diagnosis and prognosis, lack of consensus for&#xD;
      preventive and curative treatment of the infection. New treatments are being evaluated and&#xD;
      encouraging results could revive the debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR from urine is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CMV infection. Urine collection is&#xD;
      not systematic in newborns and its realization can sometimes be difficult. On the other hand,&#xD;
      in children at risk (hypotrophy, prematurity, infectious risks, fetal distress or respiratory&#xD;
      distress at birth), gastric aspiration is systematically performed at birth to overcome&#xD;
      obstruction of the upper aero-digestive tract, to prevent oesophageal atresia, to avoid&#xD;
      inhalation by reflux and sometimes to make a bacteriological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that this liquid could be used for the detection of CMV infection without&#xD;
      adding any invasive action in newborns. Ultimately, gastric aspirate could allow for routine&#xD;
      CMV screening in children at risk and thus allow for appropriate care by nursing staff.The&#xD;
      occurrence of immediate or delayed sensory sequelae in these children would be then limited.&#xD;
