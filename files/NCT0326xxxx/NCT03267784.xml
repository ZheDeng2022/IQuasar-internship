  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound&#xD;
      surface area reduction of Diabetic Foot Ulcers) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of&#xD;
      two doses of the allogeneic investigational medicinal product &quot;allo-APZ2-DFU&quot; topically&#xD;
      administered to the wound matrix of patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer. Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will&#xD;
      be expanded in vitro. The Investigational medicinal product (IMP) containing the&#xD;
      ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied two times (at Visit 3 and six weeks later, at Visit&#xD;
      10) on the wound surface of DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up for efficacy for a period of three months starting after the first&#xD;
      IMP application which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size&#xD;
      reduction evaluation will start two weeks after the first IMP application. The quality of the&#xD;
      wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue,&#xD;
      epithelialization and wound exudation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated&#xD;
      with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-DFU&#xD;
      three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 after the first IMP application are included.&#xD;

             participation and/or under follow-up in another clinical trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, physical&#xD;
             examination, or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the planned treatment,&#xD;
             affect the patient's compliance, or place the patient at high risk of complications&#xD;
