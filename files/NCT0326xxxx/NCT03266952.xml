  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment of a population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed&#xD;
      in 2001 and annual follow-up has continued since then. This collaborative study is the first&#xD;
      prospective cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same&#xD;
      community. This grant supports continued follow-up and outcome detection and expansion of&#xD;
      data collection in this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular&#xD;
      outcomes (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and insulin resistance,&#xD;
      carotid intima-media thickness, carotid distensibility, and quantitative magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to determine if MRI&#xD;
      subclinical disease accounts for race/ethnic differences in cognitive impairment. To&#xD;
      accomplish these aims further data collection using the population-based, prospective cohort&#xD;
      study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting insulin levels to&#xD;
      evaluate insulin resistance. High-resolution carotid imaging data will be collected at&#xD;
      subsequent visits to expand the measurements of subclinical carotid disease to 1300 subjects.&#xD;
      MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontal executive domains will be done on&#xD;
      1300 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter hyperintensities,&#xD;
      silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting in 2005, subjects enrolled in the MRI substudy began to have echocardiograms and&#xD;
      24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone&#xD;
      interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person&#xD;
      assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive. Community stroke surveillance&#xD;
      will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic&#xD;
      committees classify stroke, MI and vascular death.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a major public health problem with a disproportionate impact on blacks and&#xD;
      Hispanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in Northern Manhattan have demonstrated that blacks and Hispanics have a greater&#xD;
      stroke incidence and more frequently have small vessel and intracranial atherosclerotic&#xD;
      stroke than whites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for these race/ethnic disparities are not entirely clear. Enrollment of a&#xD;
      population-based, prospective cohort of 3298 stroke-free adults was completed in 2001 and&#xD;
      annual followup has continued since then. This collaborative study is the first prospective&#xD;
      cohort study among whites, blacks and Caribbean Hispanics living in the same community. This&#xD;
      grant supports continued followup and outcome detection and expansion of data collection in&#xD;
      this cohort. The aims are to evaluate the relationship between vascular outcomes (stroke, MI,&#xD;
      and vascular death) and insulin resistance, carotid intima-media thickness, carotid&#xD;
      distensibility, and quantitative MRI measures of vascular subclinical brain disease and to&#xD;
      determine if MRI subclinical disease accounts for race/ethnic differences in cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. To accomplish these aims further data collection using the population-based,&#xD;
      prospective cohort study is proposed. Stored baseline serum will be used to measure fasting&#xD;
      insulin levels to evaluate insulin resistance. High resolution carotid imaging data will be&#xD;
      collected at subsequent visits to expand the measurements of subclinical carotid disease to&#xD;
      1300 subjects. MRIs and a neuropsychological battery emphasizing frontal executive domains&#xD;
      will be done on 1300 subjects and quantitative analyses performed to measure white matter&#xD;
      hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent cerebral microbleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting in 2005, subjects enrolled in the MRI substudy began to have echocardiograms and&#xD;
      24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Subjects will be followed by annual telephone&#xD;
      interviews to ascertain stroke, MI, death, and changes in cognitive state. In-person&#xD;
      assessment will be done for all subjects who screen positive. Community stroke surveillance&#xD;
      will be maintained to insure stroke detection among the cohort. Specific diagnostic&#xD;
      committees classify stroke, MI and vascular death. The strengths of this cohort study are the&#xD;
      wealth of baseline data already assembled, the triethnic composition residing in the same&#xD;
      community, the outstanding followup record, the evaluation of putative risk factors, and the&#xD;
      innovative assessment of MRI subclinical disease and carotid subclinical disease. The study&#xD;
      primary hypotheses are:1. To determine the independent association of insulin resistance&#xD;
      among nondiabetics and the incidence of stroke, as well as stroke, MI or vascular death,&#xD;
      after adjusting for known modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, lipids, cigarettes,&#xD;
      and alcohol. 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the independent association of subclinical carotid disease (carotid intima-media&#xD;
      thickness and carotid distensibility) and the incidence of stroke, MI or vascular death after&#xD;
      adjusting for conventional modifiable vascular risk factors, as well as novel vascular risk&#xD;
      factors such as homocysteine, high density lipoprotein (HDL) subpopulations, and insulin&#xD;
      resistance.3. To compare the prevalence of subclinical vascular brain disease as measured by&#xD;
      quantitative MRI, including white matter hyperintensities, silent infarcts, and silent&#xD;
      cerebral microbleeds, in each race/ethnic subgroup and determine the association between&#xD;
      subclinical brain disease and modifiable vascular risk factors measured up to 10 years prior&#xD;
      to MRI. Vascular risk factors will include baseline and repeated measures of conventional&#xD;
      modifiable conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, lipid levels, cigarette smoking,&#xD;
      physical activity, alcohol use, as well as less-well documented factors such as homocysteine,&#xD;
      HDL subpopulations, and insulin resistance. 4. To determine the relationship between&#xD;
      subclinical vascular brain diseases and cognitive impairment, particularly diminished&#xD;
      performance in frontal executive tests, and whether these MRI findings help explain cognitive&#xD;
      performance differences among whites, blacks and Hispanics after adjusting for age and&#xD;
      education.5. To explore whether subclinical vascular brain diseases are important predictors&#xD;
      of stroke, MI or vascular death. Beginning in Summer 2005, some new aims were added as&#xD;
      follows: 1) to determine whether aortic arch abnormalities and/or cardiac abnormalities,&#xD;
      and/or 24hour blood pressure levels and changes, are independently associated with silent&#xD;
      brain infarcts in the elderly; 2) to determine the risk of symptomatic stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and vascular death associated with aortic/cardiac/24hour blood pressure&#xD;
      abnormalities. As of 2010 the investigators will be collaborating with other institutions&#xD;
      under the NINDS Ischemic Stroke Genetics (ISG) study. The aims of the NINDS Ischemic Stroke&#xD;
      Genetics Study (NINDS ISG Study; NIH Grant 1 U01 NS06920801) are to:1) Assemble ischemic&#xD;
      stroke phenotypic data and high quality DNA data from 10 stroke studies. (Participating&#xD;
      studies in the NINDS ISG Study: Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study; Siblings with Ischemic Stroke&#xD;
      Study; Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study; Genes Affecting Stroke Risk and&#xD;
      Outcome Study/Bugher Network Study; Northern Manhattan Study; Baltimore/Washington Young&#xD;
      Stroke Study; Heart and Vascular Health Stroke Study; Nurses Health Study; Reasons for&#xD;
      Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke; Women's Health Initiative). This collaboration&#xD;
      has access to 7,033 cases of ischemic stroke and 23,411 study-specific controls. 2) Test for&#xD;
      associations with ischemic stroke and its subtypes in the NINDS ISG Study. 3) Replicate and&#xD;
      extend associations detected in Aim 1.2 above by taking advantage of other genomewide&#xD;
      association studies conducted by other members of the Ischemic Stroke Genetics studies.&#xD;
