  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation, which is done under the guidance of lung&#xD;
      specialists/therapists. It includes breathing exercises, physical exercises, and exercises to&#xD;
      increase tolerance of activity (stamina). This type of lung rehab has been shown to improve&#xD;
      symptoms, quality of life, breathing, and walking distance. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      decrease hospitalization and death rates in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      lung cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Care Management Program (CCMP), a program that includes educational sessions&#xD;
      for tobacco cessation, phone calls, and a home action plan has also demonstrated benefit in&#xD;
      addition to the pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators have an opportunity to identify and intervene with COPD&#xD;
      patients. The vast majority of early stage lung cancer patients are much more scared of their&#xD;
      cancer than their COPD. Upon identification of COPD and recognition of patient tobacco habits&#xD;
      for patients planned to undergo SBRT, interventions can potentially be made that will reduce&#xD;
      COPD hospitalization rates, second primary lung cancer rates, and likely death rates. The&#xD;
      interventions are broadly available and relatively easily instituted and include the&#xD;
      following: seeing a doctor to diagnose their other underlying illness or illnesses (both&#xD;
      respiratory and cardiovascular), smoking cessation if they are smokers, and CCMP's and&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation which have shown measurable COPD benefits in prior trials.&#xD;

      Primary objective: To evaluate the technical feasibility and delivery of a comprehensive&#xD;
      program that leads to prevention and management of symptoms of COPD in early stage lung&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing curative therapy, promotes and leads to smoking cessation, and&#xD;
      evaluates potentially unknown cardiopulmonary co-morbid or therapeutically-induced diseases&#xD;
      in the cancer patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To document overall survival of patients undergoing lung SBRT plus preventative care,&#xD;
           including evaluation and treatment by a pulmonologist and cardiologist in combination&#xD;
           with a tobacco cessation program (for those currently smoking or within 6 months of&#xD;
           quitting), and pulmonary rehabilitation. Overall survival and other tumor recurrence and&#xD;
           survival endpoints will be compared to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) changes of patients undergoing lung SBRT with usual&#xD;
           care plus evaluation and treatment by a pulmonologist and cardiologist in combination&#xD;
           with a tobacco cessation program (for those currently smoking), and pulmonary&#xD;
           rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate primary tumor control, regional control, distant metastasis and&#xD;
           progression-free and cause-specific survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate toxicity rates, including pulmonary and cardiotoxicity after SBRT. Diagnosis&#xD;
           and management of cardiopulmonary toxicities may be greater for these patients&#xD;
           undergoing routine evaluation by specialist physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate smoking cessation rates after employing an Ask, Assist and Refer method for&#xD;
           smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate second primary lung cancer rates and compare them to historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate changes in pulmonary function, 6-minute walk test and V02 max values with&#xD;
           participation in pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To document hospitalization rates after SBRT using these preventative care strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To explore the impact of SBRT on ventilation and changes in functional lung using&#xD;
           4-Dimensional computed tomography(4DCT) before and after SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To study the potential impact of SBRT on cardiac function using pre-and post-SBRT EKG&#xD;
           and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for this study will be identified in the Radiation Oncology department as being&#xD;
      planned to receive SBRT for their lung cancer. All eligibility will be reviewed. Once a&#xD;
      patient is deemed eligible and reviewed and signed the informed consent, he/she will be asked&#xD;
      to complete the smoking questionnaire available on the state of Michigan (MI) Quitline. If a&#xD;
      patient is deemed eligible and decline to enroll, they will be asked to voluntarily complete&#xD;
      the American Heart Association (AHA) Smoking Quiz as an eligible patient exit form. Following&#xD;
      their completion of this quiz, they will be asked again if they are certain of their desire&#xD;
      to decline the study. All enrolled patients will also complete the AHA smoking quiz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligibility will be confirmed and pre-treatment standard staging activities (history and&#xD;
      physical, zubrod, weight, thoracic surgeon evaluation, chest CT with contrast,&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT), Pulmonary Function Test, bloodwork and pregnancy safety evaluation) will&#xD;
      have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline pulmonologist referral will be made within 4 weeks before/after SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline cardiologist referral will be made within 4 weeks before/after SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline EKG and echocardiogram (ECHO) will be done prior to the 1st fraction of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehab baseline assessment including a 6 Minute Walk Test, oxygen consumption (VO2&#xD;
      max) will occur prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charlson Comorbidity Index Evaluation will occur prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life, Depression, Anxiety, and Craving Assessment questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will also have a urine or saliva Nicotine evaluation and enrollment in the Michigan&#xD;
      Tobacco Quitline program which requires a cell phone or tablet owned by the patient. This is&#xD;
      a free service within Michigan, available to any smokers, not specific for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT will take place as prescribed by the treating radiation oncologist within the standard&#xD;
      parameters. On-Treatment Visits (OTV) will occur weekly during the SBRT and include a history&#xD;
      and physical, zubrod (performance score), weight, hospitalization and smoking assessment, and&#xD;
      urine or saliva Nicotine evaluation . As part of the study, nicotine replacement is required&#xD;
      to be ordered as is daily visits/calls with a smoking cessation specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of radiotherapy, the subject will have weekly visits/calls with the smoking&#xD;
      cessation specialist for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 weeks post SBRT-the patient will come back to the radiation oncology clinic for a&#xD;
      history and physical, zubrod, and weight. The patient also have pulmonary function testing&#xD;
      (PFT), adverse event reporting, 6 minute walk test and pulmonary rehab per plan developed&#xD;
      pre-treatment, hospitalization and smoking assessment #1 Research 4DCT, not diagnostic, will&#xD;
      be obtained at this visit and done in the radiation oncology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following testing will happen, as stated at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and then annually per&#xD;
      standard. Procedures specific to this study will be completed at 24 months. Any annual&#xD;
