    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is characterized by shortened red blood cell survival and a&#xD;
      positive Coombs test. The responsible autoantibodies may be either warm reactive or cold&#xD;
      reactive. The rate of hemolysis and the severity of the anemia may vary from mild to severe&#xD;
      and life-threatening. Diagnosis is made in the laboratory by the findings of anemia,&#xD;
      reticulocytosis, a positive Coombs test, and specific serologic tests. The prognosis is&#xD;
      generally good but renal failure and death sometimes occur, especially in cases mediated by&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemolysis is the premature destruction of erythrocytes. A hemolytic anemia will develop if&#xD;
      bone marrow activity cannot compensate for the erythrocyte loss. The severity of the anemia&#xD;
      depends on whether the onset of hemolysis is gradual or abrupt and on the extent of&#xD;
      erythrocyte destruction Hemolysis can be due to hereditary and acquired disorders. Acquired&#xD;
      causes of hemolysis include immune disorders, Toxic chemicals and drugs, Antiviral agents and&#xD;
      Physical damage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) exhibits two important characteristics: shortened red&#xD;
      blood cell (RBC) survival and presence of autoantibodies directed toward autologous RBCs,&#xD;
      usually demonstrated by a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT). AIHA is&#xD;
      classified by the temperature at which autoantibodies bind optimally to RBCs. In warm&#xD;
      antibody AIHA, which constitutes about 80-90% of adult cases, hemolysis is mediated by&#xD;
      antibodies which bind to RBCs at 37 °C (98.6 °F. In cryopathic hemolytic syndromes,&#xD;
      cold-reactive autoantibodies exhibit affinity for RBCs optimally at temperatures below body&#xD;
      temperature. In adults, most of the cold-reactive antibodies are agglutinins of the&#xD;
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype. In children, cold hemolysins (generally IgG) are most common.&#xD;
      Unusual patients with mixed AIHA exhibit both cold-reactive and warm-reactive autoantibodies&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these types of AIHA may be sub-classified based on the presence or absence of&#xD;
      underlying diseases. In the absence of an underlying disease, the AIHA is termed primary or&#xD;
      idiopathic. When AIHA occurs as a manifestation or complication of another disease, the term&#xD;
      secondary AIHA is used. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphomas account for about&#xD;
      half of all secondary AIHA cases. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases also account for a large number of secondary AIHA cases. Certain drugs also mediate&#xD;
      immune injury to RBCs. Three mechanisms are recognized and two of these involve elements of&#xD;
      autoimmunity, in which autoantibodies recognize and bind to specific RBC epitopes in concert&#xD;
      with drugs or their metabolites or in which the autoantibody binds to RBC epitopes without&#xD;
      the presence of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis The signs and symptoms of AIHA are nonspecific and common to all types of anemia .&#xD;
      The primary symptoms include exertional dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, varying degrees of fatigue,&#xD;
      and signs and symptoms of the hyperdynamic state, such as bounding pulses, palpitations…etc&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory findings of drug-induced AIHA may resemble those of warm antibody AIHA or a&#xD;
      cryopathic hemolytic syndrome, depending on the mechanism of the autoantibody induction and&#xD;
      the target antigen. A high index of suspicion on the part of the clinician and discussions&#xD;
      with blood bank personnel can usually reveal the role of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      complete blood count Peripheral blood smear : This test can detect an anemia, pancytopenia,&#xD;
      and infections. Along with the differential count, a complete blood count can help diagnose&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies and other hematological disorders. The platelet count usually is&#xD;
      normal in most hemolytic anemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increased reticulocyte count represents increased RBC production and is a criterion for&#xD;
      hemolysis but is not specific for hemolysis. Thrombocytopenia associated with positive direct&#xD;
      coombs test occur in evans syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) study : Serum LDH elevation is a criterion for hemolysis,&#xD;
      but is not specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum haptoglobin : A low serum haptoglobin level is a criterion for moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect bilirubin : Unconjugated bilirubin is a criterion for hemolysis, but it is not&#xD;
      specific , the level of indirect bilirubin usually is less than 3 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct antiglobulin test (DAT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DAT result is usually positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), but it may&#xD;
      occasionally be negative in this disorder. DAT-negative AIHAs have been reviewed. From 5-10%&#xD;
      of all AIHAs are DAT negative. The polybrene test can detect DAT-negative AIHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment all of the drugs used in the treatment of AIHA are largely or partly directed&#xD;
      against the patient's natural immune system, which may, in turn, extensively derail the&#xD;
      immune system due to treatment. .The first-line therapy for warm AIHA are corticosteroids,&#xD;
      which are effective in 70-85% of patients and should be slowly tapered over a time period of&#xD;
      6-12 months. For refractory/relapsed cases, the current sequence of second-line therapy is&#xD;
      splenectomy (effective approx. in 2 out of 3 cases but with a presumed cure rate of up to&#xD;
      20%), rituximab (effective in approx. 80-90% of cases), and thereafter any of the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil).&#xD;
      Additional therapies are intravenous immunoglobulins, danazol, plasma-exchange, and&#xD;
      alemtuzumab and high-dose cyclophosphamide as last resort option. As the experience with&#xD;
      rituximab evolves, it is likely that this drug will be located at an earlier point in therapy&#xD;
      of warm AIHA, before more toxic immunosuppressants, and in place of splenectomy in some&#xD;
      cases. In coronary artery disease , rituximab is now recommended as first-line treatment&#xD;
