  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation (IPV) will show greater improvements in Forced&#xD;
      Expiatory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) shorter duration of stay, and greater time to next&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation in pediatric Cystic Fibrosis patients admitted for pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEV1 is a measurement of obstruction in the airway which is seen to be elevated in CF&#xD;
      patients with worsening lung disease. FEV1 is used as a primary endpoint in pulmonary trials&#xD;
      because it is an acute indicator of worsening or improving lung function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective randomized clinical trial. All Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients&#xD;
      five years and above who are being admitted to University of Florida (UF) Shands Children's&#xD;
      Hospital with the diagnosis of CF acute pulmonary exacerbations will be approached for study&#xD;
      consent on day one of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomized to receive either IPV (metaneb) or Chest Physiotherapy (CPT)&#xD;
      vest (Incourage) therapy. Treatments will be administered by in-house respiratory therapists&#xD;
      four times daily according to standard protocol, and the respiratory therapist will document&#xD;
      each treatment in the patient's electronic medical record (EPIC). Each patient will also&#xD;
      receive mucolytic agents (dornase alpha, hypertonic saline) and antibiotic therapy as per&#xD;
      routine inpatient protocol per the attending pulmonologist on service. If the patient's&#xD;
      clinical status worsens during their admission the attending pulmonologist will be allowed to&#xD;
      change the airway clearance regimen or antibiotic coverage at their discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is enrolled and has another admission for pulmonary exacerbation after their&#xD;
      initial admission, we will attempt to randomize them to the other arm and utilize this data&#xD;
      to see if there is a difference in outcome parameters for the same patient if they are&#xD;
      randomized to both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of improvement in FEV1 defined as absolute difference between admission FEV1 and&#xD;
      discharge FEV1 will be used as primary outcome measure to compare effectiveness between both&#xD;
      modalities. This measure is commonly used in the Cystic Fibrosis community of clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers as measure of airway obstruction and disease severity. We will perform spirometry&#xD;
      at least twice, at admission and discharge, on these patients. The patient's spirometry from&#xD;
      their office visit on the same day of admission or first spirometry during their admission&#xD;
      will count as the initial spirometry. Last spirometry obtained before discharge will be the&#xD;
      discharge spirometry. Additional spirometry may be performed during the patient's admission&#xD;
      at the attending provider's clinical discretion. We will also use data from these additional&#xD;
      spirometry measurements if they take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional cost incurred by using the IPV device as opposed to standard of&#xD;
      care (CPT vest).There is also no increased effort performing IPV treatments from the&#xD;
      respiratory therapist performing the treatment or from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of hospital stay in days will be used as a secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary outcome measure will be the length of time between discharge and subsequent&#xD;
      admissions for CF pulmonary exacerbation. We will follow the subject for an additional 6&#xD;
      months after they are enrolled to ascertain the time to next admission and total number of&#xD;
      admissions in that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other information that will be accessed through EPIC records will be number of admissions for&#xD;
      CF pulmonary exacerbations, airway clearance regimen, radiological data, laboratory results&#xD;
      (respiratory cultures, Respiratory Viral Panels, Acid Fast Bacilli cultures, complete Blood&#xD;
      counts), vital signs, weight measurements, Bronchoscopy reports, medications used (Orkambi,&#xD;
      Kalydeco, antibiotics), and oxygen requirement. All of this information will be collected in&#xD;
      the time period of 1 year before study and throughout study,&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also administer a 2 question questionnaire at the beginning and end of admission to&#xD;
      the hospital in order to evaluate the patient/family opinion of the therapy they received&#xD;
      during their participation in the study.&#xD;
