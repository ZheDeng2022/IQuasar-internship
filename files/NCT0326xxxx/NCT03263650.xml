    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if olaparib, when given after treatment&#xD;
      with cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and prednisone, can help to control aggressive variant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (AVPC). The safety of these drugs will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cabazitaxel and carboplatin are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of certain types of prostate cancer. Prednisone is&#xD;
      FDA-approved and commercially available as a corticosteroid. Olaparib is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of certain types of ovarian cancer. The combination&#xD;
      of cabazitaxel and carboplatin followed by olaparib in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 96 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study&#xD;
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of&#xD;
      being assigned to Group 1 and a 1 in 3 chance of being assigned to Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will not receive olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive cabazitaxel and carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You and the study staff will know to which group you have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive cabazitaxel by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6. You will then&#xD;
      receive carboplatin by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take 1 tablet of prednisone by mouth 2 times each day of Cycles 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects (for example,&#xD;
      filgrastim) before and/or after each dose of cabazitaxel and continuing through several days.&#xD;
      Your doctor will describe these drugs to you in more detail, including how they are given and&#xD;
      any side effects you may expect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will take tablets of olaparib 2 times by mouth each day starting&#xD;
      on Day 1 of Cycle 7. Swallow the whole tablet or tablets. Do not chew, crush, divide, or&#xD;
      dissolve the tablets. If you vomit shortly after taking your olaparib tablet you can retake a&#xD;
      new dose as long as you can see that the tablet came out whole. You should take the doses at&#xD;
      the same time each day (or within 2 hours of the scheduled times). Do not take the dose if&#xD;
      you forget and it is more than 2 hours since your scheduled time. Take olaparib at least 1&#xD;
      hour after and 2 hours before eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will receive standard of care treatment and follow-up after Cycle&#xD;
      6. The study doctor will tell you more about what this may mean for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive carboplatin and cabazitaxel for up to 6 cycles. If you are in Group 1, you&#xD;
      may continue receiving olaparib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
      You may no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing, tumor&#xD;
           marker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample will&#xD;
           also be used for CTC testing. You must fast for up to 12 hours before the Cycle 4 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Cycle 4 only, you will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 6, you will have a second tumor biopsy for biomarker testing to compare to the&#xD;
      one taken at screening. The type of biopsy you have will depend on where the disease has&#xD;
      spread and/or what the doctor thinks is in your best interest. The doctor will discuss with&#xD;
      you the type of biopsy you will have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn to check your testosterone levels, biomarker&#xD;
           testing, and for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 8-10:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing,&#xD;
           biomarker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample&#xD;
           will also be used for CTC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 10, you will only have study visits every 3 cycles. Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle&#xD;
      13, every 3 cycles (Cycles 13, 16, 19, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing,&#xD;
           biomarker testing, and to measure your PSA level. At some of these visits, this sample&#xD;
           will also be used for CTC testing. You must fast for up to 12 hours before the visits at&#xD;
           Cycle 10 and every 3 cycles after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have severe side effects, you may return to the clinic more often so the study doctor&#xD;
      can check on your health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you leave the study, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan and either MRIs or CT scans to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tumor marker testing, and&#xD;
           to measure your PSA level. You must fast for up to 12 hours before this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 6 months after the end-of-study visit, the study staff will check your health.&#xD;
      This will be done either by a chart review or a phone call. If you are called, this call will&#xD;
      last about 5 minutes. These calls will stop if you withdraw from the study.&#xD;

          7. Chronic use of known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, voriconazole,&#xD;
             nefazodone, posaconazole, ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir,&#xD;
             boceprevir, telaprevir and nelfinavir), moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir,&#xD;
             aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem,&#xD;
             erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil), strong CYP3A4 inducers&#xD;
             (e.g. phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine, St.John's Wort, phenobarbital) and&#xD;
             moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil and&#xD;
             nafcillin). Concomitant use of these drugs with olaparib is not allowed. Patients may&#xD;
             undergo limited courses of them prior to starting olaparib but will be required to&#xD;
             have &gt;/= 5 week washout period from phenobarbital, and &gt;/=3 week washout period from&#xD;
             the rest, before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Active uncontrolled infection ( patients completing a course of antibiotic or&#xD;
             antiviral therapy whose infection is deemed to be controlled may be allowed on study&#xD;
             after discussion with the PI; the PI will serve as the final arbiter regarding&#xD;
             eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A diagnosis or suspicion of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A history of pneumonitis or extensive bilateral lung disease of non-malignant&#xD;
             etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required radiotherapy or&#xD;
             systemic treatment within the past 5 years, or has a &gt;/= 30% probability of recurrence&#xD;
             within 24 months (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively&#xD;
             treated in-situ cancer of the Ta urothelial carcinomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high-resolution&#xD;
             computed tomography scan, uncontrolled seizures or any psychiatric disorder that&#xD;
             prohibits obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or spinal cord compressions. A&#xD;
             scan to confirm the absence of brain metastases is not required. The patient can&#xD;
             receive a stable dose of corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these&#xD;
             were started at least 28 days prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the olaparib, carboplatin or cabazitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or&#xD;
             physical (e.g. infectious disease) illness.&#xD;
