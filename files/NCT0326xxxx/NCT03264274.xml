  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various antiangiogenic agents have a modest effect in prolonging overall survival in solid&#xD;
      tumours. In colorectal cancer it is clear that there are some patients in whom bevacizumab&#xD;
      significantly prolongs survival, but it is not effective in the majority of patients.&#xD;
      Biomarker studies using tumour tissue and blood have failed to define a consistent biomarker&#xD;
      that correlates with a beneficial effect of bevacizumab on survival. DCE-MRI can detect&#xD;
      changes in tumour blood flow which, in early phase drug studies, correlated with subsequent&#xD;
      tumour responses, but is too expensive and time consuming to be used in larger scale trials.&#xD;
      DCE-US is a promising biomarker for use in this group of patients with antiangiogenic agents,&#xD;
      as detailed above. The investigators wish to use this technique as a predictive biomarker for&#xD;
      any effects Aflibercept has on OS and PFS in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      refractory to standard treatment.&#xD;
