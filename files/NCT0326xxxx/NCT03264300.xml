  <brief_summary>

      A critical aspect of brain tumor patient management is the radiographic assessment of tumor&#xD;
      status, which is used for diagnosis, localization, surgical planning and surveillance. The&#xD;
      primary goal is to develop and apply advanced, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      techniques that can supplement existing high-resolution anatomic imaging to aid clinical&#xD;
      decision-making for patients diagnosed with brain tumors. The studies proposed herein involve&#xD;
      the development of advanced imaging methods that are intrinsically sensitive to the&#xD;
      biophysical characteristics associated with tumor pathogenesis, as they are more likely to&#xD;
      improve tumor characterization and localization and may offer early and more specific&#xD;
      indicators of treatment response. These advanced methods include diffusion-weighted imaging&#xD;
      (DWI), chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), and dynamic susceptibility contrast&#xD;
      (DSC) perfusion MRI. A secondary objective of this study is to validate cerebral blood volume&#xD;
      (CBV) metrics acquired using a DSC acquisition and post-processing methods by comparison with&#xD;
      an intravascular reference standard contrast agent. Validated perfusion imaging techniques&#xD;
      will improve the reliability and relevancy of derived CBV metrics across a range of clinical&#xD;
      applications, including tumor localization, treatment guidance, therapy response assessment,&#xD;
      surgical and biopsy guidance, and multi-site clinical trials of conventional and targeted&#xD;
      brain tumor therapies.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to (1) Develop and optimize acquisition methods for&#xD;
      MRI-based biomarkers that are indicative of brain tumor pathophysiology. These methods&#xD;
      include, but are not limited to, DWI, CEST, and Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) and&#xD;
      Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI; and (2) Validate DSC-MRI accuracy by comparison to an&#xD;
      intravascular reference standard. Developmental studies: During the development of new&#xD;
      imaging-based biomarkers, it is critical to optimize acquisition parameters, systematically&#xD;
      characterize performance and contrast in the pathology of interest, validate with&#xD;
      histopathology and establish test-retest repeatability. Thus, the first goal of this study is&#xD;
      to develop advanced Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), CEST and DSC/DCE-MRI methods for&#xD;
      application to brain tumors. Objective 1 is a single-center study of up to 60 subjects being&#xD;
      done to explore and optimize imaging signatures indicative of altered functional tumor&#xD;
      states. These advanced imaging methods will allow the investigators to probe&#xD;
      neuropathological tumor correlates, including cellular characteristics, molecular and&#xD;
      metabolic changes, and vascular characteristics. Compared to existing conventional anatomic&#xD;
      imaging, the researchers hypothesize that these experimental methods will be better able to&#xD;
      characterize brain tumors and will have the potential to serve as new biomarkers of&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic importance. The researchers approach brings together biophysical&#xD;
      and physiological information obtained from MRI and correlates this with clinical diagnoses&#xD;
      and outcomes. Validation of DSC-MRI: Despite DSC-MRI's potential impact on clinical care, its&#xD;
      broad scale integration has been slow, in large part from a lack of consensus about&#xD;
      methodology and how to prevent potential CBV inaccuracies. Although DSC-MRI relies on the&#xD;
      assumption that gadolinium-based contrast agents remain within the vascular lumen, this&#xD;
      condition is often violated in vivo. If not corrected for, contrast agent leakage effects&#xD;
      lead to CBV inaccuracy, misdiagnosis, and potentially mistreatment. While there exist&#xD;
      numerous leakage correction strategies that have been shown to clearly improve DSC-MRI's&#xD;
      clinical utility (e.g., predicting therapeutic response), a key limitation has prevented the&#xD;
      standardization and wide-spread adoption of DSC-MRI methodology: To date, no study has&#xD;
      validated the accuracy of leakage corrected CBV measures in patients. So while leakage&#xD;
      corrected CBV values may be used, for example, to differentiate tumor recurrence from&#xD;
      post-treatment effects, it is unknown whether this clinical benefit is a consequence of the&#xD;
      complex combination of pulse sequence parameters, kinetics, dosing scheme, relaxivities, and&#xD;
      leakage correction strategy or if the computed CBV actually reflects the underlying vascular&#xD;
      density. This distinction is critical because it has implications for DSC-MRI&#xD;
      standardization, establishing CBV thresholds for clinic use, multi-site comparisons and&#xD;
      clinical trials. The investigators believe this limitation represents the most critical and&#xD;
      clinically relevant challenge in the field of brain tumor DSC-MRI that urgently needs to be&#xD;
      addressed. Objective 2 is a single-center study of up to 160 subjects being done to validate&#xD;
      the accuracy of DSC-MRI measures of CBV. To validate the DSC-MRI measures derived from small&#xD;
      molecular weight gadolinium-based (Gd) contrast agents, the investigators will compare rCBV&#xD;
      maps to those derived from the intravascular contrast agent, Ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol has&#xD;
      been evaluated in humans as a potential DSC-MRI contrast agent but not for the purposes of&#xD;
      validating leakage correction techniques. Since ferumoxytol-based DSC-MRI is not influenced&#xD;
      by leakage effects, it enables the assessment of the most reliable perfusion metrics that can&#xD;
      be expected from DSC-MRI and, as such, is the most reliable reference standard by which to&#xD;
      evaluate CBV accuracy. Note that while ferumoxytol is undergoing clinical trials as a&#xD;
      potential DSC-MRI contrast agent, it is unlikely to replace Gd-based contrast agents because&#xD;
      it cannot provide the signal enhancement expected on conventional post-contrast T1-weighted&#xD;
      images and is therefore unsuitable for use with standard response criteria.&#xD;
