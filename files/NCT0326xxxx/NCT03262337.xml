  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New mobile Health (mHealth) technology creates an opportunity to approach travel medicine&#xD;
      research in a different way, revolutionising our understanding of risks to travellers. Using&#xD;
      mHealth technology, the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute (EBPI),&#xD;
      University of Zurich (UZH), developed a TRAVEL app in collaboration with the Eidgnössische&#xD;
      Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using this new technology, an extensive collection of data (prospective collection of&#xD;
      individual travel behaviour and experienced health events, mapping the travel itinerary via&#xD;
      global positioning system (GPS), linking to publicly available local weather data and data on&#xD;
      disease endemicity) can be combined and an unprecedented abundance of information on travel&#xD;
      behaviour and experienced risks can be obtained. These data will allow a much better&#xD;
      understanding of travel risk profiles using cluster analysis. By simultaneously recording&#xD;
      health outcomes, the relationship between travel risk profiles and health events can be&#xD;
      assessed. In this study, the investigators will address several major shortcomings in travel&#xD;
      health in tropical and subtropical destinations by improving the understanding of poorly&#xD;
      assessed and potentially underestimated health threats (e.g. risk of accidents and injury,&#xD;
      mental health disorders), and travel risks specific to elderly travellers and travellers with&#xD;
      chronic conditions. These findings will directly feed back into individual travel advice&#xD;
      given by practitioners in Switzerland and finally world-wide.&#xD;

      1000 clients traveling to Thailand, China, India, Brazil, Peru or Tanzania will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Travel Clinics in Zurich and Basel and through advertising at local travel agents&#xD;
      and the universities of ETH and UZH from September 2017 until February 2019. After completing&#xD;
      an intake at the clinic, participants will be given the option to use their own Smartphone&#xD;
      for data collection, or to use a phone owned by the UZH-EBPI during travel. Participants will&#xD;
      use a data collection app for questionnaire responses during and after travel including: a&#xD;
      daily questionnaire on travel behaviors, daily symptoms questionnaire, and localization&#xD;
      tracking, showing the participants' travel path and locations.&#xD;
