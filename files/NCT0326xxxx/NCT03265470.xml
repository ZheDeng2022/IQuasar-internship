    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease usually associated with radical cystectomy&#xD;
      operation which is the treatment of choice for invasive urinary bladders tumor.&#xD;
      Peri-operative acute kidney injury (AKI) is common but poorly recognized and managed which is&#xD;
      associated with increase surgical morbidity and mortality and hospital cost .Prospective&#xD;
      human studies establishing a renal protective effect of dexmedetomidine are still&#xD;
      questionable.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that intra-operative intravenous&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusion could improve early renal function after open radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized comparative study will be carried out on 100 patients of either sex, ASA I&#xD;
      and II with baseline serum creatinine below 1.4 mg/dl who will be submitted for radical&#xD;
      cystectomy. The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups according to the drug&#xD;
      infused intra-operatively; dexmedetomidine group and fentanyl group. Dexmedetomidine group:&#xD;
      will receive loading dose (0.8μg/kg) over 20 minutes, followed by intravenous infusion&#xD;
      (0.4μg/kg/h) and fentanyl group: will receive loading dose (1μg/kg), followed by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion (1μg/kg/h) during intra-operative period till end of procedure. Assessment of renal&#xD;
      function through evaluation of pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)&#xD;
      using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula based on baseline serum&#xD;
      creatinine, serum cystatin C level at 24 hours post-operative, daily post-operative serum&#xD;
      creatinine for one week post-operative and post-operative eGFR using MDRD formula.&#xD;
