  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We and other investigators have revealed an association between Hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      seropositivity and an increased risk of developing marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZ),&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL, also known as Waldenström's macroglobulinemia), follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma (FL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The sustained virologic response&#xD;
      (SVR) to treatment with interferon or pegylated (Peg)IFN with ribavirin was closely&#xD;
      associated with the regression of HCV-associated B-cell NHL (mainly MZL, and LPL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), such as sofosbuvir,&#xD;
      have been shown to have a higher cure rate, less side effects, and a shorter duration of&#xD;
      therapy for chronic HCV infection. After the approval of DAA for HCV therapy, several recent&#xD;
      anecdotal case reports showed that indolent low-grade B-cell NHLs regressed after HCV&#xD;
      clearance by DAAs. It is noted that the time to complete remission of these lymphomas was&#xD;
      around 20 to 24 weeks after starting DAAs. These findings indicate that DAAs can eradicate&#xD;
      the trigger of lymphomagenesis by curing chronic HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because DAAs are more potent and efficient than pegylated (Peg) interferon plus ribavirin and&#xD;
      well-tolerated for the treatment of HCV infection, it is reasonable to use DAAs as the&#xD;
      frontline treatment for HCV-positive patients with indolent B-cell NHL, such as MZL, LPL, and&#xD;
      low-grade FL, who do not require immediate cytoreductive therapy. The aim of this proposal is&#xD;
      to assess whether Harvoni® (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) could eradicate HCV and lead to&#xD;
      durable complete remission of these lymphomas..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although several epidemiological studies, including our study have been demonstrated the link&#xD;
      between HCV and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), the direct evidence of the&#xD;
      HCV-associated-NHL remains uncertain. Direct antiviral agents (DAA) have been shown to have a&#xD;
      higher cure rate, less side effects, and a shorter duration of therapy for chronic HCV&#xD;
      infection. Whether DAA treatment can cure HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL remains unclear?&#xD;
      If yes, a direct evidence of HCV-associated lymphomagenesis will be approved. Because DAAs&#xD;
      are more potent and efficient than pegylated (Peg) interferon plus ribavirin and&#xD;
      well-tolerated for the treatment of HCV infection, it is reasonable to use DAAs as the&#xD;
      frontline treatment for HCV-positive patients with indolent B-cell NHL, such as MZL, LPL, and&#xD;
      low-grade FL, who do not require immediate cytoreductive therapy. The aim of this proposal is&#xD;
      to assess whether Harvoni® (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) could eradicate HCV and lead to&#xD;
      durable complete remission of HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the translational part, we will assess the expression pattern of BAFF-related canonical&#xD;
      and non-canonical NF-κB signaling molecules by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and&#xD;
      t(11;18)(q21;q21), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in&#xD;
      pre-treatment tumors samples of patients in prospectively predicting the antiviral&#xD;
      responsiveness of HCV-positive indolent B-cell NHLs. The serum cytokines and chemokines,&#xD;
      IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13 and CXCL13, BAFF level, and HCV RNA load before&#xD;
      and after DAA treatment in HCV-associated indolent B-cell NHLs will be examined. The genotype&#xD;
      of the HLA class II, and cloning followed by sequences of the VH region of the immunoglobulin&#xD;
      gene derived from pre-treatment tumor samples will be assessed.&#xD;
