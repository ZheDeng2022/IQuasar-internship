  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the acute effect of isotonic versus isometric exercise versus walking&#xD;
      on pain in individuals with plantar heel pain and an ultrasound-diagnosed plantar&#xD;
      fasciopathy. The hypothesis is that isometric exercise will induce greater participant rated&#xD;
      pain relief than isotonic exercise and walking during aggravating activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be required to attend three sessions (isometric, isotonic, or walking)&#xD;
      within a maximum of two weeks. The order in which the participant completes the sessions will&#xD;
      be randomised.There will be a minimum of 48 hours between sessions. To account for potential&#xD;
      time of day differences in terms of pain, all sessions will be performed within Â±1 hour (e.g.&#xD;
      if the first session is performed at 10 AM the remaining two sessions will be performed&#xD;
      between 9 and 11 AM). After diagnosis, randomisation of the order of which the sessions will&#xD;
      be performed, and have their pain during an aggravating activity examined (aggravating&#xD;
      activities will be static stance, half squat or heel raise). Subsequently the participants&#xD;
      will be instructed in performing either isotonic or isometric heel raise or walking,&#xD;
      (determined according to the randomisation) by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed according to a pre-established analysis plan using&#xD;
      STATA ver. 14. The assumption of negligible carryover effects is investigated with a&#xD;
      preliminary test. The primary analysis will test the presence of a difference in EIH between&#xD;
      isotonic and isometric exercise and walking and a 3 X 2 repeated measures ANOVA will be&#xD;
      performed. Independent factors will be exercise type (isometric vs. isotonic vs. walking) and&#xD;
      time (pre vs. post). If an interaction is found, post-hoc paired t-tests will be performed.&#xD;
      The standardised mean difference (effect size) and its confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated and presented in a forest plot. Apriori it has been determined that no conclusions&#xD;
      will be made favouring either of the exercises nor walking if pain is reduced less than the&#xD;
      clinically important difference of 19 mm VAS. In addition, the proportion of clinically&#xD;
      relevant pain reductions (i.e. a pain reduction of at least 19 mm VAS) will be calculated.&#xD;
      EIH by pain experienced during the aggravating activity before the exercises and walking will&#xD;
      also be presented in a plot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses using a 3 X 2 repeated measures ANOVAs will test if there is a difference&#xD;
      in the thickness of the plantar fascia and a difference in PPTs from before to after either&#xD;
      of the exercises or walking and a difference in pain experienced during the exercises or&#xD;
      walking. If interactions are found post-hoc paired t-tests will be performed. A paired t-test&#xD;
      will be performed to investigate potential differences in plantar fascia thickness from&#xD;
      before to after the initial PPT and pain aggravating activity are performed. Effect sizes&#xD;
      will be calculated for the difference in pressure pain threshold and plantar fascia&#xD;
      thickness. The association between thickness of the plantar fascia and the difference in pain&#xD;
      from before to after the exercise activities will be investigated using Pearson's correlation&#xD;
      coefficient.&#xD;

    <description>The isometric exercise is performed standing with the forefoot on a step. The participant is instructed to stand still with the ankle joint in neutral and hold this position. Supporting oneself for balance by placing the hands on a wall or a rail is allowed. The participant performs 5 sets of 45-second isometric holds. The load used is the heaviest possible load that the participant is able to withstand for 1 minute. As with the isotonic exercise, if the participant's body weight is inadequate the participant is fitted with a backpack with books and/or weights.</description>

    <description>The isotonic exercise is performed standing with the forefoot on a step. The toes are maximally dorsi-flexed by placing a towel underneath them. The participant is instructed to perform a heel-raise to a maximal plantar flexion in the ankle joint, and afterwards to lower the heel to maximal dorsi flexion. Supporting oneself for balance by placing the hands on a wall or a rail is allowed. The participant performs 4 sets of 8 repetitions with a load of 8RM. The contraction time is 3s concentric, 2s isometric and 3s eccentric and will be guided by a metronome.&#xD;
If the participant's body weight is inadequate to reach sufficient loading during the exercises the participant is fitted with a backpack with books and/or weights.</description>
