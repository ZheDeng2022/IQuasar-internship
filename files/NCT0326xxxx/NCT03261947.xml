    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of TAK-931 in a cohort of&#xD;
      Western participants with metastatic solid tumors and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      TAK-931 in participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous&#xD;
      esophageal cancer (sqEC), and squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC).&#xD;

      Pancreatic Arm Now Closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-931. TAK-931 blocks function of a specific&#xD;
      protein called CDC7 kinase in the human body. TAK-931 is being tested in participants with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer (colorectal, pancreatic, sqNSCLC and sqEC) in the United States and Japan&#xD;
      and also in the participants with any type of metastatic cancer with no standard therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative in the United States only. This study will look at the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of TAK-931.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 160 participants. Participants will be enrolled in 5&#xD;
      cohorts: 1) Western safety cohort, to be enrolled in the United States only, will include&#xD;
      non-Japanese participants with metastatic solid tumors and no standard therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative, 2) Metastatic pancreatic cancer cohort, 3) Metastatic colorectal cancer cohort,&#xD;
      4) Metastatic sqNSCLC cohort, and 5) Metastatic sqEC cohort. All participants will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • TAK-931 50 mg (2x25 mg or 5x10 mg) capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one 50 mg (2x25 mg or 5x10 mg) capsule at the same&#xD;
      time of the day every day for 14 days, followed by 7 days break in 21-day cycles throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Japan. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 24 months. Participants will make multiple visits&#xD;
      to the clinic. Participants in both Western cohort and disease specific cohorts will be&#xD;
      followed for progression-free survival every 12 weeks after the last dose of the study drug&#xD;
      until the occurrence of disease progression, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal, death,&#xD;
      start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, study termination, or until 6 months after&#xD;
      discontinuation of the study treatment, whichever occurs first. Once disease progression is&#xD;
      confirmed, participants in the disease-specific cohorts will be followed for overall survival&#xD;
      every 12 weeks until death, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal, study termination, or&#xD;
      transfer of a participant to a long term safety study, single participant investigational new&#xD;
      drug application, or similar program after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 12 investigative sites in Japan and the United States from 25 October 2017 to 24 August 2020.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study had two parts, Part 1 (Safety Cohort) enrolled western participants with locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors to receive TAK-931 and assessed safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. In Part 2, participants were enrolled into Tumor (Disease)-Specific Cohorts based on tumor criteria: pancreatic cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous esophageal cancer (sqEC), squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) to receive TAK-931 and were assessed for antitumor activity.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR) in Tumor-Specific Cohorts</title>
        <description>DCR was defined as percentage of participants documented to have unconfirmed CR, PR, or SD for at least 6 weeks from treatment initiation according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as the best response. CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documentation of PD (including clinical progression or clinical deterioration) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST V1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurred after receiving study drug. TEAEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, where Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; Grade 4:Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5:Death related to AE. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria.</description>

      <desc>At each visit the investigator had to document any occurrence of adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings. Any event spontaneously reported by the participant or observed by the investigator was recorded, irrespective of the relation to study treatment. A total of 67 deaths occurred in this study. Since all the information for death data could not be collected, not all deaths could be reported in all-cause mortality.</desc>
