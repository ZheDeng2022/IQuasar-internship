  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the correlation between the distribution&#xD;
      of F-18 FES within ER+ breast tumors as seen on Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) images of&#xD;
      the breast, and the distribution of cells stained ER+ within the tumor by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements at surgical pathology. The secondary aim is to&#xD;
      determine if the correlation (or lack of) between F-18 FES uptake and F-18 FDG uptake as&#xD;
      imaged by PEM, is an accurate representation of the heterogeneity of ER expression in the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will recruit up to 20 patients with newly diagnosed ER+ breast cancer who&#xD;
      have recently undergone or are scheduled to undergo a clinically-indicated breast MRI&#xD;
      examination and are scheduled for surgical excision of the breast cancer. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo two PEM studies, one with F-18 FDG and the second with F-18 FES. As F-18 FES is not&#xD;
      an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical, this FES study will be performed under an investigator&#xD;
      IND cross-referenced to the National Cancer Institute IND 79,005 for F-18 FES. A time&#xD;
      interval of 6-8 hours will be required between performance of the F-18 FDG study and the F-18&#xD;
      FES study. All patients will have the 2 PEM studies within 30 business days of the clinically&#xD;
      indicated MRI. See Study Schema shown below. Subjects must meet the following eligibility&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postmenopausal women, as defined by a. Lack of menstrual periods for ≥ 12 months b. For&#xD;
           women with prior hysterectomy and age &lt; 60, a serum FSH level within the postmenopausal&#xD;
           range&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Histologic proof of invasive breast carcinoma that is ER positive per ASCO/CAP&#xD;
           guidelines (staining in ≥ 1% of cells by immunohistochemistry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Extent of disease confirmed, or to be confirmed, on a clinical contrast-enhanced breast&#xD;
           MRI examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Minimum size criteria for index cancer of 10 mm as measured on mammogram, ultrasound, or&#xD;
           MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Planned surgical excision of the breast cancer at Mayo Clinic, Rochester&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be consented prior to undergoing the PEM studies. The order in which&#xD;
      the PEM and MRI studies are performed will NOT be randomized, and will be dictated by patient&#xD;
      schedule. Co-registration of the PEM images from F-18 FDG and F-18 FES will be used to assess&#xD;
      the heterogeneity of uptake of the F-18 FES relative to that of F-18 FDG. Heterogeneity of ER&#xD;
      expression in the tumor will be determined by immunohistochemistry on the pathologic tissue&#xD;
      and findings will then be correlated with the ratio of activity in the co-registered images&#xD;
      of F-18 FES and F-18 FDG. An integrated interpretation of the MRI and PEM images will be&#xD;
      performed to match lesions seen on the three scans and will be made available to the ordering&#xD;
      physician and surgeon.&#xD;
