      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of apatinib mesylate tablets plus&#xD;
      tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsules induction chemotherapy in locally advanced&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck patients who were judged surgically unresectable or&#xD;
      appropriate for non-surgical definitive therapy.The primary purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of apatinib mesylate tablets plus tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium&#xD;
      capsules in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck&#xD;
