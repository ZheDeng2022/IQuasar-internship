      The aim of this study is to assess the Correlation between The Arabic Pediatric Voice Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (PV-RQOL), The Auditory Perceptual Assessment and Acoustic Analysis of voice&#xD;
      of dysphonic children. This is important to provide an efficient therapeutic strategy for&#xD;
      these children.&#xD;

      Voice is the carrier wave for speech signal. It can also be defined as an audible sound&#xD;
      produced by phonation . It is a primary mean of expression and oral communication and has&#xD;
      life-long importance to social well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through life, voice development follows and represents organic, psychological, and social&#xD;
      changes in the person .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any disruption of the function of voice is called dysphonia . defination of dysphonia is&#xD;
      perceptual audible change of a patient's habitual voice as self-judged or judged by his or&#xD;
      her listeners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of the pediatric voice disorders ranges from 6%-23%, while, stated that voice&#xD;
      disorders affect approximately 6-9% of pediatric population. Boys were statistically more&#xD;
      likely to have dysphonia (7.5%) over girls (4.6%) , abnormal vocal presentations&#xD;
      (symptomatology) include: phonasthenia ,dysphonia, aphonia and dysodia. Dysphonia may&#xD;
      adversely impact a child's general health, communicative effectiveness, social and&#xD;
      educational development, self-esteem, and participation in school group activities. Hence,&#xD;
      dysphonia has a substantial negative effect on children's lives.Although voice disorders are&#xD;
      common in the pediatric population; there is still a lack of information available to&#xD;
      clinicians regarding evaluation and treatment of pediatric voice disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology of Voice disorders can be subdivided into 3 main groups: There are the organic voice&#xD;
      disorders (There are detectable morphological changes in the vocal apparatus), Non-organic&#xD;
      (functional) voice disorders (There is no detectable organic pathology in the structure of&#xD;
      the larynx) and Minimal Associated Pathological Lesions (MAPLs) (Long-standing, non-organic&#xD;
      (functional) voice disorders leading to the creation of detectable organic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of evaluation of voice disorders is constructed /built in escalating stepwise&#xD;
      stages from the simple subjective bed-side diagnostic procedures to the more sophisticated&#xD;
      objective quantitative instrumental measures. Thus the protocol encompasses the following 3&#xD;
      levels which are 1- Elementary diagnostic procedures, 2-Clinical diagnostic aids 3-Additional&#xD;
      instrumental measures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several instruments have been designed specifically to evaluate quality of life outcomes in&#xD;
      dysphonic populations. The best validated and most utilized surveys are the Voice Handicap&#xD;
      Index (VHI) , the Voice Outcome Survey (VOS) and the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQoL) .&#xD;
      These instruments were designed to be used in the assessment of dysphonic patients and were&#xD;
      validated in adult populations. Since their dissemination, each of these instruments have&#xD;
      produced a pediatric analogue, namely a pediatric VOS (PVOS) , a pediatric V-RQoL and a&#xD;
      pediatric VHI (PVHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire may help to increase the patient's awareness of the impact of dysphonia and his&#xD;
      motivation for change. The Questionnaires have also been proven sensitive to post-changes and&#xD;
      are an additional and valuable tool in the determination of therapy efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Minia University, a study was carried out to develop an Arabic version of PVRQoL and test&#xD;
      its validity and reliability .The results suggested that the APVRQoL is a valid and reliable&#xD;
      assessment tool that can be used by the parents of Arabic-speaking children or by the&#xD;
      children themselves (when they are older) with voice disorders to assess the impact of&#xD;
      dysphonia on the quality of their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The (PV-RQOL) has 10 questions that are divided among 4 subdomains: The social (questions no:&#xD;
      8 and 10), emotional (questions no: 4 and 5) , The physical (questions no: 2 and 3) and the&#xD;
      functional (questions no: 1, 6,7 and 9), each question is rated from 1to5 (1=no problem and&#xD;
      is given&quot;10 points&quot;,2=a small amount and is given&quot;7.5points&quot;,3=a moderate amount and is&#xD;
      given&quot;5 points&quot;,4=a lot and is given&quot;2.5 points&quot;, and 5=problem is as bad as it can be, and&#xD;
      is given&quot;0 points&quot;. Thus the raw scores can range from 0 to 100 points with higher scores&#xD;
      indicating a better quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Application of the Arabic Pediatric Voice Related Quality of Life (PV-RQOL): all participants /parents of the participants will be given (PV-RQOL) form that consists of 10 questions divided among 4 subdomains: The social (questions no: 8 and 10), emotional (questions no: 4 and 5) , The physical (questions no: 2 and 3) and the functional (questions no: 1, 6,7 and 9) . Thus the total score can range from 0 to 100 points with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.and Auditory perceptual assessment (APA) of the participant's voice: the domains will be graded on a scale of 0-3, in which 0 is normal and 3 is severe.and Acoustic voice analysis: will be carried out using Kay Elemetrics' Computerized Speech Laboratory. These measures will be obtained by recording the voice of each participant using a microphone positioned âˆ¼10 cm from his/her mouth and the participantswill be asked to phonate a sustained vowel /a/ at comfortable pitch and intensity levels.</description>
