      The investigators would like to compare the progression free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      quality of life, and safety outcomes of patients receiving versus not receiving a 2nd&#xD;
      transurethral resection of bladder tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bladder cancer (BCa) is the 4th and 12th most common malignancies by incidence in&#xD;
      Canadian men and women, respectively. In Canada, the lifetime probability of developing BCa&#xD;
      is 1 in 27 men and 1 in 84 women. Urologists use a transurethral resection of bladder tumor&#xD;
      (TURBT) to diagnose and stage patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). While&#xD;
      the value of repeat TURBT is not questioned for incomplete endoscopic resections,&#xD;
      retrospective studies have suggested value in repeat resection for high grade T1 (T1HG)&#xD;
      tumors even if they are completely resected, typically done within 6 weeks of the initial&#xD;
      resection. Repeat TURBT for T1HG BCa has been touted to detect understaged tumors, remove&#xD;
      occult residual disease, provide prognostic value and improve subsequent bladder therapy. To&#xD;
      date, there is a paucity of high quality level-1 evidence validating repeat TURBT for T1HG&#xD;
      compared to a single TURBT for improved long term disease specific outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Among patients with T1HG BCa with completely resected tumor, is repeat&#xD;
      TURBT superior to single TURBT for improving 53-year progression free survival (PFS), defined&#xD;
      as &gt;/=T2 local disease or lymph node disease/distant metastasis? Study Design: The RESECT&#xD;
      trial is designed as a pilot, single-centre, 2-arm parallel-group, superiority randomized&#xD;
      trial, with random permuted blocks (lengths of 4 or 6) and balanced allocation (1:1),&#xD;
      conducted at the University Health Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Adult patients with completely resected T1HG bladder urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      are eligible to participate. Patients with either lymph node/distant metastases at&#xD;
      presentation, variant histology, those that had their initial resection performed outside of&#xD;
      a study centre, or patients with severe comorbidities are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Repeat TURBT (experimental) versus T1HG standard of care (active control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome is the difference between the two intervention arms with&#xD;
      regards to PFS over 5-years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes are the difference between the&#xD;
      two intervention arms in: (i) clinical measures; (ii) survival measures; (iii) perioperative&#xD;
      safety measures; and (iv) quality of life (QOL) questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Randomization will occur at the central coordinating site using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization schedule and random permuted blocks (of lengths 4 or 6). The&#xD;
      allocation sequence will be implemented using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Neither participants nor treating physicians will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation. The research/data analyst team will be blinded as will the radiologists that&#xD;
      assess surveillance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: To test feasibility, a sample of 18 cases in 1 year is expected. Analysis:&#xD;
      Proportional outcomes will be analyzed with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and continuous&#xD;
      variables will be analyzed with Student's t-test. Time to event outcomes will be analyzed&#xD;
      using log-rank tests on Kaplan-Meier estimates, followed by adjusted Cox proportional-hazard&#xD;
      models. Continuous variables with differences between two time periods will be analyzed suing&#xD;
      an analysis of covariance, with baseline values and centre adjusted for as covariates.&#xD;
      Continuous variable outcomes with values over multiple time periods will be analyzed using&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of covariance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: In addition to baseline assessment, each participant will be followed up at 3, 6,&#xD;
      9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 months after the intervention with cystoscopic&#xD;
      evaluation, and assessment of disease progression and QOL. Surveillance imaging will be every&#xD;
      6 months for the 5-year follow-up.&#xD;

The FACT-Bl metric is validated for measuring HRQOL of patients with BCa. This questionnaire is designed for patients with bladder cancer and includes assessment of four general domains (physical, social/family, emotional and function), with patients responding to statements on a five-point ordinal Likert scale ranging from zero to four. Additionally, there are statements concerning urinary tract symptoms, intestinal symptoms and sexual symptoms (10 statements), with two more for those with a stoma. With 39 statements, the highest score achievable is 156.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete initial resection by a BCa-focused urologic oncologist; mandatory bladder&#xD;
             detrusor muscle in the initial TURBT specimen and complete visible resection&#xD;
             documented by the surgeon/OR staff by intra-operative photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urothelial carcinoma as the predominant histology as determined by genitourinary&#xD;
             specific pathologist (e.g. small (&lt;50%) components of small cell, squamous cell or&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma are allowable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years old: BCa is primarily a disease of the elderly, thus we have elected to&#xD;
             include healthy octogenarian/nonagenarian patients. Additionally, since a TURBT can be&#xD;
             performed under general or spinal anesthesia, we feel that including these patients is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lymph node or distant metastases at initial presentation - determined on standard BCa&#xD;
             staging evaluation with a CT-urogram of the abdomen/pelvis and/or a preoperative chest&#xD;
             x-ray demonstrating pulmonary metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extensive NMIBC disease warranting immediate cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Variant histology (not urothelial carcinoma) - ie. micropapillary, plasmacytoid,&#xD;
             nested or sarcomatoid variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No muscularis propria (inadequate bladder staging) present in the initial TURBT&#xD;
             specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initial TURBT demonstrating T1HG disease performed outside of study centre - as per&#xD;
             study protocol, quality control of surgical performance for this trial requires the&#xD;
             TURBT to be performed by an experienced BCa-dedicated surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe comorbidities, including but not limited to: (i) previous stroke&#xD;
             with persistent cognitive, motor, etc deficits; (ii) recent (&lt;6 months) myocardial&#xD;
             infarction or current unstable angina; (iii) liver cirrhosis; (iv) severe chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/respiratory disease. Patients must be suitable&#xD;
             candidates for either spinal or general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation.&#xD;
