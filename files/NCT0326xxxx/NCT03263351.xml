  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been a rise in type 2 diabetes (T2D) rates in adolescents, disproportionately in&#xD;
      girls from disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups. This group of girls also is at heightened risk&#xD;
      for depression, and depression and T2D are linked. Depressive symptoms are a risk factor for&#xD;
      worsening of insulin sensitivity, one if the major precursors to T2D. In preliminary studies,&#xD;
      the investigators found that a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy group decreased depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and prevented worsening of insulin sensitivity in adolescent girls at-risk for T2D&#xD;
      with moderate depressive symptoms. The aims of this study are: 1) to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy depression group vs. a health education control group for&#xD;
      improving insulin sensitivity and preserving insulin secretion in racially/ethnically diverse&#xD;
      adolescent girls at-risk for T2D with moderate depressive symptoms over a 1-year follow-up;&#xD;
      2) to evaluate changes in eating, physical activity, and sleep as explanatory and 3) to test&#xD;
      changes in cortisol factors as explanatory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been rapid escalation of type 2 diabetes (T2D) rates in adolescents. Early-onset&#xD;
      T2D (&lt;20y) typically shows a more aggressive course than adult-onset T2D and&#xD;
      disproportionately affects girls from disadvantaged, racial/ethnic groups. This group of&#xD;
      girls also is at heightened risk for depression, and depression and T2D are linked.&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms often manifest in adolescence and are a prospective risk factor for&#xD;
      worsening of insulin sensitivity, the major physiological precursor-in combination with&#xD;
      deterioration of pancreatic β-cell capacity to secrete insulin-in the path to T2D. The&#xD;
      effects of depression on poor insulin sensitivity remain even after accounting for adiposity.&#xD;
      In theory, depressive symptoms may worsen insulin sensitivity through stress-induced&#xD;
      behaviors (e.g., disinhibited eating, physical inactivity, sleep disturbance) and&#xD;
      stress-induced physiological causal mechanisms (e.g., hypercortisolism). The central theme of&#xD;
      this study is that intervening to reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents at-risk for T2D&#xD;
      may offer an innovative, targeted approach to ameliorate insulin resistance and to,&#xD;
      consequently, preserve β-cell function and lessen T2D risk. In preliminary data, the&#xD;
      investigators found initial evidence that a 6-week cognitive-behavioral group decreased&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and prevented worsening of insulin sensitivity 1 year later in overweight&#xD;
      and obese girls with moderate depressive symptoms and a family history of T2D, in comparison&#xD;
      to a 6-week health education control group. Directly extending these findings, the primary&#xD;
      aims of this study are: 1) to assess the efficacy of a 6-week cognitive-behavioral depression&#xD;
      group vs. a 6-week health education control group for improving insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      preserving β-cell function in racially/ethnically diverse adolescent girls at-risk for T2D&#xD;
      with moderate depressive symptoms over a 1-year follow-up; 2) to evaluate changes in eating,&#xD;
      physical activity, and sleep as behavioral explanatory mediators underlying the relationship&#xD;
      between decreases in depressive symptoms and improvements in insulin sensitivity and β-cell&#xD;
      function over 1 year and 3) to test changes in cortisol awakening response, diurnal cortisol&#xD;
      rhythm, and total daily cortisol output as physiological mechanisms explaining the&#xD;
      relationship between decreases in depressive symptoms and improvements in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and β-cell function over 1 year.&#xD;
