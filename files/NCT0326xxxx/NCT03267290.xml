    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unique regarding diagnosis because the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      without pathology proof is accepted. The dynamic image, including contrast-enhanced computed&#xD;
      tomography (CECT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image (CEMRI) were recognized in&#xD;
      many guidelines for diagnosing the HCC. In contrast to the CT and MRI, ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      with/without contrast is suggested by several societies as the sufficient surveillance&#xD;
      modality. The contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has aroused more attentions regarding the&#xD;
      rapid improvement of contrast medium. In this study, the investigators conducted a&#xD;
      prospective, single-center, open-label trial to compare the efficacy and safety of CEUS +&#xD;
      CEMRI in characterizing HCC, in comparison with CECT + CEMRI.&#xD;

      The liver cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resulted in more than 7,000&#xD;
      mortalities in Taiwan every year. HCC is unique regarding diagnosis because the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis without pathology proof is accepted. The dynamic image, including contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      computed tomography (CECT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image (CEMRI) were&#xD;
      recognized in many guidelines for diagnosing the HCC including Taiwan National Health&#xD;
      insurance. Currently established guidelines endorse 3-phasic CT and MRI as first-line&#xD;
      modalities. In contrast to the CT and MRI, ultrasound (US) with/without contrast is suggested&#xD;
      by several societies as the most sufficient surveillance modality. However, the advantage of&#xD;
      US in liver cirrhosis with regenerative nodules is only 32-65% in sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has aroused more attentions regarding the rapidly&#xD;
      improvement of contrast medium. In addition to Italian association for the study of the&#xD;
      liver, the Japan society has documented CEUS as an integral part in the diagnosis algorism.&#xD;
      Two phases, i.e. vascular phase and Kupffer phase, could be interpreted with second&#xD;
      generation contrast agents, Sonazoid, for differentiating liver tumors. For liver tumor that&#xD;
      failed to present washout phase in CECT or CEMRI, CEUS might be helpful because a tumor lack&#xD;
      of contrast uptake in the Kupffer phase is favouring HCC. However, previous reports were&#xD;
      confined to retrospective studies or small population, and more solid evidence is required to&#xD;
      identify the diagnosis feasibility of CEUS with specific contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators conducted a prospective, single-center, open-label trial to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of CEUS + CEMRI in characterizing HCC, in comparison with&#xD;
      CECT + CEMRI. 60 patients with liver tumours no larger than 3cm in diameter will be enrolled,&#xD;
      and tumour specimen will be obtained after imaging examination by tumour resection or biopsy.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the sensitivity and specificity between the study groups, use the&#xD;
      histology as reference diagnosis. The secondary endpoints include (1) the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of CEUS+CECT, CECT+CEMRI in differential diagnosis of liver tomours as malignant&#xD;
      or benign, use the histology as reference diagnosis, (2) adverse effects, (3) vital signs&#xD;
      (blood pressure, heart rate), and (4) laboratory values (the hematologic, renal and hepatic&#xD;
      function change). Our exploratory endpoint is the detection rate of CEUS+CEMRI, CECT+CEMRI,&#xD;
      use the histology as reference diagnosis.&#xD;
