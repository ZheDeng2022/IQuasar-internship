    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 people will participate in this study. This study will compare two different&#xD;
      methods of fluoride application. Both methods are currently used in dental practice and both&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective. If the participant chooses to participate in this study,&#xD;
      participant will be asked to either wear a small tray that has been custom made to fit into&#xD;
      the mouth into which fluoride is placed and worn for 5 minutes at bedtime, or participant&#xD;
      will be asked to brush fluoride onto the teeth for 2 minutes at bedtime. Participant will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to use one of these methods of fluoride application: participant will not&#xD;
      be allowed to choose which method of application you prefer. Participant will be asked to use&#xD;
      fluoride every night while enrolled in the study. The fluoride that is used in the study is&#xD;
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and is commercially available with&#xD;
      a prescription. After the study is over, participant will need to continue to use fluoride&#xD;
      every night for life to help reduce the risk for dental cavities in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participant will receive a dental examination every 3 months for a total of&#xD;
      4 study visits over the period of 1 year. This visit will consist of a dental examination to&#xD;
      identify any new cavities and instructions for fluoride use. Participant will also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a written log to document daily fluoride use and to give feedback about&#xD;
      compliance with fluoride use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research proposal is unique in that it compares two different methods of applying&#xD;
      neutral sodium fluoride to prevent dental caries and improve compliance in this at-risk&#xD;
      population. Given that compliance with use of fluoride trays has historically been poor,&#xD;
      there is controversy as to which application method is best. Further, the optimal dosage&#xD;
      regimen is unknown. Clarification is needed to support best practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the proposed study will help to identify an effective and tolerated form of&#xD;
      fluoride delivery in patients undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. If our hypotheses&#xD;
      are supported, additional studies will be undertaken with a larger sample size, and expanded&#xD;
      to include patients with head and neck cancers treated with chemotherapy or a combination of&#xD;
      cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo an initial dental visit, which will consist of medical consultation&#xD;
      with the patient's oncologist and standard dental and radiographic examinations. Patients&#xD;
      will return to have existing dental disease treated (eg. caries, gingival disease,&#xD;
      extractions). When treatment is complete, they will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      The Screening Form will be used to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit #1 (Baseline) After obtaining consent, subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive fluoride therapy with either custom trays (Tray group) or by application with a&#xD;
      toothbrush (Brush group). Each subject will undergo a basic dental examination for&#xD;
      identification of new carious lesions. Visit #1 is the baseline, with a new caries score of&#xD;
      zero. Photographs will be taken of the subject's mouth and instructions for fluoride therapy&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tray group: The subject will have custom vinyl vacuform fluoride trays made using an in-house&#xD;
      laboratory. They will be instructed to apply a &quot;ribbon&quot; of fluoride gel into each tray, and&#xD;
      then to wear each tray for 5 minutes, one tray at a time, after which the subject will&#xD;
      expectorate any remaining fluoride from the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brush group: The subject will be instructed to apply a &quot;ribbon&quot; of fluoride gel onto the&#xD;
      toothbrush provided (Colgate Wave Sensitive) and to brush with the fluoride for 2 minutes at&#xD;
      bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: The subject may not rinse, eat, or drink for 30 minutes after the fluoride&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be instructed to perform their fluoride therapy at bedtime and to document&#xD;
      the date and time of treatment on the Monthly Fluoride Log. All subjects will be provided&#xD;
      with 1.1% neutral sodium fluoride (PreviDentÂ®) gel for the duration of the study. All&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to return their monthly fluoride logs and any remaining fluoride&#xD;
      at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for a follow-up examination at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the first&#xD;
      study visit. At each visit, the following procedures will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Update medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take photographs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct examination for caries&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess compliance with fluoride therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect fluoride log for previous 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dispense new fluoride log&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect and weigh returned fluoride tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weigh and dispense new fluoride tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dispense new toothbrush (Brush group only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled to immediately return to have any new carious lesions filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate compliance, subjects will be asked about their fluoride use according to standard&#xD;
      methods utilized by other experts in the field. High compliance is defined as daily use; low&#xD;
      compliance is defined as two to three times per week; not compliant is defined as less than&#xD;
      two times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate caries incidence, the number of surfaces per tooth on which new caries appear&#xD;
      will be documented on the Caries Assessment Form. Caries will be scored using the&#xD;
      International Caries Classification and Management System criteria for clinical research.&#xD;
      Surfaces will be scored as either I (no obvious decay) or II (obvious decay). Bitewing&#xD;
      radiographs and periapical films (as needed) will be taken at 6 and 12 months after the&#xD;
      initial examination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics, including means (standard deviations) or counts (percentages), as&#xD;
      appropriate, will be used to summarize baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      the two groups.&#xD;
