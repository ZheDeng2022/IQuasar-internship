  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase Ib: safety will be assessed in consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients at&#xD;
      increasing doses of TG4001 in combination with avelumab according to a 3+3 design. There will&#xD;
      be no intra-patient dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II part 1, evaluation of efficacy and further evaluation of safety of the&#xD;
      combination of TG4001 and avelumab will be performed in a single arm of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic HPV-16 positive advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase II part 2, evaluation of efficacy of the combination of TG4001 and avelumab will&#xD;
      be performed in a randomized, open-label controlled study comparing TG4001 in combination&#xD;
      with avelumab to avelumab alone in patients with HPV-16 positive advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both phases, tumor response will be evaluated on local assessment using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      or study withdrawal for any reason, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
