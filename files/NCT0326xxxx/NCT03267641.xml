  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th most common cancer in the world but the 2nd most&#xD;
      important cause of cancer death. Because of its highly heterogeneous nature, the current&#xD;
      approach to identifying druggable targets have not delivered efficacious therapies in HCC and&#xD;
      is a main reason for the high case fatality. Even when surgical resection is potentially&#xD;
      curative in early disease, tumor recurrence remains high and long term survival poor because&#xD;
      of the absence of useful adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these unmet needs, the investigators bring together internationally recognized&#xD;
      scientists from genomics and immunology and established clinician investigators in a&#xD;
      synergistic team. This TCR capitalizes on recent collaborative advances made by the PIs in&#xD;
      the consortium. The investigators have shown through multi-region sampling of freshly&#xD;
      resected HCC and phylogenetic analysis, that significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity exists&#xD;
      and have identified the specific positions of known clonal drivers. Simultaneously the&#xD;
      investigators have analyzed the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment with deep&#xD;
      immune-phenotyping and found unique inter-patient immune landscapes predictive of clinical&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This TCR is a prospective study that samples resected HCC from multi-ethnic sites within the&#xD;
      established Asia-Pacific Hepatocellular Carcinoma (AHCC) Trials Group, which has enrolled&#xD;
      approximately 1000 patients through 6 multi-center trials in 35 centers in the region.&#xD;
      Clinical trajectories are tracked and genomic and immunological studies are repeated when&#xD;
      tumors recu r, to confirm clonally dominant driver mutations and immunological processes that&#xD;
      are targetable. Concurrently, representative pre-clinical models will be developed from the&#xD;
      tissues sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to combine these approaches to overcome the challenges posed by genomic&#xD;
      heterogeneity and to guide the development of therapeutics and precision medicine in HCC.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female patients, 21 to 80 years of age at the time of signature of the&#xD;
             informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically proven HCC after liver resection. Combined&#xD;
             hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HCC limited to the liver with no extra-hepatic metastasis on CT or MRI of the abdomen&#xD;
             and chest (defined as lymph node &lt;2 cm, lung nodules &lt; 1 cm, farther lymph nodes &lt; 2&#xD;
             cm) according to the AASLD criteria65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. R0 or R1 resection on histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eligibility according to tumour size:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Large tumour &gt;= 5 cm (preferred)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Smaller tumours &gt;=2cm and &lt; 5cm&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Multifocal tumours - maximum of 3 total tumours with size &gt;=2cm detected from&#xD;
                  CT-scan. Detection of &lt;1cm tumour intra-operatively or upon histologic&#xD;
                  examination following resection can be ignored. For multiple satellite nodules&#xD;
                  (&gt;=2cm) that are detected intraoperatively, harvest ALL satellite nodules (&gt;/=&#xD;
                  2cm). DNA/RNA will be extracted from cases confirmed to be&#xD;
                  HCC/hepato-cholangiocarcinoma by histology. A MAXIMUM of 3 samples with the best&#xD;
                  quality are to be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Child-Pugh ≤ 7 points without clinical ascites before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;

          9. The patient has received no anti-cancer specific treatment for HCC eg. previous liver&#xD;
             resection, loco-regional therapy (e.g. RFA, TACE, SIRT), radiotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             chemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy other than the planned surgery. However,&#xD;
             patient who has received previous HCC resection more than 5 years ago is deemed to&#xD;
             have a de-novo liver tumour and therefore can be included.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Single lesion &lt; 2 cm at the time of tumour resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites, except&#xD;
             effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or&#xD;
             effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for over 5 years and highly&#xD;
             likely to have been cured.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy,&#xD;
