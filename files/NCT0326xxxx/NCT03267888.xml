    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage I-III multiple myeloma that has come back after a period of&#xD;
      improvement or that does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with stage I-III&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of concurrent single/low dose radiation therapy (radiotherapy) (8&#xD;
      Gy/1fx) in combination with pembrolizumab in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] &gt;&#xD;
      grade 2 toxicity at 6 and 12 months) and the effect of radiation in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab on systemic response rates using international myeloma working group (IMWG)&#xD;
      uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a&#xD;
      result of combining pembrolizumab and radiotherapy at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy on day 1. Patients also receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 2 or 3. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
