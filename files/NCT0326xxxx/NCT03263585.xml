    <textblock>
      Background: Back pain and osteoporosis with vertebral fractures are common conditions in&#xD;
      elderly women and significantly affect their quality of life. A common complication of&#xD;
      osteoporosis are vertebral fractures. Treatment with bone-specific drugs does often not help&#xD;
      the pain condition caused by the vertebral fractures even when the progress of the disease&#xD;
      has decreased. Vertebral fractures often result in deformation of the spine and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life of the individual. The spinal kyphosis also affects the lung function and the&#xD;
      effect of the kyphosis itself is severe. Alternative treatments of back pain may lead to&#xD;
      reduced drug demand for pain. Physical activity is one of the most important factors that&#xD;
      regulates bone mass and can also affect balance and fall risk positively. The back orthosis&#xD;
      that we intend to use in the treatment study has been shown in some previous scientific&#xD;
      studies to strengthen the muscles in the back and also decrease the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of back pain in&#xD;
      elderly women with an activating functional orthosis versus treatment with a group of&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic tools and a control group for a six-month treatment period and follow-up&#xD;
      after 12 months from the start of study. The aim was also to study elderly women with&#xD;
      osteoporosis and back pain in a follow-up study of a cohort of women at high risk of&#xD;
      osteoporotic fractures, with focus on back pain, functional capacity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim was to study the effect of treatment with activating functional orthosis versus&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic treatment in a group and a control group without treatment. The main&#xD;
      outcomes will be the experienced perceived back pain and back extensor strength. Additional&#xD;
      outcomes will be quality of life, balance, lung function and kyphosis. Biochemical markers&#xD;
      for pain will be measured in the RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Evaluation of alternative treatment methods such as exercise by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist and treatment with a functional orthosis will give new additional treatment&#xD;
      options for our patients. An activating functional orthosis could reduce the use of&#xD;
      analgesics and increase the quality of life of the affected women.&#xD;

      The aims: 1. Identification in a population-based cohort of elderly women the occurrence of&#xD;
      vertebral fractures, back pain and their impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To study the effect of treatment with a functional activating orthotic and physiotherapy&#xD;
      in an equipment training group, both in comparison with a control group, on the perceived&#xD;
      pain, back extensor muscle strength, quality of life, balance and incidence of falls, lung&#xD;
      function and kyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Qualitative study of how participants experienced treatment and exercise in an activating&#xD;
      orthotic. The investigators hypothesis was that a functional orthotic could be a&#xD;
      complementary treatment method that could reduce the use of analgesics and increase the&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of treatment of back pain in elderly&#xD;
      women with an activating spinal orthotic versus treatment with a physiotherapy equipment&#xD;
      training group and a control group for a six-month treatment period and a follow-up six&#xD;
      months after the end of treatment. The aim was also to identify the occurrence of vertebral&#xD;
      fractures in a cohort of elderly women and to investigate their perceived quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Osteoporosis is a condition in the skeleton that is characterized by reduced bone&#xD;
      density and an increased risk of fractures [1]. Back pain and osteoporosis with vertebral&#xD;
      fractures are common conditions in elderly women that significantly affect their quality of&#xD;
      life. Vertebral fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture [2]. Vertebral&#xD;
      fractures are underdiagnosed and are a major problem. It is estimated that only one third of&#xD;
      vertebral fractures are clinically detected [3]. The lifetime risk for a Swedish&#xD;
      postmenopausal woman to get a clinically detected vertebral fracture is approximately 15%&#xD;
      [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the acute phase, a vertebral fracture is very painful and in the aftermath the vertebral&#xD;
      fracture often leads to chronic back pain, increased kyphosis mainly located to the thoracic&#xD;
      and lumbar spine, reduction in body height and impaired lung function. There exists a&#xD;
      correlation between increased kyphosis and increased risk of falls [5]. Vertebral fractures&#xD;
      can affect important daily activities and provide a lower health-related quality of life&#xD;
      [6-8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with bone-specific drugs does not relieve the back pain caused by the vertebral&#xD;
      fractures despite improvement in the state of the disease. The kyphosis also affects lung&#xD;
      function, and the effects of the kyphosis itself have previously been considered as very&#xD;
      severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important part in the treatment of patients with osteoporosis is physical therapy with an&#xD;
      equipment training group. The goal is to maintain or increase mobility, strength and balance&#xD;
      that can improve health-related quality of life and prevent fractures. Training of the back&#xD;
      extensor muscles have shown to have a positive impact on health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      reduce back pain, and training could also affect fear of falling positively [5, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A German randomized controlled study from 2004 and one from 2011 has shown a positive effect&#xD;
      of treatment with an activating spinal orthotic on body posture, back extensor muscular&#xD;
      strength and quality of life in elderly women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures [10,&#xD;
      11]. It was shown that wearing the spinal orthotic, back extensor muscle strength was&#xD;
      increased through biofeedback. Training with the spinal orthotic also resulted in a&#xD;
      significant decrease of the kyphosis, which also affected lung function and body height&#xD;
      positively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now intend, in a randomized controlled study, to compare training in an&#xD;
      activating spinal orthotic with training in an equipment training group, led by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist, to see if positive results can be obtained in reduced back pain, increased&#xD;
      muscle strength in back extensor muscle, increasing mobility, and decreased kyphosis in the&#xD;
      thoracic and lumbar spine. It can also lead to improved lung capacity, and further increased&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. If the training method in the activating spinal orthotic&#xD;
      appears to work, it would improve the possibilities to train and treat patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis, vertebral fractures and back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A. A cross-sectional study of cohort elderly women regarding the occurrence of&#xD;
      vertebral fractures and their impact on health related quality of life and back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. A randomized controlled study where the effect of treatment with an activating spinal&#xD;
      orthotic is compared with training in an equipment training group led by a physiotherapist&#xD;
      and with an untreated control group for a six-month treatment period and a follow-up six&#xD;
      months after the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. A qualitative study with interviews in focus groups were the participating women may&#xD;
      describe their experiences of training in an activating spinal orthotic and how they&#xD;
      experience health related quality of life during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Cross-sectional study All 186 women who participated in the follow-up study of the&#xD;
      Primos project, a population-based cohort study in Stockholm were invited to participate in&#xD;
      the current study [12-15]. All these women have been re-examined clinically in a longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up study with bone density measurements of the hip, lumbar spine, whole body and heel,&#xD;
      clinical risk markers for osteoporosis and metabolic disease, nutritional status and a&#xD;
      balance tests in 2007-2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women interested in participating in the study got an invitation to a study visit. During the&#xD;
      study visit, written and oral information about the study was being given and then the women&#xD;
      signed an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
