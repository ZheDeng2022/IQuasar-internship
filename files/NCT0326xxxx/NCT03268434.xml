      Aim of the current study is to investigate the acceptance and efficacy of Metacognitive&#xD;
      Training for Depression (D-MCT) compared to cognitive remediation in outpatients with major&#xD;
      depressive disorders in a randomized, controlled, assessor-blind, group trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based treatments for depression include pharmacological and psychological&#xD;
      interventions. Within psychological interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one&#xD;
      of the most extensively researched evidence-based approaches for depression (Cuijpers, 2015).&#xD;
      However, even if optimal treatment and access to services were available to all patients, the&#xD;
      burden of depression would be reduced by only 30% (Andrews et al., 2004). Moreover, as&#xD;
      depression represents the disorder with the highest drop-out rates during CBT treatment&#xD;
      (36.4%) (Fernandez et al., 2015), and a relapse rate of 54% for treatment responders within&#xD;
      the two years after treatment termination (Vittengl et al., 2007), it is pivotal to improve&#xD;
      treatment for depression. It has been argued that this is less a question of developing novel&#xD;
      psychological treatments as of determining how existing treatments may be improved (Cuijpers,&#xD;
      2015) and better disseminated to increase retention rates and to use the waiting phase to&#xD;
      rise interest in therapy (Fernandez et al., 2015). Due to hopelessness and the discouraging&#xD;
      character of the disorder, this poses a particular challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet this aim, Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT) has been developed as a&#xD;
      low-threshold, highly standardized and yet easy to administer group concept for the treatment&#xD;
      of depression. It is conceptualized as a variant of CBT that adopts a metacognitive&#xD;
      perspective focusing on the modification of cognitive biases, and is compatible with a&#xD;
      general CBT treatment approach. Use of standardized presentations reduces time needed for&#xD;
      preparation and administration of the training; moreover, this &quot;packaging&quot; increases the&#xD;
      accessibility of D-MCT to a wide range of health care providers, and encourages&#xD;
      standardization across therapists. The training seeks to enable group members to recognize&#xD;
      and correct the often automatic and unconscious thought patterns that accompany depression.&#xD;
      To this end, it attempts to challenge cognitive biases through the use of creative and&#xD;
      engaging exercises supported by a multimedia presentation (e.g., insight based on &quot;aha&quot;&#xD;
      effects rather than psychoeducation) and to encourage patients to take a metacognitive&#xD;
      perspective (&quot;think about one's thinking&quot;). The training is highly flexible with regard to&#xD;
      depth and intensity. Patients do not need to (but may) discuss their own problems, and can&#xD;
      still experience how cognitive biases work and influence one's mood in a playful atmosphere.&#xD;
      The training is conceptualized as an open group: New patients can join the group in every&#xD;
      session. Thus, the threshold for administration of and participation in this intervention is&#xD;
      low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general structure of and exercises in D-MCT were inspired by Metacognitive Training for&#xD;
      psychosis (Moritz et al., 2014); however, contents were modified upon to suit the specific&#xD;
      problems of individuals with depression. Beside depressive thought patterns already targeted&#xD;
      in CBT (e.g., overgeneralization, &quot;mind reading&quot;), a number of general cognitive biases,&#xD;
      which have been identified by basic cognitive research, form the core of D-MCT (e.g.,&#xD;
      mood-congruent memory (Mathews and MacLeod, 2005)). Finally, as in Metacognitive Therapy&#xD;
      (MCT) sensu Adrian Wells (Wells, 2011) dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., thought&#xD;
      suppression, rumination as problem-solving) are challenged. D-MCT thus blends established&#xD;
      elements from CBT and MCT as well as newly developed and evidence-based exercises in one&#xD;
      coherent metacognitive approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-MCT was positively evaluated with regard to feasibility and acceptance in a non-randomized&#xD;
      pilot study (Jelinek et al., 2013). Moreover, efficacy of D-MCT was suggested in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trail (RCT) in comparison to an active control intervention (Jelinek et al.,&#xD;
      2016). In this trial patients with depressive disorder were completing a psychosomatic&#xD;
      outpatient treatment program and were randomly assigned to either D-MCT or general health&#xD;
      training. Severity of depression and cognitive biases were assessed at baseline (t0), post&#xD;
      treatment (t1) and 6 months (t2) later by raters blind to diagnostic status.&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated that at the end of treatment, as well as 6 months&#xD;
      later, improvement in depression was significantly greater in the D-MCT relative to the&#xD;
      health training group at medium effect sizes. A significantly greater number of patients in&#xD;
      the D-MCT group were in remission at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, the decrease in cognitive&#xD;
      biases and increase in psychological well-being/quality of life was larger in the D-MCT than&#xD;
      the health training group over time. Patients' subjective appraisal of D-MCT was also&#xD;
      positive (Jelinek et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the current study is to investigate the acceptance and efficacy of D-MCT in&#xD;
      outpatients.The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS, 17-item version) total score as well&#xD;
      as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) serve as primary outcome.&#xD;
      Self-assessed depression, dysfunctional beliefs, self-esteem, quality of life, rumination,&#xD;
      remission rate as well as neuropsychological functioning serve as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
