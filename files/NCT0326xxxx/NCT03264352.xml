      Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in high-risk hypertensive individuals reduces major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) events. Diabetic patients with hypertension benefit from BP lowering&#xD;
      treatment. The present trial, IPAD in brief, is a randomized, open-label, parallel-designed,&#xD;
      multicenter study involving nearly 12,000 patients to be recruited over three years and to be&#xD;
      followed up for a median of four years and a half. IPAD tests the hypothesis that&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications in adults with type 2 diabetes, whose seated BP 120-139 mm Hg&#xD;
      systolic and below 90 mm Hg diastolic, results in 20% difference in the incidence of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. During follow-up for participants in the&#xD;
      intensive group, the sitting systolic pressure should be decreased to below 120 mm Hg, by&#xD;
      titration and combination of the double-blind study medications of an angiotensin type-1&#xD;
      receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day), a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker&#xD;
      (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and/or other medications if necessary. For those in the standard&#xD;
      group, the sitting systolic pressure should be monitored and controlled below 140 mm Hg.&#xD;

      The IPAD trial is a randomized, open-label, parallel-designed, multicenter study. 11,414&#xD;
      patients will be recruited over three years with a median follow up of 4.5 years. IPAD tests&#xD;
      the hypothesis that intensive antihypertensive medical therapy in adult patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, whose seated BP ranges from 120 to 139 mm Hg systolic and &lt; 90 mm Hg diastolic,&#xD;
      results in 20% reduction in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      events (the primary endpoint), a composite of stroke, cardiovascular death, nonfatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for heart failure (HF) and hospitalization for&#xD;
      unstable angina. Secondary endpoints of this study include: stroke; cardiovascular death; MI;&#xD;
      hospitalization for HF; hospitalization for unstable angina; all-cause mortality; overt&#xD;
      albuminuria; worsened renal function; end-stage renal disease; development of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy that needs interventional operation; peripheral arterial diseases; new on-set&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation or flutter; cancer; change of health-related quality of life. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the study include T2DM patients aged between 45 and 79 years within the&#xD;
      aforementioned BP ranges. for participants in the intensive group, the sitting systolic BP&#xD;
      should decrease to &lt; 120 mm Hg, using titration and combination of study medications&#xD;
      consisting of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day) and a&#xD;
      dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and/or other medications if&#xD;
      necessary.For those in the standard group, the sitting systolic pressure should be monitored&#xD;
      and controlled below 140 mm Hg. Across the whole study, 844 primary endpoints are expected to&#xD;
      occur. Interim analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis at the&#xD;
      accumulation of 281 and 563 primary endpoints respectively. At the completion of the trial,&#xD;
      both an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol analysis will be performed.&#xD;
