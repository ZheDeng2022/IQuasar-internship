      Bloating, gas, pain and diarrhea are common complaints. Routine investigations are negative;&#xD;
      these patients are labeled as IBS. In these patients, whether testing for carbohydrate&#xD;
      malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is useful is unclear.&#xD;
      Investigators aim to assess the prevalence of SIBO, fructose and lactose intolerance, the&#xD;
      usefulness of breath tests, and predictive value of pre-test symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal bloating, gas, belching, distension, and diarrhea are common gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms that are reported by at least 1/3rd of patients presenting to gastroenterology&#xD;
      clinics. When routine endoscopic and radiological tests are negative1, most of these patients&#xD;
      are labeled as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in gastroenterology practice2. Unfortunately&#xD;
      these symptoms persist and these patients remain dissatisfied with their health care and&#xD;
      continue to doctor shops or seek remedies from alternative care. Several studies have shown&#xD;
      that these symptoms have a significant and negative impact on their quality of life. One&#xD;
      possible explanation for their symptom is carbohydrate food intolerance. The Western diet has&#xD;
      changed significantly over the last 3 decades. Today, large amounts of fructose are being&#xD;
      consumed. This sugar is used as a sweetener in sodas, fruit juices, multiples beverages and&#xD;
      candies. Although is naturally present in apples, peaches, pears and oranges, the exponential&#xD;
      products and consumption of the synthetic high fructose corn syrup has alarmingly increased&#xD;
      fructose consumption. When small amounts are ingested, fructose is completely absorbed from&#xD;
      the gut mainly through Glut 5transporter from the intestinal brush border or through&#xD;
      facilitated transport along glucose through the Glut 2 transporter5. If a person has either&#xD;
      limited absorptive capacity or overwhelms normal absorption capacity by excess ingestion,&#xD;
      then malabsorption of fructose ensues. This unabsorbed fructose can serve, as an osmotic&#xD;
      load, that draws fluid into the intestinal lumen, causing abdominal bloating, gas, pain and&#xD;
      diarrhea 6-7. Likewise lactose is a disaccharide that is present in dairy products and is&#xD;
      widely consumed. After ingestion lactose is hydrolyzed in the small intestine by the brush&#xD;
      border enzyme lactase into glucose and galactose that are in torn absorbed8. If lactose is&#xD;
      malabsorbed by Glut 2, then it will serve as an osmotic load, and get rapidly propelled in to&#xD;
      the colon where it is fermented by the colonic bacterial flora, into short chain fatty acid,&#xD;
      hydrogen,methane and other gases, this lactose malabsorption produces gas, bloating,&#xD;
      flatulence and diarrhea9. About 75% of the worldÂ´s population gradually lose their ability to&#xD;
      produce the lactase enzyme after age 30 years10-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malabsorption or intolerance of carbohydrates such as fructose and lactose are common and&#xD;
      frequently encountered both in the primary care and specialist gastroenterology clinics, but&#xD;
      are poorly recognized or treated. Over the last decade, breath testing has emerged as a&#xD;
      simple, non invasive method of identifying malabsorption and/ or intolerance to common food&#xD;
      ingredients such as fructose12, and lactose13, as well as to identify small intestinal&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)14. However, they are only performed in selected academic centers,&#xD;
      and their clinical utility and diagnostic yield largely remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also may the clinical utility of performing a single breath test versus a cumulative battery&#xD;
      of breath tests, such as glucose, lactose or fructose breath test, in a patient with&#xD;
      unexplained GI symptoms is also not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to investigate a consecutive series of patients with unexplained&#xD;
      chronic GI symptoms and examine; 1) the prevalence of SIBO answered by the glucose breath&#xD;
      test, fructose and lactose intolerance answered by the fructose y lactose breath test, ; 2)&#xD;
      the predictive value of pre-test symptoms in the diagnosis of SIBO or carbohydrate&#xD;
      intolerance.&#xD;
