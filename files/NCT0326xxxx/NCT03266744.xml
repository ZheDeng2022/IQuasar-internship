  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a feasibility study prior to a planned phase III trial. Currently, assessing&#xD;
      response to treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the bone is limited by the technical&#xD;
      problems associated with CT scans and bone scans. WB-MRI provides theoretical and practical&#xD;
      advantages that allow for more detailed analysis of disease response or progression. This may&#xD;
      allow for earlier identification of progressive disease and earlier change in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will have a CT scan, bone scan and WB-MRI at baseline and then&#xD;
      repeated CT and WB-MRI scans every 12 weeks (until week 96, and then every 24 weeks) until&#xD;
      there is evidence of progressive disease on either of the imaging modalities. In addition to&#xD;
      the regular scans on the study, patients will be given the opportunity to participate in a&#xD;
      study of how reproducible the findings of WB-MRI scans are. At the point of disease&#xD;
      progression, a repeat bone scan is performed and the involvement of the patient in the trial&#xD;
      comes to an end.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are eligible for RESPECT if they have bone-only metastatic breast cancer (MBC), as&#xD;
      established by standard CT and bone scintigraphy, and are starting a new line of systemic&#xD;
      therapy. This can be first line SACT or any subsequent line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergo a baseline CT scan (thorax/abdomen/pelvis) and isotope bone scan prior&#xD;
      to commencing their new systemic therapy. All CT and bone scans are performed according to&#xD;
      standard departmental protocols, with no deviations required. WB-MRI are performed within 2&#xD;
      weeks of study entry. CT scans and WB-MRI are then performed every 12 weeks until week 96,&#xD;
      and then every 24 weeks until the patient completes the study. The reporting radiologist who&#xD;
      interprets the CT scans is blinded to the images and results of the WB-MRI scan and vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study commencement Participants are required to have had a CT scan of the thorax, abdomen&#xD;
      and pelvis and a bone scan (bone scintigraphy with technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate) no&#xD;
      more than 4 weeks prior to trial entry to ensure that they have bony-only metastatic disease,&#xD;
      as defined using standard imaging. Baseline WB-MRI scans are performed within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed in clinic and a baseline physical examination is undertaken. Any&#xD;
      additional tests required for the initiation of the new SACT are performed at the discretion&#xD;
      of the treating clinician and according to local protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study CT scans and WB-MRI are performed every 12 weeks until week 96, and then&#xD;
      every 24 weeks until disease progression is evident (as defined in the study protocol). Scans&#xD;
      are performed within the range of 7 days prior and 7 days after the planned 12 weekly scan&#xD;
      interval date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is evidence of equivocal disease progression on WB-MRI only, a repeat WB-MRI is&#xD;
      undertaken between 28 and 42 days after the equivocal WB-MRI to confirm or refute the&#xD;
      presence of progressive disease. If this confirmed disease progression, then the date of&#xD;
      progression is defined as that of the original WB-MRI (i.e. the one performed 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      earlier). No repeat CT scans are performed alongside the confirmatory WB-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are reviewed in outpatient clinic after every imaging time point so that the&#xD;
      results of the CT and WB-MRI can be relayed to them by their oncologist and a decision can be&#xD;
      made about their ongoing treatment. If more frequent clinic reviews are required then these&#xD;
      are not prohibited by the trial protocol. As with the frequency of imaging, the required&#xD;
      trial clinic visits change to every 24 weeks after the week 96 visit. During these clinic&#xD;
      visits a clinical assessment is made and a full physical examination undertaken. Current&#xD;
      anti-cancer drug therapy, including any changes, are documented. Any skeletal related events&#xD;
      are also documented. Skeletal related events are defined within the RESPECT study as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pathological fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metastatic spinal cord compression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radiotherapy for bone pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgery to site of bone metastasis Case report forms are completed by the trial&#xD;
           administrators at every imaging time point. These are referred to as week 12, week 24,&#xD;
           week 36 and so forth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Imaging Questionnaires are performed at the week 12 and week 36 visits, and are&#xD;
      completed by the patients within the radiology department soon after their CT and WB-MRI&#xD;
      scans has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the study protocol is reached when any of the following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Progressive bone and/or visceral disease is demonstrated on CT scan and WB-MRI (as&#xD;
           defined in section X).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unequivocal progressive bone and/or visceral disease is demonstrated on WB-MRI alone (as&#xD;
           defined in section X).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CT and/or WB-MRI findings requiring intervention such as palliative radiotherapy, or a&#xD;
           change in systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Equivocal evidence of progressive bone and/or visceral disease (not meeting the full&#xD;
           criteria for disease progression in section 7.1.3) demonstrated on WB-MRI only, with&#xD;
           confirmation of findings on repeat WB-MRI undertaken 4-6 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Symptomatic skeletal disease or evidence of clinical progression of disease that&#xD;
           necessitates a change in systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat nuclear medicine bone scan is undertaken once the participant met one of the end of&#xD;
      study criteria above.&#xD;
