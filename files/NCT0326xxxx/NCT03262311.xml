  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the potential of a relatively simple serum assay that&#xD;
      aims to identify patient subpopulations whose curative radiotherapy outcome is likely to be&#xD;
      compromised by radiobiological tumour hypoxia (prognostic value) and who are most likely to&#xD;
      gain (predictive value) from the addition of radiation sensitiser drugs or targeted&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose escalation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Aim: To analyse tiny cancer cell fragments called extracellular vesicles isolated from blood&#xD;
      samples for their ability to identify patients with tumours that are relatively&#xD;
      oxygen-starved and expected to be resistant to ionising radiation and many chemotherapy&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 16 patients with proven cancer plus 4 healthy volunteers who give written&#xD;
      informed consent to participate will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Eligible patients will be identified in the Outpatient Department at The Royal&#xD;
      Marsden in Sutton or London and given a copy of the Information Sheet describing the study in&#xD;
      detail. Dr Somaiah's team will call these potential volunteers at least 24 hours after they&#xD;
      have received written information about the study to answer any questions. The same consent&#xD;
      process will be followed for staff members who agree to participate as healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Research subjects who offer verbal agreement to participate will be asked for written consent&#xD;
      and will be allocated a study ID. This will be used on all trial documentation and blood&#xD;
      samples together with their initials and date of data/sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pimonidazole administration: This well-established drug has the valuable property of binding&#xD;
      exclusively to oxygen- starved tissues in a form that can be detected as a colour change in&#xD;
      cell fragments released into the blood stream. A single oral dose of pimonidazole 500 mg/m2&#xD;
      will be prescribed and administered in a Royal Marsden outpatient clinic after confirmation&#xD;
      of eligibility and completion of written informed consent. A member of the research team will&#xD;
      monitor subjects to ensure that the prescribed drug is successfully taken (swallowed with&#xD;
      water) before leaving the hospital (or going back to work/home in the case of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample: A peripheral venous blood sample of 20 ml will be collected from each&#xD;
      participant the day after administration of pimonidazole, since it takes several hours for&#xD;
      the drug to be absorbed and to bind to proteins and other molecules in oxygen-starved cells.&#xD;
      A second sample will be collected 14 ±5 days later in order to confirm that all coloured cell&#xD;
      fragments have disappeared from the circulation.&#xD;
