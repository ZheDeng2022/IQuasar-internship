  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people have allergic reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about these reactions to provide guidance on who can safely receive the vaccines, including a&#xD;
      second dose in people who had a reaction to the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety of giving a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose to people who had a&#xD;
      systemic allergic reaction to their first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18-69 who had a systemic allergic reaction to their first dose of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have underlying health issues may need to come to the NIH for screening tests&#xD;
      to make sure they are safe to receive the vaccine . People who are eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the study will be admitted to the NIH hospital and stay for at least 4 days. They will give a&#xD;
      urine sample. They will have a nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 test. They will have an intravenous line&#xD;
      placed in each arm. They will get the study vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) and&#xD;
      one dose of placebo on different days. They will have breathing tests. They may have clinical&#xD;
      photography if they develop a rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 follow-up visits . They will have allergy skin testing at one visit.&#xD;
      Drops of different allergens or controls will be placed on their back or arm. The skin under&#xD;
      each drop will be scratched with a tool. If the results are negative, a small amount of&#xD;
      allergen will be injected just below the surface of their skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 6 months .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Widespread vaccination will be essential to overcome the public health crisis created by&#xD;
      COVID-19. Although rare, the allergic reactions that have occurred because of COVID-19 mRNA&#xD;
      vaccinations have created substantial fear and anxiety in the general population where&#xD;
      allergic disease is common. This concern may translate to reduced willingness for patients&#xD;
      with a history of severe allergies to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and/or a hesitancy on the&#xD;
      part of physicians to administer the vaccine to these patients out of concern that the&#xD;
      vaccine will trigger an allergic reaction. Furthermore, the high rate of suspected allergic&#xD;
      reactions following the initial doses of these vaccines may prevent a substantial fraction of&#xD;
      the population from receiving a second dose, which may be necessary for the vaccine to be&#xD;
      fully effective. Currently, the safety of administering a second dose of these vaccines to&#xD;
      patients who experienced an allergic reaction to the first dose is unknown. For these&#xD;
      reasons, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for allergic reactions to the&#xD;
      mRNA COVID vaccines is critically needed in order to reassure the public and to provide&#xD;
      evidence-based guidance on who can safely receive these vaccines, including a second dose in&#xD;
      those individuals who experienced a reaction to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of individuals 18-69 years of age who experienced a&#xD;
      systemic allergic reaction after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty)&#xD;
      or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Eligible individuals will be enrolled and receive a dose of the&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as well as placebo in a blinded, randomized order on consecutive&#xD;
      days. To maximize safety, all participants will be admitted to a 4-day inpatient stay in the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit at the NIH Clinical Center where experienced staff and all equipment and&#xD;
      medications necessary to treat severe allergic reactions are readily available. Two IV lines&#xD;
      will be inserted prior to study vaccination to allow for frequent blood draws and rapid&#xD;
      administration of fluids/medications if needed in the event of a reaction. There will be a&#xD;
      remote follow-up one week after discharge. Participants will return to the NIH approximately&#xD;
      9 weeks and then 6 months after discharge to provide additional research samples. At the&#xD;
      9-week visit, participants will undergo allergy skin testing to investigate the potential&#xD;
      role of IgE in triggering allergic reactions to the vaccine.&#xD;
