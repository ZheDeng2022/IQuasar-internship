  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MIC-DroP trial will test the hypothesis that preventing early life blood-stage malaria&#xD;
      antigenic exposure with intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) enhances protective immunity to&#xD;
      malaria. This study will take advantage of a unique opportunity to study infants born to&#xD;
      mothers followed in a NIH-funded randomized controlled trial of novel intermittent preventive&#xD;
      therapy in pregnancy (IPTp) regimens (NCT04336189). MIC-DroP will leverage the parent IPTp&#xD;
      study to enroll 924 children who will be randomized at 8 weeks of age to receive no&#xD;
      intermittent preventive therapy in childhood (IPTc), monthly DP from 8 weeks to 1 year of&#xD;
      age, or monthly DP from 8 weeks to 2 years of age, and then follow children to 4 years of&#xD;
      age. The primary outcome of this study will be to compare the incidence of malaria from 2 to&#xD;
      4 years of age among children randomized to receive no IPTc, monthly DP for the first year of&#xD;
      life, or monthly DP for the first two years of life. Investigators will also leverage this&#xD;
      trial to evaluate immune development during early childhood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 924 HIV- uninfected&#xD;
      children. Children born to mothers enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of different IPTp&#xD;
      arms in pregnancy (NCT 04336189) will be enrolled in this study. In the parent IPTp study,&#xD;
      2757 HIV-uninfected pregnant women will be randomized to receive IPTp with monthly&#xD;
      sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) alone, monthly DP alone, or both monthly SP+DP, and followed&#xD;
      through 4 weeks postpartum. At the 4-week postpartum visit, we will enroll and randomize 924&#xD;
      eligible children to one of three IPTc arms: no IPTc (the current standard of care), monthly&#xD;
      DP from 8 weeks to 1 year of age, or monthly DP from 8 weeks to 2 years of age. Study drugs&#xD;
      will be placebo controlled and all doses of study drug will be given by directly observed&#xD;
      therapy (DOT). The intervention phase will be completed at 2 years of age, and children&#xD;
      followed through 4 years of age. Study participants will be followed for all of their&#xD;
      outpatient medical care in our dedicated study clinic. Malaria incidence will be measured via&#xD;
      active case detection. Routine assessments will be performed in the study clinic for all&#xD;
      study participants every 4 weeks, including passive surveillance for parasitemia by&#xD;
      quantitive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Venous blood will be collected for immunologic&#xD;
      assays three times annually from 8 weeks to 4 years of age. All maternal assessments&#xD;
      conducted during the parent IPTp study, including assessment for maternal malaria exposure&#xD;
      (e.g., placental histology) household survey, will be available and linked to each study&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
