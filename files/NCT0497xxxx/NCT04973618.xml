    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase IB study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APVO436 in&#xD;
      naïve elderly unfit patients with newly diagnosed primary AML at the RP2D level when it is&#xD;
      used as an adjunct to the standard of care and obtain a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      anti-leukemia activity of an APVO436-containing combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary Objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of APVO436 at the RP2D level when&#xD;
      it is used as an adjunct to the standard of care (venetoclax and azacitidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of APVO436-containing&#xD;
           experimental triple drug combination therapy modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine pharmacodynamics (PD) of APVO436, including changes in CD123 antigen density&#xD;
           and measures of T cell number and function over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine correlations between response and MRD level and cytogenetic and molecular&#xD;
           genetic profiles.&#xD;

      The goal of this Phase IB study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APVO436 at the&#xD;
      RP2D level when it is used as an adjunct to the standard of care and obtain a preliminary&#xD;
      assessment of the anti-leukemia activity of an APVO436-containing combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTD for APVO436 was not reached at a dose level of 240 µg/cycle in the ongoing Phase 1&#xD;
      FIHT (Cohort 10 in the dose escalation phase; weekly dose 60 mcg). 46 patients have received&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of APVO436 across multiple dose-escalation cohorts, with dosing&#xD;
      escalated from 0.3 micrograms to 60 micrograms. Long half-life of APVO436 enabled its&#xD;
      administration over short infusion times. APVO436 exhibited a manageable safety profile,&#xD;
      encouraging single agent activity and a promising benefit to risk profile in relapsed&#xD;
      advanced stage AML. Of 7 evaluable relapsed AML patients treated in Cohort 6, 5 showed&#xD;
      stabilization of their leukemia. Of the 5 AML patients with disease stabilization, 3 lived&#xD;
      246+ days, 261+ days, and 281+ days, respectively and 2 progressed after a month. Two of the&#xD;
      patients who experienced a stabilization of their relapsed leukemia achieved first a partial&#xD;
      remission (PR) and subsequently a complete remission (CR). No partial or complete remissions&#xD;
      were observed at APVO436 dose levels lower or higher than the Cohort 6 dose level. The&#xD;
      sub-MTD dose level of Cohort 6 was identified as the RP2D level of APVO436 for further&#xD;
      evaluation in this study. Therefore, APVO436 will be used at the Cohort 6 dose level from&#xD;
      Study 5001 in this study. CRS has occurred in some patients and has been managed using the&#xD;
      generally recommended standard CRS treatments&quot;. In Cohort 6, among 9 AML/MDS patients&#xD;
      evaluable for toxicity, 2 patients developed a Grade 1 CRS and one patient developed a&#xD;
      transient Grade 3 CRS related to APVO436 which resolved with routine clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 eligible patients will be enrolled in the current study. APVO436 will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously over 4 hours weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle at a&#xD;
      fixed dosage of 18 mcg after a weekly ramp up during Cycle 1 (Step-up dosing: C1D15: 6 mcg&#xD;
      over 22 hours, C1D22: 12 mcg over 8 hours, C2D1: 18 mcg over 6 hours, C2D8: 18 mcg over 4&#xD;
      hours). The infusion time may be increased to 22 hours if deemed appropriate and/or necessary&#xD;
      by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 4 x 28-day cycles of combined 3-drug immunochemotherapy: APVA&#xD;
      [APVO436+Venetoclax+Azacitidine]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional continued triple therapy for 4 additional cycles (up to 8 total cycles) will be&#xD;
      available for patients with an objective working group response or prolonged stable&#xD;
      disease/clinical benefit. Patients completing 8 cycles of triple therapy on protocol will&#xD;
      then move to follow-up and continue SOC therapy per their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax will be administered orally daily on days 1-21 of each cycle at a fixed dosage of&#xD;
      400 mg/daily after a daily ramp up (Day 1: 100 mg; Day 2: 200 mg; Day 3-Day 21: 400 mg).&#xD;
      Standard dose adjustments will be made for patients on azole antifungals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azacitidine will be administered intravenously over 30 min daily on days 1-7 of each cycle at&#xD;
      a dosage of 75 mg/m2&#xD;
