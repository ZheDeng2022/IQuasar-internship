      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel combination of&#xD;
      biomarkers, pH/HNE/MPO, in detecting wound infection using the clinical judgement at 4 weeks&#xD;
      as a standard of reference which will include a wound biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the biggest challenges in wound care today is the accurate and timely diagnosis of&#xD;
      infection in complex wounds. Despite efforts, it still remains difficult to determine whether&#xD;
      complex wounds are infected or not. There is no single gold standard for wound infection:&#xD;
      clinicians use a multitude of methods in addition to the history and their examination to&#xD;
      reach an overall conclusion as to potential wound infection status - each with its own&#xD;
      strengths and weaknesses (associated performance characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To aid accurate and timely detection of wound infection in clinical practice, ConvaTec and&#xD;
      partners have developed a new technology intended to detect infection biomarkers. This is&#xD;
      based on the combined measurement of the following three biomarkers: wound pH, and activity&#xD;
      of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) host enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this proof of concept study is to demonstrate that the three infection&#xD;
      biomarkers (HNE/MPO/pH) surpass clinical judgement in detecting infection status using a&#xD;
      standard of reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proof of concept study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      novel combination of biomarkers, pH/HNE/MPO, in detecting wound infection using the clinical&#xD;
      judgement at 4 weeks as a standard of reference which will include a wound biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the proof of concept study is to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      molecular microbiological analysis of swab samples and wound biopsies with the biomarkers pH,&#xD;
      HNE and MPO.&#xD;
