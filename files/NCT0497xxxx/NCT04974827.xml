  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-arm study, patient with cervical cancer who had recurrence of the pelvic wall&#xD;
      after surgery ± Abdominal aortic lymph node metastasis will be included to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with concurrent chemoradiation and subsequent&#xD;
      maintenance therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient received neoadjuvant therapy once every three weeks for a total of seventeen&#xD;
      cycles. From the first day of treatment, the patient will undergo concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
      for 5 weeks.The chemotherapy drug is cisplatin or carboplatin every week for 5 weeks. After&#xD;
      the end of concurrent chemoradiation, the patient will continue to use camrelizumab as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy until one year.&#xD;
