  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition of the central nervous system;&#xD;
      around 1 in 600 people in the United Kingdom have MS. Many people with MS (70%) have&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties, which they experience as distressing and disabling, and there is&#xD;
      currently a lack of treatment options to improve these difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMART (Strengthening Mental Abilities with Relational Training) - a theory-based online&#xD;
      cognitive training programme, which has been shown to improve general cognitive abilities -&#xD;
      has not been tested with people who have MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To conduct a feasibility study to inform development of a definitive trial of SMART for&#xD;
      improving cognitive functioning in people with MS. The investigators will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability to participants of the intervention, delivery format, inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, baseline and outcome measures, randomisation protocol, and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The framework for a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a definitive trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant recruitment and retention rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample-size needed for fully powered trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Signal of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan: To address Aims 1-5, the investigators will recruit 60 adults with MS who are&#xD;
      experiencing cognitive difficulties, identified from MS clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete baseline assessments of their cognitive abilities and answer&#xD;
      questionnaires about their cognitive difficulties, personal priorities, mood, fatigue,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life, and healthcare services used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be administered by a researcher, face-to-face or remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three arms (20 per group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Receives SMART intervention online - plus usual care (MS Nurse support). SMART&#xD;
      intervention involves completing a series of logic problems, which are designed to train&#xD;
      skills that scaffold complex cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Receives usual care alone. Group 3: Receives a 'control' intervention online - plus&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures will be re-administered at three- and six-months post-randomisation.&#xD;
      Researchers and patient-partners (people with personal experience of MS, who will act as&#xD;
      co-researchers) will also interview 30 participants about their experience of the study and&#xD;
      treatment. All qualitative data will be transcribed and thematically analysed in terms of a&#xD;
      priori feasibility aims. Quantitative data will enable sample-size calculation for a&#xD;
      definitive study and determine signal of efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive deficits have been identified as the most debilitating impact of MS. These deficits&#xD;
      interfere with daily living, manifesting as inattention (e.g., getting easily distracted),&#xD;
      forgetting (e.g., leaving the stove on after cooking), and problem-solving difficulties&#xD;
      (e.g., getting confused when completing a multi-stage task like cooking). The burden of these&#xD;
      deficits reduces quality of life and restricts daily activities and employment - and&#xD;
      correspondingly, diminishes patient perceptions of personal competence and self-worth.&#xD;
      Cognitive rehabilitation is not routinely offered in the National Health Service (NHS) - and,&#xD;
      when it is offered, largely focuses on teaching people to compensate for deficits (e.g.,&#xD;
      using external memory aids) rather than retraining cognitive skills. A recent&#xD;
      state-of-the-field review from international MS experts has called for research towards&#xD;
      identifying effective, evidence-based, and clinically feasible interventions to address&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in MS. There is evident uncertainty about how to intervene effectively,&#xD;
      and this is recognised by the James Lind Alliance as a top-10 priority area for&#xD;
      research-funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our trial tests the feasibility of a highly accessible and low-resource format of cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation (online training). Given NHS resource constraints, the scale of the problem,&#xD;
      and concerns about face-to-face consultation in the context of COVID-19, new and&#xD;
      cost-effective ways of implementing promising cognitive rehabilitation interventions are&#xD;
      needed. Low-resource online formats are more likely to be implemented if found to be&#xD;
      clinically effective, enable wider access for patients, and provide active support for&#xD;
      self-management - consistent with (1) models of care for managing longer-term conditions and&#xD;
      (2) the digital healthcare agenda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a feasibility trial, outcomes are unlikely to immediately effect changes to NHS practice.&#xD;
      However, this is a necessary step towards developing a definitive trial - and will give us a&#xD;
      signal of efficacy, a prerequisite for progression to a definitive trial. If found to be&#xD;
      clinically- and cost-effective, the latter trial could create a step-change in MS cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation - improving service-delivery and optimising support with limited additional&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a feasibility study to inform development of a definitive trial of SMART (an&#xD;
      online 'brain training' treatment) for improving cognitive functioning in people with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acceptability to participants of the intervention, delivery format, inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, baseline and outcome measures, randomisation protocol, and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The framework for a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a definitive trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant recruitment and retention rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample-size needed for fully powered trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Signal of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a three-arm feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      comparing (1) SMART + treatment-as-usual (TAU) with (2) TAU and (3) active control ('sham')&#xD;
      training + TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting eligible patients will complete a baseline cognitive assessment battery and&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing impact of living with MS, health-related quality of life, subjective&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties, and service/resource-use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing baseline assessments, participants will be randomly allocated to one of&#xD;
      three arms (using minimisation to balance participant characteristics across arms):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SMART + TAU&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TAU. Content of TAU for cognitive concerns, based on our clinical experience and&#xD;
           knowledge, is often informational support from an MS Nurse with signposting to the MS&#xD;
           Society/MS Trust websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sham training (active control: Sudoku) + TAU. The investigators selected Sudoku to&#xD;
           control for expectancy effects based on popular conceptions that it broadly improves&#xD;
           cognitive functions, coupled with little evidence supporting this notion, and its use as&#xD;
           an active control in similar trials. Sham-training will be delivered online, over the&#xD;
           same timeframe/regimen as SMART treatment, and with telephone support to facilitate&#xD;
           access - controlling for modality, schedule of engagement, and relational support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Research Fellow will complete blinded outcomes at 3- and 6-months post-randomisation, by&#xD;
      re-administering baseline measures. Quantitative data will enable sample-size calculation for&#xD;
      a definitive study and determine signal of efficacy. After the first follow-up assessment (&gt;3&#xD;
      months post-randomisation) a sub-sample of participants will engage in feasibility-feedback&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
