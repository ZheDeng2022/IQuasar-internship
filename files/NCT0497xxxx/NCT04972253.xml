  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to see whether using a drug that blocks a protein called FGFR&#xD;
      (fibroblast growth factor receptor) prior to surgery is safe and effective in patients with&#xD;
      bladder cancer that have mutations in FGFR3 or FGFR2 and who cannot receive chemotherapy with&#xD;
      cisplatin prior to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Infigratinib&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center (DF/HCC) prospective feasibility study to assess biomarker-directed&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy in patients with cT2-T4aN0 MIBC who are candidates for radical cystectomy&#xD;
      (RC) and ineligible for, or refuse, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves using a drug that inhibits FGFR in patients with bladder cancer&#xD;
      (that have mutations in FGFR) prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Infigratinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include pre-screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits. This pre-screening is already done as clinical&#xD;
      care. Study participants will receive study treatment for 2 months prior to surgery and will&#xD;
      be followed for at least 1 year after undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 12 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug (infigratinib) and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug&#xD;
      to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is also a Feasibility Study, which is the first time investigators are&#xD;
      examining this drug in patients with bladder cancer that has not spread to other organs. The&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved infigratinib as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
