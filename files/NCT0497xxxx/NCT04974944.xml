  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the world and is a leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death among women in developing countries. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy +/-&#xD;
      bevacizumab have been recommended as the first-line treatment for patients who present with&#xD;
      metastatic (e.g. stage IVB), persistent, or recurrent cervical cancer. However, patients in&#xD;
      this setting are rarely curable. The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, including&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of several cancers. The&#xD;
      investigator previously reported the promising antitumor efficacy of camrelizumab (PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor) combined with apatinib (VEGFR2 inhibitor) as second-line, or later, therapy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cervical cancer. This randomized study is to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of first-line treatment with camrelizumab plus apatinib compared to the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of paclitaxel and cisplatin/carboplatin plus bevacizumab in patients with stage IVB,&#xD;
      recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer.&#xD;

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a 27-item self-report quality of life (QOL) measure that includes 4 subscales (physical well-being, social well-being, functional well-being and emotional well-being). The Trial Outcome of Index of FACT-Cx (FACT-Cx TOI) consists of two subscales from the FACT-G: Physical Well Being (7 items) and Functional Well Being (7 items), plus the Cervix Cancer-specific subscale (15 items). The total score is ranged 0-116 for FACT-Cx TOI. A higher score indicates better HRQL.</description>
