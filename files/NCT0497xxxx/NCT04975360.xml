  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep inertia (sometimes also referred to as sleep drunkenness) is a disabling state of&#xD;
      increased sleepiness, impaired mood and reduced vigilance immediately upon awakening. Sleep&#xD;
      inertia is highly prevalent in various neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative,&#xD;
      affective and circadian sleep-wake rhythms disorders, as well as in frequent societal&#xD;
      conditions such as chronic sleep restriction, jetlag and shiftwork. Reactive countermeasures&#xD;
      against sleep inertia, i.e., strategies implemented upon wake-up, are not sufficiently&#xD;
      effective, yet current recommendations are limited to proactive strategies, including long&#xD;
      enough sleep at optimal times of day. These recommendations are not always easy and sometimes&#xD;
      impossible to apply. To address this unmet medical need, the investigators developed an&#xD;
      innovative, time-controlled, pulsatile-release formulation of 160 mg caffeine targeting an&#xD;
      efficacious dose briefly before planned awakening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep inertia is a disabling state of grogginess and impaired vigilance immediately upon&#xD;
      awakening. The adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, is widely used to reduce sleep&#xD;
      inertia symptoms, yet the initial, most severe impairments are hardly alleviated by&#xD;
      post-awakening caffeine intake. To ameliorate this disabling state more potently, the&#xD;
      investigators developed an innovative, delayed, pulsatile-release caffeine formulation&#xD;
      targeting an efficacious dose briefly before planned awakening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators comprehensively test this formulation in two placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, cross-over studies. First, the investigators establish the in vivo caffeine&#xD;
      release profile in young men. Subsequently, they investigate the formulation's ability to&#xD;
      improve sleep inertia in sleep-restricted volunteers. Following oral administration of 160 mg&#xD;
      caffeine at habitual bedtime [22:30], the investigators keep the participants awake until&#xD;
      03:00, to increase sleep inertia symptoms upon scheduled awakening [at 07:00]. Immediately&#xD;
      upon awakening, the investigators quantify subjective state, psychomotor vigilance, cognitive&#xD;
      performance, and the cortisol awakening response. They also record polysomnography during&#xD;
      nocturnal sleep and a 1-hour nap opportunity at 08:00.&#xD;

    <description>The 160 mg caffeine pulsatile-release formulation was manufactured using a drug layering process. Caffeine and the excipients are dispersed in the coating media and then sprayed onto inert microcrystalline cellulose spheres using a fluid bed through a Wurster tube with continuous inlet air that dries the liquid in the dispersion, to obtain various layers consisting of caffeine and release-controlling polymers. The applied release-controlling polymeric system is based on methacrylate copolymers, which control the release of caffeine in pH-dependent and pH-independent manner. The release mechanism of the polymeric system is mainly driven by the swellability and permeability of the copolymers. The final micropellets are then encapsulated into hydroxypropylmethylcellulose capsules.</description>
