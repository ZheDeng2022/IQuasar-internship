      Rotator cuff injury is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction. The common symptoms&#xD;
      of rotator cuff injury include shoulder pain, weakness, and limited mobility. Arthroscopic&#xD;
      exploration is the gold standard for the diagnosis of rotator cuff injury, but it is an&#xD;
      invasive examination that is difficult to carry out routinely; MRI is sensitive in diagnosing&#xD;
      rotator cuff tears Both sex and specificity are high, but due to the popularity, cost and&#xD;
      waiting time, it is difficult to be used as a routine screening method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, finding patients with suspected rotator cuff injuries through physical examination&#xD;
      of the shoulder joints, MRI further assisting in the diagnosis, and final surgical diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment are the current standardized procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although there are many physical examination methods for the shoulder joint, the&#xD;
      accuracy of each method is different, and each has its own sensitivity and specificity. How&#xD;
      to apply multiple examination programs in combination to make it sensitive, efficient and&#xD;
      accurate Judgment is a problem that needs to be solved clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to adopt prospective research methods to collect and collect patient&#xD;
      medical records, preoperative physical examination results, imaging data, and findings during&#xD;
      intraoperative exploration, to understand the impact of various shoulder joint physical&#xD;
      examination methods and imaging data on rotator cuff injuries&#xD;
