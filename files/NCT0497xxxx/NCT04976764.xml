      Liver transplantation is an effective treatment for end-stage liver disease. Cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications are the common causes of death in liver transplant recipients. The presence of&#xD;
      cirrhosis cardiomyopathy has a potential impact on the prognosis of liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Therefore, it is important to identify the high risk factors with cirrhotic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy before transplantation, so as to intervene earlier and improve the prognosis&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;

        In this study, the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis who received liver&#xD;
        transplantation from January 1, 2012 to June 1, 2021 in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao&#xD;
        University were reviewed through the Yidu cloud platform. According to the 2019 cirrhosis&#xD;
        cardiomyopathy (CCM) diagnostic criteria, they were divided into two groups according to&#xD;
        the presence or absence of cardiomyopathy.The incidence of CCM , the predictive factors of&#xD;
        perioperative and postoperative cardiovascular complications were followed up. At the same&#xD;
        time,we analysed the influence of CCM on the survival rate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnostic criteria for decompensated liver cirrhosis: according to the guidelines for&#xD;
             diagnosis and treatment of liver cirrhosis in 2019;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnostic criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: in accordance with the revised&#xD;
             criteria of CCM of international multidisciplinary Alliance for cirrhotic&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy in 2019, the preoperative echocardiographic images of all patients were&#xD;
             reviewed, and the systolic and diastolic dysfunction of all patients were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. the compensatory liver cirrhosis, primary liver cancer without liver cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Multiple organ transplantation or multiple organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The preoperative echocardiographic data were not fully recorded, so that the exact&#xD;
