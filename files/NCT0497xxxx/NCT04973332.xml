  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, 1:1, controlled trial with blinded outcome&#xD;
      assessment assessing non-inferiority of SINOMED SR compared to Solitaire FR. The trial aims&#xD;
      to randomize 220 patients 1:1 to receive SINOMED SR or Solitaire FR.The primary outcome is&#xD;
