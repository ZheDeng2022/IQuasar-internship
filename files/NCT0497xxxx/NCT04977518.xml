      This was a retrospective observational study of consecutive cases of definite or possible&#xD;

      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare but life-threatening serious disease that still has a&#xD;
      high mortality, even in developed countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical presentations, treatment and outcomes of IE patients in a tertiary hospital in East&#xD;
      China over an 8-year period. This was a retrospective observational study of consecutive&#xD;
      cases of definite or possible IE as per the modified Duke criteria between January 2008 and&#xD;
      December 2015.&#xD;
