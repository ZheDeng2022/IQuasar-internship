  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feedback delivered during motor practice can help promote motor skill learning, enhance&#xD;
      confidence, and alter brain connectivity. However, the optimal way to provide feedback to&#xD;
      promote learning, confidence and brain connectivity is unknown. This project will study how&#xD;
      the feedback that is provided during practice of a movement skill can help people learn and&#xD;
      build confidence and whether these correspond to changes in brain function. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure motor skill performance, confidence, and resting state brain connectivity before&#xD;
      and after a session of motor practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positive social comparative feedback, which indicate to the learner that they are performing&#xD;
      above average, is one way to enhance a learner's expectancies about future performance.&#xD;
      Expectancies include the learners' perceived competence about their ability to perform the&#xD;
      task, expectations about task outcome (success or failure), and predictions of extrinsic&#xD;
      reward or positive experiences related to performance. Positive feedback during motor&#xD;
      practice enhances expectancies, which is hypothesized to be rewarding to the learner, leading&#xD;
      to better skill performance and learning. Reward is a powerful shaper of behavior. However,&#xD;
      while social comparative feedback supports motor skill learning, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      positive social comparative feedback induces a response in the dopamine reward network.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of social comparative&#xD;
      feedback during motor practice on the functional connectivity of the reward neural network.&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 40 participants who will be randomized into 1 of 2 feedback groups&#xD;
      (performance feedback or performance plus positive feedback). Participants will practice a&#xD;
      motor sequence task on a single day and then return for retention performance testing about&#xD;
      24 hours later. Measures of brain function and brain structure will be collected before and&#xD;
      after practice on day 1. Changes in performance (response time to complete a sequence) and&#xD;
      self-efficacy will be measured from baseline to 24 hours later at retention. Changes in brain&#xD;
      functional connectivity over practice on day 1 will be assessed in the reward network and the&#xD;
      motor network.&#xD;
