      Develop a game-based upper-extremity motor and cognitive rehabilitation system using custom&#xD;
      and adaptable virtual reality simulations on a wearable device enhanced with biosensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are stage II and stage III breast cancer survivors with lasting cognitive&#xD;
      impairments following their first round of chemotherapy. They will be randomized 1:1 into an&#xD;
      experimental group and a sham control group. Each group will train in the home for 8 weeks,&#xD;
      during which they will perform up to 4 rehabilitation sessions/week (based on tolerance).&#xD;
      Each session will start with vitals being measured and logged. Each group will have three&#xD;
      clinical evaluations: 1) at baseline; 2) at 8 weeks post-baseline; and 3) at 16 weeks from&#xD;
      baseline for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group sessions will consist of increasingly more difficult cognitive training&#xD;
      tasks in the form of simulated tasks. Biosensors will be sampled while participants interact&#xD;
      with these games while wearing the computer system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham control group will have the same number, suration and frequency of sessions, however&#xD;
      they will play web games while wearing some the same biosensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers of all subjects will receive a laptop to be used in filling subjective evaluation&#xD;
      forms and sending messages to research team. Training will be in the home, so caregivers will&#xD;
      need to support the trials by ensuring compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo standardized clinical evaluations at baseline, at 8 weeks and at 16&#xD;
      weeks from baseline. The subjects in the experimental group will have computerized measures&#xD;
      taken during each session, and will fill subjective evaluation forms every 4 weeks of active&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This portion of the study is intended to provide information pertaining to the feasibility of&#xD;
      the experimental system for remote integrative (cognitive and motor) therapy of breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors (Stage II or III) with lasting cognitive impairments subsequent to their first&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen, and living in the community with a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim primarily at determining any clinical benefits in improved cognition (primarily in the&#xD;
      executive functions domain), but also increased independence in ADLs, and improved mood&#xD;
      (reduced depression). Another outcome is the degree of technology acceptance by the targeted&#xD;
      population. Training will be done in the home, thus co-dwelling caregivers will also be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. testing of a wearable device modified with added biosensors, by breast cancer survivors&#xD;
           with CRCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. new technology acceptance and ease of use at home by these individuals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. clinical benefit to improved cognition (primarily executive functions and cognitive&#xD;
           endurance) when experimental therapy is added to daily routine vs. daily routine plus&#xD;
           web-based cognitive games;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. a therapist console module and enhanced automatic session report that will allow remote&#xD;
           monitoring of patient exercising and offline data processing and review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized equally in an experimental group, or a sham control group.&#xD;
      Experimental subjects will receive computer-based therapy, of increasing duration and&#xD;
      intensity for up to 4 sessions/week for 8 weeks. The length of sessions will increase from 15&#xD;
      minutes in week 1 to 40 minutes of actual play in week 8. The longer sessions will also train&#xD;
      cognitive endurance, or the ability for sustained cognitive effort. All experimental subjects&#xD;
      will have their exercise duration and intensity data logged into the database and&#xD;
      investigators will monitor them remotely. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) software layer in&#xD;
      the system will progress game difficulty based on success in the games as well as on degree&#xD;
      of cognitive engagement, as estimated by the biosensors. Higher cognitive difficulty will be&#xD;
      indicative of improved cognition, thus progress in mitigating cognitive impairments&#xD;
      subsequent to chemotherapy. Additionally, the duration of training will also be logged, as&#xD;
      will be the frequency of training. Longer sessions will be indicative of ability to sustain&#xD;
      cognitive engagement longer. Additional input will be obtained from caregivers in the form of&#xD;
      periodic questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue will be self-reported during weekly follow up calls by a Clinical Coordinator.&#xD;
      Participants will train while seated, and (if needed) their arms can be supported on a table.&#xD;
      Rest periods may be introduced as needed, to further mitigate fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every other week participants and their caregivers in the experimental group&#xD;
      will fill a subjective evaluation questionnaire aimed at gauging perceived benefits and&#xD;
      possible technical difficulties when using the BrightGo system. Questions will be scored on a&#xD;
      5-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group will perform an equal amount of web-based game play of assigned&#xD;
      cognitive-oriented games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo screening for cognitive impairments (to confirm Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment at baseline). Then they will continue with their daily routine during their 8-week&#xD;
      training, and will undergo a second clinical evaluation at the end of these 8 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will then undergo a third (follow up) evaluation at 8 weeks post-end of&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will support the training by helping ensure compliance to protocol, and will&#xD;
      complete subjective evaluation forms to rate the perceive benefit of training for the person&#xD;
      they care for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a weekly call from the Clinical Coordinator so to report on any&#xD;
      health concerns and system issues.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Generally in good overall health; 21&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to converse in English;&#xD;

             or at least present during home sessions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to report on standard of care (e. g. any other treatments during the study) on&#xD;

          -  Willing to report on experimental system issues and to fill periodic evaluation&#xD;
             questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CAREGIVERS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CRCI POST CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac, orthopedic, neurologic, psychiatric symptoms limiting participation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aggressive behaviors (observation);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Domestic disputes or unstable home environment limiting home based training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Reasons for exclusion based on these impairments relate to the nature of the virtual&#xD;
        rehabilitation training, where participants need to be able to perceive the graphics scene&#xD;
        on a head-mounted display, be able to hold game controllers in both hands and interact with&#xD;
        therapeutic games, hear the simulation sounds, be aware of their surroundings and be able&#xD;
        to sustain rapid arm/fingers movement. While the proposed system is considered safe,&#xD;
        malignancies in the upper body, cardiac, orthopedic or neurologic issues can pose bodily&#xD;
        risks due to intense activity, risks which we want to minimize. Pregnancy is an exclusion&#xD;
        since pregnant women are more prone to simulation sickness. The evaluation instruments are&#xD;
        in English, thus subjects who do not speak the language will not comprehend the evaluation&#xD;
        questions or instructions, which will bias responses.&#xD;
