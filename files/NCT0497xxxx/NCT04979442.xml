  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 registration study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of milademetan compared to trabectedin in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      (i.e., where resection is deemed to cause unacceptable morbidity or mortality) or metastatic&#xD;
      DD liposarcoma that progressed on 1 or more prior systemic therapies, including at least 1&#xD;
      anthracycline-based therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 160 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive milademetan or&#xD;
      trabectedin. Randomization will be stratified by the ECOG performance status (0 or 1) and&#xD;
      number of prior treatments (≤ 2 or &gt; 2) for the patient's liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive study drug (i.e., milademetan or trabectedin) until reaching&#xD;
      unequivocal disease progression (RECIST v.1.1) as determined by the Investigator,&#xD;
      experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are&#xD;
      met. Patients may be treated beyond tumor progression if they are experiencing clinical&#xD;
      benefit based on the assessment of the Investigator in discussion with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for documentation of disease progression and survival&#xD;
      information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent treatment information (i.e.,&#xD;
      date/duration of treatment, response, and subsequent disease progression). Long-term&#xD;
      follow-up will continue every 12 weeks (± 7 days) until the endpoint of death, the patient is&#xD;
      lost to follow-up, or for 24 months following the final dose of study drug, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
