  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak first appeared in Wuhan, China's Hubei&#xD;
      Province in December 2019 and has quickly turned into a worldwide pandemic. As of 28 July&#xD;
      2020, 16,465,707 cases of COVID-19 have been reported. COVID-19 is a highly contagious&#xD;
      respiratory disease that causes respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe respiratory symptoms have been observed in COVID-19 patients. Fever (88.7%), cough&#xD;
      (57.6%) and shortness of breath (45.6%) were observed in an average of 81% of the patients.&#xD;
      However, patients with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, usually over 65 years&#xD;
      of age, may have very serious pulmonary sequelae of the infection. Due to lung fibrosis as a&#xD;
      result of pneumonia in COVID-19, some patients experience severe respiratory failure&#xD;
      requiring pulmonary rehabilitation. In the study of Complaints such as peripheral and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle weakness, shortness of breath on exertion, and decreased exercise capacity&#xD;
      may be seen in patients who have had COVID-19. In addition, while anxiety and depression&#xD;
      increase, quality of life may decrease. In a study conducted with geriatric patients who had&#xD;
      COVID-19 and were discharged; Peripheral and respiratory muscle strengthening exercises were&#xD;
      given to the patient after discharge, and as a result of the study, it was found that the&#xD;
      patient's walking distance and cough strength increased, while the complaints of shortness of&#xD;
      breath, anxiety and depression decreased significantly. As a result of this; We can say that&#xD;
      while shortness of breath, anxiety-depression and complications are reduced with the&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program in patients with pulmonary involvement who have had&#xD;
      COVID-19, participation in daily life activities and quality of life increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation is an emerging method that aims to provide rehabilitation to patients and&#xD;
      clinicians by reducing barriers such as distance, time and cost by using information and&#xD;
      communication technologies. Telerehabilitation enables patients who cannot access&#xD;
      rehabilitation due to geographic, economic or physical disabilities to benefit from&#xD;
      rehabilitation services. At the same time, the importance of social distance is emphasized&#xD;
      for the continuation of the pandemic process and protection from the highly contagious&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

      Outpatients with pulmonary involvement who have had COVID-19 was included in the study.&#xD;
      Patients who had COVID-19 and pulmonary problems was divided into two groups as randomized&#xD;
      controlled. Individuals in the first group was given respiratory exercises (diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breathing, thoracic expansion, exercises to increase chest compliance with respiratory&#xD;
      control with exercise band and leg strengthening exercises) and inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      with the Threshold IMT (T-IMT) device. The T-IMT (Threshold IMT, Respironics, USA) is a&#xD;
      device that provides the same pressure with each breath for the strength and endurance of the&#xD;
      inspiratory muscles, regardless of whether the patient is breathing rapidly or slowly. This&#xD;
      device provides a constant pressure during inspiration with its flow-independent one-way&#xD;
      valve. At the same time, the tool has an adjustable pressure mechanism. The instrument&#xD;
      consists of the pressure section, the mouthpiece and the nose clip. When the patient breathes&#xD;
      deeply, a constant pressure is applied to inspiration by the valve and the respiratory&#xD;
      muscles are strengthened. In the study, individuals was divided into two groups by&#xD;
      randomization method. In the first group, inspiratory muscle training was applied for 30&#xD;
      minutes, 3 times a day, 7 days a week for 6 weeks. In practice, individuals was asked to sit&#xD;
      in a relaxed upper chest and shoulders position. After the nose clip was in place, the&#xD;
      patient was taught to inhale and exhale by closing their lips tightly around the mouthpiece&#xD;
      of the instrument. After 8-10 breathing cycles, the patient was asked to continue this cycle&#xD;
      for 10 minutes at a time, by checking the breathing for 3-4 breaths. The presence of symptoms&#xD;
      such as dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath was also questioned during the training.&#xD;
      In the second group; only breathing exercises (diaphragmatic breathing, thoracic expansion,&#xD;
      exercises to increase chest compliance with respiratory control with exercise band, and leg&#xD;
      strengthening exercises) was given and a youtube video was sent to the patients so that they&#xD;
      could follow the exercises and they was interviewed regularly every week. In the second&#xD;
      group; breathing exercises (diaphragmatic breathing, thoracic expansion, exercises to&#xD;
      increase chest compliance with respiratory control with exercise band and leg strengthening&#xD;
      exercises) was taught and only the exercise link with these exercises was sent.&#xD;
