  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EUS-guided tissue acquisition is an established modality to diagnose malignancies of the&#xD;
      pancreas and extrahepatic bile ducts. In the recent years fine needle biopsy (FNB) needles&#xD;
      have largely replaced fine needle aspiration (FNA) for EUS-guided tissue acquisition. The&#xD;
      Acquire FNB needle is a Franseen needle which has three symmetric cutting edges to obtain&#xD;
      core tissue specimens. The Trident FNB needle has been recently introduced to the market for&#xD;
      EUS-guided tissue acquisition. It has a multi-blade three-prong tip which one of the tips is&#xD;
      longer than the other two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare these two types of needle in term of&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy, and safety profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with solid mass lesions in the pancreas or extrahepatic biliary system will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two types of FNB needle. Four passes of FNB will be acquired from&#xD;
      the mass lesion in each patient. The primary aim is to compare sensitivity of two types of&#xD;
      FNB needle to diagnose malignancy. Also, each pass of FNB needle will be assessed separately&#xD;
      by two expert pathologists to determine per-pass sensitivity of two types of FNB needles.&#xD;
