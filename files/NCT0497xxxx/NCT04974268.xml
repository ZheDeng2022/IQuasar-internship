      This study evaluates the reduction of lymphedema and its complications in obese women treated&#xD;
      with a muscle training and weight loss program as well as the improvement body composition,&#xD;
      muscle strength, quality of life and neurocognitive function, compared to a conventional&#xD;
      treatment control group.&#xD;

      Introduction: Breast cancer is the most frequent tumour in women. Breast cancer-related&#xD;
      lymphedema (BCRL) occurs in 10 to 36% of patients undergoing dissection and emptying of&#xD;
      axillary nodes and between 5 and 17% undergoing sentinel node biopsy. BCRL is associated with&#xD;
      discomfort, pain, risk of infections, disability, symptoms of depression and anxiety and&#xD;
      worse quality of life. The prevalence of persistent lymphedema increases with the presence of&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: In overweight or obese women with BCRL to assess whether a muscle training and weight&#xD;
      loss program reduces lymphedema volume and its associated complications, as well as improves&#xD;
      body composition, muscle strength, quality of life and neurocognitive function, compared to a&#xD;
      conventional treatment control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Open prospective randomized trial of 2 parallel arms. Subjects: patients&#xD;
      referred to the Rehabilitation Unit with lymphedema secondary to breast cancer and overweight&#xD;
      or obesity. The control group will receive the usual treatment and general dietary&#xD;
      recommendations and the intervention group will carry out a program of supervised exercise&#xD;
      (strength and aerobic) and weight loss (based on the Mediterranean diet and with a meal&#xD;
      replacement). The change in volume in the limb affected by lymphedema, segmental body&#xD;
      composition and phase angle (impedance measurement), muscular strength (hand dynamometry),&#xD;
      level of physical activity (IPAQ), dietary parameters, quality of life (FACB+4) will be&#xD;
      assessed. Cognitive function (Memory FSRCT test), psychological symptoms (anxiety and&#xD;
      depression by means of HADS) NS biochemical parameters (albumin, prealbumin, lipids, CRP,&#xD;
      25-OH vitamin D and insulin) will be analyzed.&#xD;
