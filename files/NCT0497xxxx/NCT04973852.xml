  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if it's possible to reach high cardiovascular intensity&#xD;
      training parameters (exercise at a rate that elevates heart rate to the level recommended for&#xD;
      improving strength and endurance) while walking in a wearable robotic exoskeleton. This study&#xD;
      will also evaluate if exercising at high intensity will lead to improvement in walking&#xD;
      ability. Participants in this study will be asked to attend 5 walking training sessions using&#xD;
      Ekso exoskeleton. There will be two additional sessions, one before and one after the five&#xD;
      training sessions. At these two sessions, study participants will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      seated balance, walking speed and endurance tests and breathing assessments.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy to implement&#xD;
      high cardiovascular intensity training parameters (70-80% heart rate reserve) with the use of&#xD;
      overground wearable robotic exoskeletons in an inpatient rehabilitation setting for locomotor&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to investigate the potential functional improvements in gait after&#xD;
      receiving high-intensity locomotor training with an overground exoskeleton, as measured on&#xD;
      the 10-meter walk test and six-minute walk test.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Heart Rate Reserve Achieved During HIT Gait Training Session while Wearing Exoskeleton</measure>
    <time_frame>During session 1 (about day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be monitored continuously and recorded every 5 minutes throughout the session (each session lasts about 60 minutes). Heart rate reserve (HRR) is maximum heart rate (HRmax) minus resting heart rate (HRrest). Target HR ranges will be calculated using age-predicted maximum heart rate (HRmax = 208 - {0.7 * age]) and Karvonen formula (target HRR (70%) = ([0.7 * (HRmax - HRrest)] + HRrest) and (target HRR (80%) = (0.8 * (HRmax - HRrest)] + HRrest). The percentage of HRR achieved during the exoskeleton session is calculated as the percentage of HR readings during the session that are within the 70-80% target HR zone.</description>
