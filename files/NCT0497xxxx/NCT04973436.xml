  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic lung cancer patients experience significantly greater psychological distress&#xD;
      (i.e., depression, anxiety) compared to other cancers. Psychological distress is as a&#xD;
      prognostic indicator for worse clinical outcomes and poorer overall survival in cancer&#xD;
      patients. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a trans-diagnostic, evidence-based&#xD;
      psychotherapy that teaches participants a core set of behavioral skills (distress tolerance,&#xD;
      emotion regulation, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness) to cope more effectively with&#xD;
      emotional and physical symptoms. The proposed study seeks to adapt and pilot test DBT skills&#xD;
      training for patients with metastatic lung cancer using the ADAPT-ITT framework. Participants&#xD;
      will be metastatic lung cancer patients who score &gt;=3 on the National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
      Network distress thermometer. Phase I aims to use focus groups and interviews with key&#xD;
      stakeholders (metastatic lung cancer patients (N=20), thoracic oncology providers (N=6),&#xD;
      clinicians with expertise in survivorship and behavioral symptom management (N=6)) to&#xD;
      determine if and how DBT skills training must be modified for implementation with metastatic&#xD;
      lung cancer patients. Adapted material will be reviewed by topical experts in DBT and&#xD;
      implementation science to produce a manualized, adapted DBT skills training protocol for&#xD;
      metastatic lung cancer patients (DBT-MLC). Phase II aims to pilot test DBT-MLC to assess&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and examine pre-to-post intervention outcomes of psychological&#xD;
      distress, (i.e., depression and anxiety) fatigue, dyspnea, pain, emotion regulation,&#xD;
      tolerance of uncertainty, and DBT coping skill use. DBT-MLC will consist of coping skills&#xD;
      training sessions delivered either in-person or via videoconferencing technology. Study&#xD;
      measures will be collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1-month&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
