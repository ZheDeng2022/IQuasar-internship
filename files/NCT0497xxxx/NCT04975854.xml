  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET)&#xD;
      as a treatment for specific phobia (acrophobia). The study will randomly assign 42&#xD;
      participants with acrophobia to one of two conditions: a) the experimental condition&#xD;
      (consisting of 3 sessions of virtual reality exposure) or b) a control condition. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive short information session about general principles of exposure therapy before&#xD;
      the start of the study. After the end of the study, the waitlist group will be invited to&#xD;
      attend the short version (one or two-sessions) of the VRET. Both groups will receive a final&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires 2 months after the last session.&#xD;

    <description>The vHISS is a 8-item scale assessing the severity of visual height intolerance with additional questions for diagnosing acrophobia. Raw score range from 0 to 13, where 0 = least severely affected and 13 = most severely affected.</description>

    <measure>Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-Treatment (Controlling for Baseline Score)</time_frame>
    <description>SMSP-A is a 10-item scale that assesses the severity of specific phobias in individuals aged 18 and older over the past 7 days. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale with item scores of 1-4 respectively indicating mild, moderate, severe and extreme severity of specific phobia related distress.</description>

    <time_frame>2-Weeks In-Treatment (Controlling for Baseline Score)</time_frame>
    <description>The IAPT phobia scale-avoidance is a single item from the outcome measures administered by the UK National Health Service's IAPT programme (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies). The patient is asked to rate his/her avoidance of heights in daily situations on a scale from 0 (would not avoid it) to 8 (always avoid it).</description>

    <measure>Six-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-Sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is used to measure self-reported symptoms of state anxiety with higher score indicating higher anxiety levels (prorated score range 20-80).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 months. During In-Sessions: week 1-3 (reported repeatedly during each session in response to presented exposure situations).</time_frame>
    <description>The SUDS is a visual analog scale in which the participant rates his/her anxiety/discomfort based on a range between 0 (no anxiety/discomfort) and 10 (very severe anxiety/discomfort). A SUDS rating will be collected at the end of each segment, reflecting maximum distress experienced during the interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Hierarchy</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-Treatment (Controlling for Baseline Score)</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked to develope a hierarchy of feared situations ranging from most-feared at the top to least-feared at the bottom. Then, he/she rates anticipated fear, anxiety or distress for each item (score 0-100 %, with higher score indicating higher anxiety) - according to how distressing they feel it would be to encounter that situation. The hierarchy is used to guide a process of VRET sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-First Session</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes 3 subscales SP (spatial presence), INV (involvement) and REAL (experienced realism) with score range 0-7. Higher scores indication higher sense of presence. This measure might be positivelly associated with positive outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post-First Session</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates cybersickness symptoms in three subscales: nausea (N), oculomotor disturbance (O), disorientation (D). Total simulator sickness raw score 0-48 (adjusted total score 0-180). Higher scores on each scale indicatestronger perceptions of the underlying sickness symptoms and aretherefore undesired. This measure might be negatively associated with positive outcome and sense of presence.</description>

    <description>Virtual reality scenarios consists of increasingly intense exposures to phobic stimuli (e.g., looking over railings from various floor levels) with the support of the therapist. The goal of VRET is sufficient reduction in anxiety to allow the patients to expose themselves to heights in everyday situations.</description>
