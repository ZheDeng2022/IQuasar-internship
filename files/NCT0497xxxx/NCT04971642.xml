  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Misaligned teeth are very common in the population and are commonly known as malocclusion.&#xD;
      This happens when the upper teeth do not align properly with the lower teeth. It can lead to&#xD;
      difficulty in jaw movement, chewing, speech, and gum disease. Correction of malocclusion&#xD;
      requires orthodontic (braces) treatment. Currently, the imaging technique known as cone-beam&#xD;
      computed tomography (CBCT) has been routinely used in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      planning for patients with malocclusion. Although CBCT provides better information than&#xD;
      conventional dental X-rays, it typically delivers more harmful radiation to the patients.&#xD;
      This is especially important as radiation from repeated X-ray imaging during dental&#xD;
      monitoring visits can be cumulative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is commonly used in medical imaging. The ultrasound method is non-invasive,&#xD;
      cost-effective, and free of ionizing radiation. The application of ultrasound has been&#xD;
      investigated in many fields in Dentistry. We plan to evaluate the ability of intra-oral&#xD;
      ultrasound to see the bone and gingiva around the tooth for patients under orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. If ultrasound is found to be a reliable tool in imaging the tooth-gum complex,&#xD;
      children and adolescents will benefit immensely from the decreased radiation risks and&#xD;
      reduced cancer rate.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a intraoral ultrasound to image the&#xD;
      tooth-periodontium complex that is an alternative to ionizing radiation CBCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging is a radiation-free alternative to image tooth-periodontium complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Straight teeth and a healthy smile is paramount to an individual's well-being. Malocclusion&#xD;
      (crowding of teeth) is the third most common dental anomaly according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization(WHO). The severity of malocclusion can cause difficulty in jaw movement,&#xD;
      chewing, speech, and high susceptibility to gum disease. Correction of malocclusion problems&#xD;
      requires comprehensive orthodontic treatment. CBCT imaging for orthodontic diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment planning has increased of late due to its inherent advantages over the traditional&#xD;
      2D planar cephalometric and panoramic radiography. These include the advantage of having 3D&#xD;
      capabilities to view images with no superimposition or magnification errors. This is&#xD;
      especially significant in detecting bony dehiscence and fenestration associated with&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment. The presence of these defects decreases bony support to the teeth,&#xD;
      which compounded with plaque-induced inflammation, can be detrimental to the health of the&#xD;
      teeth during orthodontic tooth movement. CBCT image typically delivers much higher radiation&#xD;
      than conventional dental radiographs. Orthodontic patients, mostly children, are increasingly&#xD;
      susceptible to deleterious effects of ionizing radiation due to the accumulated radiation&#xD;
      dose from repeated monitoring visits. Hence new imaging modalities such as ultrasound have&#xD;
      been researched as a radiation-free alternative to CBCT imaging. The ultrasound technique&#xD;
      uses echoes of mechanical waves and the acoustic properties of the target to produce an image&#xD;
      non-invasively. The characteristics of the returning echoes are mainly governed by the&#xD;
      elastic 'properties of the transmitting medium and the acoustic impedance contrast of the&#xD;
      interface between the target and the surrounding medium. For decades, medical ultrasound has&#xD;
      mainly been used to image soft tissues. Although the use of ultrasound in dentistry focused&#xD;
      more on imaging dental hard tissues, most recently, its use has been expanded to image&#xD;
      periodontal soft and hard structures. Although the interest in using ultrasound in dentistry&#xD;
      is increasing, research on the use of ultrasound to study tooth-periodontal tissues is&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of an intra-oral&#xD;
      ultrasound technique in a clinical setting by comparing the ultrasound measurements with&#xD;
      those of the clinical standard CBCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 orthodontic participants in the age group of 10-60 years old will be recruited for the&#xD;
      study for over a year. This population group is screened and recruited from the patients seen&#xD;
      at the Orthodontic Clinic in the Oral Health Clinic - Department of Dentistry based on the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each subject will have diagnostic records taken as part of&#xD;
      routine orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. These records include extraoral and&#xD;
      intraoral photos, digital models, and CBCT imaging. In addition to routine diagnostic&#xD;
      records, ultrasound scanning of the mandibular and maxillary incisor, canine, premolar, and&#xD;
      molar teeth for a total of sixteen (16) teeth (four (4)teeth in each of the four quadrants)&#xD;
      will be performed after obtaining informed consent from patients and their guardians.&#xD;
      Following diagnostic records, all subjects will undergo orthodontic treatment for correction&#xD;
      of their malocclusion by either a licensed orthodontic faculty member or an orthodontic&#xD;
      resident under the supervision of a licensed orthodontist at Kaye Edmonton Dental Clinic,&#xD;
      University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound scanner used is a handheld medical diagnostic system that has a Clarius&#xD;
      platform (ClariusMobile Health, Richmond, Canada, Device ID: 1012444 and DeviceIdentifier&#xD;
      99-02-00046&#xD;
&#xD;
      ) and a DenSonics DSI-1 intraoral 20 MHz array transducer (DenSonics Imaging Inc, Edmonton,&#xD;
      Canada) to be used off-label (Health Canada has not approved yet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ultrasound scans will be done by the same research assistant after training. This&#xD;
      research assistant has no involvement in the patient's care. The ultrasound imaging will be&#xD;
      performed on the maxillary and mandibular(again 16 teeth per patient will be imaged -&#xD;
      incisor/canine/premolar/molar in each of the four dental quadrants). The tooth-periodontium&#xD;
      complex will be imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probe will be isolated for infection control using a plastic wrap and will be positioned&#xD;
      intraorally with a gel pad separating the ultrasound transducer and the targeted&#xD;
      tooth-periodontium structures, with the long axis of the probe in alignment with the&#xD;
      longitudinal axis of the tooth. On average, it takes about 1-2 minutes to perform a single&#xD;
      scan, and we estimate a total of 25 minutes to perform scans on all the teeth in a single&#xD;
      individual. The saved data will be exported to a desktop computer for data analysis and&#xD;
      measurements using in-house developed MATLAB codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following five distance, thickness, or localization parameters will be measured linearly&#xD;
      on ultrasound images for further analysis and comparison: (1) gingival margin- cementoenamel&#xD;
      junction, (2) cementoenamel junction - alveolar bone crest, (3) gingival thickness at the&#xD;
      alveolar bone crest, (4) alveolar bone thickness at the crest and (5) localization of&#xD;
      cementoenamel junction. Measurements of the above five parameters will be performed by four&#xD;
      raters in the ultrasound images. All the raters will be blinded for data processing and&#xD;
      measurement. To test intra-rater reliability, each rater will conduct the measurement three&#xD;
      times with one week apart between measurements to avoid bias. Three of the measurements: (2)&#xD;
      cementoenamel junction - alveolar bone crest, (4) alveolar bone thickness at the crest and&#xD;
      (5) localization of cementoenamel junction will be identified in both CBCT and ultrasound&#xD;
      images and compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be presented as Mean±SD. Quality control of the data will be done&#xD;
      by scatter plots to detect outliers. We will consider three assessments: Intra-rater&#xD;
      reliability, inter-rater reliability, and agreement between the two methods. The intra- and&#xD;
      inter-rater reliabilities will be assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC(2,1))&#xD;
      using a 2-way random model and absolute agreement with a 95% confidence interval. Correlation&#xD;
      and the Bland-Altman plot will be used to assess the agreement between CBCT and ultrasound.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Individuals undergoing CBCT imaging as part of Orthodontic diagnostic records&#xD;
                  Individuals in the age group of 10-60 years would have a full complement of&#xD;
                  permanent teeth erupted which will help standardize the research methodology to&#xD;
                  prevent an error in data acquisition, caused by the overlap of dental tissue in&#xD;
                  the mixed dentition period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with missing permanent teeth, gingival recession (below CEJ), severe&#xD;
             crowding, or a history of corrective orthodontics will be excluded. Any co-factors&#xD;
             (previous orthodontic treatment) that might influence the ultrasound findings, will be&#xD;
             excluded. Participants with unfavorable oral hygiene will be excluded due to the&#xD;
             ambiguity associated with data acquisition in an inflamed periodontium. Also,&#xD;
             participants presenting with craniofacial syndromes will be excluded due to the&#xD;
