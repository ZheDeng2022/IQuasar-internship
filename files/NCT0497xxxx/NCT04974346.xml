  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Para-aortic lymph node metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for locally advanced cervical&#xD;
      cancer, but false negative diagnosis is easy to occur. The aim of this trial was to&#xD;
      investigate whether para-aortic prophylactic radiotherapy improves disease-free survival in&#xD;
      patients with positive pelvic lymph nodes below the common iliac artery.&#xD;

      This clinical trial enrolled participants with locally advanced cervical cancer with positive&#xD;
      pelvic lymph nodes below the common iliac region diagnosed by Positron emission&#xD;
      tomography-computed tomography(PET-CT). Participants should be able to receive concurrent&#xD;
      cisplatin chemotherapy. No anti-tumor treatment was given before randomization. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two groups. The study group will receive radiotherapy of pelvic&#xD;
      and para-aorta, concurrent chemotherapy and brachytherapy, and the control group will receive&#xD;
      pelvic radiotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy and brachytherapy.&#xD;
