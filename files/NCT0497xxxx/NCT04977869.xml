  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning combined with mechanical thrombectomy in treating acute ischemic stroke due to&#xD;
      large vessel occlusion of anterior circulation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 498 cases of ischemic stroke who undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 24&#xD;
      hours from the onset are included in 10 centers in China according to the principle of&#xD;
      random, and parallel control. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times per day for 7 consecutive days. The control group&#xD;
      receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times per day&#xD;
      for 7 consecutive days. Two groups will be followed up for 90 days to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of remote ischemic conditioning combined with mechanical thrombectomy in treating&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion of anterior circulation.&#xD;
