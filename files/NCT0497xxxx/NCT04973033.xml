  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) represents a group of&#xD;
      small vessel vasculitides characterized by granulomatous and neutrophilic tissue&#xD;
      inflammation, often associated with the production of antibodies that target neutrophil&#xD;
      antigens. The predominantly used treatment for induction of remission in AAV consisted of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (CYC) plus corticosteroids (GCs) which leads to remission in about 90% of&#xD;
      patients. However, relapses are frequent and remain a challenge. The optimal drug for&#xD;
      maintenance treatment is not determined. Tofacitinib is a Jak inhibitor which has been proved&#xD;
      to be effective in multiple inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Considering&#xD;
      that T cells and associated cytokine production play an important role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      AAV via activation of the JAK/ STAT pathway, we hypothesized that tofacitinib-mediated&#xD;
      inhibition of JAK signaling may represent an effective therapy for active AAV. In this&#xD;
      prospective, open label, single arm study, tofacitinib 5mg twice a day will be added to the&#xD;
      background treatment of GCs and immunosuppressants in AAV, the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      tofacitinib will be assessed.&#xD;
