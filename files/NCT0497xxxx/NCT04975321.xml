      A clinical trial comparing two types of NuSmile anterior crowns to composite strip crowns on&#xD;
      anterior dental restorations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stainless steel crowns have been the most common treatment for large cavities in baby teeth&#xD;
      until recently. These crowns are silver in color, and aesthetically are not a good option for&#xD;
      restoring front teeth. Several tooth colored options have been developed to meet the growing&#xD;
      demand for more aesthetics on front teeth. With the variety of new options for restoring&#xD;
      anterior primary teeth, the investigators would like to evaluate the long-term success of&#xD;
      three tooth-colored restoration options: NuSmile Signature crowns, NuSmile ZR crowns, and&#xD;
      composite crowns. The investigators are interested in looking at the outcomes of these three&#xD;
      restoration types, in terms of durability, aesthetics and cost effectiveness for the&#xD;
      treatment of front baby teeth. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      performance of two types of NuSmile crowns compared to composite crowns in treating large&#xD;
      multi-surfaced cavities on front baby teeth.&#xD;
