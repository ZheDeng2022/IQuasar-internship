  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with diabetes are a highly vulnerable population that suffers the highest rates&#xD;
      of cardiovascular and microvascular complications as well as adverse drug events such as&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Investigators will conduct a 12-month pragmatic clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      impact of scalable interventions that are designed to support personalized goal setting and&#xD;
      self-care through remote delivery of clinical and socioeconomic risk assessment, telephonic&#xD;
      care management, and community resource linkage. This highly personalized approach to&#xD;
      diabetes care has to potential to improve quality of life of this high-risk population while&#xD;
      avoiding adverse drug events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the needs of older patients with diabetes, multiple organizations have called for&#xD;
      a personalized approach to setting risk factor goals and self-care plans. The American&#xD;
      Geriatrics Society (AGS) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have published&#xD;
      recommendations urging individualized glycemic goals (hemoglobin A1C (A1C) &lt;7.5%, &lt;8.0%, or&#xD;
      &lt;8.5%) for three strata of older patients (healthy, complex, very complex). The guidelines&#xD;
      also acknowledge the importance of addressing socioeconomic risks that are barriers to&#xD;
      self-care management such as cost-related non-adherence and food insecurity. Despite&#xD;
      widespread agreement by experts, the clinical impact of this highly personalized approach to&#xD;
      diabetes care for older adults has been rarely studied in controlled trials. Interventions&#xD;
      designed to personalize diabetes care must overcome multiple challenges to implementation&#xD;
      including the brief clinical encounter, lack of patient engagement between encounters, and&#xD;
      lack of systems to leverage community-based self-care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to address these knowledge and care gaps by studying the integration of&#xD;
      two evidence-based interventions designed to engage patients and enhance self-care:. Managing&#xD;
      Diabetes to Gain Opportunities for a More Active Life (My Diabetes GOAL) and CommunityRx. The&#xD;
      My Diabetes GOAL intervention is designed to engage older patients in personalized goal&#xD;
      setting and chronic disease management.&#xD;
