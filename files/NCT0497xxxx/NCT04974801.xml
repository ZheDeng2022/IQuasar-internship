  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The benefits of using Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HMEs) for pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation after total laryngectomy are widely known. However, current available HMEs do&#xD;
      not reach the level of humidification capacity of the nose, and patients adherence to using&#xD;
      an HME 24/7 is not always possible. Provox Life HMEs and attachments are a new range of HMEs&#xD;
      and attachments, with improved humidification/breathability performance, and designed to suit&#xD;
      different situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and aim: In this clinical trial, the new Provox Life System was assessed for&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation and QoL after total laryngectomy, and compared with currently&#xD;
      available HMEs and attachments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Forty laryngectomized patients, who were previous users of HMEs, were randomized to&#xD;
      Usual Care or Provox Life for 6 weeks, after which a cross-over occurred. Data was collected&#xD;
      at baseline, and after the end of each study period. Additionally, patients filled in a diary&#xD;
      and tally sheet to record their forced expectorations and coughing.&#xD;
