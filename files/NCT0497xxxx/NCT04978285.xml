      Primary aim - To investigate the relationship between postoperative anaemia and&#xD;
      patient-centred outcomes after major abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim - To determine whether a more liberal perioperative IV fluid strategy increases&#xD;
      the risk of postoperative anaemia (haemodilution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adults with anaemia in the immediate postoperative period following major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery have a poorer quality of recovery and higher risk of complications, leading&#xD;
      to poor disability-free survival when compared with patients without postoperative anaemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of postoperative anemia remain unclear. Postoperative anaemia is more likely&#xD;
      if there is pre-existing anemia, but also increased perioperative blood loss, frequent blood&#xD;
      sampling, excess IV fluids (leading to hemodilution), sepsis, and inadequate nutritional&#xD;
      intake after surgery. A nadir in Hb concentration is most often observed within the first 3-4&#xD;
      days after surgery. Postoperative anemia is believed to have deleterious effects on patient&#xD;
      outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay, increased postoperative complications, and&#xD;
      perhaps poor survival, but there is very little data to support this belief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent consensus statement suggested that all patients recovering from major surgery&#xD;
      (defined as blood loss &gt; 500 ml or lasting &gt; 2 h) and either had preoperative anemia or&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe blood loss during surgery must be screened for anemia after surgery.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this consensus group recommended that patients recovering from uncomplicated&#xD;
      major surgery should have their Hb concentration measured for at least 3 days after surgery&#xD;
      to detect anemia. As outlined above, this is problematic if there is fluid retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of IV iron for the treatment of postoperative anemia is unclear, with the most&#xD;
      recent systematic review concluding that neither oral nor IV iron had a significant effect on&#xD;
      patient quality of life or functional outcomes following surgery. A diagnosis of iron&#xD;
      deficiency is very difficult in the postoperative period because the acute phase inflammatory&#xD;
      response results in spuriously elevated ferritin levels, and several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated oral iron therapy is ineffective in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose a study to investigate the incidence, extent, and outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with anemia after major surgery, including an assessment of the amount of IV fluids&#xD;
      administered in the immediate perioperative period.&#xD;
