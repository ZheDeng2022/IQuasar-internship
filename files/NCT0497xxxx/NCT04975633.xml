      A feasibility study investigating the Bodyport virtual cardiac clinic vs usual care for&#xD;
      outpatient heart failure management at Keck Medical Center of USC&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a debilitating disease associated with high hospitalization rates which&#xD;
      could potentially be curbed by remote patient monitoring. Remote monitoring may allow for the&#xD;
      early detection of signs and symptoms of cardiac decompensation, enabling prompt&#xD;
      interventions to reduce hospital admission rates or the duration of inpatient stay, and the&#xD;
      quality of life of those suffering from heart failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      structured remote patient management interventions can reduce the percentage of days lost to&#xD;
      unplanned cardiovascular admissions. The investigators propose assessing the feasibility of a&#xD;
      structured virtual cardiac care service leveraging the Bodyport platform to optimize&#xD;
      outpatient management of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will leverage the Bodyport virtual cardiac clinic platform to deliver care for the&#xD;
      heart failure patient population at Keck Medical Center of USC. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive the Bodyport Cardiac Scale for home monitoring as well as heart&#xD;
      failure education and non-clinical support from Bodyport coaches. Daily measurement uploads&#xD;
      from the patients will be analyzed and changes in measurement data will be used to guide&#xD;
      follow-up and care management, such as diuretic dose adjustments. For this initial&#xD;
      feasibility study, the investigators will be focusing on patient and provider satisfaction of&#xD;
      the virtual cardiac clinic along with the operational ease of executing this form of care&#xD;
      compared to standard care.&#xD;
