  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether a brief video aiming to optimize expectations regarding&#xD;
      the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) can enhance the efficacy of a PMR&#xD;
      compared to a neutral video control group in an online intervention. Another aim is to assess&#xD;
      whether this effect will be moderated by the degree of human support (guided or unguided&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;

      This study aims to determine whether a brief video aiming to optimize expectations regarding&#xD;
      the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) can enhance the efficacy of a PMR&#xD;
      session compared to a neutral video control group in an online intervention. Another aim is&#xD;
      to assess whether this effect will be moderated by the degree of human support (guided or&#xD;
      unguided intervention). After the baseline assessment, participants are randomized to one of&#xD;
      4 possible intervention groups: i) watching a video aiming to optimize participants'&#xD;
      expectations before undergoing a single PMR session without personal support of the&#xD;
      experimenter (unguided), ii) watching a video aiming to optimize participants' expectations&#xD;
      before undergoing a single PMR session with the personal support of the experimenter&#xD;
      (guided), iii) watching a neutral video (not aiming to optimize participants' expectations)&#xD;
      before undergoing a single PMR session without personal support of the experimenter&#xD;
      (unguided), or iv) watching a neutral video (not aiming to optimize participants'&#xD;
      expectations) before undergoing a single PMR session with the personal support of the&#xD;
      experimenter (guided). In a pre-posttest design, the subjective stress levels of the&#xD;
      participants in the for groups will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from pre (baseline) to post scores (30 minutes later)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rate how stressed they feel at the moment at two time points (baseline and after the PMR intervention) on a questionnaire (VAS: item ranges from 0 (not stressed at all) - 100 (very stressed). Change scores are calculated (post- minus pre-scores). More negative change scores are better since it indicates a stronger stress reduction (maximum reduction: -100). Higher positive change scores are worse since this indicates an increase in perceived stress (maximum increase: +100). Range of change scores: -100 - +100).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in positive affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre (baseline) to post scores (30 minutes later)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rate adjectives regarding their current mood (positive and negative) at two time points (baseline and after the PMR intervention) on a questionnaire. Change scores are calculated (post- minus pre-scores). Instrument: Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988) is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both positive and negative affect. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Range for sum score of positive/negative affect: 10-50. For positive affect higher scores are better; for negative affect lower scores are better.</description>

    <description>Participants watch a video aiming to optimize participants' expectations before undergoing a single PMR session without personal support of the experimenter (unguided). The PMR session involves learning to monitor tension in each specific muscle group in the body by deliberately inducing tension in each group. This tension is then released, with attention paid to the contrast between tension and relaxation.</description>
