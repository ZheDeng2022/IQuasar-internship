      Aims and objectives: To investigate preoperative anxiety in parents of paediatric surgical&#xD;
      patients, testing whether the provision of information (using video and story books)&#xD;
      regarding the surgical process can impact on reducing anxiety. Analyse if some personal&#xD;
      factors influence the reduction of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Attending a surgical theatre generates anxiety in all types of patients,&#xD;
      especially in the case of children. The effect of different preoperative intervention&#xD;
      procedures in children that attempt to reduce their anxiety level have been studied a great&#xD;
      deal. However, although their parents also suffer high anxiety levels, potential intervention&#xD;
      to reduce their levels have not received the same attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomised Clinical trial Methods: One hundred and twenty-five parents of&#xD;
      children (8-12 y.o.) undergoing surgery in Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias&#xD;
      hospital (Oviedo, Spain) were randomly assigned to the control group (34 individuals) or one&#xD;
      of the 3 experimental groups (91). After the pre-anaesthesia consultation, children and&#xD;
      parents of the experimental groups were provided with a story book, a video with additional&#xD;
      information of nursing, or both. In the antechamber of the operating room and prior to the&#xD;
      surgical intervention, the State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety of the parents and children were&#xD;
      measured using the STAI and STAIC questionnaires respectively. The data collection, including&#xD;
      different demographic variables was carried out for 12 months starting in October 2016&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomised and blind clinical trial. The parents could be randomly assigned to the control group, and received the standard procedure, or to the experimental groups. Three experimental groups were possible regarding the various types of interventions: story book (IG1), video (IG2), or both instruments (IG3)</intervention_model_description>
