      This study intends to combining wearable technology to crate Internet+Digital Hospital-remote&#xD;
      Home Type 2 Diabetes follow-up management mode.To preliminarily explore compared with the&#xD;
      traditional medical treatment mode, whether the new management mode of DM can improve the&#xD;
      management objectives and patient satisfaction of T2DM and reduce medical costs. The study&#xD;
      provides a powerful reference for establishing corresponding platforms and promoting such&#xD;
      models at the government management level in the future.&#xD;

      Background:The prevalence of T2DM in Chinese adults has exceeded 10%, and the prevalence of&#xD;
      abnormal glucose metabolism has exceeded 40% in people older than 18 years. This will lead to&#xD;
      a significant increase in the prevalence of DM complications in the next decade, and the&#xD;
      disability and death caused by complications will also seriously affect the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients and bring a huge social and economic burden.This randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      intends to combining wearable technology to crate Internet+Digital Hospital-remote Home T2DM&#xD;
      follow-up management mode.To preliminarily explore compared with the traditional medical&#xD;
      treatment mode, whether the new management mode of DM can improve the management objectives&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction of T2DM and reduce medical costs. The study provides a powerful&#xD;
      reference for establishing corresponding platforms and promoting such models at the&#xD;
      government management level in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The study was a parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial. the number of cases&#xD;
      planned to be included in 200 cases. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      or control group.The intervention group receives Internet + Digital Hospital-remote home&#xD;
      management mode,including remote monitoring devices+Internet management platform, dietary&#xD;
      recommendations, exercise supervision, web education, information pushing, doctor-patient&#xD;
      interaction, etc.The control group receives the traditional management mode, including&#xD;
      routine dietary and exercise recommendations, education as well as monitor in the clinic.&#xD;
