  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of cancer and cancer deaths in the US. While&#xD;
      most (69%) smokers want to quit, only 6% succeed in doing so each year. For many smokers, the&#xD;
      addictiveness of nicotine makes quitting very difficult. To reduce cigarette smoking and&#xD;
      resulting harms, FDA has announced a comprehensive approach to tobacco and nicotine&#xD;
      regulation that includes moving toward a very low nicotine content (VLNC) standard for&#xD;
      cigarettes. Greatly reduced nicotine levels would facilitate smoking cessation. However, the&#xD;
      maximal success of the policy may require public understanding that, although these new&#xD;
      cigarettes are less addictive, their high toxicity and carcinogenicity are unchanged. Yet,&#xD;
      nearly half of adult smokers incorrectly think smoking VLNC cigarettes is less harmful than&#xD;
      smoking current cigarettes (the VLNC misperception). Additionally, 24% of smokers said they&#xD;
      would be less likely to quit if a VLNC regulation is enacted. Thus, the VLNC misperception&#xD;
      may partially undermine a nicotine reduction policy. Although communication research suggests&#xD;
      it is challenging to change people's incorrect understanding, new communication techniques&#xD;
      may help reduce the VLNC misperception. In this randomized trial we will examine whether&#xD;
      messages about the harm of VLNC cigarettes can reduce the VLNC misperception and increase&#xD;
      intention to quit in a nicotine reduction scenario.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will assess whether messages about the harm of VLNC cigarettes reduce the&#xD;
      misperception that they are less harmful than regular cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll participants from an existing nationally representative panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants are part of an existing nationally representative panel and have&#xD;
      already consented to participate in the panel. Before enrolling, participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to consent to participate in this study via a consent form included in the study&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey software will randomly allocate participants to one of the four arms of the study (3&#xD;
      intervention arms or a control arm). Each study arm will have approximately the same number&#xD;
      of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a 15-minute survey. The survey will begin with an introduction to&#xD;
      the concept of VLNC cigarettes. Then participants will be shown intervention or control&#xD;
      messages, and their beliefs will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description of the Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be shown a set of 3 messages about the harms of VLNC cigarettes&#xD;
      (intervention arms) or about littering (control arm). Each of the 3 intervention arms use a&#xD;
      different theme to attempt to correct the VLNC misperception.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by a 3 item scale. VLNC Misperception measured with 3 questions, the final VLNC misperception score is a mean of the response to the 3 questions, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a perception that VLNC are much more harmful than other cigarettes, and 5 indicates a perception that VLNC are much less harmful than other cigarettes, and 3 is a perception that VLNC are as harmful as other cigarettes.</description>

    <description>Measured by a 3 item scale. Quit intention measured with 3 questions, the final quit intention score is a mean of the response to the 3 questions, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low intention to quit smoking, and 5 indicates a high intention to quit.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Message Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>During one day survey</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by a 3 item scale after each message, 9 items total. Perceived message effectiveness measured with 3 questions per message. The final perceived message effectiveness score is a mean of the response to the 3 questions, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low perceived message effectiveness, and 5 indicates high perceived message effectiveness.</description>

Interest in other nicotine products with 3 questions, the final score is a mean of the response to the 3 questions, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low interest in other nicotine products, and 5 indicates a high interest in other nicotine products. We also plan to examine these 3 items individually, on the same 1 to 5 scale.</description>
