  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the patients with major depressive disorder do not respond to conventional&#xD;
      antidepressants that act through the mono-aminergic system. The available treatment&#xD;
      modalities, including SSRIs, are slow to act and have a lag time before showing improvement&#xD;
      in symptoms of patients. To overcome these treatment hurdles, add-on therapy to standard&#xD;
      antidepressant drugs may lead to better therapeutic outcomes. Sarcosine, which is a&#xD;
      nutraceutical, modulates glutamate neurotransmission has an ameliorative effect on the&#xD;
      disease symptoms of depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The only clinical&#xD;
      study done on depressive patients by Huang et al. cannot be generalized due to certain&#xD;
      inherent limitations. To date, there is no randomized controlled trial with add-on sarcosine&#xD;
      to current antidepressant therapy to the best of our knowledge. So, we considered sarcosine&#xD;
      can be the candidate drug for add-on therapy due to its multiple mechanisms on the&#xD;
      glutaminergic system. Adding sarcosine to ongoing antidepressant therapy may either increase&#xD;
      their response rate or decrease adverse drug reactions by decreasing the dose requirement or&#xD;
      may show a quicker therapeutic effect. Hence, the present randomized controlled trial has&#xD;
      been planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sarcosine as add-on therapy in major&#xD;
      depressive disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder or unipolar depression is a commonly encountered psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder, with reported lifetime and one-year prevalence rates of 16.6% and 6.6%,&#xD;
      respectively, and is associated with an increased risk of suicide. It is estimated that more&#xD;
      than 264 million of the global population have suffered from depression. Major depressive&#xD;
      disorder causes significant disabilities, thus adversely affects the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers. Despite the clinical significance of depression, its&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is still not understood comprehensibly, and different potential&#xD;
      targets have been explored. One of the most well-researched theories of previous decades has&#xD;
      been the monoamine hypothesis; however, it appears that simple monoamine depletion is&#xD;
      insufficient to account for the development of the disorder. Drugs acting through enhancing&#xD;
      the monoaminergic pathway, i.e., increasing the synaptic concentration of serotonin,&#xD;
      noradrenaline, or dopamine, are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant medication in the&#xD;
      last five decades. Among them, second-generation antidepressant drugs like selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)&#xD;
      are the most effective and most widely used nowadays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Methyl D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulation is one of the leading novel mechanisms in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of depression that has been postulated for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
      The NMDA hypothesis originated from an unexpected observation that D-cycloserine, a partial&#xD;
      agonist of the NMDAR, has antidepressant activity. Also, NMDA-enhancing treatment results in&#xD;
      a significant reduction in depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. It has also&#xD;
      been observed that major depression is associated with decreased expression and release of&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcosine (N-Methyl Glycine), an endogenous amino acid with NMDA receptor function enhancing&#xD;
      property, is usually used as a dietary supplement or nutraceutical. Sarcosine increases the&#xD;
      availability of glycine for the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor by inhibiting its&#xD;
      reuptake from the synaptic cleft. It also possesses glycine binding site co-agonistic&#xD;
      activity. In various animal studies, it has been found that long-term sarcosine treatment&#xD;
      significantly ameliorated the induced depression, confirming the potential role of sarcosine&#xD;
      as an antidepressant agent. Huang et al. and Chen et al. have demonstrated antidepressant&#xD;
      effects of sarcosine in animal behavior models of depression. The only clinical trial of&#xD;
      sarcosine done on depressive patients by Huang et al. has shown better and quicker response&#xD;
      with superior tolerability as compared to citalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic latency, lack of efficacy in a significant proportion of patients, and adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions are the primary concerns in current antidepressant therapies. To overcome&#xD;
      these treatment challenges, add-on therapy to standard antidepressant drugs may lead to&#xD;
      better therapeutic outcomes. Our literature search found that to date, there is no randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial on sarcosine as an add-on therapy to first-line antidepressants like SSRIs.&#xD;
      The result of the previous study by Huang et al. cannot be generalized because of the&#xD;
      inherent limitations in study design. So, the present randomized controlled trial has been&#xD;
      planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of add-on sarcosine to SSRIs in major depressive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
