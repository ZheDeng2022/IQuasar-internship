  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to participate in SELECT-LIFE study because participants take&#xD;
      part in the SELECT trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECT-LIFE study is a survey-based study that will start when the SELECT trial ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECT-LIFE looks at the long-term effects of participants taking part in the SELECT trial&#xD;
      including the trial medicine participants have been taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the SELECT trial ends, participants will no longer get the medicine participants got in&#xD;
      the study, even if participants decide to take part in the SELECT-LIFE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not get any specific treatment or medicine as part of the SELECT-LIFE&#xD;
      study, and participants will be treated as participants normally would by their own doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SELECT-LIFE study will last for up to 10 years after SELECT trial ends, and participants&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a questionnaire about their health every 6 months.&#xD;

EQ-5D index score range: 0 to 1 and EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self reported health status.</description>
