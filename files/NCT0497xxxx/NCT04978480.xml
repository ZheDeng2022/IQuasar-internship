  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke systems of care should emulate trauma systems which deliver the full range of&#xD;
      care to all injured patients by means of organized, coordinated efforts in defined geographic&#xD;
      areas. Just as trauma systems have proven ability to save lives of the most severely injured&#xD;
      patients, clinicians should have a stroke system able to provide care to patients with the&#xD;
      most severe strokes. The most severe type of acute ischemic stroke is due to proximal large&#xD;
      vessel occlusion (LVO). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) offers an extraordinary potential to&#xD;
      improve the outcome of patients with LVO. Unfortunately, in part because MT is available only&#xD;
      at advanced stroke centers, only a minority of patients with LVO are treated with MT, and&#xD;
      there are racial, socioeconomic, and rural disparities in access to MT. Based on the success&#xD;
      of trauma systems and our prior collaboration, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH)&#xD;
      is planning a five-year statewide quality improvement initiative of trauma communications&#xD;
      center (TCC) coordinated severity-based stroke triage (SBST) which aims to transform the&#xD;
      fragmented acute stroke care system by coordinating prehospital and inter-facility emergency&#xD;
      stroke care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) is implementing a quality improvement&#xD;
      initiative of trauma communications center coordinated severity-based stroke triage (TCC&#xD;
      Coordinated SBST) which aims to transform the fragmented acute stroke care system by&#xD;
      coordinating prehospital and inter-facility emergency stroke care. Investigators will study&#xD;
      the implementation of this initiative and the impact it has on access to care and health&#xD;
      outcomes. Our specific aims are to (1) Compare the proportion of patients encountered by the&#xD;
      emergency medical service (EMS) with suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO) who are treated&#xD;
      with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) before (adhering to standard triage to the nearest stroke&#xD;
      center) and after implementation of TCC Coordinated SBST; (2) Assess the broad public health&#xD;
      impact of TCC Coordinated SBST; and (3) Assess stakeholder perceptions of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the heart of the Alabama stroke system is the Alabama Trauma Communications Center (ATCC),&#xD;
      where 24 paramedic communicators field calls from EMS and maintain current status of&#xD;
      hospitals and resources across the state. EMS providers enter all patients with suspected&#xD;
      stroke into the Alabama Stroke System by calling the ATCC. The ATCC, like other Emergency&#xD;
      Communication Centers, is not involved with initial emergency medical dispatch, but rather&#xD;
      assists EMS by routing the patient to the nearest stroke system hospital depending on&#xD;
      hospital-resource availability and notifying the receiving hospital. As necessary components&#xD;
      of this stroke system change, the ADPH is adding a designation for thrombectomy-capable&#xD;
      stroke centers (MTCs), carrying out EMS training in a validated 6-item stroke severity scale,&#xD;
      the Emergency Medical Stroke Assessment (EMSA), across the state, and expanding data&#xD;
      collection to capture statewide stroke system data including prehospital EMSA items (gaze,&#xD;
      facial droop, arm drift, leg drift, naming, and repetition) and hospital data including&#xD;
      whether an LVO was confirmed, LVO location, and whether the patient received MT.&#xD;
      Investigators will only collect data for this study on patients who have been entered into&#xD;
      the stroke system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in health care policy by the ADPH allows a natural experiment. The ADPH has&#xD;
      planned a phased rollout, lending itself to analysis as a stepped wedge cluster trial with&#xD;
      each EMS region serving as a cluster. This design will facilitate modeling the impact of time&#xD;
      on the effectiveness of TCC Coordinated SBST. This study will broadly and equitably target a&#xD;
      population of stroke patients of all ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities. A strength of this&#xD;
      study is that at least 50% of subjects will be women and over one-third of the enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be African Americans based on census data. As the study involves rural and&#xD;
      urban regions and stroke centers of all levels across the State, investigators will gain&#xD;
      information regarding the impact on resources (e.g., EMS response times for non-stroke&#xD;
      conditions), benefits, and potential risks (e.g., delay to tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)&#xD;
      treatment and other unintended consequences) of implementation across a wide range of service&#xD;
      delivery contexts. Finally, because the trial is embedded within a state-wide acute stroke&#xD;
      registry, investigators will be able to evaluate its public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methods methodological approach integrating rigorous quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods will be the most effective way to understand varied and multi-level stakeholder&#xD;
      perceptions and optimize implementation of this complex health intervention across different&#xD;
      service contexts. Investigators will use a multi-phase mixed methods design to assess&#xD;
      stakeholders' views about the implementation process. Prior to implementation of TCC&#xD;
      Coordinated SBST, investigators will use qualitative and quantitative methods to aid in the&#xD;
      development of context specific forms of the model. After implementation, quantitative survey&#xD;
      data will yield a general understanding of stakeholder perceptions of the intervention and&#xD;
      guide purposeful selection of subjects for interviews to more fully understand&#xD;
      context-specific barriers and facilitators to the intervention's implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline period in each EMS region, all stroke patients will undergo standard&#xD;
      triage to the nearest stroke center of any level. During the implementation period in each&#xD;
      EMS region, patients with a last known well (LKW) time ≤ 24 hours, who are alert or respond&#xD;
      to voice, and who have an EMSA ≥ 4, will be routed by TCC directly to a MTC if additional&#xD;
      transport time complies with region-specific transport time limits and will not preclude use&#xD;
      of tPA; Otherwise, TCC will coordinate transport to the closest stroke center of any level&#xD;
      and initiate a region and hospital specific plan to expedite inter-facility transfer to a MTC&#xD;
      for appropriate patients. Patients will receive standard emergency department and hospital&#xD;
      evaluation and treatments as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the 36 months of data collection, about 7,000 men and women of all races and ethnicities&#xD;
      with suspected severe stroke will be enrolled in this study. There will be a prospective&#xD;
      collection of variables in the standard triage period and post-implementation of the TCC&#xD;
      Coordinated SBST. Patients entered into the stroke system are assigned an ATCC number which&#xD;
      is unique for each EMS transport. The ATCC paramedic will guide EMS in performance of the&#xD;
      EMSA; send a hospital pre-notification page that includes the patient's age, sex, specific&#xD;
      EMSA items, LKW time, and ATCC number; and enter prehospital clinical variables in an&#xD;
      electronic data capture system (LifeTrac). Hospital participation in the Alabama Stroke&#xD;
      System requires Stroke Centers to share stroke patient emergency department and hospital data&#xD;
      which is entered by stroke center coordinators into the ADPH REDCap database, a secure,&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant, web-based application for supporting data capture for research, linked to&#xD;
      prehospital records by the ATCC number. Stroke center coordinators will conduct a validated&#xD;
      structured telephone mRS at 3 months post stroke. EMS Regional Agencies will play an&#xD;
      important role in ensuring complete data capture from stroke centers by following up with&#xD;
      stroke center coordinators. System level data captured by ADPH will allow determination of&#xD;
      county and regional EMS response times, proportion of EMS organizations and stroke centers&#xD;
      participating, and data on fidelity of implementation.&#xD;
