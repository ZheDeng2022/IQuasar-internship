  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported incidence of hypomagnesemia is approximately 2% in the general population.&#xD;
      Hypomagnesemia is a common problem, occurring in nearly 10%of general hospitalized patients&#xD;
      and 17% of hospitalized cancer patients. A higher incidence, up to 60% to 65%, has been found&#xD;
      among intensive care unit patients. Hypomagnesemia can potentially cause fatal complications&#xD;
      including ventricular arrhythmia, coronary artery spasm, and sudden death. It also associates&#xD;
      with increased mortality and prolonged hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium exists in three different forms in the body. In serum, 5-14% of the magnesium is&#xD;
      reported to be complexed with anions such as phosphate, bicarbonate, and citrate, 19-33% is&#xD;
      reported to be protein-bound (mainly to albumin), and 55-67% is found in the free ionized&#xD;
      fraction. Because the amount of bound or complexed Mg can vary significantly, especially in&#xD;
      illness, the ionized magnesium can vary in an unpredictable way. Conventional laboratory&#xD;
      testing typically only measures total serum magnesium, which is often not reflective of&#xD;
      ionized magnesium. Unlike ionized calcium, which is commonly measured and is also readily&#xD;
      calculated from the total calcium and albumin levels, ionized magnesium is neither commonly&#xD;
      measured nor easily calculated. One study reported that the level of ionized magnesium cannot&#xD;
      be predicted by analysis of total magnesium and that the levels of ionized magnesium vary&#xD;
      upon different pathophysiological conditions and between individuals. Furthermore,&#xD;
      measurement of ionized magnesium in serum might be of great impact in patients for whom&#xD;
      magnesium status is required, and the correlation of ionized magnesium and total magnesium is&#xD;
      weak in patients for whom magnesium status is required as a whole, and this is the reason why&#xD;
      the ionized magnesium should be measured directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most of the clinical studies were evaluate the effect of hypomagnesemia on the&#xD;
      outcome after surgery using the levels of total serum magnesium. However, the portion of&#xD;
      extracellular magnesium that is physiologically active is in the various process is ionized&#xD;
      magnesium. So, it is important to evaluate the level of ionized magnesium in surgical&#xD;
      patients to predict the outcomes after surgery. Unfortunately, clinical trial regarding the&#xD;
      effect of the concentrations of ionized magnesium on the surgical patients is limited.&#xD;
