  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IPAQ-SF scale is widely used in our clinical settings. The translated version of IPAQ-SF&#xD;
      scale in Urdu will help the clinician in collecting data thus, easy to understand for the&#xD;
      patient and making it more desirable in our region.&#xD;

      The purpose of study is to translate IPAQ-SF (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-&#xD;
      short form) scale in Urdu and to determine the validity &amp; reliability of IPAQ-SF in Urdu&#xD;
      version. Patients who are at high risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      diabetes, and hypertension age between 30 to 65 years and can understand Urdu and English&#xD;
      language are included in my study. 6mint walk test performed to assess aerobic capacity and&#xD;
      endurance and physical activity over the last seven days is recorded on the translated&#xD;
      version of IPAQ-SF in Urdu and then back of Urdu into English.&#xD;
