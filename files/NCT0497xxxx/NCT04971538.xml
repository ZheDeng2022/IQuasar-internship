  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the goal of elimination of hepatitis C infection in Pakistan, the strategy of&#xD;
      elimination needs to be increasingly directed towards case finding through mass screening in&#xD;
      rural or peri-urban communities to identify and treat those not yet aware of their infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-testing (ST) with easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests has been successfully used for&#xD;
      diseases such as HIV. The availability of self-testing has been shown to increase testing&#xD;
      rates and testing acceptability in diverse populations around the world, in large part due to&#xD;
      its convenience and privacy advantages. In the present study we aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability and impact of a program enabling home delivery of hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      self-testing in the Malir district, Karachi division, Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomized controlled study that will be nested within a larger&#xD;
      micro-elimination study run by Aga Khan University (AKU). This larger study has already&#xD;
      completed house-to-house screening of Union Council (UC) 9 and 10 in the Malir district of&#xD;
      Karachi, with a number of households still in need of follow-up, these households contained&#xD;
      members who were not present during the house-to-house screening and were not able to be&#xD;
      offered the HCV rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In this study AKU study staff will return to the&#xD;
      households that had persons missed by the first round of house-to-house screening done during&#xD;
      the CHIME study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For randomization purposes, the neighborhoods in UC 9 and 10 will be grouped into clusters.&#xD;
      The clusters will be matched in pairs based on similarity of geography (peri-urban or rural),&#xD;
      population size, and age demographics. Each cluster within a matched pair will then be&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, if the participant is not home the study staff will leave an HCV&#xD;
      self test (HCV ST), instructions for use ( IFU), and supporting materials with the household.&#xD;
      The study team will also explain the HCVST process to the most senior member of the&#xD;
      household, as well as leave a mobile number for the participant to contact for help&#xD;
      conducting the test. The study team will follow up with the participant to inquire about if&#xD;
      testing was completed. If the HCV ST is reactive, study staff, over the phone, will also make&#xD;
      an appointment to return to the house for enrolment into the larger AKU micro-elimination&#xD;
      study, and after enrolment into the lager AKU micro-elimination study the participant will&#xD;
      receive a blood draw for HCV RNA confirmatory testing and APRI staging. If the participant is&#xD;
      HCV viraemic they will be provided treatment, delivered to their door by The Liver&#xD;
      Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, if the participant is not home the study staff will leave both printed&#xD;
      and verbal information on HCV testing and direct them to the nearest clinic with screening&#xD;
      services. Study staff will also leave a mobile number for the participant to contact for&#xD;
      further information on HCV testing. The study team will follow up with the participant to&#xD;
      inquire about if testing was completed. If the HCV test is reactive, study staff, over the&#xD;
      phone, will also make an appointment to return to the house for enrolment into the larger AKU&#xD;
      micro-elimination study, and after enrolment into the lager AKU micro-elimination study the&#xD;
      participant will receive a blood draw for HCV RNA confirmatory testing and Aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) staging. If the participant is HCV viraemic&#xD;
      they will be provided treatment, delivered to their door by The Liver Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups result reporting of did the test and it was positive, did the test and it was&#xD;
      negative and did the test and it was indeterminate/I don't know the result, and did not do&#xD;
      the test will be incentivized with a 500-rupee phone credit voucher, for those participants&#xD;
      who phone AKU and inform them of the results within one month of enrolment. The study team&#xD;
      will follow up with a subsection of participants, n=60 in the intervention and n=60 in the&#xD;
      control, conduct a brief survey on their perceptions of the testing process&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, if the previously missed person is home when the study staff visits, that&#xD;
      person will be enrolled in the larger micro-elimination study and not this study, no&#xD;
      self-testing will be done. Study staff will conduct onsite RDT testing and reflex blood draw&#xD;
      for confirmatory HCV RNA testing and APRI staging if the RDT is reactive as per the larger&#xD;
      study protocol. If the person has HCV viremia, they will be provided HCV tx delivered to&#xD;
      their door by The Liver Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operational analysis and a costing analysis will also be done evaluating the costs&#xD;
      associated with self-testing home delivery with regards to cost per test completed and cost&#xD;
      per person diagnosed with HCV.&#xD;

    <description>The OraQuick® HCV Self-Test is a lateral flow rapid diagnostic that can detect anti-HCV antibodies in oral fluid. Instructions for Use (IFU) for OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Self-Test have been developed in Georgian for the previous 2 studies conducted in Georgia using the OraQuick® HCV Rapid Antibody Self-Test. The IFU has been optimized taking in the feedback on the IFU resulting from the aforementioned studies. As this HCV test is not approved for self-test use in Georgia, all tests will be labelled as Research Use Only (RUO) and test results will not be used for patient management.</description>
