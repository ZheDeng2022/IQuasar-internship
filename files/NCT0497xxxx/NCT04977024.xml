    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the immune response to COH04S1 compared to Emergency Use&#xD;
      Authorization (EUA) SARS-COV-2 vaccine in patients with blood cancer who have received stem&#xD;
      cell transplant or cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COH04S1 belongs to a category called modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccines, created from a&#xD;
      new version of MVA, called synthetic MVA. COH04S1 works by inducing immunity (the ability to&#xD;
      recognize and fight against an infection) to SARS-CoV-2. The immune system is stimulated to&#xD;
      produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that would block the virus from entering healthy cells.&#xD;
      The immune system also grows new disease fighting T cells that can recognize and destroy&#xD;
      infected cells. Giving COH04S1 after cellular therapy may work better in reducing the chances&#xD;
      of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or developing a severe form of COVID-19&#xD;
      disease in patients with blood cancer compared to EUA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the biological activity and the role of timing of 2 injections of COH04S1 vaccine&#xD;
      administered at 2.5x10e8 PFU/dose compared to EUA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess safety of COH04S1 vaccine. II. Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 S and N-specific Th1 vs Th2&#xD;
      polarization. III. Evaluate T-cell levels and function. IV. Evaluate activated/cycling and&#xD;
      memory phenotype markers. V. Evaluate durability of immune responses. VI. Evaluate&#xD;
      maintenance of immunity that can be associated with protection over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Surveillance for incidental COVID-19 infection during follow-up (1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I : Patients receive one dose of COH04S1 intramuscularly (IM) in the upper arm on days 0&#xD;
      and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II : Patients receive one dose of EUA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine IM in the upper arm on days 0&#xD;
      and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 7, 90, 120, 180,&#xD;
      and 365.&#xD;
