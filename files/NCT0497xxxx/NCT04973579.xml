      Prospective, single-center, clinical registry of patients with symptomatic/critical carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis at risk of stroke coexisting with unstable or multivessel severe coronary&#xD;
      artery disease and/or severe valvular heart disease undergoing endovascular treatment of&#xD;
      carotid atherosclerosis using a mesh stent in combination with cardiac surgery (coronary&#xD;
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery). A study involving clinical data&#xD;
      evaluation of truly simultaneous treatment outcomes in patients deemed to require carotid&#xD;
      revascularization at the time of surgical cardiac intervention (single-stage, simultaneous&#xD;
      treatment). An open-label study, without randomization - a single arm study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coexistence of symptomatic or unstable stroke-threatening carotid atherosclerotic&#xD;
      stenosis with cardiac disease requiring urgent / fast-track cardiac surgery (such as advanced&#xD;
      unstable or multivessel coronary artery disease, recent myocardial infarction or pulmonary&#xD;
      edema, severely impaired myocardial contractility, and/or severe valvular disease requiring&#xD;
      surgical treatment) represents a major medical and therapeutic/logistics challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to current guidelines, in absence of prospective randomized evidence, the most&#xD;
      appropriate management strategy for a given patient should be determined by a multispecialty&#xD;
      team. In hemodynamically compromised patients sequential treatment (i.e., first carotid&#xD;
      stenosis repair followed by surgery or first cardiac surgery followed by carotid stenosis&#xD;
      treatment, either surgical or endovascular) is associated with a high risk of cardiac&#xD;
      complications in case of first-stage carotid stenosis treatment and a high risk of&#xD;
      neurological complications in case of the first-stage cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this challenging patient group, we have introduced single-stage, truly simultaneous&#xD;
      procedure. The fundament of the strategy is to establish extracorporeal circulation back-up&#xD;
      (&quot;CEC standby&quot;) prior to the minimally invasive (endovascular) treatment of&#xD;
      stroke-threatening carotid artery stenosis in the hybrid room under single anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CAS (proximal or distal protected), in case of suboptimal femoral access (or lack of&#xD;
      femoral access), a direct access via carotid artery is used (transcervical or transcarotid&#xD;
      revascularization), this is immediately followed by cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure, each time, follows recommendation of the Multispecialty Team (Heart Team +&#xD;
      NeuroVascular Team) as the lowest-deemed risk management in patients with indications for&#xD;
      both urgent both carotid revascularization and cardiac surgery. Both carotid and cardiac&#xD;
      treatment are performed under single anesthesia with the feasibility of immediate&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation support during carotid revascularization in case of hemodynamic&#xD;
      collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for treatment is based on the decision (recommendation) of a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Heart Team along with a NeuroVascular Team consisting of a cardiac surgeon, cardiologist,&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, angiologist, neurologist, and vascular surgeon, with the concomitant use of&#xD;
      routine pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological prevention - according to current guidelines.&#xD;
