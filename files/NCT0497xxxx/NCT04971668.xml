  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesized that the use of blend aromatherapy and gum chewing before surgery&#xD;
      would reduce preoperative anxiety as assessed by the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and provide non pharmacological methods to decrease&#xD;
      postoperative sore throat, postoperative nausea &amp; vomiting and postoperative pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A written informed consent will be taken from the patients.patients will be assigned randomly&#xD;
      to three groups (30 subjects each) either with preoperative aromatherapy (Group A) or gum&#xD;
      chewing (Group G) or control group (Group C) to assess the preoperative anxiety and&#xD;
      postoperative sore throat, nausea &amp; vomiting and pain control between the three studied&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preoperative anxiety scale assessed by STAI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI takes less than 5 minutes to complete and can be scored in less than 2 minutes. There are 20 questions (I feel calm, secure, tense, strained, at ease, upset, am presently worrying over possible misfortunes, satisfied, frightened, uncomfortable, self-confident, nervous, jittery, indecisive, relaxed, content, worried, confused, steady and pleasant) where people rate their anxiety from one (not at all) to four (very much so), and scores range from 20 to 80. For example, low anxiety is 20 to 37, moderate anxiety is 38 to 44, and high anxiety is 45 to 80. Assessment will be done at two times; first time (before study intervention)15 minutes preoperatively in the holding area as a baseline with recoding systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. Second time; (after study intervention) in the operating room before induction of anesthesia</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative sore throat (POST) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>On arrival in the post anesthesia care unit, the patient is immediately evaluated for the presence of postoperative sore throat (POST); time 0 hour using a standardized scale. The severity of POST is graded on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3; 0 being no sore throat, 1 being mild discomfort (complains only with questioning), 2 being moderate sore throat (complains on their own), and 3 being severe sore throat (change in voice, hoarseness, and throat pain). Evaluations will be recorded at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after surgery. Patients with score ≥2; will be given dexamethasone 4 mg and parecoxib 40 mg.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The post anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurses will assess and document postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) using a Verbal Descriptive Scale, which correlates to visual analog nausea scores, with an objective measure of severity: 0 = no PONV: patient reports no nausea and has had no emesis episodes; 1 = mild PONV: patient reports nausea but declines antiemetic treatment; 2 = moderate PONV: patient reports nausea and accepts antiemetic treatment; and 3 = severe PONV: nausea with any emesis episode (retching or vomiting). The score will be obtained at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after PACU arrival. In the PACU, ondansetron 4 mg IV will be given for score ≥2.</description>
