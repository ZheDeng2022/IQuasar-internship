  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current clinical trial is focused on evaluating the efficacy of rTMS for treatment of&#xD;
      depression in youth and young adults (hereafter called transition aged youth, TAY) with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The motivation to undertake the current efficacy study is&#xD;
      driven by: (1) the substantial impact of depression on TAY with ASD (based on prevalence and&#xD;
      contribution to disability/impairment); (2) lack of evidence-based treatments for depression&#xD;
      in autism (there are no current trials rigorously evaluating any treatment for depression,&#xD;
      i.e., psychotherapeutic, pharmacotherapeutic, brain stimulation); (3) rTMS has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy in non-autistic individuals to improve symptoms of depression and may be better&#xD;
      tolerated in youth than medication treatment; (4) a prior pilot rTMS study focused on&#xD;
      treatment of executive function deficits in autism indicated that high frequency rTMS&#xD;
      delivered using a rigorous randomized control trial (RCT) protocol can be feasibly&#xD;
      implemented in TAY with autism, is well tolerated (mild to moderate adverse effects and low&#xD;
      drop out), and has the potential to improve symptoms of depression.&#xD;

      The investigators will use a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design of bilateral&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation (BL-TBS) to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) administered 5&#xD;
      days per week for 6 weeks (30 sessions). The investigators will recruit n=80, 16-29 year old&#xD;
      participants with autism that do not have co-occurring intellectual disability (ID). In the&#xD;
      current study, the target population will be individuals with autism, without ID who have&#xD;
      co-occurring clinically significant depression. Pre/post treatment MRI will be used to study&#xD;
      mechanisms of treatment response. The investigators will build on their previous pilot rTMS&#xD;
      study in autism with two key innovations. First, the investigators will use theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation (TBS) for depression as opposed to conventional rTMS. TBS is a newer form of rTMS&#xD;
      shown to be non-inferior to conventional rTMS for depression with a similar safety profile.&#xD;
      Tolerance of intermittent TBS (iTBS, delivered at 100% RMT to right DLPFC in ten 9-17&#xD;
      year-olds with ASD) has already been shown in autism in a prior open-label study.&#xD;
      Importantly, TBS can be delivered in a fraction of the time needed for conventional rTMS.&#xD;
      This shorter administration time may be critical for participant retention as sensory&#xD;
      sensitivity is a major feature of autism. A shorter administration also has important&#xD;
      practical implications for future clinical access. The investigators will use BL-TBS based&#xD;
      on: preliminary data of improved antidepressant efficacy with a bilateral (over unilateral)&#xD;
      TBS approach that combines left excitatory with right inhibitory DLPFC stimulation, as well&#xD;
      as findings that bilateral (over unilateral) rTMS may improve suicidal ideation in MDD.&#xD;

    <description>An X100 stimulator with a B65 A/P type coil (Magventure Inc.) will be used with the active coil facing away from the scalp, for sham stimulation. The coil is positioned under MRI guidance using real-time neuronavigation using Brainsight [x,y,z= -38, 44, 26(left), +38, 44, 26 (right). To reproduce the nociceptive qualities of the stimulation, the B65-type stimulation coil - sham side - includes a built in electrical stimulator in the coil connector which &quot;fires&quot; a synchronous electrical pulse along with the TMS stimulus through electrodes mounted on the forehead or near the area of stimulation, to generate auditory and somatosensory (vibration) stimuli.</description>
