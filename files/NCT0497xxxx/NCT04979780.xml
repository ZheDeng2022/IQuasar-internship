  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active cancer are ~5-fold more likely to develop a venous thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
      than those without. When VTE occurs, cancer patients carry an up to a 3-fold higher rate of&#xD;
      thrombosis recurrence and ~twice the risk of bleeding during anticoagulation. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is critical to utilize anticoagulants that optimize efficacy while minimizing bleeding risk&#xD;
      when treating cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines list direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as an alternative to low&#xD;
      molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment of CAT. The strength-of-recommendation for&#xD;
      DOACs is based on data from multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing them to&#xD;
      LMWHs to treat CAT, with results suggesting DOACs may reduce thrombosis risk but with&#xD;
      potentially more frequent bleeding (particularly in those with certain gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      genitourinary cancers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies evaluating DOACs for CAT treatment have been published, but these&#xD;
      studies have been either single-arm, evaluated cancer subtypes not recommended for DOAC&#xD;
      treatment, were of limited sample size and/or employed heterogeneous definitions of active&#xD;
      cancer. We seek to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban versus LMWH for CAT&#xD;
      treatment in active cancer patients using a large de-identified electronic health record&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective cohort analysis using US OptumÂ® De-Identified EHR data. We will use Optum EHR&#xD;
      (electronic health records) data from November January 1, 2012 through latest available data&#xD;
      (currently September 2020).&#xD;

        The Optum EHR database includes longitudinal patient-level medical record data for ~91+&#xD;
        million patients seen at ~700+ hospitals and ~7,000+ clinics across the US. The study&#xD;
        population of interest will be patients with cancer, admitted to the hospital, emergency&#xD;
        department or observation unit for acute DVT and/or PE on or after January 1, 2013 (to&#xD;
        correspond with the US availability of rivaroxaban for VTE treatment), being treated with&#xD;
        rivaroxaban (or any DOAC in secondary analysis) or LMWH on day 7 post-acute VTE diagnosis&#xD;
        (index date), and have been active in the data set for at least 12-months prior to the&#xD;
        index event (based on the &quot;First Month Active&quot; field) and had at least one provider visit&#xD;
        in the 12-months prior to the acute VTE event (baseline period).&#xD;
