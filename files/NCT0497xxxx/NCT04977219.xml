  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left sided spatial neglect is a common yet potentially debilitating phenomena associated with&#xD;
      right hemisphere stroke. Heilman defines neglect as &quot;the failure to report, respond, or&#xD;
      orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite of a brain lesion that&#xD;
      cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor deficits&quot;. Numerous studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the impact of spatial neglect in right hemisphere stroke patients on both rehabilitation&#xD;
      outcomes, and subsequent functioning in the community. Given the highly significant negative&#xD;
      impact of spatial neglect, numerous treatment approaches have been attempted, yet most lack&#xD;
      evidence in terms of efficacy. One promising exception has been prism adaptation training&#xD;
      (PAT), which several recent reviews reported improved independence as a benefit of this&#xD;
      treatment, both in terms of ameliorating the severity of neglect and demonstrating&#xD;
      generalization to important functional behaviors. Still, much remains unknown regarding PAT,&#xD;
      and not all studies have shown positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital, a number of providers have added PAT to the standard&#xD;
      PT, OT and speech that stroke patients receive during their inpatient stay. As part of a&#xD;
      process improvement initiative the investigators identified 57 patients that received PAT&#xD;
      training between June 2016 and September of 2019. The investigators propose a retrospective&#xD;
      case-control study examining the impact of PAT treatment on the rehabilitation outcomes for&#xD;
      these patients. Outcome variables to be assessed include the measures of spatial neglect&#xD;
      (Catherine Bergego Scale), functional independence measures (FIM), length of hospitalization&#xD;
      and discharge destination. The investigators hypothesize that patients who received 4 or more&#xD;
      PAT sessions during their inpatient rehabilitation stay will show improvements both in&#xD;
      measures of neglect and functional independence as a result of this treatment.&#xD;
