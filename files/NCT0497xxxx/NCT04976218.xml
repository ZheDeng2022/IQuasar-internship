  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor modified T (CART) cell therapy has been identified as a&#xD;
      breakthrough therapy in hematologic malignancies. However, CART cell therapy yielded no&#xD;
      satisfactory efficacy data in the study of solid tumors. One of major challenges is the&#xD;
      complicated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors. It has been&#xD;
      reported that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the major regulatory factors in&#xD;
      the TME. In this study, we construct CAR-EGFR-TGFβR-KO T cell by knocking out TGF-β receptor&#xD;
      Ⅱ through CRISPR/Cas9 in order to study the anti-tumor activities and safety profiles of&#xD;
      CAR-EGFR-TGFβR-KO T cell in advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer.&#xD;

      Chimeric antigen receptor modified T (CART) cell therapy has been identified as a&#xD;
      breakthrough therapy in hematologic malignancies. Different from the promising efficacy in&#xD;
      leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma, however, CART cell therapy yielded no satisfactory&#xD;
      efficacy data in the study of solid tumors. One of major challenges is the complicated&#xD;
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors. It has been reported that&#xD;
      transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the major regulatory factors in the TME, which&#xD;
      plays a key role in promoting tumor initiation, metastasis, and suppressing anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity. In this phase Ⅰstudy, we plan to construct CAR-EGFR-TGFβR-KO T cell by knocking out&#xD;
      TGF-β receptor Ⅱ through CRISPR/Cas9 in order to study the anti-tumor activities and safety&#xD;
      profiles of CAR-EGFR-TGFβR-KO T cell in the treatment of advanced unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
