  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      DZ-002 and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of DZ-002 administered on a weekly schedule in patients with solid tumors. Pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and the anti-tumor activity of DZ-002 will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, first-in-human, Phase 1, safety, PK and pharmacodynamic study of&#xD;
      DZ-002 in patients with solid tumors who have failed standard therapies. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 phases, a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase will first determine the MTD and/or RP2D of DZ-002 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancers. Subsequently, the MTD and/or RP2D will be investigated in 2 expansion&#xD;
      treatment groups of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Patients who are determined to be eligible, based on Screening assessments, will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and will receive their first dose of study therapy on Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
      All patients will receive DZ-102 administered as a weekly intravenous (IV) infusion on days&#xD;
      1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. The dose of DZ-002 will be dependent on the cohort in&#xD;
      which the patient is enrolled.&#xD;
