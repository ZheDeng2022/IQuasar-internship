      The aim of our study is to compare the effects of face-to-face and internet-based BBAT in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Face-to-face and internet-based CFT have superiority over each other in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: In patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome, face-to-face and internet-based CFT&#xD;
      have no superiority over each other.&#xD;

&#xD;
      H0: Face-to-face and internet-based CFT have superiority over each other in patients&#xD;

&#xD;
      H1: In patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome, face-to-face and internet-based CFT&#xD;
      have no superiority over each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigation of the effects of face-to-face and internet-based BBAT on functional&#xD;
           disability, pressure pain threshold, body awareness, posture, pain intensity, trunk&#xD;
           position sense, postural control, balance, sleep quality, quality of life and&#xD;
           inflammation level in patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of the effects of face-to-face and internet-based BBAT on functional&#xD;
           disability, pressure pain threshold, body awareness, posture, pain intensity, trunk&#xD;
           position sense, postural control, balance, sleep quality, quality of life and&#xD;
           inflammation level in patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome&#xD;
