  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to investigate strategies that may improve patient's knowledge of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes during reproductive age and improve knowledge and engagement in self-care&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

      Our Promoting REproductive Planning, And REadiness in Diabetes (PREPARED) strategy will&#xD;
      utilize health information and consumer technologies to 'hardwire' preconception care and&#xD;
      promote diabetes self-management among reproductive-aged, adult women with T2DM in primary&#xD;
      care. Specifically, PREPARED will leverage electronic health record (EHR) technology at&#xD;
      clinic visits to: [1] promote medication reconciliation and safety, [2] prompt&#xD;
      patient-provider preconception counseling and reproductive planning, and [3] deliver low&#xD;
      literacy print tools to reinforce counseling and promote goal-setting for diabetes self-care&#xD;
      activities. Post-visit, a widely-available text messaging platforms will be used to: [4]&#xD;
      encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors through goal-setting and daily reminders. Our&#xD;
      randomized trial will assess the effectiveness and fidelity of a technology-based strategy to&#xD;
      promote preconception care and diabetes self-management among women with type 2 diabetes in&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of PREPARED, compared to usual care, to improve patient: a)&#xD;
      knowledge of reproductive risks associated with T2DM and recommended self-care activities b)&#xD;
      engagement in self-care behaviors, including: i) diet, ii) physical activity, iii) adherence&#xD;
      to diabetes medications; and use of iv) folic acid, and v) most or moderately effective&#xD;
      contraception, when indicated; and c) clinical measures, including hemoglobin A1c, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and LDL cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess whether PREPARED reduces disparities in the above outcomes versus usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Evaluate the fidelity of PREPARED to prompt medication reconciliation and&#xD;
      preconception counseling, and to deliver patient education and post-visit support of diabetes&#xD;
      self-care behaviors.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We will use a questionnaire, developed by our team and the scientific literature, to evaluate patient knowledge of reproductive risks and recommended health behaviors for women with type 2 diabetes. It includes items assessing knowledge of pregnancy planning, reproductive risks, and desired diabetes self-care behaviors. The number of correct answers (0 to 20) is summed and expressed as percentage correct (0-100%). Higher scores indicate greater knowledge.</description>

    <description>Usual care includes: 1) no specific materials to promote medication reconciliation, reproductive planning, or patient education on diabetes self-management within the context of preconception care, 2) variable physician preconception counseling without any EHR notifications or counseling support; and 3) no specific patient support or prompts to promote healthy behaviors post-visits.</description>

    <intervention_name>Medication Reconciliation (MedRec) Tool</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive a print MedRec tool, generated via the EHR, which includes a list of medications prescribed according to the patient record. Patients are asked to review this list, to add/remove drugs to reflect actual use, to note how they are taking each medication, and to describe any concerns.</description>

    <description>During the clinic visit, an automated, EHR alert will notify the provider that the patient is a woman of reproductive age with T2DM and should receive counseling on the importance of glycemic control, the use of contraception until glycemic control is achieved, and the benefits of folic acid.</description>

    <description>When patients leave an encounter, they will receive a patient-friendly educational material (a.k.a. the PREPSheet) that reviews potential risks of pregnancy in the context of T2DM and highlights the importance of: 1) achieving glycemic control through diabetes self-care, 2) using effective contraception until glycemic control is achieved and pregnancy is desired, 3) discussing medication use with a provider if planning or becoming pregnant, and 4) taking folic acid daily to reduce increased risk of neural tube defects.</description>
