    <description>Definisse™ free floating threads will be used with the Soft Tissue Reshaping-2 (STR-2) Technique, to reposition the tissue of the malar area.&#xD;
It is to be used for the face and neck. The thread presents a central area, free of barbs, and two distal areas with barbs. The 12 cm thread will be used in this study.&#xD;
Definisse™ double needle thread (12 cm) that is equipped with barbs in the intermediate section, while the side and the central sections are smooth. The thread ends with two straight cut edge needles 10 cm long Definisse™ double needle threads will be used with the Jawline Reshaping (JR) Technique, to reshape the frame of the jawline, lifting the lower face. This is to be used for the face and the neck. The thread ends with two straight cut edge needles The 12 cm thread will be used in this study.</description>
