  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even if hospital alcohol detoxifications are frequent in France, their&#xD;
      caracteristicscharacteristics remain unknown. The investigators aim to describe the clinical&#xD;
      and paraclinical caracteristicscharacteristics of their patients, their length and&#xD;
      geographical repartition, etc… The investigators also aim to evaluate factors associated with&#xD;
      longer stays or ulterior re-hospitalization for the same reason. Finally, The investigators&#xD;
      aim to compare the stays by facility type.&#xD;

      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the consequences of excessive alcohol use are one of the primary reasons for&#xD;
      hospitalization. When stopping the substance, patients with an alcohol use disorder can&#xD;
      suffer from a potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal syndrome. To mitigate these risks, a&#xD;
      withdrawal under medical supervision is possible, either in an outpatient setting or in&#xD;
      hospital, where the detoxification can be programmed or imposed. In the course of an alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patient's life, re-drinking is not exceptional and the patient may undergo several&#xD;
      withdrawals during his or her life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric pathologies, especially anxiety and depression, are more frequent in these&#xD;
      patients than in the rest of the population, just as can be somatic pathologies.e. Withdrawal&#xD;
      accidents, represented by comital seizures and delirium tremens, can be critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital detoxifications, studies do not show any benefit in continuing the stay beyond 10&#xD;
      days, except in the case of somatic or psychiatric complication. However, little information&#xD;
      is available on the average length of stay for hospital alcohol detoxification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although alcohol dependence issues are very frequent and the resulting withdrawals are&#xD;
      relatively common and associated with numerous comorbidities, little data exists at a&#xD;
      national level in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to describe these hospital detoxifications: course, duration,&#xD;
      frequency and clinical and paraclinical characteristics of the patients. We also wish to&#xD;
      analyze which characteristics are associated with longer stays or re-hospitalization and to&#xD;
      compare the care according to the facility type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To describe the clinical, paraclinical, and stay characteristics of hospital alcohol&#xD;
      detoxification in France&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the regional distribution of hospital alcohol detoxification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether certain clinical characteristics are associated with a longer&#xD;
           hospital stays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether certain clinical characteristics are associated with subsequent&#xD;
           re-hospitalization for the same reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the characteristics of patient stays by type of facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this descriptive observational study using pre-existing data accessed via the PMSI&#xD;
      (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information), we will use all hospital stays from&#xD;
      2011 to 2020 for alcohol detoxification in France, both in public and private settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each hospital stay will be collected the length, the antecedents of hospital alcohol&#xD;
      detoxification, clinical and psychiatric comorbidities, withdrawals complication, alcohol use&#xD;
      complication, further examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will describe the stays using median and quartiles for continuous variables and number and&#xD;
      percentage for dichotomous variables. For secondary objectives, we will use a multivariate&#xD;
      linear regression model if the length of stay is normal, an ordinal regression model&#xD;
      otherwise. The characteristics of the stays will be compared regarding the type of facility&#xD;
      using univariate comparative tests: Chi² or Fisher for dichotomous variables and Student or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney for continuous variables.&#xD;
