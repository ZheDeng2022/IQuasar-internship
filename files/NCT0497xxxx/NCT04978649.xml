    <textblock>
      Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in high-risk hypertensive individuals reduces major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) and renal events. Diabetic patients with hypertension benefit from BP&#xD;
      lowering treatment. The present trial, IPAD-CKD in brief, is a randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      parallel-designed, multicenter study involving nearly 5322 patients to be recruited over&#xD;
      three years and to be followed up for a median of four years and a half. IPAD-CKD tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that antihypertensive medications in adults with type 2 diabetes, whose seated BP&#xD;
      120-139 mm Hg systolic and below 90 mm Hg diastolic, results in 20% difference in the&#xD;
      incidence of major renal events. During follow-up for participants in the intensive group,&#xD;
      the sitting systolic pressure should be decreased to below 120 mm Hg, by titration and&#xD;
      combination of the double-blind study medications of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker&#xD;
      Allisartan (240 mg/day), a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day),&#xD;
      and/or other medications if necessary. For those in the standard group, the sitting systolic&#xD;
      pressure should be monitored and controlled below 140 mm Hg.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The IPAD-CKD trial is a randomized, open-label, parallel-designed, multicenter study. 5322&#xD;
      patients will be recruited over three years with a median follow up of 4.5 years. IPAD tests&#xD;
      the hypothesis that intensive antihypertensive medical therapy in adult patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, whose seated BP ranges from 120 to 139 mm Hg systolic and &lt; 90 mm Hg diastolic,&#xD;
      results in 20% reduction in the incidence of major renal events (the primary endpoint), a&#xD;
      composite of renal failure and proteinuria progression. Secondary endpoints of this study&#xD;
      include: renal failure ; proteinuria progression; proteinuria reversion; end stage renal&#xD;
      disease; cardiovascular-cause mortality; MI; hospitalization for HF; stroke;hospitalization&#xD;
      for unstable angina; all-cause mortality;development of diabetic retinopathy that needs&#xD;
      interventional operation; peripheral arterial diseases; new on-set atrial fibrillation or&#xD;
      flutter; cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the study include T2DM patients aged between 45 and 79 years within&#xD;
      the aforementioned BP ranges. For participants in the intensive group, the sitting systolic&#xD;
      BP should decrease to &lt; 120 mm Hg, using titration and combination of study medications&#xD;
      consisting of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day) and a&#xD;
      dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and/or other medications if&#xD;
      necessary.For those in the standard group, the sitting systolic pressure should be monitored&#xD;
      and controlled below 140 mm Hg. Across the whole study, 310 primary endpoints are expected to&#xD;
      occur. Interim analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis at the&#xD;
      accumulation of 107 and 214 primary endpoints respectively. At the completion of the trial,&#xD;
      both an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol analysis will be performed.&#xD;
