    <textblock>
      Patient education plays an essential role in patient-centered care as it enhances patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and information comprehension. However, about 40-80% of the information patients&#xD;
      receive from healthcare professionals is forgotten and about half of the information patients&#xD;
      remember is incorrect. To give informed consent, patients must be able to understand and&#xD;
      recall the discussed information correctly. This is especially important in brain tumor&#xD;
      patients, in which different treatment options determine outcome and risks. The goal of&#xD;
      treatment in brain tumors is resection as completely as possible, without damaging healthy&#xD;
      brain tissue. To this end, patients must understand the complex relation of the tumor to&#xD;
      healthy brain tissue. This relation is different in each patient and three-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      in nature. Current two-dimensional visual tools lack the ability to properly display these&#xD;
      complex 3D relations. In this study, we will investigate the effect of the use of 3D models&#xD;
      in patient education, taking into account patient specific factors that might act as&#xD;
      confounders. We will conduct a case control, multi-center study in the Radboud University&#xD;
      Medical Center (Radboudumc) Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC). Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the control group until inclusion for the control group is completed (n=30),&#xD;
      after which patients will be enrolled in the intervention group (n=30). Patients will be&#xD;
      cognitively tested using the Amsterdam Cognition Scale (ACS). After the consultation with&#xD;
      their neurosurgeon, patients will be asked to fill out two questionnaires, consisting of two&#xD;
      parts (patient experiences and information recall), one week apart.&#xD;

      Objectives The main goal of this project is to evaluate the role of 3D models on different&#xD;
      aspects of patient education (patient experiences and information recall) in patients with&#xD;
      brain tumors by comparing these to the use of standard 2D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. A&#xD;
      secondary goal is to gain more insight into the experiences of the close ones of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population We will conduct a case control, multi-center study in the Radboud University&#xD;
      Medical Center (Radboudumc) Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC). Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the control group until inclusion for the control group is completed (n=30),&#xD;
      after which patients will be enrolled in the intervention group (n=30). The control group&#xD;
      will consist of patients who will be informed using MR images during pre-operative&#xD;
      consultations. The intervention group will be informed using personalized, life-size 3D&#xD;
      models during pre-operative consultations. Inclusion time is estimated to be around 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Previous studies on this topic are scarce. In our experimental study on this&#xD;
      subject [Sezer et al. 2020], we found an improvement of 5% (minimum expected difference, D)&#xD;
      in information recall when using 3D models compared to 2D models. The standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      for information recall based on this study is approximately 5. With a significance criterion&#xD;
      of 0.05 and power of 0.90 we calculated a total sample size of 42. For this study, however,&#xD;
      we expect to find a smaller effect size due to the confounding factors (cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, emotional status) which were eliminated in our experimental study in healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore we want to enroll 30 patients in each group (total sample size 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Eligible patients will be asked to participate by their clinician or nurse&#xD;
      practitioner who will they will receive an information letter and informed consent&#xD;
      (attachment E1.1). The researcher will contact the patient to officially collect the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Afterwards, the researcher will send out the link to the questionnaires&#xD;
      collecting the baseline characteristics, emotional status questionnaire (HADS) and the ACS.&#xD;
      The patient will be instructed to finish these questionnaires before the pre-operative&#xD;
      consultation. Pre-operative preparation will be the same for the control and intervention&#xD;
      group. The only difference will be the visual tool used in the pre-operative consult.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patient will be called by the researcher on the same or following day. A link&#xD;
      will be sent out with the questionnaires on experiences, information recall and chosen&#xD;
      treatment for the brain tumor. All questionnaires will be collected through Castor EDC ©&#xD;
      2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will also be asked to fill out the questionnaire on information recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pre-operative consultation, we will ask the participant whether we can contact&#xD;
      their close one. After reading the information letter and signing the informed consent the&#xD;
      close one will receive the online questionnaires testing information recall and experiences.&#xD;
      Both questionnaires will be collected through Castor EDC © 2019.&#xD;
