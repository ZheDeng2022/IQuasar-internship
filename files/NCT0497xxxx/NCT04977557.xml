      Abstract Background: Thiamine deficiency related disorders are increasingly being reported in&#xD;
      countries where polished rice is the main dietary constituents and diet is not balanced in&#xD;
      calorie, protein and micronutrients contents. Thiamine deficiency often associated with a&#xD;
      sensory-motor neuropathy (dry beriberi) without Wernicke's encephalopathy and cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of our study will be to evaluate the efficacy of thiamine in&#xD;
      patients with clinically suspected dry beriberi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be a prospective, open labeled, self-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      (quasi-experimental study) carried out in the Neurology and Medicine Ward of Chittagong&#xD;
      Medical College Hospital from July 2018 to June 2019. Fifty-five (55) patients of suspected&#xD;
      dry beriberi will be recruited as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients will be&#xD;
      given 200mg IV Thiamine Hydrochloride per day for 1 week, then oral Tab. Thiamine 100mg twice&#xD;
      daily for remaining 11week. They will be evaluated clinically before treatment and followed&#xD;
      up at the end of 1 week, 6 week and 12 week after treatment. Assessment will be done by some&#xD;
      clinical parameters like leg swelling, muscle cramp, muscle power, squat test, sensory&#xD;
      impairments, deep tendon reflexes and by Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) Score.&#xD;
      Pre and post test treatment data will be recorded in a pre-designed case record form. To&#xD;
      determine whether any o the difference between pretreatment and post treatment values were&#xD;
      statistically significant or not, either Friedman's test or Cochran's Q test will be used.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed with SPSS windows version 23 and statistical significance will be&#xD;
      defined as P&lt;0.05 and confidence interval will be set at 95% level. Our study result is&#xD;
      likely to sensitize the health professionals of this region about this neglected health issue&#xD;
      by increasing awareness of the clinical spectrum of Thiamine Deficiency related Peripheral&#xD;
      Neuropathy.&#xD;

      This Self-controlled Clinical Trial will be conducted in Department of Neurology and&#xD;
      Department of Medicine of Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) during July 2018 to June&#xD;
      2019. A total of 55 patients of possible beriberi will be included based on inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients with isolated cardiac/wet beriberi and with other known causes of&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy such as Diabetic, hereditary, Demyelinating (GBS, CIDP), metabolic&#xD;
      (hepatic/renal impairment), history of intake of drugs (e.g. INH, Ethambutol, Phenytoin,&#xD;
      Metronidazole, Dapsone etc.) and toxins exposure (As ,Organo-phosphate Compound, Pb ,Hg&#xD;
      except alcohol) were excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational Definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors: Imbalanced diet (diet poor in thiamine/rich in carbohydrate or anti-thiamine&#xD;
      factors), malnutrition, alcoholism, Gastro-Intestinal surgery, chronic diarrhoea, chronic&#xD;
      vomiting, pregnancy or history of recent delivery, chronic, diuretics use, renal dialysis,&#xD;
      total parenteral nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible/suspected neuritic (dry) beriberi: Risk factors + at least 2 of the following signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle weakness of upper and or lower limb (less than grade 5 power in MRC scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive sensory symptoms (burning, tingling or pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective sensory deficit (pain, touch, position, vibration sense )&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absent or reduced deep tendon reflexes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Positive squat test (unable to rise after squatting without help)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Leg swelling Probable neuritic (dry) beriberi: Above symptoms recovered after thiamine&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Procedure: After selection of subjects, detailed history, clinical&#xD;
      examination and all other Information regarding sociodemographic and clinical factors of&#xD;
      neuritic beriberi will be taken in a prescribed case record form. Relevant investigations&#xD;
      (CBC, Peripheral Blood Flim (PBF), Serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, Liver function test,&#xD;
      fasting &amp; 2 hour after breakfast sugar. HbA1C, TSH, serum Vitamin B12, Chest X ray, ECG,&#xD;
      Echocardiography, CSF study, Nerve Conduction Study will be performed to exclude differential&#xD;
      diagnoses. Then therapeutic trial of Inj. Thiamine will be given IV for 1st week (200mg IV&#xD;
      daily) then orally (tab. Thiamin 100mg bd) for 11 weeks. Patients will be followed up after&#xD;
      1, 6 and 12 week to see the response on the basis of some clinical parameters and Overall&#xD;
      Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Continuous data will be reported as the means Â± SD or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range. Qualitative or categorical data will be described as frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions. The intention to treat analysis (ITT) analysis will be used to determine the&#xD;
      statistical significance. Missing values will be replaced by the series means for this&#xD;
      purpose. To determine whether any of the difference between pretreatment and post treatment&#xD;
      values are statistically significant or not, either Friedman's test or Cochran's Q test will&#xD;
      be used. Former test compares the quantitative variables and non-dichotomous qualitative&#xD;
      variables and the later test compares the dichotomous qualitative/categorical variables.&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be defined as P &lt; 0.05 and confidence interval will be set at&#xD;
      95% level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables under study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable: Treatment response will be measured by Overall Neuropathy&#xD;
      Limitation Scale (ONLS) score before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Variables: Comparison and Assessment of clinical features at presentation&#xD;
      and after treatment: leg swelling, muscle cramp, muscle power (MRC grading), deep tendon&#xD;
      reflexes, sensory impairments (tingling /burning /pain/ touch/ position /vibration), squat&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has received approval from Ethical Review Committee of Chittagong Medical College&#xD;
      and written informed concent.will be taken from all participants.&#xD;
