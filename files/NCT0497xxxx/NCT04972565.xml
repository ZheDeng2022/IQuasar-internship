  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) and Hypermobility Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorders (HSD) often experience dyspnea. Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) has been shown to&#xD;
      improve dyspnea and respiratory muscle function; however, the impact of IMT in combination&#xD;
      with whole-body exercise training on respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea, and daily function&#xD;
      remains unknown. The objectives of this research are i) to evaluate dyspnea, respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength and function, ventilatory parameters, and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQL) in individuals with hEDS and HSD compared to healthy age and sex-matched controls, ii)&#xD;
      to explore the contributors to dyspnea during exercise with a specific focus on respiratory&#xD;
      muscle structure and function in hEDS and HSD patients and healthy controls, and iii) to&#xD;
      assess whether the combination of IMT and whole-body exercise training will be more effective&#xD;
      than whole-body exercise training alone in improving participant outcomes in hEDS and HSD&#xD;
      participants. It is hypothesized that i) hEDS and HSD participants will have lower&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, higher peripheral airway resistance, lower HRQL, and higher&#xD;
      anxiety and depression levels compared to healthy controls, ii) the contributors to increased&#xD;
      exercise induced dyspnea will include decreased respiratory muscle strength, increased airway&#xD;
      resistance, and greater prefrontal cortical neural activity, and iii) the combination of IMT&#xD;
      and whole-body exercise training will be superior to whole-body training alone for improving&#xD;
      dyspnea, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, aerobic capacity, HRQL, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-four hEDS and HSD participants will be recruited from the University Health Network&#xD;
      (Toronto, Canada). Participants will have baseline evaluations of dyspnea, pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests (i.e., oscillometry, spirometry, and lung volumes), respiratory muscle structure and&#xD;
      function (i.e., diaphragm ultrasound and respiratory muscle strength), HRQL, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. Symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be utilized to quantify&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea using the 10-item Borg dyspnea scale, 18-point qualitative dyspnea&#xD;
      assessment scale, peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2), and assessment of dynamic ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters. Neural activity in the pre-frontal cortex will be measured during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing via functional near-infrared spectroscopy. These baseline measures will be&#xD;
      compared to 17 age and sex-matched healthy controls. After baseline assessments, hEDS and HSD&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of the following groups: i) Usual Care plus IMT: 8&#xD;
      weeks of whole-body exercises (standard care provided to hEDS and HSD patients at the&#xD;
      University Health Network) plus a concurrent IMT intervention 5 times per week); ii) Usual&#xD;
      Care: 8 weeks of whole-body exercises (as outlined above). After four and eight weeks,&#xD;
      participants will have repeat assessments as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exertional dyspnea is a prevalent and troublesome symptom experienced by individuals living&#xD;
      with hEDS and HSD. This study will provide a better understanding of the underlying&#xD;
      contributors of dyspnea in hEDS and HSD patients, with a focus on respiratory muscle&#xD;
      structure and function, prefrontal cortical neural activity, and ventilatory parameters, both&#xD;
      at rest and with exertion.&#xD;
