  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Abdominal pain, distension, and discomfort are the most frequently seen side&#xD;
      effects after colonoscopy. These side effects can cause physical and mental results and&#xD;
      increased workloads and care costs. Additionally, the satisfaction of the patients with the&#xD;
      colonoscopy process may affect their willingness to undergo repeated colonoscopies in the&#xD;
      future which may be required for the surveillance of colon malignity. Currently, there are no&#xD;
      studies evaluating the effects of abdominal massage on post colonoscopy these abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of post colonoscopy abdominal&#xD;
      massage on abdominal pain, distension, discomfort, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled study. Participants&#xD;
      meeting inclusion criteria will be assigned to intervention and control groups using a random&#xD;
      number generator. Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive abdominal&#xD;
      massages twice a day after colonoscopy, and participants assigned to the control group will&#xD;
      receive only &quot;routine care&quot;. The abdominal pain, distension, discomfort, and satisfaction&#xD;
      levels of the patients will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: New approaches are needed to improve the physiological and psychological health&#xD;
      levels of patients after colonoscopy and help them return to their daily life activities and&#xD;
      social lives faster. The trial will provide valuable evidence to inform clinical application&#xD;
      and help evaluate the effects of the use of the relevant intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain, bloating, and discomfort are the most frequently problems experienced by&#xD;
      patients undergoing colonoscopy. These problems are thought to be caused by several factors&#xD;
      such as the duration of the process, the technical difficulty level of the process,&#xD;
      distension caused by air insufflation, and the expertise level of the endoscopist. These&#xD;
      problems are experienced by approximately a third of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and may&#xD;
      last from a few hours to a few days. In a recent study, 44% of patients were found to&#xD;
      experience such minor side effects 24 hours after colonoscopy, and 23% were found to&#xD;
      experience them after a 30 day follow up. Although these problems are dubbed minor side&#xD;
      effects, they may cause serious results for patients with regard to physical comfort and&#xD;
      mental stress and may necessitate patients to be monitored post colonoscopy and followed up&#xD;
      closely. This may lead to an increase in costs by increasing the length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      nursing care requirements. Additionally, the satisfaction of the patients with the&#xD;
      colonoscopy process may affect their willingness to undergo repeated colonoscopies in the&#xD;
      future which may be required for the surveillance of colon malignity. For these reasons,&#xD;
      decreasing post colonoscopy abdominal pain, distension, and discomfort and increasing patient&#xD;
      satisfaction may increase the acceptance of future colonoscopy screening for colorectal&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies focused on decreasing abdominal symptoms after colonoscopy and increasing patient&#xD;
      comfort and satisfaction have yielded varying results. For example, while some studies have&#xD;
      reported that rectal tube application after colonoscopy reduces pain and increases patient&#xD;
      comfort and satisfaction, in another study, it was determined that rectal tube application&#xD;
      post colonoscopy had no effect on abdominal distension, pain, discomfort, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after the process and 24 hours later. In another study, rectal aspiration&#xD;
      applied right after colonoscopy was found to be more effective in decreasing abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms compared to the application of rectal tubes after colonoscopy. In another study&#xD;
      where total colonic decompression through repeating cecal intubation after colonoscopy was&#xD;
      applied, the method was found to decrease the distension complaints of patients in the early&#xD;
      post colonoscopy period from 59% to 25%. However, in this study, no significant difference&#xD;
      between the groups that did and did not receive decompression with regard to abdominal pain&#xD;
      and distension could be found 24 to 48 hours after the procedure. In yet another study, no&#xD;
      significant difference with regard to pain intensity could be found between the aspiration of&#xD;
      air in the curves of the colon without repeated intubation while the colonoscope was being&#xD;
      taken out and rectal aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal massaging has been shown to help improve symptoms in patients with severe&#xD;
      constipation. In the literature, it has been reported that abdominal massage relaxes the&#xD;
      abdominal muscles and stimulates the excretory activity by supporting the intestine, decrease&#xD;
      discomfort and pain in individuals with abdominal pain related to cramps or flatulence, and&#xD;
      increase the quality of life. Moreover, it is a non-invasive and safe non-pharmacological&#xD;
      method. It has no known side effects and does not require any cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was assumed post-colonoscopy abdominal massage can improve their abdominal&#xD;
      symptoms. However, to date, there is no study evaluating the effects of abdominal massage on&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms after colonoscopy. Therefore, a prospective study was designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the aspect of post-colonoscopy abdominal massage that concerns endoscopy nurses, namely its&#xD;
      effect on abdominal pain, bloating, discomfort and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of post colonoscopy abdominal massage on&#xD;
      abdominal pain, distension, discomfort, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no significant difference between patients receiving abdominal massage post&#xD;
      colonoscopy and those not receiving such an intervention with regard to abdominal pain,&#xD;
      distension, discomfort, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
