  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether a computer-based tutorial as supportive means enhances quality and&#xD;
      efficiency of the informed consent process for cataract surgery focussing on the patients'&#xD;
      attitude before and after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informing the patient and obtaining informed consent is one of the major duties physicians&#xD;
      perform before starting a medical treatment. The requirements concerning the informed consent&#xD;
      process are high. The amount of information needed to be explained to the patient is growing,&#xD;
      as procedures get more complex and the number of treatment options increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CatInfo tool is a computer-based tutorial about cataract and cataract surgery run on a&#xD;
      handheld device with headphones and presented in an audio-visual fashion. The patient gives&#xD;
      feedback after each chapter using a traffic light system to ensure that the content has been&#xD;
      understood (green - content understood, ready to continue; yellow - questions that require&#xD;
      discussion with the physician and red - repetition of the module required). A printout that&#xD;
      summarizes what the patient has selected after each chapter immediately tells the physician&#xD;
      which topics have been poorly understood or were unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in a randomized triple-masked study that patients using the CatInfo tool&#xD;
      were significantly better informed than patients only having a face-to-face interview.&#xD;
      Satisfaction with the tool was high. This present study has the goal to assess the patients'&#xD;
      attitude before and after surgery using validated questionnaires (decisional conflict scale,&#xD;
      decision regret scale) as well as knowledge. Patients scheduled for their first eye cataract&#xD;
      surgery are randomly allocated to two groups, receiving standard face-to-face informed&#xD;
      consent (control group) or additionally using the interactive CatInfo tool (study group).&#xD;
      Scores between the groups are compared.&#xD;

    <description>To assess the decisional confidence after the face-to-face informed consent discussion patients are asked to complete the decisional conflict scale questionnaire. In this study it is calculated as decisional confidence, where 0 represents the lowest decisional confidence and 100 the highest.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>One month after surgery the patients' satisfaction with their decision is evaluated with the decision regret scale (DRS) questionnaire via telephone interview. A score of 0 means no regret, a score of 100 high regret.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of pre-assessment visit (1 week before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the knowledge concerning cataract surgery patients are asked to complete a multiple-choice questionnaire concerning cataract surgery. The number of correctly answered questions are summed up. The scale ranges from a minimum of 0 points to a maximum of 19 points. The more points the better the patient's knowledge about cataract and cataract surgery.</description>
