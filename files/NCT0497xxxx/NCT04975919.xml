  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of venetoxlax in combination with decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (relapsed)&#xD;
      or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax and&#xD;
      decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cedazuridine may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      venetoxlax in combination with decitabine and cedazuridine may help to control acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (complete remission [CR], complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete count recovery [CRi], MLFS and partial response [PR]) of 10-days decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine (oral decitabine) and venetoclax in patients with refractory/relapsed acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the duration of response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the number of patients who achieve a hematologic improvement (HI) in&#xD;
      platelets, hemoglobin, or ANC and the number of patients who achieve &gt; 50% reduction in&#xD;
      blasts on therapy with venetoclax/10-day oral decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety of venetoclax in combination with 10-day oral decitabine in&#xD;
      patients with refractory/ relapsed AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the number of patients who transition towards stem cell transplantation upon&#xD;
      achieving response with the combination venetoclax/10-day oral decitabine regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the incidence of infectious complications per cycle with venetoclax in&#xD;
      combination with 10-day oral decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate global gene expression profiles, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), BH3&#xD;
      profiling and other potential prognostic markers to explore predictors of antitumor activity&#xD;
      and/or resistance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine and cedazuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve CR/CRi during consolidation/maintenance may receive decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine PO QD on days 1-5. Patients also receive venetoclax PO QD on days 1-28 of cycle&#xD;
      1 and days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
