  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VISAGE-ONCO study is a qualitative transversal study aiming to identify and describe&#xD;
      processes and mechanisms that explain in cancerology the feelings and experience of patients&#xD;
      and health professionals with regard to the possibility of having access to secondary&#xD;
      findings generated by the use High-speed exome sequencing . Semi-structured interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted with patients and health professionals to answer this aims from 2 situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first situation is in the context of the standard practice for theranostic purposes,&#xD;
      where somatic and constitutional analysis of the various genes involved in carcinogenesis is&#xD;
      carried out systematically in parallel. Patients are informed that the analysis of these&#xD;
      genes may reveal the existence of a genetic predisposition to another type of cancer than the&#xD;
      one for which patients have consulted, with a risk for themselves or their relatives, which&#xD;
      could modify their management. This targeted information on genetic predisposition genes to&#xD;
      cancer is therefore provided as part of standard management for theranostic purposes, but&#xD;
      without any detailed exploration of the reasons why patients wanted to be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second situation is in the framework exome analysis position in the strategy of genetic&#xD;
      redisposition factors identification in early-onset cancer study (EX²TRICAN NCT04141462)&#xD;
      where all the genes identified in human pathology are part of the analysis. Patients have the&#xD;
      possibility of accessing a result concerning a gene that may or may not be linked to a&#xD;
      hereditary cancer risk if patients have ticked off in the consent form the wish to be&#xD;
      informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, two distinct questions arise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That of understanding the wish of patients to be given back actionable data which can be&#xD;
           identified in a fortuitous way within the framework of standard management for&#xD;
           theranostic purposes and in EX²TRICAN, by taking into account the fact that these data&#xD;
           can constitute an opportunity for the patient in terms of management; but patients also&#xD;
           constitute a risk of transmission for they relatives, and a psychological risk by the&#xD;
           anxiety generated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wish to have access - or not - to data which are not actively sought today within&#xD;
           the framework of standard care for theranostic purposes and in EX²TRICAN (genetic&#xD;
           alterations increasing the risk of cardiovascular or metabolic diseases), but which&#xD;
           could be proposed in a systematic way in the future because of their actionable&#xD;
           character.&#xD;
