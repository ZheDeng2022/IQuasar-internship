  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to undertake a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      investigate whether mHealth technology, allowing biometric informed feedback and coaching on&#xD;
      exercise and PA, can be effective in previously sedentary individuals. The overall objective&#xD;
      is to have an evidence-based exercise and PA intervention ready to evaluate in a future RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from Liverpool John Moores University, and other local&#xD;
      office-based businesses. Participants will be randomised to either online exercise resources&#xD;
      only (n=50) or exercise counselling + mHealth (n=50).This is a pilot parallel group,&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial whereby consenting participants will complete baseline testing&#xD;
      (T1) before starting a 12-week exercise intervention supported by online resources only&#xD;
      (online resources intervention) or online resources and a programme of exercise counselling&#xD;
      enhanced with mobile health (mHealth) technology (mHealth intervention). Participants will&#xD;
      repeat baseline assessments (i) 6-weeks into the intervention (T2) and, (ii) immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention (T3). Testing at baseline and following the 12-week intervention will&#xD;
      include changes in physical activity, blood pressure, body composition and glycaemia control&#xD;
      (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have access to online resources throughout the 12-week programme. The&#xD;
      intervention group will be provided with exercise counselling and to support this they will&#xD;
      also be provide with a wristwatch that can monitor everyday activity and their heart rate, a&#xD;
      smartphone app and access to a website. The intervention group will also participate in 4&#xD;
      consultations with an exercise specialist to plan their exercise programme and be updated on&#xD;
      their progress towards physical activity targets. Weekly text message updates will also&#xD;
      provide feedback to the intervention group with participants able to respond to these&#xD;
      updates.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will complete a 12 week mHealth technology assisted exercise counselling intervention. Participants will co-develop a 3-month structured exercise and PA programme, with support from an exercise specialist. All participants will have 4 exercise consultations with their exercise specialist. The intervention will be supported by 3 mHealth elements; 1) a wrist worn fitness watch, 2) a smartphone app for patients, and 3) a coaching website for the exercise specialist. The 3 elements will be synced, allowing data to be transferred between platforms.</description>
