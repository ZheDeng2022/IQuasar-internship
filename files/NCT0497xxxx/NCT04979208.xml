  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 pandemic and its health and societal consequences raise fears of a deterioration&#xD;
      in the management of non-Covid-19 pathologies, particularly those requiring rapid treatment.&#xD;
      These fears relate in particular to strokes and acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), the two&#xD;
      most frequent diseases, for which emergency treatment is a major factor in the vital and&#xD;
      functional prognosis of patients. They are based on activity data from the emergency&#xD;
      services, which have shown a sharp drop in admissions for AMI and strokes at the start of the&#xD;
      pandemic. This drop is interpreted as being partly linked to a tendency for patients to delay&#xD;
      or even give up care, which may be explained by fear of contamination, the desire not to&#xD;
      solicit already overworked healthcare professionals and overload in emergency structures. In&#xD;
      addition, studies have shown that the time required to treat AMI during the pandemic phase in&#xD;
      China has been extended due to the new organizations set up in healthcare institutions in&#xD;
      connection with this major health event. In addition, certain inequalities in access to care,&#xD;
      already identified during the non- pandemic period among AMI and stroke patients, are likely&#xD;
      to be accentuated by the new healthcare organizations set up during the pandemic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are interested in the impact of changes in healthcare utilization and&#xD;
      reorganization within hospitals, related to the Covid-19 pandemic, on the quality of the care&#xD;
      pathway for stroke and AMI patients in the Aquitaine region. The investigators also study the&#xD;
      role of the socio-demographic, socio-economic and geographical characteristics of these&#xD;
      patients as factors of inequality of access to care during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is based on data collected within the Aquitaine Cardio-Neuro-Vascular Registries&#xD;
      (CNV), an exhaustive cohort of stroke and AMI patients treated by a health care institution&#xD;
      in Aquitaine. They are an excellent tool for describing the care pathway and outcomes of&#xD;
      these patients, from the onset of symptoms to the end of the acute episode. An additional&#xD;
      collection is planned to collect all the organizations and activities set up within the&#xD;
      hospitals in Aquitaine. The study period, from January 2019 to August 2020, provides&#xD;
      sufficient time before lockdown and after the date of the end of lockdown, to analyze trends&#xD;
      in the quality of pathways, according to the various reorganizations of the health system and&#xD;
      changes in the use of care linked to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project identifies the reorganizations with the most striking consequences on the quality&#xD;
      of care for patients suffering from non Covid-19 pathologies. It analyzes the changes in the&#xD;
      behaviour of patients and their family and caregivers in their use of care during the&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic and their impact on the care pathways and results. It contributes to the&#xD;
      policy of reducing inequalities in access to care and to the definition of a health strategy&#xD;
      in the event of a major health crisis.&#xD;
