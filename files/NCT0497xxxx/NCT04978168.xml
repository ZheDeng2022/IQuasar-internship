      Determine whether a facilitated local change team intervention improves a probation&#xD;
      organization's client-level medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) outcomes and&#xD;
      implementation outcomes relative to baseline across multiple sites. Determine whether&#xD;
      client-level outcomes are further enhanced by the introduction of Peer Support Services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The purpose is to determine whether a facilitated local change team (LCT)&#xD;
      intervention improves linkage to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and implementation&#xD;
      outcomes, and whether participant-level outcomes are further enhanced by the use of Peer&#xD;
      Support Specialists (PSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: This Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves a pre-post&#xD;
      design (implementation study) followed by a randomized trail of PSS (effectiveness study).&#xD;
      The study is conducted at 7 performance sites in 3 states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Core Implementation Study): The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,&#xD;
      Sustainability (EPIS) framework is used to guide system-change through facilitated LCTs&#xD;
      consisting of probation and community treatment staff who are given a core set of&#xD;
      implementation strategies which are used to conduct a needs assessment and set goals. The&#xD;
      overall objective is to improve linkage to the continuum of evidence-based care for&#xD;
      justice-involved individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Organizational (program-level)&#xD;
      and staff survey are collected at the end of each EPIS stage (baseline Exploration, end of&#xD;
      Preparation, end of Implementation, and 12 months [Sustainability]). Implementation outcomes:&#xD;
      Organizational engagement in MOUD (primary), plus changes in staff knowledge/attitudes and&#xD;
      organizational outcomes (secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Effectiveness Study of PSS): After completing implementation, 680 adults on&#xD;
      probation are randomized to receive PSS vs. treatment as usual (TAU), with assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. This trial tests whether having a trained peer improves&#xD;
      clinical outcomes beyond effects of Core Implementation. Implementation program-level&#xD;
      outcomes include organizational engagement in MOUD use (primary outcome); changes in staff&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes about MOUD, commitment and efficacy, readiness for change;&#xD;
      organizational attitudes for change, commitment and efficacy (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
      Client-level effectiveness outcomes include participant engagement in MOUD (primary outcome),&#xD;
      probation revocation, illicit opioid use, and overdoses (secondary outcomes). Other aims&#xD;
      include identifying barriers and facilitators, and cost-benefit analysis of PSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to test the effectiveness of PSS compared to TAU (agency approach after&#xD;
      implementation) on outcomes of individuals on probation: Engagement in MOUD (primary&#xD;
      effectiveness outcome), probation revocation (secondary), illicit opioid use (secondary), and&#xD;
      overdose (tertiary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to test the effectiveness of EPIS-based Core Implementation Intervention&#xD;
      relative to baseline on engagement in MOUD (primary implementation outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim is to test the effects of the EPIS implementation strategies relative to&#xD;
      baseline on program-level (organizational and staff-level) outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth aim is to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing PSS compared to TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fifth aim is to identify organizational and staff barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      intervention implementation by conducting qualitative interviews with key probation and&#xD;
      community treatment stakeholders who are managing and delivering the MOUD program.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study conducted in two phases. The first recruits as staff/leaders from probation agencies and community treatment agencies. The second phase (which starts after the implementation in the first period is completed) recruits adults on probation and staff of probation agencies. The Core Implementation study (first phase) involves a pre-post design. The effectiveness study (second phase) uses randomized parallel assignment with two arms.&#xD;
The initial Core Implementation study involved four phases: Exploration (baseline), Preparation, Implementation, Sustainability (6- and 12-month follow-ups). The subsequent Effectiveness study starts after the Implementation phase is completed, with its own baseline data and follow-ups up to 12 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>During baseline Exploration, staff organizational surveys are collected. During Preparation, staff focus groups conduct needs assessment with system mapping of linkage points for screening, assessment, and referral, and the agencies/staff involved in these activities. During Implementation, sites use facilitated local change teams (LCT) provided with a core set implementation strategies to facilitate linkages between probation agencies and local community treatment providers. The LCTs identify barriers to change, approaches to overcome barriers, do goal selection using SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, timely) goals and evidence for medications, address stigma, and clarify needs/expectations/roles of probation officers and treatment providers, then choose and implement goals and strategies. Sustainability Phase: Facilitators work with LCTs for 12 months using a written action plan based on goal selection.</description>
