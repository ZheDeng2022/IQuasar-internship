  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to figure out if there are physical factors such as&#xD;
      cognition level, nutrition status, walking speed, and handgrip strength that are associated&#xD;
      with the development of swallowing problems. Investigators want to better understand how&#xD;
      swallowing problems develop in older adults with and without frailty. Identifying factors&#xD;
      that contribute to swallowing problems, can develop therapies in the future to improve&#xD;
      swallowing outcomes for older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will determine the presence and severity of dysphagia in a cohort of older adults based&#xD;
      on clinical frailty phenotype; Aim 2 will examine the effects of frailty status on&#xD;
      physiological measures of swallowing in older adults; and Aim 3 will characterize&#xD;
      relationships among specific functional frailty domains and dysphagia status in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed research will provide a new understanding of the factors that underlie and&#xD;
      contribute to dysphagia across clinical frailty phenotypes. Equipped with this knowledge,&#xD;
      future treatment and management approaches can be developed to proactively identify dysphagia&#xD;
      risk factors in pre-frail and frail individuals so dysphagia can be prevented or adequately&#xD;
      addressed. This work is highly significant due to the large and increasing population of&#xD;
      aging people who often suffer from debilitating swallowing impairments and may benefit from&#xD;
      optimized treatments that can be developed using knowledge gained from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison). A total of about&#xD;
      69 people will participate in this study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dysphagia presence and severity will be examined using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP). Under MBSImP, swallows are assessed via 17 physiologic components pertaining to the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. These individual components are scored from '0' to '5' with higher scores representing greater (worse) impairment within each component. The MBSImP yields total composite scores for the oral and pharyngeal domains as well as an overall impression score which is the worst score across all 17 components.</description>

        69 community-dwelling older adults (23 non-frail, 23 pre-frail, 23 frail) will be recruited&#xD;
        from the UW Health Geriatrics clinics. Participants will attend two research visits. During&#xD;
        the first study visit, a comprehensive assessment of limb function, gait, cognitive, and&#xD;
        nutrition will be performed. Findings from this first session will allow us to calculate a&#xD;
        Fried Frailty Index19 score for each participant and confirm their frailty status&#xD;
        (non-frail, pre-frail, frail). During the second research visit, comprehensive swallowing&#xD;
        assessments and saliva sample collection will occur. Given this is a cross-sectional study,&#xD;
        enrollment will continue until the target of 69 participants (23 per group) is met.&#xD;
