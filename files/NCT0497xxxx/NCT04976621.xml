  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may have wide-ranging&#xD;
      consequences. Post-TBI depression may impede reintegration into the family and community and&#xD;
      lead to lower quality of life and heightened suicide risk. It may also interfere with&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Yet, current treatments for post-TBI depression are based largely on expert&#xD;
      opinion rather than evidence from rigorous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral activation (BA) is a promising intervention for post-TBI depression. It is a brief&#xD;
      behavioral treatment that helps people define goals, create and execute plans to reach them,&#xD;
      and engage in meaningful activities. BA has been tested in clinical trials since the 1970s&#xD;
      and has been shown to reduce or prevent depression in populations with diverse medical&#xD;
      conditions. However, BA has rarely been used or studied for treatment of depression in a TBI&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a study of BA with 40 Veterans with TBI and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in VA outpatient rehabilitation care. One group of Veterans will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive BA plus usual care. The BA program consists of six sessions delivered&#xD;
      over three months at the VA (or Veterans' homes, if preferred) by an occupational therapist&#xD;
      (OT). A second group of Veterans will be randomly assigned to receive usual care. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the feasibility of delivering the BA intervention in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation setting and its acceptability to Veterans and staff. The research team will&#xD;
      also assess participant responses to BA in the outcomes of depressive symptoms, community&#xD;
      reintegration, and quality of life. Study findings will be used to guide the development of a&#xD;
      future study of BA in a larger sample of Veterans with post-TBI depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study and future research may add a powerful clinical tool to rehabilitation services to&#xD;
      lessen or prevent depression in Veterans with TBI. Reducing depression may in turn facilitate&#xD;
      rehabilitation and enhance community reintegration, allowing Veterans to engage more fully in&#xD;
      their families and communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: Nearly 400,000 Veterans have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      since 2000, representing up to 22% of combat casualties. Depression is one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent and serious of TBI sequelae. Post-TBI depression adversely affects rehabilitation,&#xD;
      treatment adherence, community reintegration (CR), quality of life (QOL), social&#xD;
      relationships, and caregiver burden. Yet, post-TBI depression remains under-assessed,&#xD;
      undertreated, and under-studied. No clinical guidelines for post-TBI depression treatment&#xD;
      exist, and current treatment is largely based on expert opinion rather than evidence from&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising therapeutic approach to post-TBI depression is Behavioral Activation (BA), a&#xD;
      brief and pragmatic treatment rigorously tested since the 1970s in clinical trials for&#xD;
      depression in diverse clinical populations. BA helps individuals set goals, create plans, and&#xD;
      engage in activities that improve mood and maintain social connectedness - making it&#xD;
      well-suited to treating depression in a TBI population that struggles to set goals and is&#xD;
      prone to social isolation. BA can accommodate hallmark deficits of TBI such as deficits in&#xD;
      memory, organization, planning, initiation, emotion regulation, and interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning. It can be delivered by professionals routinely available in VA outpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation services (e.g., occupational therapists, nurses, psychologists, social&#xD;
      workers) and, therefore, can be deployed in rehabilitation settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will assess the feasibility of a BA protocol adapted for post-TBI&#xD;
      depression in an outpatient VA rehabilitation setting. Specific study objectives are to: (1)&#xD;
      assess BA's acceptability to Veterans and staff and other feasibility indicies, (2) provide&#xD;
      preliminary evidence of participant response in the outcomes of depressive symptoms, CR, and&#xD;
      QOL at the 3-month follow-up interview, (3) develop the BA protocol and manual to be tested&#xD;
      in a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the future, and (4) explore engagement in&#xD;
      activity as the mechanism that underlies BA intervention effects on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This feasibility study includes a pilot randomized controlled trail to&#xD;
      examine participant response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This feasibility study will enroll 40 male and female Veterans receiving care at&#xD;
      a VAMC Rehabilitation Medicine Service and meeting study criteria for TBI and depression.&#xD;
      Veterans will be randomly assigned to BA plus treatment as usual (TAU) or control (TAU). The&#xD;
      BA program consists of six sessions delivered over 3 months at the VA (or the Veteran's home,&#xD;
      as preferred by Veteran) by an occupational therapist (OT). All Veterans are interviewed at&#xD;
      baseline before randomization and 3 months later by a blinded interviewer. Both interviews&#xD;
      assess Veterans' depressive symptoms, CR, and QOL, using standardized instruments.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed in six domains: acceptability to Veterans and clinic staff;&#xD;
      process (recruitment, refusal, and retention rates; study completion; eligibility criteria;&#xD;
      and number of sessions attended); practicality (resources and constraints imposed by the&#xD;
      setting); safety; participant comprehension of interviews and the intervention; and research&#xD;
      burden (length of interviews, participant fatigue, and emotional distress). After the&#xD;
      follow-up interview, phone interviews with BA participants and with clinic staff will be&#xD;
      conducted to capture acceptability and their experience with BA. These qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative methods are designed to test the feasibility of a future RCT, identify the&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementation of BA in the rehabilitation setting, and describe&#xD;
      Veterans' experiences with BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/Significance: This study and line of research has the potential to advance knowledge&#xD;
      by identifying a feasible and efficacious approach to preventing and/or mitigating depression&#xD;
      among Veterans with TBI, a clinical population at high risk for depression and its sequelae.&#xD;
      Findings will be used to inform the development of a future RCT powered to test BA's efficacy&#xD;
      in a larger sample of Veterans with post-TBI depression.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>At the baseline interview, the interviewer will review the study, answer questions, obtain Informed Consent, conduct screening for eligibility, and conduct the baseline interview. The interview will be conducted in the rehabilitation clinic office or home. Veterans who do not wish to continue with the study after the baseline interview will not be randomized.&#xD;
Within 48 hours of the baseline interview, eligible veterans will be randomized using the method of random permuted blocks and concealed allocation. Those randomized to BA will be contacted within 5 days by the interventionist and scheduled for the first session. They will receive the 6-session BA intervention (as well as treatment as usual [TAU]). Control participants will receive TAU only (which may include current medical and mental health treatments.) Three months after Baseline, a blinded interviewer will conduct the follow-up interview in person or on the phone with all veterans.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Depressive symptom scores on CES-D</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured by The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). CES-D is a well-established 20-item screening instrument that shows good psychometric properties in TBI populations. It will be administered at the Baseline interview and Follow-up interview (at 3 months). It uses a Likert-type scale from 0 to 3. The total score is the sum across all 20 items. Total scores may range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Community reintegration will be measured by the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O-17). This 17-item tool is an objective measure of social functioning, developed from 3 existing community reintegration measures. It will be administered at the Baseline interview and Follow-up interview (at 3 months). It uses a 6-point Likert scale from 0 to 5. A mean score is computed. Mean Scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating better community reintegration.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life in TBI scores on QoL-TBI instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life in TBI will be measured by The QoL-TBI instrument. This instrument is a 37-item patient-centered measure that captures the individual's perception of his/her health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in cognition, self-care, daily life and autonomy, social relationships, emotions, and physical problems. It will be administered at the Baseline interview and Follow-up interview (at 3 months). It uses a 5-point scale from &quot;0 - Not at all&quot; to &quot;4- Very.&quot; Scores are summed, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the intervention rated by the interventionist</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability is measured by the Acceptance/Receipt Scale and is completed by the interventionist at the last intervention session. This is an 18-item tool with Likert scale response formats from 0 to 4. A mean score will be obtained and range from 0 to 4. Our criterion for acceptability is that at least 75% should score at 3.0 or higher.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Veteran Acceptability/Satisfaction with the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability/Satisfaction with the intervention will be measured with the Acceptability/Satisfaction Scale and is completed by the participants who received Behavioral Activation after the last intervention session. This is a 12 item tool with a Likert scale response format from 0 to 4. A mean score will be obtained and range from 0 to 4. Our criterion for satisfaction is that at least 75% should score 3.0 or higher.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Recruitment</measure>
    <time_frame>16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recruitment is considered part of the process domain of feasibility. Recruitment will be measured by the percentage of veterans eligible for the study among those screened and the percentage willing to participate among those screened. Among those screened, our criterion for recruitment is that 50% or more will be eligible for the study and that at least 30% will be willing to participate.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention is considered part of the process domain of feasibility. Retention will be measured by the number of sessions completed over the total number of sessions (6). Among those who are enrolled, our criterion for retention is that 75% will attend 4 or more sessions and 75% will complete the study.</description>
