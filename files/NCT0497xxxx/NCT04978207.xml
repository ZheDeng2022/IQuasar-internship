    <textblock>
      This 2-arm clustered, randomized community trial will test a multilevel, COVID-19 testing and&#xD;
      linkage to care (eg, health insurance, medical appointments, community resources, contact&#xD;
      tracing) intervention against a nontailored, attention-control condition on uptake of&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing with adult African American church-affiliated members at 6 months. Contact&#xD;
      tracing approval (beliefs and participation contact tracing) and COVID19 prevention behaviors&#xD;
      will also be examined. Findings from this study could provide a theory-based, multilevel&#xD;
      model for delivering scalable, wide-reaching COVID-19 testing and linkage to care services,&#xD;
      including contact tracing, by supporting African American faith leaders with&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate, easy-to-use tools and health agency partnerships.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a two-arm clustered randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to fully test a multilevel, religiously-tailored African American church-based COVID19&#xD;
      testing and linkage to care (LTC) intervention (Tx) vs a nontailored multilevel,&#xD;
      attention-control (AC) condition on COVID19 testing uptake (primary outcome) at 6 mos. LTC,&#xD;
      contact tracing approval (CTA) and prevention behaviors (exploratory secondary outcomes) will&#xD;
      also be examined with participants, adult African American church and community members.&#xD;
      Churches will be matched on attendance size and denomination, and randomly assigned to Tx or&#xD;
      AC. Previous HIV testing and diabetes prevention studies conducted in African American&#xD;
      churches, whereby the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Socioecological Model will guide&#xD;
      intervention design and delivery, will be adapted for this project. Using a community engaged&#xD;
      approach, these models provide a theoretically-based, ecologically-expanded TBP framework for&#xD;
      intervention delivery through multilevel church outlets to increase reach, dose, and impact.&#xD;
      Sixteen churches (45 church members and 15 community members using outreach services per&#xD;
      church; N= 960 total) have been project to be required to detect significant increases in&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained church health workers will deliver the Tx intervention during existing, multilevel&#xD;
      church activities using a culturally-tailored COVID19 Tool Kit inclusive of digital tools&#xD;
      consisting of: a) individual self-help materials and automated/tailored text messages; b)&#xD;
      virtual supportive group seminars about COVID19; c) virtual/in-person church services with&#xD;
      COVID19 related materials/activities (e.g., sermons, pastors modeling testing, testimonials,&#xD;
      bulletins); and d) church-community level COVID19 testing and LTC services (e.g., healthcare,&#xD;
      prevention programs, community resources, contact tracing) provided virtually by community&#xD;
      health workers. All churches will host COVID19 testing events. First, a pilot study site will&#xD;
      be used to test project feasibility followed by the 16 RCT faith-based study sites. Social,&#xD;
      ethical, behavioral implications (SEBI) data will also be collected. All data will be made&#xD;
      available to the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Underserved Populations (RADxUP) Data&#xD;
      Consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims (SA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 1. Test a tailored TPB-guided multilevel, COVID19 intervention against a nontailored AC&#xD;
      arm on uptake of COVID19 testing, and LTC/CTA &amp; prevention behaviors with African American&#xD;
      church-populations at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The tailored, TPB testing/LTC intervention will attain higher testing rates than&#xD;
      AC at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 2. Evaluate roles of potential mediators and moderators related to COVID19 testing among&#xD;
      church-affiliated African Americans at 6 months to determine modifiable&#xD;
      facilitators/barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA 3. Conduct a process evaluation to understand study implementation facilitators, barriers,&#xD;
      and fidelity; and examine relationships between implementation, intervention dose and&#xD;
      exposure, and intervention outcomes to identify and improve essential intervention&#xD;
      components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This novel study is the first to fully test a COVID19 testing and LTC&#xD;
      intervention in African American churches. It could provide a theory-based, multilevel model&#xD;
      for delivering scalable, wide-reaching COVID19 testing and LTC by supporting African American&#xD;
      faith leaders with culturally-appropriate, easy-to-use tools and health agency partnerships.&#xD;
      It could have a major impact on uptake of COVID19 testing, inform on LTC and contact tracing,&#xD;
      and streamline future vaccine delivery in African American communities hard hit by COVID19.&#xD;
