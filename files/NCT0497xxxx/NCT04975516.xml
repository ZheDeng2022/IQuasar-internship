  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of standard of care chemotherapy with or with out&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to a limited amount of places in the body (oligometastatic). Stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to&#xD;
      tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter&#xD;
      period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy may help improve tumor control, decrease risk of tumor spreading more, decrease side&#xD;
      effects, and prolong survival.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare progression free survival (PFS) between stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      + standard chemotherapy versus (vs.) standard chemotherapy alone in patients with&#xD;
      oligometastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Confirmed response rate. II. Overall survival. III. Adverse events. IV. Longitudinal&#xD;
      assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate fatigue, and other patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients undergo SBRT once daily (QD) or every other day for 5 fractions, and&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive chemotherapy per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 14 days, and then&#xD;
      every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;
