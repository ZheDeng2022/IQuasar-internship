  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      How to maintain the stability of circulation during anesthesia has always been a concern of&#xD;
      clinicians, including shorting the preoperative fasting time under the condition of full&#xD;
      preoperative preparation, and giving appropriate amount of nutrient solution in combination&#xD;
      with the patient's situation 2~4 h before surgery to reduce the blood volume insufficiency of&#xD;
      patients before general anesthesia induction, vasoactive drugs, etc. Among them, passive leg&#xD;
      lifting experiment is widely recognized in the world. Although passive leg lifting has many&#xD;
      advantages, it still has some limitations in the operation process. This study tried to find&#xD;
      the corresponding head low and foot high Angle corresponding to the same hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      caused by passive leg lifting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For low head and high feet, studies have shown that 20° can reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      hypotension during the induction period of general anesthesia in patients undergoing&#xD;
      gastrectomy and has therapeutic effect on it, as well as reduce the use of vasoactive drugs&#xD;
      during the induction period of general anesthesia. There were no perioperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The passive leg lift test can be repeated and does not overload the patient with fluid.&#xD;
      However, there is no relevant research on the relationship between the two, which is exactly&#xD;
      the innovation of this topic.&#xD;
