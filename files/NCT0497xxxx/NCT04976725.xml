  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is a neurological condition that is very common all over the world and is observed&#xD;
      at some time in life in more than 90% of society. Migraine headache, known for thousands of&#xD;
      years, is one of the oldest diseases of humanity. The word 'hemicrania', meaning 'half of a&#xD;
      head', is used due to unilateral pain. Approaches to treating migraine include medication,&#xD;
      relaxation, biofeedback, living a regular life, adequate sleep, exercise, and stress&#xD;
      management. Neck pain is especially common in migraine patients. Exercise, manual practices,&#xD;
      electrop novelties are used to reduce musculoskeletal problems, thus reducing the effects of&#xD;
      migraine. Myofascial relaxation techniques, which are included in the manipulative techniques&#xD;
      in the literature, are relaxation methods performed on myofascial trigger points.Osteopathic&#xD;
      manual therapy (OMT) , which has recently entered the literature, 19. osteopathy, developed&#xD;
      by Andrew Taylor STILL at the end of the century, is a treatment system characterized by&#xD;
      focusing on integrity and using it by hand to heal diseases.The study of cranial OMM kraniyum&#xD;
      first anatomical and physiological mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of disease as&#xD;
      a whole is concerned with the relationship of the body, including diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      methods.It is used in the treatment of somatic dysfunction of the head and other body parts.&#xD;
      An important component of cranial Omm is the primary respiratory mechanism, which occurs as&#xD;
      movement of the head bones, sacrum, dural membranes, central nervous system and cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid. The primary respiratory mechanism is synchronous with the cranial rhythmic impulse, a&#xD;
      2-phase rhythmic cycle that represents a dynamic metabolic exchange with each stage of the&#xD;
      body. This cycle is indicated as loops between 7 and 14 per minute.Fascial mobilization&#xD;
      therapy increases energy use in segments implemented by mechanical changes.Accordingly, it&#xD;
      helps to reduce the spasm of these layers extending fascially, to dissolve adhesions, and to&#xD;
      increase the range of motion of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy has no effect on migraine symptoms. H1: Osteopathic&#xD;
      Manipulative Therapy has an effect on migraine symptoms. H2: myofascial relaxation techniques&#xD;
      have no effect on migraine symptoms. H3: methods of Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy have an&#xD;
      effect on migraine symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: myofascial relaxation techniques and osteopathic manipulative treatment methods have no&#xD;
      superiority over each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: myofascial relaxation techniques and osteopathic manipulative treatment methods have&#xD;
      superiority over each other.&#xD;
