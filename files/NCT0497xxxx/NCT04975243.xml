    <textblock>
      This clinical study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the GentleMax Pro&#xD;
      Plus™ laser system for its intended use of hair removal while using short pulse durations to&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of achieving permanent reduction of fine facial hairs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, open label trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      GentleMax Pro Plus™ laser system for its intended use of hair removal with variable pulse&#xD;
      durations and spot sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects may be enrolled in this study at one (1) investigational site. Subjects&#xD;
      having difficult to treat unwanted fine facial hairs having Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) I to&#xD;
      VI are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have a diverse sample of study subjects, the following criteria was established&#xD;
      to ensure a wide array of skin types and race and ethnicities for data analysis. At least 15&#xD;
      subjects must have FST III to V. The remaining subjects can include other FST, but must still&#xD;
      have fine facial hairs where permanent hair reduction is difficult to achieve with 3 ms&#xD;
      pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive four (4) laser hair removal treatment visits (with maximum interval&#xD;
      of 10 weeks in between treatment visits) depending on the treatment area and three (3) follow&#xD;
      up visits (1 month, 3 month, and 6 month after final treatment).&#xD;
