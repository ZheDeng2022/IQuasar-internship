  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in a 4-visit study protocol at the National Advanced Driving&#xD;
      Simulator, part of the University of Iowa, in which they will be asked to complete assorted&#xD;
      questionnaires, computerized cognitive tasks, and a simulator drive. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered 0.75 mg alprazolam (Xanax) or placebo and 500 mg vaporized cannabis (6.18% THC /&#xD;
      &lt;0.025% CBD) or placebo (0% THC / 0% CBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to validate the Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS)&#xD;
      using the CRCDS-2 driving simulator by assessing the acute effects of cannabis relative to&#xD;
      placebo on simulated driving performance. Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by the&#xD;
      significant effect of 0.75 mg alprazolam (active comparator) on driving and cognitive&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS), normal healthy&#xD;
      subjects who currently use cannabis recreationally (at least once a month) will be recruited.&#xD;
      The study involves four visits, the first of which is a screening visit of approximately 3&#xD;
      hours. At the screening visit, consent is obtained, questionnaires are given, and a physical&#xD;
      and psychological exam is administered. Subjects will also train on study procedures, such as&#xD;
      the cognitive testing, the simulator drive, and the cannabis inhalation procedure. Subjects&#xD;
      will then be scheduled for their three treatment visits, which will be one week apart..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment visits will have a clean (double placebo) and two treatment visits (active&#xD;
      alprazolam and placebo cannabis, placebo alprazolam and active cannabis). The alprazolam dose&#xD;
      is 0.75 mg and the cannabis dose is 500 mg. All cannabis will be inhaled via a VolcanoÂ® Digit&#xD;
      vaporizer using the Foltin Puff Procedure. Each of the treatment visits will last&#xD;
      approximately twenty-three hours and will include intake with eligibility and baseline&#xD;
      testing, transport to a local hotel, an overnight stay at the hotel, transport to NADS, being&#xD;
      dosed with study drugs or placebos, cognitive assessments, a simulator drive, and assorted&#xD;
      questionnaires. There will also be 8 mL blood sampling before dosing, before driving, and&#xD;
      after driving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meals will be provided at the treatment visits (dinner, snack, breakfast, lunch). Subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored until the drug effects have subsided sufficiently to ensure it is safe to&#xD;
      transport them home. Subjects will need to arrange their own transportation; they will not be&#xD;
      permitted to drive themselves home after the treatment visits.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study uses two treatments - alprazolam and cannabis - and placebo. Subjects are randomized to a study arm where the order of treatments is counter-balanced, but all treatments and placebo are received by all subjects. At a visit, you might receive placebo alprazolam and placebo cannabis, placebo alprazolam and active cannabis, or active alprazolam and placebo cannabis. There is not a visit where you receive both active alprazolam and active cannabis.</intervention_model_description>
