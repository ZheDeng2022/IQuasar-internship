  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. It aims to investigate the&#xD;
      treatment effects of amlodipine folic acid, and its combination of folic acid, compared to&#xD;
      amlodipine, on reducing the risk of first ischemic stroke among those participants with the&#xD;
      MTHFR 677 TT genotype and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 3 phases: Screening, Run-in period (0 or 2 weeks), and randomized&#xD;
      treatment (5 years), with a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 phases: Screening, Run-in period, Randomized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Screening (V0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of phase I is to obtain informed consent and make a preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first screening visit (V0), or prior to the official treatment visit, a clinical&#xD;
      examination will be performed to determine the patient's clinical diagnosis and to determine&#xD;
      eligibility for inclusion in the study. General demographic information will be obtained and&#xD;
      questions related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study will be asked.&#xD;
      Additionally, this will be the time to discuss the impact of participant vacation/travel&#xD;
      plans on adherence and compliance with the trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Run-in Period (VD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who have not used antihypertensive drugs of Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB)&#xD;
      in the past two months, will begin a treatment of amlodipine (5mg/d) for a 2-week run-in&#xD;
      period. Those patients who have been taking antihypertensive drugs of CCBs in the past two&#xD;
      months and who report no adverse reactions, will skip the run-in period and directly begin&#xD;
      the randomized treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this phase is to assess participant compliance for following the&#xD;
      amlodipine treatment regimen as well as to observe the participant's tolerance to amlodipine,&#xD;
      so as to avoid admitting those participants with poor compliance or an intolerance to&#xD;
      amlodipine, into the randomized treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Randomized Treatment (V1-V21)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase consists of a 5-year period of randomized treatment. Patients who remain&#xD;
      eligible for participation in the study will be randomized into 3 treatment groups: either&#xD;
      amlodipine only tablets (5mg/d), or amlodipine folic acid tablets (5.8mg/d), or amlodipine&#xD;
      folic acid tablets (5.8mg/d) + folic acid (0.8mg/d). During the 5-year randomized treatment&#xD;
      period, other antihypertensive drugs can be combined with the treatment drug to achieve blood&#xD;
      pressure control, including Candesartan (4mg/d) or/and Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg/d).&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up every 3 months during the treatment period, and the treatment&#xD;
      drug will be distributed at each visit. During this period, participants should continue to&#xD;
      avoid taking medications that may interfere with the evaluation of treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Run-in Period, eligible participants, stratified by research centers, were randomly&#xD;
      assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive the two study treatments. Randomization was performed&#xD;
      centrally by means of a computer-generated random-number sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll 24,000 participants. Based on the results of previous studies, the&#xD;
      annual incidence of first ischemic stroke in people with hypertension and the MTHFR TT&#xD;
      genotype without folic acid supplementation is 0.64%. Assuming that the 5-year incidence of&#xD;
      first ischemic stroke in the amlodipine group is greater than 2.5%, this study could observe&#xD;
      a relative risk difference of more than 25% between the groups with over 80% power at a&#xD;
      two-sided significance level of α=0.05. For an assumed annual incidence of first ischemic&#xD;
      stroke greater than 3.5%, a relative risk difference of over 20% between the groups could be&#xD;
      observed with 80% or more power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every 200 confirmed primary outcome events, an interim analysis will be conducted. This&#xD;
      study anticipates conducting 4 interim analyses. The O'Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function&#xD;
      will be used to define the significance level of each interim analysis to ensure that the&#xD;
      final overall two-sided significance level will be α=0.05.&#xD;
