      This is a non-randomised, single arm, open-label study of Cybis™ 10:25 in participants with&#xD;
      chronic back or neck pain in which participants receive escalating doses of Cybis™ 10:25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of Cybis™ 10:25 in&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe chronic back or neck pain that is unresponsive to&#xD;
      over-the-counter non-opioid analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a screening visit, then seven clinic visits (Day 1, 2, 8, 15, 22,&#xD;
      29, and 35). Cybis™ 10:25 will be administered oromucosally at doses varying from 0.5 mL once&#xD;
      daily to 1.5 mL twice daily. Total duration of dosing is 28 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose), Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the dose-response relationship between Cybis™ 10:25 and pain response as measured by the change from baseline in Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS).&#xD;
The NPRS is an 11-point scale between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain ever possible). The minimum clinically significant change in NPRS is two points. The NPRS has been validated for use in participant with low back pain.&#xD;
Baseline pain levels are considered the NPRS at Day 1, irrespective of dose cohort. Change from baseline will be calculated as the pain level at the end of a dose cohort (Day 8 for 0.5 mL once daily; Day 15 for 0.5 mL bd; Day 22 for 1.0 mL bd; or Day 29 for 1.5 mL bd) minus the Day 1 value.</description>

    <description>To investigate the dose-response relationship between Cybis™ 10:25 and pain response as measured by the change from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form.&#xD;
The Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form is a questionnaire that assesses worst pain in the last 24 hours, least pain in the last 24 hours, average pain, and pain 'right now' along with the interference the pain causes on general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with others, sleep and enjoyment of life. It will be scored according to its scoring manual [24]. Scores will be summarised at baseline, Day 8, 15, 22, 29 and 35.</description>

The Self-Assessment of Treatment is a 9-item scale that measures treatment satisfaction in the previous seven days. It assesses pain, self-care activities, daily activities, physical activities, emotional well-being, sleep and social functioning, all assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. It also captures how likely the respondent would be willing to receive the study treatment again, and how study treatment compares to other treatments. The SAT-II has been validated, and is considered an acceptable endpoint for pain studies. The change in Self-Assessment of Treatment score will be used to investigate the dose-response relationship.</description>
