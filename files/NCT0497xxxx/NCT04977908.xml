    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether home use of fully closed-loop&#xD;
      glucose control applying ultra-rapid Lispro insulin is superior to standard insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin&#xD;
      pump therapy with sub-optimal glycaemic control (HbA1c â‰¥ 8.0%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a run-in&#xD;
      period followed by two study periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by&#xD;
      an automated closed-loop system using ultra-rapid Lispro insulin or by participants usual&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring in random order. A total of up to 30&#xD;
      adults (aiming for 24 completed participants) with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be&#xD;
      recruited through diabetes clinics and other established methods. Participants who drop out&#xD;
      of the study within the first 4 weeks of the first intervention arm will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive appropriate training in the safe use of the closed-loop devices.&#xD;
      Participants will have access to the study team during the home study phase with 24/7&#xD;
      telephone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by&#xD;
      CGM over the 8 week period. Secondary outcomes are HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels&#xD;
      above and below target as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics in addition to insulin&#xD;
      requirements. Safety evaluation comprises severe hypoglycaemic episodes, diabetic&#xD;
      ketoacidosis (DKA) events and other adverse and serious adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the clinical trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether home use of fully closed-loop applying ultra-rapid Lispro insulin is&#xD;
      superior to insulin pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to compare home use of fully closed-loop glucose control applying&#xD;
      ultra-rapid Lispro insulin with standard insulin pump therapy with CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess the efficacy of fully closed-loop glucose control&#xD;
           applying ultra-rapid Lispro insulin in maintaining CGM glucose levels within the target&#xD;
           range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l, as compared to standard insulin pump therapy combined&#xD;
           with CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of fully closed-loop glucose control in&#xD;
           terms of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and other adverse events and&#xD;
           adverse device effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the percentage of time when closed-loop was&#xD;
           operational, and usability and acceptance of the closed-loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating clinical centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 adults completing the study. Up to 30 participants will be recruited to allow for&#xD;
      dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum duration of study for a participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 weeks (5 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The participants will be recruited through the adult diabetes outpatient clinics&#xD;
      or other established methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo a baseline evaluation including a blood sample for the&#xD;
      measurement of HbA1c, renal, liver functions, full blood count, thyroid functions and coeliac&#xD;
      antibody screen (if not done in the previous 3 months). Urine pregnancy test will be done in&#xD;
      females of child bearing age. Human factor questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in Period During the 2-3 week run-in period, participants will use their own insulin pump&#xD;
      and wear a masked CGM system. At the end of the run-in period, for compliance, at least 10&#xD;
      days of CGM data need to be recorded. CGM data during the run-in period will be used to&#xD;
      assess baseline glucose control before the start of the first home study phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomised using randomisation software to the use of&#xD;
      closed-loop glucose control or to standard pump therapy with CGM. There will be no washout&#xD;
      period between the two intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated closed-loop:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training on the use of closed-loop will be provided by the research team during a 2 to 3 hour&#xD;
      session in an outpatient setting (clinical research facility) or may be done remotely.&#xD;
      Competency on the use of study insulin pump, study CGM and closed-loop system will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a competency assessment tool developed by the research team. Further training&#xD;
      may be delivered as required. Participants will be advised to use the closed-loop system with&#xD;
      ultra-rapid Lispro insulin for next 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional insulin pump therapy with CGM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use their own insulin pump and study CGM. Training on the use of real-time&#xD;
      CGM and how to interpret real-time will be provided. Participants will use standard insulin&#xD;
      pump therapy, with their usual insulin, and real-time CGM for the next 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first intervention period, a blood sample for the measurement of HbA1c will&#xD;
      be taken and human factor questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c and human factor questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered. Study devices will be returned and participants will resume usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events and adverse&#xD;
      device events will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse&#xD;
      device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse events&#xD;
      and any unanticipated adverse device/method effects that occur during the study and will&#xD;
      review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving&#xD;
      a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of&#xD;
      a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant protocol violation or non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to satisfy competency assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision by the investigator, or the sponsor, that termination is in the participant's&#xD;
           best medical interest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reaction to insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical grounds (e.g. participant relocates)&#xD;
