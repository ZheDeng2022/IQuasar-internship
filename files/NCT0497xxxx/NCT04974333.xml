  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SANENT trial is a primary care-based, prospective, two-arm, randomized controlled,&#xD;
      open-label, blinded-endpoint study with the aim to compare a diabetes management strategy&#xD;
      using an information board and a mobile application versus standard care in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. This trial aims to recruit 1440 type 2 diabetes patients during&#xD;
      a period of six months until the requested number of participants have been achieved. The&#xD;
      total length of the intervention will be one year. The SANENT trial protocol is presented&#xD;
      according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)&#xD;
      recommendations&#xD;

      Trial setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted within primary health care practices in three states (Colima,&#xD;
      Tlaxcala y Guanajuato) of Mexico. These states were selected because they have a high&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes and have implemented an Electronic Health Record System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and Public involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the planning phase of the study, a pilot project was carried out evaluating the design&#xD;
      and applicability of the information board and mobile application in 31 type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients. The final intervention was then modified according to the qualitative data received&#xD;
      from the patients. the investigators also involved primary healthcare clinicians in the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of the information. The results of the study will be made&#xD;
      available to all trial participants and participating general practices. Finally, the General&#xD;
      Health Council of Mexico who manages the countries public health system is included as&#xD;
      collaboration partner in this trial and has been involved in all phases of the design of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a difference in HbA1C of 0.5% between the intervention and the control group, a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 1.5%, a power of 90% and an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided tests) with a&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 25% during the study, a minimum of 504 will be needed in total in each of&#xD;
      the three states. Thus, the total number of patients will be 1512.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating healthcare centers were selected because they have the most recent version&#xD;
      of the Electronic Health Record System that allows linking clinical information to the mobile&#xD;
      app and the information board used in this study. In addition, these centers count with the&#xD;
      necessary health information system infrastructure. Finally, each of these centers take care&#xD;
      of the clinical control of diabetes patients. The primary healthcare workers of the&#xD;
      participating centers will screen their type 2 diabetes patient lists and will invite&#xD;
      eligible patients. Patients will receive an invitation letter and a leaflet with general&#xD;
      information about the study. Eligible patients may also be contacted by phone, emails, or&#xD;
      text by the healthcare professionals. Patients will be enrolled for screening and random&#xD;
      allocation over a six-month period. During the first visit of the screening phase, the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and medical record will be revised by the healthcare professionals. In&#xD;
      case the patient is potentially eligible, the patient will be invited to the study upon&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent. Before the next screening visit, the HbA1C of the patient will be&#xD;
      measured to complete the eligibility assessment. Once the diagnosis of uncontrolled type 2&#xD;
      diabetes has been made, all other baseline measurements and laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will use a parallel group design, randomizing patients to either the intervention&#xD;
      or the control arm by a computer-generated sequence with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      randomization of the study participants will be done after having provided consent and when&#xD;
      all baseline assessments have been completed to minimize reporting and selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation will be done using a validated secure web-based randomization operated by a&#xD;
      data manager, not involved in the patient recruitment, located at the Autonomic University of&#xD;
      Mexico. This will ensure concealment of the treatment sequence up to the allocation. The&#xD;
      treatment sequence will be generated by a computer-generated sequence of random numbers.&#xD;
      Allocation will be carried out with an algorithm to ensure groups are balanced for important&#xD;
      baseline prognostic and other factors: study site, age (&lt;65/≥65 years), sex (male/female),&#xD;
      duration of diabetes (&lt;5 years/≥5 years) and number of medications (&lt;5/≥5) which are&#xD;
      considered as a key prognostic variable for the primary outcome of this trial. The treatment&#xD;
      allocation codes will be concealed in sequentially numbered envelopes that will be opened&#xD;
      each time a patient will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment compliance using Morisky scale. The Morisky scale is a validated scale designed to estimate the risk of medication non-adherence. The scale consists of eight questions, first seven items having a dichotomous answer (yes/no) that indicates adherent or non-adherent behaviour. For item 8, a patient can choose an answer on a 5-point Likert scale, expressing how often happens that a patient does not take his medications. The Morisky scores can range from 0 to 8 points.</description>

    <description>Depression will be measured using the Beck questionnaire. The Beck questionnaire adda up the score reported for each of the 21 questions ranging from zero to three. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0-3. Measures of 0-9 indicates that a person is not depressed, 10-18 indicates mild-moderate depression, 19-29 indicates moderate-severe depression and 30-63 indicates severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity changes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in physical activity will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire allows to estimate the overall total physical activity metabolic equivalents-minutes/week score. All activities are converted into minutes before calculating metabolic equivalent minutes. To calculate metabolic equivalents minutes a week the metabolic equivalents value given is multiplied (remember walking = 3.3, moderate activity = 4, vigorous activity = 8) by the minutes the activity was carried out and again by the number of days that that activity was undertaken. The higher the metabolic equivalent-minutes/week score, the more activity the participant is.</description>

    <measure>Changes in albumin to creatine ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in kidney function will be measured using the albumin to creatine ratio. A ratio of albumin (mcg/L) to creatinine (mg/L) of less than 30 is normal; a ratio of 30-300 signifies microalbuminuria and values above 300 are considered as macroalbuminuria.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life changes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 36 questionnaire assessing changes in quality of life. The SF-36 measures eight scales: physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
