  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often receive a drug called daunorubicin.&#xD;
      Daunorubicin is a type of drug called an anthracycline, which increases the risk of some&#xD;
      damage to the heart. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are&#xD;
      two types of drugs that are often used (and are FDA approved) to treat the type of damage to&#xD;
      the heart caused by anthracyclines. They have also been used in some populations to prevent&#xD;
      this type of heart damage. In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      preventively take a beta blocker and ACEi or not to receive these. The primary purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to look at how often people in each group develop this type of heart damage. The&#xD;
      study investigators will also collect data about your quality of life and other changes in&#xD;
      your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity among patients receiving acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy is unknown. We hypothesize that up-titrating study agents&#xD;
      to maximum tolerated dosage at the time of induction (starting treatment for AML) will&#xD;
      prevent the development of systolic dysfunction as determined on serial echocardiography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will know which group they are assigned to, and if someone in the group not&#xD;
      receiving the preventive drugs needs these drugs for their clinical care, they will be able&#xD;
      to receive them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive the standard clinical care medicines and lab tests&#xD;
      for their AML. Everyone will have electrocardiograms (also called ECGs or EKGs) and&#xD;
      echocardiograms before and at multiple timepoints during the study. They will also have a&#xD;
      special blood test to see their levels of troponin, a protein that helps with muscle&#xD;
      contractions in your heart. All participants will complete questionnaires at a few timepoints&#xD;
      during the study to measure their quality of life. Participants in the preventive beta&#xD;
      blocker and ACEi group will take these drugs when they're in the hospital and at home,&#xD;
      keeping a diary of when they take it when they're at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that taking a beta blocker and ACEi during initial therapy for&#xD;
      AML and through about 90 days after they last take an anthracycline will prevent the&#xD;
      development of this heart problem.&#xD;

             infarction in the 6 months preceding registration or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the&#xD;
             study personnel, all at the discretion of the treating oncologist.&#xD;
