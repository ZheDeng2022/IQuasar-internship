  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare the efficacy of asciminib 80 mg QD versus Investigator&#xD;
      selected TKI for the treatment of newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with Ph+&#xD;
      CML-CP. The Investigator selected TKI will be one of the following treatment options for&#xD;
      first-line treatment of CML-CP - imatinib 400 mg QD or nilotinib 300 mg BID or dasatinib 100&#xD;
      mg QD or bosutinib 400 mg QD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase III, multi-center, open-label, randomized study of oral asciminib 80 mg&#xD;
      QD versus Investigator selected TKI (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib) in adult&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. All comparator TKIs will be made available, unless&#xD;
      not permitted by local regulations or local Health Authority, or not approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of CML in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to compare the efficacy of asciminib 80 mg QD with Investigator&#xD;
      selected TKI for the treatment of newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with Ph+&#xD;
      CML-CP. The Investigator selected TKI will be one of the treatment options approved by major&#xD;
      Health Authorities for first-line treatment of CML-CP - imatinib 400 mg QD or nilotinib 300&#xD;
      mg BID or dasatinib 100 mg QD or bosutinib 400 mg QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 402 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to asciminib and Investigator&#xD;
      selected TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified based on the following two stratification factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ELTS score (low versus intermediate versus high)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-randomization selected TKI (imatinib versus 2G TKI (nilotinib or dasatinib or&#xD;
           bosutinib)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, the Investigator, in consultation with the patient, considering the&#xD;
      current treatment paradigm and patient characteristics and comorbidities, will make a&#xD;
      selection of preference for imatinib or 2G TKI (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib) if the&#xD;
      patient is randomized to the comparator arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further ensure that the distribution of patients, between imatinib and 2G TKIs (nilotinib&#xD;
      or dasatinib or bosutinib), in the Investigator selected TKI arm is reflective of the use of&#xD;
      these agents in clinical practice, the enrollment into the strata of imatinib versus 2G TKI&#xD;
      (nilotinib or dasatinib or bosutinib) based on the pre-randomization selection of TKI will be&#xD;
      managed by Interactive Response Technology to be approximately 50% versus 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms: The study will have 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: asciminib 80 mg QD under fasting conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Investigator selected TKI that will include one of the below treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imatinib 400 mg QD administered with food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nilotinib 300 mg BID administered under fasting conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dasatinib 100 mg QD administered with or without meal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bosutinib 400 mg QD administered with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No crossover of study treatment across arms and no change of study treatment within the&#xD;
      Investigator selected TKI will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study treatment: Patients on the study will continue to receive the assigned&#xD;
      treatment until the End of Study, or until premature discontinuation due to treatment&#xD;
      failure, disease progression or intolerance or due to Investigator or participant decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: The End of Study will occur 5 years from the last patient first treatment&#xD;
      in the study. Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely due to any reason, will be&#xD;
      followed up for survival and progression (to AP/BC) until the End of Study.&#xD;

    <description>The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30) consists of functioning scales, symptoms' scales, single-item scales and the global health status quality of life (QoL) scale.

                  reading. If QTcF ≥ 450 msec and electrolytes are not within normal ranges,&#xD;

                  QTcF interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the&#xD;

             arterial or pulmonary hypertension, uncontrolled clinically significant&#xD;
             hyperlipidemia). Please refer to Section 6.3.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer.&#xD;
