  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of Dextenza vs standard of care prednisolone&#xD;
      taper after cataract surgery in diabetic patients with regards to controlling post-op&#xD;
      inflammation at post-op days 7, 14, and 30.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammation after cataract surgery is controlled at the investigators' institution by a&#xD;
      taper of prednisolone acetate 1%, which consists of four drops daily for one week, followed&#xD;
      by three drops daily for one week, then two drops daily for one week, then one drop daily for&#xD;
      one week. Due to the frequency of drops needed after cataract surgery, compliance with the&#xD;
      post-op regimen often wavers. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Dextenza, which has&#xD;
      been shown to be better than placebo after cataract surgery (1), against prednisolone acetate&#xD;
      taper. If shown to be as effective without compromising safety, it could be a very convenient&#xD;
      alternative to prednisolone acetate taper. Furthermore, if Dextenza is shown to be as&#xD;
      effective as prednisolone taper in diabetic patients, it could be logically generalized that&#xD;
      it would be effective in patients without diabetes as well, as patients without diabetes (and&#xD;
      with no confounding risk factors, such as a history of uveitis) are less prone to developing&#xD;
      post-op macular edema. Risks are minimal for this FDA approved treatment and include&#xD;
      iridocyclitis (10%); intraocular pressure increased (6%); visual acuity reduced (2%); cystoid&#xD;
      macular edema (1%); corneal edema (1%); eye pain (1%) and conjunctival hyperemia (1%). These&#xD;
      risks are comparable to prednisolone acetate.&#xD;
