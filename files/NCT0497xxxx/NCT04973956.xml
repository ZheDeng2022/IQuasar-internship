  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In motor learning, to consider that movements are produced by the cooperation and combination&#xD;
      of many brain structures and are influenced by the emotions to which individuals are&#xD;
      subjected is essential. Several neural circuits have been identified that closely link the&#xD;
      emotional system and the motion control system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety is defined by persistent and excessive worries that do not disappear even in the&#xD;
      absence of the stressor. Anxiety has been found to produce inefficiencies in information&#xD;
      processing, which can result in performance deficits, as well as self-reported anxiety has&#xD;
      been linked to poorer working memory performance. In these stress and anxiety contexts,&#xD;
      relaxation techniques have been widely used to reduce psychophysiological arousal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding how movement, emotions and interactions are regulated is significant because of&#xD;
      the large number of movements humans perform. Of these, manual tasks represent precise&#xD;
      movements that require the integration of many elements by the nervous system to perform&#xD;
      these tasks successfully. How anxiety influence the way manual tasks are learned is still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, motor imagery (MI) is a cognitive process that is an important contributor&#xD;
      to how movements are planned and executed. The use of MI has been recommended to improve&#xD;
      movement learning and task execution. Knowing MI capacity is essential for creating effective&#xD;
      and individualized MI programs. However, how anxiety can affect our motor imagery ability is&#xD;
      still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine and quantify the effects of anxiety in the&#xD;
      learning of a precise manual task not previously trained on four parameters of fine motor&#xD;
      control: time, error, speed, and accuracy. On the other hand, the aim is to determine if the&#xD;
      ability of internal visual, external visual, and kinaesthetic imagery varies when the&#xD;
      participants are subjected to anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that participants with anxiety, to whom relaxation is induced, will&#xD;
      show better motor performance on the fine motor task and better motor imagery ability. In&#xD;
      contrast, the investigators expect that participants with anxiety, to whom relaxation is not&#xD;
      induced, will show poorer motor performance on the fine motor task and poorer motor imagery&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In order to meet the study objectives of determining and quantifying the effects of anxiety&#xD;
      on learning a precise manual task and on motor imagery ability, this study will be conducted.&#xD;
      The development of the study will take place in a conditioned room belonging to the&#xD;
      University of Alcalá, the Complutense University of Madrid, the European University of&#xD;
      Madrid, or Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. The study may also be carried out in other&#xD;
      Spanish and international university centers, subject to the consent and permission of the&#xD;
      respective centres. The study will be carried out by all national and international laws,&#xD;
      regulations, and recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be longitudinal, experimental, randomized, and double-blind, as&#xD;
      specified in the present registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be composed of participants who are undergraduate and postgraduate&#xD;
      students at the university centers where the study will be carried out, from which the&#xD;
      participants will be recruited. All participants included in the study must meet the study&#xD;
      selection criteria and participate voluntarily after reading the information sheet and&#xD;
      signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two intervention groups, both groups will have anxiety measured&#xD;
      with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and then be randomized to either the relaxation&#xD;
      intervention group or the control group. Each group will consist of a minimum number of 30&#xD;
      subjects to be able to study the desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each participant freely chooses to participate in the study, an initial questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to ensure that the participants meet the criteria for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. At this point, the participants will be coded by assigning them a number, which will&#xD;
      serve to identify each participant throughout the study. Participants will take the STAI, one&#xD;
      of the most widely used instruments for the self-reported assessment of anxiety. Participants&#xD;
      with scores indicative of anxiety will be included in the study. Included participants will&#xD;
      be randomized through sealed envelopes stratified by gender to one of two experimental&#xD;
      groups: relaxation or control. The participants will also take the Movement Imagery&#xD;
      Questionnaire-3 (MIQ-3) to measure internal visual, external visual, kinaesthetic imagery&#xD;
      ability, and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) to determine the participant's&#xD;
      laterality. Depending on the group to which the participants have been assigned, the&#xD;
      participants of the relaxation group will perform a relaxation intervention using the&#xD;
      Abbreviated Progressive Muscle Relaxation technique (APMR). This intervention consists of a&#xD;
      standardized 20 min session in which subjects are asked to sequentially tense and relax&#xD;
      various muscle groups. To do so, participants will listen to an audio with relaxation&#xD;
      instructions while seated in a reclining seat and dimmed lighting. Despite its brevity, this&#xD;
      relaxation technique has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and has been shown to&#xD;
      produce cognitive, behavioral, and physiological relaxation. On the other hand, participants&#xD;
      in the control group will listen to a content-neutral audio for 20 minutes and will be seated&#xD;
      in an un-reclined chair with normal lighting. After the relaxation or control intervention,&#xD;
      participants will learn a precise manual task with the non-dominant hand. The task will&#xD;
      consist of going over a 127 mm circumference on a graphics tablet at a rate of 2 seconds per&#xD;
      lap, which will be set by a metronome using a wireless pen that will leave no trace of ink&#xD;
      but will store the data in the MATLAB program via the graphics tablet. Thus, data from the&#xD;
      learning process and short-term memory of the task will be recorded. Afterward, there will be&#xD;
      a 20-minute break during which participants will perform the MIQ-3 again. Finally, the task&#xD;
      data will be collected to record the long-term memory of the manual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during all experiments, electrodermal activity and heart rate variability will&#xD;
      be recorded using the Empatica E4 physiological variable measurement wristband. This&#xD;
      measurement of physiological variables will serve to confirm that a significant emotional&#xD;
      effect has been generated and to test motor imagery processes since anxiety, relaxation, and&#xD;
      motor imagery all produce effects on the activation of the autonomic nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis and processing of data from MATLAB version R2020b, and the Empatica E4 wristband&#xD;
      will be performed using SPSS 25.0 statistical software and Kubios HRV software (for HRV&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, appropriate statistical analyses will be performed to see if the data are distributed&#xD;
      according to a standard curve and to assess the influence of sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the descriptive analysis of the relative and absolute frequencies for the&#xD;
      qualitative variables of gender and age will be carried out, and their homogeneity will be&#xD;
      tested using the Chi-square test. The descriptive analysis of the quantitative variables of&#xD;
      time, error, speed, accuracy, electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, and&#xD;
      kinaesthetic, internal visual, and external visual imagery will also be carried out. If the&#xD;
      variable conforms to the normal, the mean, range, and standard deviation shall be calculated.&#xD;
      If the variables do not conform to the normal, non-parametric tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis will be performed using mixed ANOVA to see the differences in the mean&#xD;
      values respective to motor control (time, error, speed, and accuracy), and the differences&#xD;
      between the first and last lap and between consecutive laps of the task in the same four&#xD;
      parameters, both in the task performed in the short term and the long term. A further ANOVA&#xD;
      analysis will take place for imagery ability, comparing the results obtained at the two&#xD;
      respective points during the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of learning between laps will be analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA comparing&#xD;
      each motor control measurement parameter with respect to the lapping factor. Electrodermal&#xD;
      activity, and heart rate variability during the measurement of imagery ability, emotional&#xD;
      state induction, manual task learning, and its maintenance in the short and long term will&#xD;
      also be studied by repeated-measures ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hypothesis testing, a significance level of 0.05 will be set.&#xD;
