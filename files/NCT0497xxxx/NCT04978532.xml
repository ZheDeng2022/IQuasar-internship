  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental trial. The children who&#xD;
      attended a pediatric surgical clinic for venipuncture divided into two groups via&#xD;
      randomization in the computer environment. After the randomization, the children in the&#xD;
      guided imagery group listened to a voice recording prepared in a studio during venipuncture.&#xD;
      This voice recording named 'Stroll in the Forest' helped the children to imagine that they&#xD;
      are strolling in a forest and guided them. On the other hand, no application was performed on&#xD;
      the children in the control group during the venipuncture. The primary outcome of the study&#xD;
      was pain and secondary outcomes were heart rate and oxygen saturation values. The pain was&#xD;
      evaluated by the children, parents, and observer. The pulse and oxygen saturation values were&#xD;
      measured before, during, and after the venipuncture.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Various nonpharmacological methods are used in reducing the pain of children. One of these&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods is the guided imagery method. In the guided imagery method, the&#xD;
      imagination of children is used. It is possible to have children imagine by being guided with&#xD;
      audible stimulus and, therefore, distract their attention from the procedure or&#xD;
      pain/discomfort feeling. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the guided&#xD;
      imagery method on procedural pain level, heart rate, and oxygen saturation values of the&#xD;
      children within the age range of 8-12 years. The sample size of the study has been determined&#xD;
      by the power analysis (G*Power 3.1.9.2), in line with the results obtained from the studies&#xD;
      which have been conducted using a similar research method. The sample size was found to be a&#xD;
      total of 144 children including minimum of 72 children for each group. It was estimated that&#xD;
      case losses may occur and therefore, it was decided to conduct the study with a total of 154&#xD;
      children including 77 children in two groups. One child in the guided imagery group was&#xD;
      excluded from the study as he/she gave up listening to voice recording during the procedure&#xD;
      and 1 child whose procedure could not be completed at once. In the control group, 1 child who&#xD;
      felt nauseous during the procedure and 1 child whose procedure could not be completed at once&#xD;
      could not be included in the sample group. Therefore, the sample group was composed of a&#xD;
      total of 150 children including 75 children in each group. Information Form, Faces Pain&#xD;
      Scale-Revised (FPS-R), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and their parents who applied to the clinic for venipuncture were informed about the&#xD;
      study. information about children and their parents included in the study were asked by the&#xD;
      researcher through face-to-face interview and these data were recorded in 'Information Form'&#xD;
      ten minutes before the procedure. FPS-R was explained to the children and they were asked&#xD;
      whether or not they had pain before the procedure and they were asked to perform marking on&#xD;
      the scale. Also, the children were told that they would mark the pain score again after the&#xD;
      procedure. The parent was informed about 10-point VAS. Parent and observer (healthcare&#xD;
      professional) marked children's pain level on the VAS independently by using a ruler. The&#xD;
      researcher measured and recorded the pain level on the information form. The pulse oximeter&#xD;
      device was attached to the finger of the extremity of the child that was not used for blood&#xD;
      drawing. The children in the guided imagery group were informed that they would start to&#xD;
      listen to voice recording named 'Stroll in the Forest' before venipuncture and blood would be&#xD;
      drawn while they were listening to the voice recording. Also, children were asked to close&#xD;
      their eyes, imagine the text content, and focus on the voice recording while listening to the&#xD;
      voice. Thus, it was aimed to distract the children's attention from the procedure. One minute&#xD;
      before venipuncture, children wore an earphone and voice recording started. As routine&#xD;
      venipuncture procedure would be performed for the children in the control group, they were&#xD;
      informed about the venipuncture procedure. Pre-procedure heart rate and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      values of the children in the guided imagery group were determined and recorded just before&#xD;
      attachment of tourniquet at the 50th second of the voice recording and then tourniquet was&#xD;
      attached and blood drawing was started. Heart rate and oxygen saturation values of the&#xD;
      children in the control group before attaching the tourniquet were written and then&#xD;
      tourniquet was attached and then venipuncture was conducted. The blood of all the children&#xD;
      included in the study was drawn by the experienced laboratorian working in the clinic using&#xD;
      the 21 G needle-type injector. There was needle insertion in both control and guided imagery&#xD;
      groups and when the first blood was seen in injector, the heart rate and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      were recorded. Immediately after the injector was removed, the heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation were recorded. Just after the procedure, children were asked to mark the pain&#xD;
      level they felt during the procedure on FPS-R. The parent and observer evaluated the pain&#xD;
      level of the children during the procedure using VAS.&#xD;

    <description>Pain assessed by children with Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). This self-report scale is used to determine the level of acute pain. This scale is suitable for the use of children in the age range of 4-16 years and it is a commonly preferred valid and reliable scale. The scale is composed of a total of 6 facial expressions, rated from 0 to 10, starting from a neutral face expression (0 point) and including a picture of a face expressing the existence of severe pain without tears (10 points).</description>

    <description>Pain assessed by parents and the observer with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is composed of a 100-mm horizontal line and the point &quot;0&quot; of this line expresses &quot;no pain&quot; and the point &quot;10&quot; expresses &quot;worst pain&quot;. Firstly, the individual marks the intensity of the pain he/she perceives and the point marked by him/her is measured by using a ruler so that the pain score is determined</description>
