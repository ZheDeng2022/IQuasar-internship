  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will establish a collection of biological samples from Marfan patients or&#xD;
      with associated diseases to be used for research purposes only, with due respect for&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease (incidence 1/5000) characterized by ocular,&#xD;
      cardiac and skeletal abnormalities. More recently, a decrease in fat and muscle mass has been&#xD;
      demonstrated, associated with a decrease in exercise endurance, causing a significant&#xD;
      deterioration in the quality of life. Little is known about the pathophysiology of these&#xD;
      symptoms. Patients with Marfan syndrome or related diseases are followed at the children's&#xD;
      hospital as part of the Rare Diseases Reference Centre (CRMR) for Marfan syndrome at the&#xD;
      Toulouse University Hospital. During regular check-up visits, an extra sample of blood and&#xD;
      urine will be collected and stored for research utilisation with the patient's consent. The&#xD;
      ultimate objective of this collection is to provide available biological resources to&#xD;
      facilitate the development of subsequent studies aimed at better characterizing the&#xD;
      multisystemic disorders in Marfan syndrome, to understand the pathophysiology of the disease,&#xD;
      and to identify biological factors that predict the severity and progression of the disease.&#xD;
      The possibility of having systematically collected biological resources will make it possible&#xD;
      to answer certain questions more quickly depending on the progress of research.&#xD;
