  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BC-U001 is an allogeneic fresh human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell product,&#xD;
      which showed therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis(RA) based on its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue repair activities. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of BC-U001 for RA patients using a 3+3 design.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll RA patients who still remained moderate-to-high disease activity after&#xD;
      conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) therapy. All participants are informed about the&#xD;
      study procedures and potential risks and are required to provide written informed consent&#xD;
      prior to study begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3+3 dose escalation design will be implemented. Three ascending dose cohorts (3&#xD;
      participants/cohort) will be treated successively to identify the maxium tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or a recommended dose for phase II study. Dose escalation will be terminated if the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in 2 participants during the 28-day follow-up&#xD;
      within cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLT was defined as any ≥grade 3 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 hemtological toxicity&#xD;
      according to CTCAE v5.0, which was related to the investigational product determined by&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
