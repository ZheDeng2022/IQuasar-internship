  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single ascending dose escalation followed by a multiple&#xD;
      administration dose at the maximal suitable dose (MSD). The investigational Medicinal Product&#xD;
      (IMP) is given as an add-on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talineuren consists of GM1 (monosialotetrahexosylganglioside), the pharmacologically active&#xD;
      ingredient, associated with a proprietary lipid formulation assembled as liposomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety of TLN administration intravenously in&#xD;
      Parkinson patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the determination of the maximal suitable dose based on the safety&#xD;
      profile and preliminary efficacy, as well as the determination of the pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ganglioside lipid GM1 has been described in the literature as a neuroprotective agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical studies have shown that GM1 improves the condition of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talineuren consists of the pharmacologically active ingredient GM1, associated with a&#xD;
      proprietary lipid formulation assembled as liposomes. Talineuren has been developed to&#xD;
      improve the delivery and bioavailability of GM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      intravenous Talineuren administration in Parkinson's disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The determination of the recommended phase 2 dose based on the safety profile and&#xD;
           preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The determination of the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims at investigating the safety of the novel formulation of GM1, Talineuren.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To that extent a two-part trial was designed: Part 1- Dose escalation Part 2- Dose&#xD;
      consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1- rapid dose escalation scheme from 6 mg to 720 mg of Talineuren formulated GM1 in 3&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2- multiple dosing of Talineuren over 8 weeks in 9 patients to validate the safety&#xD;
      profile of the maximum suitable dose.&#xD;
