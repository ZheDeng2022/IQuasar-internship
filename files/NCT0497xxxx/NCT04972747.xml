  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of technological advances in the field of newborns, the survival rates of very&#xD;
      young babies have increased. With this situation, there was a need to develop new&#xD;
      evidence-based application areas in premature babies. Nurses provide evidence-based care in&#xD;
      many areas to term and preterm babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. One of these areas&#xD;
      is the skin, which is known as 13% of the newborn's body weight and constitutes the largest&#xD;
      part of the organism. Before skin care is given, knowing the skin characteristics of the&#xD;
      newborn and performing skin care in accordance with these features will provide more benefits&#xD;
      for the baby. The skin of newborns is different from adults in terms of both function and&#xD;
      function. In addition, skin characteristics of term and preterm babies also differ according&#xD;
      to the week of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin basically enables the newborn to explore the world by thermoregulation, as a barrier&#xD;
      against microorganisms and chemical harmful substances, maintaining fluid-electrolyte&#xD;
      balance, vitamin D production, fat storage and sensory-touch. The immature skin of the&#xD;
      newborn cannot fully fulfill these functions. In another study conducted between sunflower&#xD;
      oil and the control group, it was stated that rash and peeling were less common in the&#xD;
      sunflower oil experiment group compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, evidence-based knowledge of nurses about neonatal skin care should be increased&#xD;
      in neonatal intensive care units, and appropriate nursing care should be given especially to&#xD;
      premature newborns who are at risk due to hospitalization. Even if there is no routine&#xD;
      procedure in our service, baby oil is massaged during care hours, but there is no study on&#xD;
      this. The aim of this study is to contribute to the neonatal skin care literature and to&#xD;
      provide appropriate evidence-based care in the service routine.&#xD;

      The research will be carried out with preterm babies hospitalized in the 3rd Level Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of SBÜ Kocaeli Derince Training and Research Hospital, Alikahya Campus&#xD;
      and meeting the criteria of the study. Preterm babies with a birth weight of 1000 g and&#xD;
      above, who do not receive ventilator support, and who do not have skin damage more than 5% of&#xD;
      the body surface between 32-36 weeks of gestation will be included in the study. Two groups&#xD;
      will be created by randomization method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These groups are; Sunflower oil group: Babies to whom skin care will be applied with&#xD;
      sunflower oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coconut oil group: Babies who will be treated with coconut oil&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the premature babies who meet the study criteria are divided into groups and their&#xD;
      consent is obtained, they will be followed up by the person conducting the study, and all&#xD;
      applications will be carried out by the same person. Information about the newborn will be&#xD;
      filled in by the person who will perform the application by using the &quot;Form for Identifying&#xD;
      the Introductory and Clinical Characteristics of the Newborn&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application will be carried out twice a day during the maintenance hours of the service.&#xD;
      In skin care applications, body baths are applied not more than three times a week, as it may&#xD;
      cause hypothermia in preterm babies in the ward routine. In daily skin care, body cleaning&#xD;
      with cotton, changing the fixation points such as orogastric probe, and changing the monitor&#xD;
      probe locations are among the routine practices. In order to hydrate and moisturize the skin&#xD;
      in preterm and term babies, baby oil in the service is used. Skin care applied in the service&#xD;
      routine will be applied to the preterm babies included in the study, and only sunflower oil&#xD;
      and coconut oil will be used as moisturizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPLICATION Group 1: Preterm babies treated with sunflower oil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31 preterm babies determined by randomization method will be included in the group to be&#xD;
           applied skin care with sunflower oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the application, the researcher will meet with the family and fill in the&#xD;
           &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social hand washing will be applied before the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the application, the skin of the newborn will be evaluated by using the &quot;Neonatal&#xD;
           Skin Condition Assessment Scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to measure the moisture of the skin before the application, the moisture level&#xD;
           of the skin will be recorded by measuring from three different points, namely the&#xD;
           abdomen, legs and arms, with a DMM branded skin moisture meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The baby will be placed under a radiant warmer by the practitioner to keep his body&#xD;
           temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the follow-up of growth parameters, the weight of the newborn will be weighed at the&#xD;
           same time while the baby is naked, using the digital baby scale in the service. In&#xD;
           addition, the baby's head circumference, height and belly circumference will be measured&#xD;
           with a tape measure and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each application, preterm babies will be given skin care in the service routine&#xD;
           and sunflower oil will be applied twice a day for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absorption of sunflower oil for preterm babies will be provided by using a baby massage&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the massage, 3-4 ml of sunflower oil will be applied to the whole body surface&#xD;
           except the genital area and scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Massage to the baby will be started first on the legs and feet, then continued with&#xD;
           massage of the abdomen and chest area, arms and hands, face and back, respectively, and&#xD;
           will be applied for 15 minutes at least 30 minutes after feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 hours after each application, the skin of the newborn will be evaluated using the&#xD;
           &quot;Neonatal Skin Condition Assessment Scale&quot;, and the measurement will be made with a DMM&#xD;
           brand skin moisture meter and recorded in the follow-up form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight monitoring will be recorded daily to monitor growth parameters and daily weight&#xD;
           gain / decrease will be monitored. Head circumference and height lengths will be&#xD;
           measured and recorded before the application and on the 7th and 14th day of the&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Preterm babies treated with coconut oil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31 preterm coconut oils determined by randomization method will be included in the group&#xD;

&#xD;
      Sunflower oil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunflower oil is a light yellow colored and light-tasting vegetable oil obtained from the&#xD;
      seeds of the sunflower plant. It contains 90% unsaturated fatty acids (combined oleic and&#xD;
      linoleic) and about 10% saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic). In the literature, the&#xD;
      importance of using mineral oils in maintaining the integrity of the skin of newborns has&#xD;
      been stated and there are many studies using sunflower oil on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coconut Oil&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coconut oil is a highly saturated fat traditionally made from the oil's raw coconut or dried&#xD;
      coconut kernels. Coconut oil is rich in medium-chain fatty acids, a saturated form of fat. It&#xD;
      contains Lauric acid 49%, Mystic acid 18%, Caprylic acid 8%, Palmitic acid 8% and Capric acid&#xD;
      7%.&#xD;
