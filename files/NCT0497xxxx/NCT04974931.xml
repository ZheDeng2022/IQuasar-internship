  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) remain one of the most common complications associated with&#xD;
      reversal of ileostomy and colostomy. In addition to having detrimental impacts on the&#xD;
      patient's post-operative course, they also pose significant financial ramifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been comparative studies in the use of negative pressure wound therapy in reducing&#xD;
      surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENA Incision Management System is a type of disposable, customizable and powered negative&#xD;
      pressure system designed to help manage and protect surgical incisions and their surrounding&#xD;
      environment. It is now commonly used as a surgical wound dressings in the setting of vascular&#xD;
      surgeries, post-cesarean infections and colorectal resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is designed as a randomised controlled trial to examine if PREVERA therapy as a&#xD;
      NPWT is more superior than conventional dressings in reducing the rate of surgical site&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical site infections (SSI) remain one of the most common complications associated with&#xD;
      reversal of ileostomy. In addition to having detrimental impacts on the patient's&#xD;
      post-operative course, they also pose significant financial ramifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is one strategy that has been extensively&#xD;
      studied in reducing the rate of surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREVENA Therapy is a form of Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (INPWT) that has been&#xD;
      widely used in the management of closed surgical incisions. They are delivered as&#xD;
      prophylactic measures in preventing surgical complications such as surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center superiority&#xD;
      trial with 2 parallel groups and primary endpoint of surgical site infection at day 7 (after&#xD;
      7-day use of PREVENA) and day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting The trial will be conducted at two different hospitals located in Dublin,&#xD;
      Ireland: St James Hospital - Ireland's largest acute academic teaching hospital (Academic&#xD;
      Partner - Trinity College Dublin); Tallaght University Hospital - (Academic Partner - Trinity&#xD;
      College Dublin)&#xD;
