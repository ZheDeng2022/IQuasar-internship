      This study aimed to investigate the performance of next-generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      techniques measuring immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH)-variable, diversity, and joining&#xD;
      (V[D]J) clonal rearrangements （IgH-V[D]J NGS） compared with flow cytometry (FCM) in detecting&#xD;
      of minimal residual disease (MRD) for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with&#xD;
      South Chinese Children Leukemia Group (SCCLG)-ALL 2016, and to predict the relapse of the&#xD;
      disease in the early stage and to assess the prognosis, so as to provide the basis for early&#xD;
      intervention treatment and reduce the hematological relapse and improve the survival rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of residual leukemia levels, &quot;minimal residual disease&quot; (MRD), during therapy&#xD;
      has now emerged as the most important predictor the outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL). As a result, risk-classifications based on MRD assessment has become an essential part&#xD;
      of determining disease risk and directing therapeutic approach for children and adults with&#xD;
      ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell&#xD;
      receptor (TCR) clonal rearrangements as a method of detecting MRD have been introduced. These&#xD;
      approaches expand the sensitivity of MRD detection to as high as 1 in 10,000,000 cells and&#xD;
      have been shown to be predictive of relapse in children with ALL receiving standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of IgH-V(D)J&#xD;
      NGS and compared its capacity to measure MRD with that of flow cytometry using diagnostic and&#xD;
      follow-up samples from more than 100 patients with ALL. Patients under age of 18 years with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed ALL will be recruited and receive the treatment strategy of (SCCLG)-ALL 2016.&#xD;
      After identifying a trackable clone in diagnostic samples (Baseline), MRD was measured using&#xD;
      IgH-V(D)J NGS and FCM on bone marrow at 3 time-points: fifteen days after induction therapy&#xD;
      (D15), thirty-three days after induction therapy (D33) and then at the end of induction&#xD;
      therapy. Event-free survival (EFS), Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      were assessed.&#xD;
