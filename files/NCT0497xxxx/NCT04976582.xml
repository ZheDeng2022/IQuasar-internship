  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is an extremely common problem that most people experience at some point&#xD;
      in their life. It is the leading cause of activity limitation and work absence throughout&#xD;
      much of the world. In India, occurrence of LBP is also alarming. Nearly 60% of the population&#xD;
      has significant back pain at some time in their life. In Brazil, spinal pain (cervical,&#xD;
      thoracic and lumbar) was considered the second most prevalent complaint, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 13.5% of the population. It is estimated that globally 39% of the population&#xD;
      will have at least one episode of back pain throughout their lives. In episodes of pain&#xD;
      greater than 12 weeks (classified as chronic lower back pain), the prognosis is unfavorable&#xD;
      and is highly associated with high treatment costs and work absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-specific low back pain&quot; [NSLBP] is defined as, low back pain that is not attributable to&#xD;
      a recognizable or known specific pathology - bone disorder in the spine [fracture], radicular&#xD;
      nerve compression, slipped intervertebral disk, stenosis in lumbar spine, inflammatory&#xD;
      disorder of spine [ankylosing spondylitis], cauda equine syndrome, congenital back disorder,&#xD;
      infection in the spine [discitis], tumour in lumbar area, osteoporosis, meningitis, Cancer,&#xD;
      HIV, autoimmune disorder [RA].&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: There is significant effects of dry needling with conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment as compared to Kinesio Taping with conventional physiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis: There is no significant effects of dry needling with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment as compared to Kinesio Taping with conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of dry needling in management of mechanical low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of kinesio taping in management of mechanical low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the quality of life in patient with mechanical low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the varying degree of disability measure in patient with mechanical low&#xD;
           back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Study Design Study will be a randomized control trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Settings The study will be conducted in the Rawal General and Dental Hospital Islamabad&#xD;
      and Al-Nafees hospital Islamabad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Duration of Study The duration of study will be completed in 04 months after approval of&#xD;
      synopsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Sample Size Thirty patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be divided into&#xD;
      groups i.e; 15 patients in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Sampling Technique Non probability convenient sampling. 3.6. Assessment: A&#xD;
      pre-intervention assessment will be performed to each participant before they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to kinesio taping group or dry needling group with physical therapy&#xD;
      intervention and outcome measures will be recorded before the intervention i.e; baseline&#xD;
      assessment ,after 2 weeks of intervention and after four weeks of treatment. After treatment,&#xD;
      patients will be performed post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7. INTERVENTION: Participants will be divided into two groups Group 1: control group in&#xD;
      which kinesiotaping with conventional physical therapy treatment (modalities including&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); electrical muscle stimulation (EMS); and&#xD;
      interferential current (IFC). Physical agents including ultrasound, hot packs, and cold&#xD;
      packs. Exercise including McKenzie exercises) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: experimental group in which dry needling with conventional physical therapy&#xD;
      treatment modalities including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS); electrical&#xD;
      muscle stimulation (EMS); and interferential current (IFC). Physical agents including&#xD;
      ultrasound, hot packs, and cold packs. Exercise including McKenzie exercises) will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8. Treatment plan: There will be a 4 weeks treatment plan consisting of 12 sessions. On&#xD;
      each week 3 sessions will be conducted.&#xD;
