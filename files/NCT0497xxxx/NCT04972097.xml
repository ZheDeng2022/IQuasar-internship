    <description>IRE of the prostate is typically performed with the subject in the lithotomy position, with 2-6 monopolar probes placed through the perineum using a brachytherapy grid and ultrasound or CT guidance. IRE supplies the targeted tissue with high voltage (2-3 kV) direct current pulses lasting up to 100 microseconds through the electrode probes.</description>
