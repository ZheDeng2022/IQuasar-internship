  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing an Elsevier clinical skill&#xD;
      platform in clinical nursing education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Research hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nursing students who assign for the critical care clinical course modules using Elsevier&#xD;
           clinical skill platform obtain a higher score in the OSCE than who receive clinical Lab&#xD;
           session on campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nursing students who utilize an Elsevier clinical skill are more satisfied in the&#xD;
           clinical education journey.&#xD;

      A quasi-experimental, two groups, pre-posttest study was carried out in Nursing college, King&#xD;
      Khalid University, Kingdome of Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-posttest per skill was conducted for both group the Elsevier clinical skill group&#xD;
           (ECS Group) and traditional Clinical Lab Session group (CLS Group), to assess the&#xD;
           students' knowledge level before and after receiving each scheduled Lab Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE): The summative OSCE included practical&#xD;
           stations with an associated written paper for each skill examined. For the practical&#xD;
           station, Students must pass the practical station (100%), as well as the relevant&#xD;
           written station (70%) to achieve a pass in that scope of practice skill according to&#xD;
           Exam policy &amp; Procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Students' perception of Usability and Learning of Elsevier Clinical Skill: included 8&#xD;
           questions developed by Rowe et al, 2017 categorized into two main themes: 1st theme is&#xD;
           relevant to the Usability of the platform (4 items) and 2nd theme reflected the Learning&#xD;
           enhancement while using the platform (4 items). Each item was scored on a three-point&#xD;
           Likert scale as follows: Strongly agree or agree (3), Neither agree nor disagree (2) and&#xD;
           Strongly disagree or disagree (1). The overall perceptions of students with both online&#xD;
           and traditional lab experiences included and score ranged between (1-3) as 1= Much&#xD;
           better than or better than, 2= About the same as 2, Much worse than or not as good as 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Participants: A convenience sample of all students enrolled in the critical care nursing&#xD;
      course (n=52) were divided into two groups and random selection was implemented by the&#xD;
      registration office following the inclusion criteria for all students who were enrolled first&#xD;
      time receive critical care nursing course. Therefore, two students were withdrawn at the&#xD;
      beginning of the course. The first group represented the control group the Clinical Lab&#xD;
      session (25 students), whilst the second group represented the intervention group the&#xD;
      Elsevier clinical skill (25 students).&#xD;
