  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of patient&#xD;
      navigation to promote linkage to smoking cessation treatments in cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a 2-month 1-arm intervention study that will recruit up to&#xD;
      20 smoking cancer patients at Penn State Cancer Institute. All participants will receive a&#xD;
      smoking cessation educational brochure and patient navigation intervention (in-person or by&#xD;
      phone) delivered over two months. At the first intervention interview, the patient navigators&#xD;
      will educate participants about the benefits of quitting, introduce smoking cessation&#xD;
      resources, motivate participants to link with treatment, help participants attend smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatments, and assess barriers that prevented them from being able to consider&#xD;
      smoking cessation. The cessation treatment resources will be discussed include PennState&#xD;
      Health Smoking Cessation Clinic, Pennsylvania Quitline, or visiting their primary care&#xD;
      provider (PCP) to discuss cessation, prescription medications, and/or nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy. A follow-up call will be made 1 month later to further assist and motivate to use&#xD;
      tobacco treatment services, and assess interim tobacco treatment engagement outcome. At 2&#xD;
      months after baseline, the final questionnaire will be administered to assess participants'&#xD;
      smoking behaviors, engagement in tobacco treatments, and satisfaction with the intervention.&#xD;
