  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial of a text-based behavioral intervention aimed at&#xD;
      increasing uptake of lung cancer screening among emergency department patients. We will&#xD;
      conduct a 2-year randomized controlled clinical trial with a prospectively collected&#xD;
      convenience sample of 366 adults who are eligible for LCS but non-adherent with LCS screening&#xD;
      guidelines. Adults aged 50-80 will be recruited from a high-volume urban ED and a low-volume&#xD;
      rural ED, assigned to study conditions, and followed-up at 150 days to assess interval&#xD;
      engagement with the University of Rochester Medical Center's LCS screening program (primary&#xD;
      outcome). Electronic Health Record (EHR) review will be conducted to assess screening results&#xD;
      and subsequent clinical endpoints.&#xD;

      Lung cancer is the number one cancer cause of death in the US1 accounting for a quarter of&#xD;
      all cancer deaths. Five-year survival for lung cancer is just 19%. However, early detection&#xD;
      of lung cancer increases 5-year survival three-fold and lung cancer screening (LCS) among&#xD;
      high-risk patients using low-dose CT scan is cost-effective and has been proven to reduce&#xD;
      lung cancer mortality by approximately 20%. Despite this potential, uptake of LCS has been&#xD;
      poor with only 14.4% of eligible patients found to have been screened in a recent 10 state&#xD;
      study. Indeed, the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services and the USPSTF have both&#xD;
      explicitly prioritized increasing the uptake of LCS among their goals. In 2021, the USPSTF&#xD;
      revised the eligibility criteria for LCS, expanding the age range to 50-80 and lowering the&#xD;
      pack-year threshold to 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Emergency Department (ED) is an ideal setting to target an intervention aimed at&#xD;
      increasing LCS uptake because the patient populations most in need are available for&#xD;
      intervention. Our team has been at the forefront of ED-based cancer prevention efforts,&#xD;
      serving as investigators on preventive work on cervical cancer and smoking cessation. EDs&#xD;
      care for a disproportionate number of patients with the socio-economic factors that are&#xD;
      associated with vulnerability to non-adherence with LCS including non-White race, lower&#xD;
      income, and lack of health insurance. Moreover, smoking accounts for 90% of all lung cancer&#xD;
      and ED patients have a higher smoking prevalence than the general population. In addition, ED&#xD;
      visits generally involve periods of waiting during which preventive health needs can be&#xD;
      assessed and intervened upon. LCS is a complex process - it is more than just an imaging&#xD;
      study. However, the first critical step is to engage high-risk patients with this process.&#xD;
      USPSTF has emphasized the importance of &quot;pathways besides referral from primary care&quot; to the&#xD;
      success of this effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of Americans - 95% - own a cell phone and an estimated 98% of all cell&#xD;
      phones have SMS capabilities. Importantly, while there still exists a &quot;digital divide&quot; with&#xD;
      regards to home computing among Americans of different backgrounds, phone ownership is nearly&#xD;
      identical among white, black, and Hispanic Americans. SMS health interventions have been&#xD;
      studied for over a decade and have been proven effective for a wide range of applications&#xD;
      including smoking cessation, diabetes self care, and breast cancer screening. SMS&#xD;
      interventions are low-cost, not staff-intensive, simple, familiar, scalable, tailorable to&#xD;
      individuals, instantaneous in delivery, asynchronous in receipt, reproducible, and accessible&#xD;
      regardless of geographical or socioeconomic factors. Our project adapts and targets this&#xD;
      effective technology to improve LCS uptake among ED patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An empirically supported theoretical framework is central to developing an effective&#xD;
      behavioral intervention, particularly in a setting like the ED where a long-term therapeutic&#xD;
      relationship cannot be leveraged. The proposed trial makes use of two complementary theories:&#xD;
      the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The TPB posits that&#xD;
      the strongest predictor of a behavior is the intention to engage in the behavior. These&#xD;
      intentions are predicted by an individual's attitudes toward the behavior, subjective&#xD;
      normative beliefs about the behavior, and perceived control over whether they can perform the&#xD;
      behavior. SDT states that individuals are motivated to engage in behaviors that satisfy the&#xD;
      needs for (a) autonomy, (b) competence, and (c) relatedness. Individuals are autonomously&#xD;
      motivated when these needs are met, which leads to engagement in a behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will utilize a randomized, prospectively collected, convenience sample and&#xD;
      a longitudinal design with a sample size of 366 recruited from urban and rural UR Medicine&#xD;
      EDs. Research enrollers will determine adherence of patients to USPSTF LCS recommendations&#xD;
      using an adaptive REDCap survey. Non-adherent patients will be randomized to intervention or&#xD;
      control conditions, with patients in the intervention condition receiving a series of&#xD;
      theory-informed text messages encouraging them to contact their primary care provider and the&#xD;
      UR LCS Program's Patient Navigator to coordinate screening, along with contact information to&#xD;
      do so. Follow-up to determine LCS program uptake (primary outcome) will occur at 150 days, at&#xD;
      which time feedback will also be solicited.&#xD;
