  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Nonspecific Low back Pain (NLBP) is a common symptom in today's society. It causes&#xD;
      serious health and economic burdens. Low back pain can be attributed to excessive physical&#xD;
      exertion or trauma, resulting in damage or degradation of the vertebrae, intervertebral&#xD;
      discs, or spinal muscles and nonspecific low back pain typically can account for 90% of the&#xD;
      patients with 35 to 55 years old. Some guidelines endorse the cautious use of medication and&#xD;
      surgery and take nonpharmacological and noninvasive treatments as a first-line treatment,&#xD;
      including routine health education, exercise, psychotherapy, and physical therapies, owing to&#xD;
      the risk of trauma and the cost. With a long history, Tuina is a one of the common&#xD;
      nonsurgical methods to treat LBP in China.. The effect of Tuina is attributed to relaxing&#xD;
      muscles and tendons, improving circulation, regulating spinal balance, decreasing edema and&#xD;
      aseptic inflammation. Many clinical reports have confirmed its effectiveness, but more&#xD;
      clinical trials are required to provide evidence of Tuina for low back pain. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study was designed to compare the effectiveness of Tuina with Flurbiprofen Cataplasms for&#xD;
      patients with low back pain on the basis treatment of health education and self-management&#xD;
      exercise at home.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, assessor- and analyst-blinded randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      conducted in Beijing, China, at Dongzhimen hospital affiliated to Beijing university of&#xD;
      Chinese medicine. In total, 90 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to a Tuina&#xD;
      group and a Flurbiprofen Cataplasms group in a 1:1 ratio. The Chinese Tuina group will be&#xD;
      given twice per week for 14 days, and medicine group will be given Flurbiprofen Cataplasms&#xD;
      twice daily for 14 days. We will ask some researchers who are blinded to assignment to&#xD;
      accomplish the outcome assignment and statistical analyses independently. The outcome will be&#xD;
      measured by three self-report questionnaires, which can reflect the lumbar dysfunction, pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, and adverse events. Four time points will be used to assess outcomes,&#xD;
      including baseline, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days after randomization.&#xD;

The waist will be focused on to manipulate preferentially and then using the same technique on the patient's back, buttocks and lower limbs. Secondly, the physician will perform the manipulation on the patient's waist and the posterolateral side of the lower limbs by pressing, kneading, plucking. The doctors press the acupoints, including Mingmen(DU04),Shenshu(BL23),Yaoyangguan(DU03),Huantiao(GB30), Weizhong(BL40),Chengshan(BL57),and Ashi points, with the elbow or the thumb to achieve Deqi sensation. Thirdly, the The doctor uses the method of pressing acupoints, including Tianshu(ST25),Qichong(ST30),Chongmen(SP12),Daimai(GB26),Jingmen(GB25) on both sides. Fourthly, the patient is required to face the doctor in a lateral position for pulling manipulation on the both sides of lumbar vertebrae.</description>
