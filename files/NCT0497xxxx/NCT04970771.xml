  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high incidence of burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation among Canadian&#xD;
      healthcare providers (HCPs), there is an urgent need to support wellness through&#xD;
      strengthening peer networks and engaging key stakeholders. This project will explore the&#xD;
      capacity of digital tools to educate HCPs and enable them to support their mental health. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate specific research questions: Are HCPs more aware of their&#xD;
      wellness needs? Did burnout and stress decrease? Do HCPs feel more supported by their peers?&#xD;
      The overarching objective is to contribute towards a culture prioritizing HCP wellbeing. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to achieve this through two outcome-oriented objectives: 1) to create&#xD;
      resources to promote HCP wellbeing and 2) to foster a web-based HCP community. This&#xD;
      initiative integrates big data tools, interactive online content, and the Solving Healthcare&#xD;
      podcast to improve HCP wellness. It is anticipated that HCPs will become more aware of their&#xD;
      wellness needs, and once they are able to identify strategies to live healthier work lives,&#xD;
      cultural changes will take place, leading to a new attitude surrounding HCP mental health. To&#xD;
      complete these objectives, resources will be drawn from the HELP-MD physician database and an&#xD;
      advisory circle, and will be disseminated via a web platform and the widely known Solving&#xD;
      Healthcare podcast. The project's significance stems from the changes it will incite in both&#xD;
      individuals and health care institutions, inspiring long term changes in workplace culture&#xD;
      and teaching the next generation that a balanced work life is attainable.&#xD;

    <description>As measured by the administration of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) at Months 1 and 12 of the intervention phase. The MBI is a 22 question survey which evaluates 3 subscales; emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. Each question is rated from 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree. A high score on the emotional exhaustion subscale (27+) coupled with a high score on the depersonalization scale (10+) indicates that the individual may be experiencing 1+ symptoms of burnout.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the administration of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at Months 1 and 12 of the intervention phase. The PSS consists of 10 questions, answered on a scale of 0-4 depending on the frequency of which the behavior is observed, with 0 indicating &quot;never&quot; and 4 indicating &quot;very often&quot;. Overall, a score of 0 indicates low stress, while a score of 40 indicates an individual with high perceived stress levels.</description>
