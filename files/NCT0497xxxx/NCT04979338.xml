  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the current standard-of-care pain treatment regimen options that are&#xD;
      available to patients who undergo gender-affirming surgery. The purpose of this research is&#xD;
      to determine if any of these options are more (versus less) effective than the others to&#xD;
      manage surgery related pain, after surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in peri-operative pain location and intensity over time, as measured by anatomic pain maps</measure>
    <time_frame>Any time pain is experienced, starting on the morning of post-operative Day 1 to End of Study at the final post-operative visit (average of 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior and posterior illustrations of the body, with pre-defined areas involved in surgery that may be circled, will be used to define pain location. Pain scores for each circled area will be measured on a Likert-scale between 0-10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain experienced in respondent's life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in opioid consumption per 24 hours, measured by total inpatient and total outpatient</measure>
    <time_frame>Per 24 hours, starting on post-operative Day 1 to End of Study at the final post-operative visit (average of 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Inpatient opioid consumption will be obtained from hospital records. Outpatient opioid consumption will be determined from completed medication logs. Opioid consumption will be measured per 24 hours, by hospital location (e.g., PACU versus Ward), and by post-operative day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the opioid side effect of urinary retention, as indicated by time to spontaneous voiding</measure>

    <description>Recorded time to spontaneous voiding will be collected from hospital records.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the opioid side effect of urinary retention, as measured by a Urinary Bother Symptom Score Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative visit, Discharge (average of 7 days after surgery), and End of Study/final post-operative visit (average of 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>A Urinary Bother Symptom Score Questionnaire, obtained from the American Urological Association, will assess the frequency of different urinary problems, such as incomplete emptying, intermittency, and urgency. Each urinary problem will be measured on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating &quot;none/not at all&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;almost always.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the opioid side effect of decreased GI motility and ileus, as indicated by number of post-operative days until commencement of regular passage of flatus</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative Day 1 to Discharge (average of 7 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Recorded number of post-operative days until commencement of regular passage of flatus will be obtained from hospital records.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the opioid side effect of nausea, as indicated by number of post-operative days to toleration of liquid diet and regular diet, as well as reported experience of nausea</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative Day 1 to Discharge (average of 7 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Recorded number of post-operative days and experience of nausea will be obtained from hospital records.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative length of inpatient stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative Day 1 to Discharge (average of 7 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Length of inpatient stay will be obtained from hospital records as the recorded number of days spent inpatient after surgery</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global satisfaction with respect to pain and physical comfort, as measured by a Quality of Recovery 15-Item Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily, starting on the morning of post-operative Day 1 to End of Study at the final post-operative visit (average of 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Questions 1-10 will assess global well-being and physical comfort, such as ability to return to work or usual home activities, feeling rested, ability to enjoy food, and general feelings of well-being. These questions will be rated on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 indicating none of the time (poor) and 10 indicating all of the time (excellent).&#xD;
Questions 11-15 will assess pain and physical comfort, such as presence of moderate/severe pain, nausea or vomiting, worried or anxious feelings, and sad or depressed feelings. These questions will be rated on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 indicating all of the time (poor) and 10 indicating none of the time (excellent).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of treatment complications</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (average of 30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment complications, such as hematoma, infection, etc., will only include those that are determined to be related to the study treatment.</description>
