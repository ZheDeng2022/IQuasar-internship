  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a complex condition affecting men worldwide. Diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM) is one of the most common causes of ED. The prevalence of ED in DM varies around 35-85%.&#xD;
      Recently, stem cell therapy has started to become the focus of experimental and clinical&#xD;
      studies for the treatment of ED. Stem cells have been shown to be able to regenerate&#xD;
      functionally damaged tissue, depending on the stimuli or signals received. Stem cells studies&#xD;
      in experimental animals have been carried out using biomarker parameters, including VEGF,&#xD;
      Bcl-2, E-selectin, cGMP, eNOS and have been shown to be successful in increasing cell&#xD;
      survival and angiogenesis, stimulating antiapoptotic, proneurogenic, proinflammatory, and&#xD;
      antifibrotic effects and improvements to these biomarker parameters. This study aims to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy, mechanism of action, and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells as a therapy for ED due to type 2 diabetes in human.&#xD;

      Prior to conducting clinical trials, researchers asked for written informed consent. If the&#xD;
      subject agrees, the study will direct the subject and control to collect basic data in the&#xD;
      form of vital signs, blood pressure, filling out the IIEF-5 questionnaire, complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and total testosterone, biomarker&#xD;
      examination (E-Selectin), VEGF, Bcl-2, miRNA 16, miRNA 126), and penile Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction was made on the basis of an IIEF-5 score &lt;22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Penile Doppler ultrasound was performed by a senior radiologist with interpretation of the&#xD;
      ultrasound images performed and reported in a blinded fashion (the reader/interpreter does&#xD;
      not know the patient's complaints). Penile Doppler ultrasound examination was performed under&#xD;
      flaccid conditions and post-sexual stimulation conditions. Prior to the examination, the&#xD;
      patient was given sildenafil 100 mg orally, then the flaccid phase was examined. Patients&#xD;
      were asked to perform sexual stimulation of themselves and measurements were taken&#xD;
      afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel with the patient recruitment, stem cells processing was carried out based on the&#xD;
      production method using xeno-free material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline, patient receive intracavernous injection procedure, as a following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The base of the penis is clamped with ethiloop before the injection is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intracavernous injection was performed in each body of 7.5 x 10^6 cells/1cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clamps are removed after 30 minutes post-injection to increase stem cell residency and&#xD;
           grafting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure, we monitor the symptoms for 1 hour to assess the presence or absence of&#xD;
      complications before the subject can go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also administer PDE-5 inhibitor to all research subjects, namely tadalafil at a dose of 1&#xD;
      x 2.5 mg for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up was carried out on all subjects both from the experimental group and the control&#xD;
      group by evaluating parameters consisting of IIEF-5, DPL, Lipid profile, HbA1c, GDS, total&#xD;
      testosterone, Doppler ultrasound, e-selectin, Bcl-2, VEGF, miRNA 16, miRNA 126 at first and&#xD;
      third month after baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all data have been collected, we will perform data analysis and make research report.&#xD;
