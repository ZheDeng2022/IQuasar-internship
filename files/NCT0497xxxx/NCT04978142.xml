  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the awareness of a sound in the ear or head without any outside source. It&#xD;
      affects around 15% of people in the UK. About 20% of people with tinnitus experience symptoms&#xD;
      that negatively affect their quality of life including sleep disturbances, difficulties with&#xD;
      hearing and concentration, social isolation, anxiety, depression, irritation or stress. Most&#xD;
      common clinical management strategies for tinnitus include education and advice combined with&#xD;
      some form of sound therapy. The effects of these management options are, however, variable.&#xD;
      Currently, the exact aetiology of tinnitus is unknown although maladaptive plasticity due to&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss is thought to play a big role. Neuroimaging studies have pointed&#xD;
      to over-activation or excessive spontaneous activity within the central auditory cortex.&#xD;
      Furthermore, electrophysiological techniques have confirmed the frontal cortex's role in&#xD;
      tinnitus through dysfunctional top-down modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neurostimulation technique in which weak&#xD;
      currents (1-2 mA's) are delivered to the brain, thereby depolarising or hyperpolarising&#xD;
      neurons within the desired region of cortex. tDCS is a non-invasive and easy to apply tool,&#xD;
      delivered by applying two surface electrode to a patients head. It has previously been used&#xD;
      as a treatment for depression, stroke rehabilitation, and cognitive enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have indicated potential benefit of tDCS in tinnitus patients, but this has not&#xD;
      yet been investigated within the UK. Neuromodulation therapies should deliver a permanent&#xD;
      reduction in tinnitus percept by driving the neuroplastic changes necessary to interrupt&#xD;
      abnormal levels of oscillatory cortical activity and restore typical levels of activity. This&#xD;
      change in activity should alter or interrupt the tinnitus percept (reduce or extinguish) and&#xD;
      this should be concomitant with a change in the level of self-reported tinnitus handicap. The&#xD;
      currently ongoing Cochrane review of neuromodulation (desynchronisation) for tinnitus in&#xD;
      adults found mixed evidence for the electrical stimulation therapies for tinnitus, including&#xD;
      tDCS. However, the review also found that the most recent tDCS trials that have used greater&#xD;
      numbers of treatment sessions found significant reductions in tinnitus symptom severity,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression. Authors concluded that these findings warrant further trials of&#xD;
      tDCS. Research studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG)&#xD;
      suggested changes in oscillatory activity in different frequency bands that might be&#xD;
      associated with tinnitus, however a consistent picture has not yet emerged. Reduction of this&#xD;
      abnormal activity might signify a reduction in the level or perceived severity of TI and&#xD;
      could potentially be used as a valuable indicator of the course of TI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project specific changes in brain activity that happen during a new treatment&#xD;
      approach for tinnitus - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)- will be investigated.&#xD;
      This will help to determine how the treatment might work, whether specific brain activity may&#xD;
      be a meaningful biological indicator or objective measure of tinnitus, and provide a reliable&#xD;
      measure of treatment-related change; this has not yet been achieved in tinnitus research but&#xD;
      is crucial.&#xD;

      Data collection session will involve the participant completing the Tinnitus Functional Index&#xD;
      (TFI) and Demographics and Tinnitus History Questionnaire (D&amp;THQ), which will provide the&#xD;
      investigators with information about their personal tinnitus history including subjective&#xD;
      characteristics such as loudness. The D&amp;THQ consists of questions selected from the European&#xD;
      School for Interdisciplinary Tinnitus Research Screening Questionnaire (ESIT-SQ).&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a standard hearing test, which will inform the investigators of any&#xD;
      hearing loss. The participant's head shape will be digitized to aid in the spatial&#xD;
      localization of the MEG signal. The participant will then undergo 40 minutes of MEG scanning&#xD;
      (10 minutes of resting state without tDCS, 20 minutes of resting state MEG with either active&#xD;
      or sham tDCS, and then another 10 minutes of resting state MEG without tDCS. The first 10&#xD;
      minutes will serve as a baseline of resting state oscillatory brain activity. The concurrent&#xD;
      tDCS and MEG recording will allow the investigators to observe changes in oscillatory brain&#xD;
      activity during tDCS. The last 10 minutes of MEG recording will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      see whether any changes in oscillatory activity persist after the stimulation ends. After the&#xD;
      MEG recording has finished, the participant will undergo an anatomical MRI scan. This will&#xD;
      allow the investigators to take the participants' individual brain morphology into account&#xD;
      when analysing the source of the MEG signal.&#xD;

    <description>Non-invasive neuromodulation employing a direct current, applied using a DC STIMULATOR PLUS manufactured by NeuroConn Technology by NeuroCare. This is a micro-processor-controlled constant current source. It meets the highest safety standards thanks to (hardware- and software-based) multistage monitoring of the current path. By continuously monitoring electrode impedance it can detect insufficient contact with the skin and automatically terminate stimulation. This is a reliable method of avoiding any injury to the patient.</description>
