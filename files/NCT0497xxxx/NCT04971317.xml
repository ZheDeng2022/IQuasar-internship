  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with the development of obesity,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, and dental caries. The current study attempts to explore whether an&#xD;
      educational, science-based intervention is able to produce a measurable negative change in&#xD;
      preferences for sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as initiate plans to reduce future SSB&#xD;
      consumption in 12-year old children. In the first condition (SSB Intervention), participants&#xD;
      will watch a video showing the decay of an egg in various SSBs (Coca-Cola, Sprite, Gatorade,&#xD;
      and apple juice), followed by the evaporation of these beverages over a heat source,&#xD;
      revealing their sugar content. In the second condition (Water Intervention), participants&#xD;
      will watch a video showing an egg maintaining its shell in water, followed by the evaporation&#xD;
      of water. In the third condition (Control), participants will watch a video of an egg&#xD;
      maintaining its shell in rubbing alcohol, followed by the evaporation of rubbing alcohol.&#xD;
      Before and after watching their assigned video, participants will complete survey questions&#xD;
      to assess self-reported: SSB consumption intentions, attitudes toward SSBs, and health&#xD;
      perceptions of SSBs. Therefore, the aims of this study are to (1) quantify changes in SSB&#xD;
      consumption intentions, attitudes towards SSBs, and health perceptions of SSBs from pre-video&#xD;
      to post-video, (2) establish the effectiveness of the SSB Intervention and Water Intervention&#xD;
      over the control, (3) establish the effectiveness of the SSB Intervention over the Water&#xD;
      Intervention, (4) determine the efficacy of incorporating scientific evidence in a public&#xD;
      health intervention, and (5) make recommendations for the future application of the method&#xD;
      employed in this intervention to future public health campaigns.&#xD;

    <description>Measurement of how often participants consume various SSBs using the following questions: 1) During the past 30 days, how often did you drink regular soda or pop that contains sugar (such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sprite, Mountain Dew, 7Up, Dr. Pepper, Ginger Ale, Fanta, etc.)? Do not include diet soda or diet pop. 2) During the past 30 days, how often did you drink sports drinks (such as Gatorade, Powerade, Vitamin Water, etc.)? Do not include diet drinks or artificially sweetened drinks. 3) During the past 30 days, how often did you drink sugar-sweetened fruit drinks (such as Kool-aid, lemonade, cranberry juice, etc.)? Do not include 100% fruit juice.&#xD;
