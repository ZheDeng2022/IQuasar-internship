  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is primarily to evaluate the professional practices over the last years&#xD;
      in the pediatric emergencies of the Nancy's Hospital for the BATiC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This, in order to identify the traumatic mechanisms and the initial clinical elements which&#xD;
      would make it possible to detect the patients at low risk of developing visceral lesions.&#xD;
      Then, a management could be proposed which would rationalize the use of additional&#xD;
      examinations and would favor the monitoring and the clinical reassessment after the initial&#xD;
      management of a minor trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the data will then aim to establish a composite score (anamnestic and clinical)&#xD;
      of initial evaluation, from which could result a uniform management protocol (clinical,&#xD;
      biological and imaging) of the minor BATiC, of the intermediate BATiC and the major BATiC,&#xD;
      applicable to pediatric emergencies at the Nancy's Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For children aged 1 to 18, trauma is one of the leading causes of death, ahead of cancer and&#xD;
      congenital malformations. The traumatic mechanisms are mainly accidents on public roads (car&#xD;
      accidents, two-wheel accidents, accidents involving a pedestrian), sports accidents&#xD;
      (especially cycling and horse riding), falls from a high height or onto a blunt object, and&#xD;
      intentional or unintentional direct hits. Mortality is mainly correlated with involvement of&#xD;
      the skull, thorax and abdomen and there is a clear male predominance (sex ratio 2 to 3 boys /&#xD;
      1 girl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, blunt abdominal trauma in children (BATiC) is a frequent reason for consultation&#xD;
      in pediatric emergencies. It accounts for 20 to 30% of childhood trauma, among which 10 to&#xD;
      30% result in potentially life-threatening intra-abdominal injuries (IAI). In order of&#xD;
      frequency, the organs most affected are the spleen, the liver, kidneys and the pancreas.&#xD;
      Rarely, hollow organs such as the small intestine, the duodenum, the colon, or the stomach&#xD;
      can be affected. In rarer occasion, sores of the mesentery may be seen to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BATiC is opposed to penetrating abdominal trauma, which accounts for only 5 to 15% of&#xD;
      abdominal trauma in children. It is frequently part of a multiple trauma defined by &quot;a child&#xD;
      who has suffered a trauma whose kinetics are likely to cause at least two lesions, at least&#xD;
      one of which can be life-threatening&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While multiple trauma accounts for only 14% of childhood trauma, it is nonetheless the main&#xD;
      cause of death after the age of 1. For several years, this has motivated the establishment of&#xD;
      emergency treatment protocols under the impetus of the development of &quot;trauma centers&quot;.&#xD;
      Therefore, polytrauma has well-codified diagnostic criteria and precise and systematic&#xD;
      management, applicable to pediatric emergencies. Regarding the isolated BATiC, the management&#xD;
      is less unequivocal. Although it is more frequent, BATiC with low or medium kinetics does not&#xD;
      benefit from any clear management protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the management of a child admitted for BATiC in the pediatric emergency room does not&#xD;
      necessarily take into account the traumatic mechanism. The course of action currently adopted&#xD;
      involves at least an initial clinical evaluation, sometimes repeated after a period of&#xD;
      monitoring. Then it is frequently supplemented by the performance of a blood test and imaging&#xD;
      aimed at detecting possible IAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current practice, some practitioners choose this systematic approach of BATiC, including&#xD;
      complementary examinations from the outset, in order to never ignore an IAI. Others seem to&#xD;
      support a more reserved attitude to the use of complementary exams when the initial&#xD;
      assessment is reassuring. It is clear that many abdominal traumas are not complicated by any&#xD;
      visceral injury. Especially when the traumatic mechanism is minimal and when the initial&#xD;
      clinical evaluation does not identify elements of seriousness. In these different situations,&#xD;
      carrying out additional examinations may indeed seem excessive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a great heterogeneity of BATiC and a strongly practitioner-dependent care&#xD;
      which does not always take into account the minor traumatic mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a validated management protocol for BATiC, as can be the case with polytrauma,&#xD;
      is difficult due to the great diversity of traumatic mechanisms and their variable kinetics.&#xD;
      All the more so since the same mechanism does not systematically expose people to the same&#xD;
      lesions depending on the child's age and its morphological characteristics. It is fundamental&#xD;
      to take into consideration the anatomical and physiological specificities of the growing&#xD;
      child which define his fragility in the face of abdominal trauma. Another difficulty lies in&#xD;
      the anamnestic collection of facts which may be limited due to the child's age, his&#xD;
      apprehension (hospital environment, reaction of the caregiver), the medical context (general&#xD;
      condition, underlying pathology, psychological state) and the social context (particular case&#xD;
      of mistreatment). This is all the more difficult when the trauma is not seen by a third party&#xD;
      at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have already sought to define predictive scores for IAI. These scores are&#xD;
      established after performing additional laboratory tests and almost always include performing&#xD;
      an abdominal ultrasound. They have the advantage of reducing the use of the scanner, thus&#xD;
      exposure to ionizing rays, but do not simplify the management of minor trauma for which it&#xD;
      would be possible not to perform additional examinations at all, if they are defined&#xD;
      beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study of the anamnestic and clinical elements of patients without any IAI could&#xD;
      allow the identification of clinical situations in which the performance of complementary&#xD;
      examinations is not necessary. In this way, the course of action for minor trauma could be&#xD;
      simplified by promoting surveillance and clinical reassessment rather than the routine use of&#xD;
      additional tests, thereby reducing the time spent in the pediatric emergency room.&#xD;
