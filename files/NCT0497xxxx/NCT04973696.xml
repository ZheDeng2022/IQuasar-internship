  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized feasibility trial of the Toolkit for Optimal Recovery after&#xD;
      Orthopedic Injury (TOR), a mind-body program to prevent persistent pain and disability in&#xD;
      at-risk patients with acute orthopedic injury, versus a minimally-enhanced usual care (MEUC)&#xD;
      control. TOR is a 4-session program delivered via secure live video to patients at risk for&#xD;
      chronic pain, 1-2 months after an orthopedic traumatic injury. The primary aim of this study&#xD;
      is to determine whether the study methodology (i.e., implementation, randomization,&#xD;
      procedures and assessment of outcome measures) and delivery of TOR meet a priori set&#xD;
      benchmarks for feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness, necessary for the success of&#xD;
      the subsequent efficacy trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care of patients with acute orthopedic injuries follows an outdated biomedical model, and&#xD;
      consists primarily of surgical interventions and pain medications, despite strong evidence&#xD;
      for the pivotal role of psychosocial factor in transition to persistent pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed the first mind-body program - The Toolkit for Optimal Recovery after orthopedic&#xD;
      injury (TOR) - to prevent chronic pain and disability in at-risk patients with orthopedic&#xD;
      injuries. TOR is based on the fear avoidance model and teaches skills (e.g., mindfulness and&#xD;
      relaxation, adaptive thinking, acceptance) to help optimize recovery. Each TOR session is 45&#xD;
      minutes long, and there are 4 sessions delivered within a period of 4-5 weeks (TOR and&#xD;
      control arm will be yoked for the timing of interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective is to conduct a multi-site feasibility RCT of TOR&#xD;
      versus MEUC control in order to determine whether the study methodology and TOR meet a priori&#xD;
      set benchmarks necessary for the success of the subsequent efficacy trial. There are 5&#xD;
      primary outcomes: 1. Feasibility of recruitment (assessed by number of participants who agree&#xD;
      to participate); 2. Appropriateness (assessed with the Credibility and Expectancy Scale); 3.&#xD;
      Feasibility of data collection (self-report; assessed by number of participants who complete&#xD;
      these measures at the 3 time points); 4. Treatment satisfaction (assessed with the Client&#xD;
      Satisfaction Scale); and 5. Acceptability of TOR (adherence to sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We expect that TOR will meet all a priori set benchmarks at each of the 3 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 27 secondary outcomes. All will be reported separately for each site (see&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, 180 patients with acute orthopedic injuries from the Level I Trauma&#xD;
      Centers at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), Dell Medical School (Austin, TX), and&#xD;
      the University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY) who are at risk for chronic pain and disability&#xD;
      will be enrolled. After consent and baseline assessments, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to TOR or to a minimally enhanced usual care control (MEUC). Subjects in the TOR&#xD;
      group undergo a 4-week session (~45 minutes each), individual, live video, synchronous&#xD;
      mind-body intervention. The MEUC group will receive a pamphlet containing brief summarized&#xD;
      information that reflects the intervention topics (e.g., the trajectory of pain and recovery&#xD;
      after orthopedic illness). In addition, participants in both groups will receive usual&#xD;
      medical care as determined by the medical team. Participants in both groups will complete&#xD;
      assessments at baseline, after the completion of TOR, and 3 months (from baseline) later.&#xD;

    <description>The Toolkit (TOR) is a 4-session, individual, live video, synchronous program developed specifically for patients with orthopedic acute injuries who are at risk for chronic pain and disability. The program teaches evidence-based mind-body skills (e.g., relaxation and mindfulness; myths about pain; activity pacing; acceptance and values based goal setting). Participants gain access to a website downloaded on their phones as an app. The website included explainer videos of skills and recordings of mindfulness and relaxation exercises.
