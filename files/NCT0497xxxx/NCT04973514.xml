    <textblock>
      Due to better medical care, a growing number of patients with congenital heart disease reach&#xD;
      adulthood. A large number of these patients needs a redo cardiac surgery. No guidelines of&#xD;
      best transfusion practice exist for this patient population. A retrospective analysis of all&#xD;
      adult patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery between 2000 and 2020&#xD;
      will be performed. Transfusion practices and their influence on outcome at 30 days and 6&#xD;
      month will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: About 1% of newborns in Belgium have a congenital heart defect. The improvement&#xD;
      of intra- and postoperative treatment and the development of new surgical techniques have&#xD;
      allowed an increasing management of congenital heart pathologies, making it possible to&#xD;
      successfully treat approximately 95% of children with these conditions. The increase in life&#xD;
      expectancy of these children has resulted in an ever-increasing proportion of this population&#xD;
      reaching adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with congenital heart disease, particularly cyanotic conditions, require&#xD;
      specialized follow-up in a referral center, given the risk of late complications related to&#xD;
      correction or palliation of the primary condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reoperations in adulthood pose a number of challenges for the multidisciplinary team managing&#xD;
      these patients: more complex surgical approach (adhesions, altered in situ anatomy,&#xD;
      development of collateral circulation, persistence of intra- or extra-cardiac shunts...). The&#xD;
      operative risk but also the infectious risk are clearly increased in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of bleeding, which is already high in cardiac surgery, particularly due to the use&#xD;
      of extracorporeal circulation, is also increased by the re-intervention itself. This is&#xD;
      potentially accompanied by greater exposure to allogeneic blood products, which has been&#xD;
      associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various techniques have been developed to reduce the risk of bleeding in cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      including the use of anti-fibrinolytic agents, avoidance of deep hypothermia, reduction of&#xD;
      vascular filling to avoid excessive hemodilution, and application of a permissive hypotension&#xD;
      and restrictive transfusion strategy. The ultimate goal of integrating these techniques into&#xD;
      our transfusion practices is to improve patient outcomes by reducing exposure to blood&#xD;
      products. There are currently no recommendations on good transfusion practices for the&#xD;
      management of these patients with congenital heart disease who require cardiac&#xD;
      re-intervention in adulthood. There are also few studies specific to this population in the&#xD;
      current literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective of the study is to analyze, in our center, if the transfusion&#xD;
      practices (measures to decrease the risk of bleeding, transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs)&#xD;
      and/or blood derivatives), in patients who have had a re-intervention of congenital heart&#xD;
      surgery, are determinant to reduce morbidity and mortality in the following 30 days and 6&#xD;
      months Type of study and design: Retrospective and descriptive study by extraction of&#xD;
      patients who underwent cardiac surgery, at the Brugmann University Hospital, between the year&#xD;
      2000 to the year 2020, by analysis of the medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Grown-up congenital heart disease patients re-operated from cardiac surgery between&#xD;
      January 2000 to December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All patients with congenital heart disease reoperated from a new cardiac&#xD;
      surgery under extracorporeal circulation, at Brugmann University Hospital, between the year&#xD;
      2000 to the year 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients with cardiac surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass, patients&#xD;
      with acquired heart disease, patients who had a re-intervention due to a complication within&#xD;
      30 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation: Descriptive analyses will be used and further analyses will be&#xD;
      performed based on preliminary results and hypotheses raised. The patients' data will be put&#xD;
      in an anonymized file and analyzed later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables to be collected: demographic data; type of procedure; personal history of the&#xD;
      patient; clinical symptomatology; pre-op, intra-op and post-op treatment; complementary pre-,&#xD;
      per-, and post-op examinations (radiological, laboratories), operative data (surgical&#xD;
      procedure performed, blood loss, blood component transfusion (red blood cells, platelets,&#xD;
      plasma), fluid balance, use of anti-fibrinolytics) ; hemodynamic monitoring (intraoperative&#xD;
      vital parameters), duration of cardiopulmonary bypasss (CPB) time, aortic clamping time,&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative complications, death, length of stay in intensive care and&#xD;
      total length of stay.&#xD;
