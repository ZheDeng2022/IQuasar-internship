  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of capsulotomy assisted by intraocular&#xD;
      caliper and Verion navigation system in phacoemulsification surgery and postoperative visual&#xD;
      quality for age-related cataract patients with corneal limbus opacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) is an important and technically challenging&#xD;
      procedure in cataract surgery. Too large or too small capsulorhexis can increase the&#xD;
      incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the image projection device Verion navigation system has been reported that&#xD;
      it can improve the repeatability and accuracy of capsulorhexis via projecting a pre-set size&#xD;
      ring to guide capsulorhexis. However, we found that for the patients with corneal geriatric&#xD;
      ring, pterygium or limbal lesions leading to unclear limbal boundary, the projected&#xD;
      capsulorhexis will deviate from the center, resulting in capsulorhexis is off center in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Our self-developed intraocular caliper, which is modified on the&#xD;
      conventional intraocular irrigation needle, can accurately measure the size of capsulorhexis,&#xD;
      and mark the position and boundary of capsulorhexis on the lens anterior capsule to guide&#xD;
      capsulorhexis, thus significantly improves the accuracy and centricity of capsulorhexis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the centricity and accuracy of intraocular&#xD;
      caliper-assisted capsulorhexis in phacoemulsification for age-related cataract patients with&#xD;
      corneal limbus opacity with that of Verion projection navigation system.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome was the distance between pupil center and capsulorhexis center. Clear images of the edges of IOL and capsulorhexis were taken at the end of the operation, and Image J image analysis software is used to measure the distance between pupil center and capsulorhexis center with the diameter of IOL optical surface (6 mm) as the reference by two independently professional graders at the meantime.</description>

    <description>Ideal capsulorhexis is defined as a centered and round capsulorhexis , which can cover the edge of IOL optical surface continuously for 360 degrees with a diameter between 5.0 to 5.5 mm.</description>

    <description>In intraocular caliper-assisted capsulotomy group, a modified intraocular caliper with standard calibration on the rinse needle was used to measure and locate the position of capsulorhexis with 5.3 mm diameter and the principle of pupillary margin in concentric circles. The surgeon could gently use the blunt needle in the front of the intraocular caliper to further make corresponding markers on the lens anterior capsule, and then carry out capsulotomy according to the marks.</description>
