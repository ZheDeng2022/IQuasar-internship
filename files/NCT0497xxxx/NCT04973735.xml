        No abnormality, or no clinically significant abnormality in vital signs, physical&#xD;
        examination, laboratory tests, and 12-lead ECG in Chinese healthy subjects during the&#xD;
        screening period.&#xD;

        Female patients of childbearing potential (defined as female subjects who do not receive&#xD;
        any operative sterilization or who had been through menopause for less than 1 year) must&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Those who have had surgery within 8 weeks prior to screening or who have surgery planned&#xD;
        during the trial, and the investigator believes that such surgery may bring potential risks&#xD;

        drug, or similar drugs, or subjects with allergic constitution (previously sensitive to ≥ 2&#xD;
        foods or drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with any positive test of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;

        months prior to screening. Tobacco abuse is defined as: smoking ≥5 cigarettes per day on&#xD;
        average within 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;

        screening, or pregnant or breast-feeding female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a history of drug addiction or drug abuse, or with positive urine screen test&#xD;
        results for drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects donating whole blood or blood components, or with massive hemorrhage (&gt;400 mL),&#xD;
        within 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or participation in a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing&#xD;
        antibody clinical trial. Participation in any other clinical study with pharmacological&#xD;
        intervention within 3 months prior to screening, or the drug is still within the&#xD;
        elimination period (5 half-lives) prior to screening, whichever is longer. Vaccination&#xD;
        within 12 weeks prior to screening, or planned vaccination during the study and within 12&#xD;
        weeks after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a history of fainting at the sight of blood or puncture. Subjects who are not&#xD;
        suitable to participate in the clinical trial as considered by the investigator or cannot&#xD;
        complete the study for any other reasons.&#xD;
