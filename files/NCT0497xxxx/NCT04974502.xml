    <textblock>
      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the oral neutrophil numbers&#xD;
      (ONN) in saliva, the level of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) in gingival crevicular fluid&#xD;
      (GCF) and the periodontal parameters in smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis, before&#xD;
      and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and method: 40 periodontitis patients including 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. All patients were received the NSPT included instructing oral&#xD;
      hygiene, scaling and root planning. Clinical parameters (plaque index (PlI), gingival index&#xD;
      (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD) and clinical attachment loss&#xD;
      (CAL)), ONN and GCF MMP-8 level were assessed before (baseline) and after NSPT 1 month and 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      After periodontal examination and medical history evaluation, all patients received oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions. The modified-Bass tooth brushing technique, as well as the use of&#xD;
      dental floss and interproximal brushes (if needed) were showed to the patients. They were&#xD;
      educated to brush their teeth at least twice a day. All patients were given a dentifrice and&#xD;
      toothbrush. Patient motivation to quit smoking was also provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, supragingival scaling with ultrasonic scalers (Cavitron Jet Plus (Densply&#xD;
      Sirona, Mississauga, Canada) were provided to all patients. Occlusion adjustments were also&#xD;
      performed in the case of indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week, the baseline (T0) parameters were recorded. The following samples were&#xD;
      collected: (1) saliva, (2) gingival cervical fluid (GCF), and (3) clinical periodontal&#xD;
      parameters. A doctor who collected the samples was blinded about the smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, scaling and root planning (SRP) by ultrasonic scalers (Cavitron Jet Plus&#xD;
      (Densply Sirona, Mississauga, Canada) and Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, USA), under&#xD;
      local anesthesia, were performed by a periodontist, who was also blinded about the smoking&#xD;
      status. The number of SRP visits was determined by patient disease conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of NSPT, all subjects were recalled after one month and three months&#xD;
      for re-evaluation. The collection of (1) saliva, (2) gingival cervical fluid (GCF), and (3)&#xD;
      clinical periodontal parameters were performed. Based on the patients' periodontal status,&#xD;
      supragingival scaling and polishing were given.&#xD;
