  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults, aged 18-75 years, with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether BI 706321 combined with ustekinumab helps&#xD;
      people with Crohn's disease. BI 706321 is a medicine being developed to treat Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. Ustekinumab is a medicine already used to treat Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. One group gets BI 706321&#xD;
      and ustekinumab. The other group gets placebo and ustekinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take BI 706321 or placebo as tablets every day. Placebo tablets look like BI&#xD;
      706321 tablets but do not contain any medicine. Ustekinumab is given as an infusion into a&#xD;
      vein once at the beginning of the study. After that, ustekinumab is given as an injection&#xD;
      under the skin every 2 months. Participants take BI 706321 or placebo in combination with&#xD;
      ustekinumab for 3 months. After that, participants receive only ustekinumab for another 9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are in the study for about 1 year. During this time, they visit the study site&#xD;
      about 13 times. At 3 of the visits, doctors do a colonoscopy to examine the bowel. The&#xD;
      results from the colonoscopies are compared between the 2 groups. The doctors also regularly&#xD;
      check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.&#xD;

             Prior treatment with a somatic cell therapy product (e.g., Alofisel) is not excluded,&#xD;
