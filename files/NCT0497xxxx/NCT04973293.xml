    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery has been recommended as the standard treatment&#xD;
      for locally advanced and resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its efficacy&#xD;
      remains to be improved. Drugs targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been proven to be effective&#xD;
      for late-stage NSCLC, and anti-angiogenesis agents targeting VEGF (bevacizumab) has also been&#xD;
      used for the first line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Therefore, we conduct this&#xD;
      single-arm clinical trial, which aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant sintilimab combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy followed by surgery in&#xD;
      treating locally advanced and resectable NSCLC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies around the world. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgery has been recommended as the standard treatment for locally advanced and&#xD;
      resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its efficacy remains to be improved.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab targeting VEGF is a widely used antitumor drugs in different types of&#xD;
      malignancies, including late-stage NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting PD-1&#xD;
      has also been confirmed to be effective in NSCLC patients. Therefore, we conduct this&#xD;
      prospective single-arm clinical trial, to investigate the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant sintilimab (ICI targeting PD-1) combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by surgery in treating locally advanced and resectable NSCLC. Twenty patients with&#xD;
      stage II-IIIA NSCLC will be enrolled. And the primary endpoint of this study is the safety of&#xD;
      this newly developed neoadjuvant treatment. The secondary endpoints are feasibility,&#xD;
      radiological response and rate of major pathological response.&#xD;
