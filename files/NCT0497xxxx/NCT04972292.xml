    <textblock>
      Subjects aged between 16 and 35 years old, with indicated surgical removal of impacted third&#xD;
      lower molar, will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive the FDC of codeine 30 mg/dipyrone&#xD;
      500 mg from Eurofarma Laboratórios SA (experimental drug) or the FDC of codeine 30&#xD;
      mg/paracetamol 500 mg (Tylex® - Janssen-Cilag Farmacêutica Ltda) as tablets for up to three&#xD;
      (3) days. Subjects whose surgery lasts no more than 40 minutes and showing moderate to&#xD;
      intense postoperative pain up to four (4) hours after surgery will be randomized. The first&#xD;
      study drug administration will take place at the clinical investigation site when the&#xD;
      postsurgical pain becomes moderate/intense (≥ 40 mm at a visual analogue scale [VAS] of 0-100&#xD;
      mm). Then, subjects will be instructed to use the study treatment whenever it is necessary&#xD;
      for pain relief, respecting a minimal interval of six (6) hours between two administrations,&#xD;
      for up to three (3) days (72 hours after the initial dose). Subjects will evaluate the pain&#xD;
      relief using a 5-point categorical scale (0 = no relief, 1 = little relief, 2 = some relief,&#xD;
      3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief) in 1-hour intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6h). The sum&#xD;
      of the relief scores over 6 hours determines the TOTPAR6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: FDC of codeine 30 mg/dipyrone 500 mg from Eurofarma Laboratórios SA (experimental&#xD;
      drug) - Subjects randomized to this group will receive one (1) experimental drug tablet + one&#xD;
      (1) Tylex® placebo tablet when the postoperative pain becomes moderate to intense (≥ 40 mm at&#xD;
      a VAS of 0-100 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Tylex® (codeine 30 mg/paracetamol 500 mg) - Subjects randomized to this group will&#xD;
      receive one (1) Tylex® tablet (codeine 30 mg/paracetamol 500 mg) + one (1) FDC placebo tablet&#xD;
      when the postoperative pain becomes moderate to intense (≥ 40 mm at a VAS of 0-100 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be allowed to use the rescue medication if necessary: Paracetamol 500 mg&#xD;
      (Tylenol® 500 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must have three (3) on-site visits at the research site. Three (3) phone calls&#xD;
      will take place between the on-site visits: Screening visit (Vs), randomization visit (Vr),&#xD;
      first phone call (CT1), second phone call (CT2), third phone call (CT3), final visit (Vf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period for including subjects in the study will start after the required ethical and&#xD;
      regulatory approvals and its estimated duration will be of up to 12 months. The approximate&#xD;
      study duration will be of 9 ± 2 days for each subject.&#xD;
