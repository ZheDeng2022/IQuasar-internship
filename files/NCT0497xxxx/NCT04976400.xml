    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of femoral condyle prosthesis, tibial tray&#xD;
      prosthesis and meniscus prosthesis of semi-individualized total knee replacement prostheses&#xD;
      designed with gender differences; and compare and analyze with the current classic&#xD;
      prostheses, showing gender differences. The designed semi-personalized total knee replacement&#xD;
      prosthesis lays the foundation for clinical application, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared with the classic osteotomy method, compare whether the semi-individualized&#xD;
           total knee arthroplasty with a gender-specific design has advantages and better safety&#xD;
           in the osteotomy method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the difference between the amount of osteotomy in the semi-individualized&#xD;
           total knee arthroplasty designed for gender differences and the amount of classic&#xD;
           osteotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compared with classic prostheses in the market, verify the clinical effects of&#xD;
           semi-individualized total knee replacement prostheses designed for gender differences,&#xD;
           and provide a basis for their clinical promotion and application.&#xD;

      Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into the experimental&#xD;
      group and the control group according to the patient's wishes. Patients in the experimental&#xD;
      group received a semi-individualized total knee replacement treatment with a gender-specific&#xD;
      design. The control group received imported Zimmer total knee replacement prostheses (Zimmer,&#xD;
      Warsaw, IN, USA).&#xD;
