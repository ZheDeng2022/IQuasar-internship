      [Background] Tremor is an important symptom of extrapyramidal diseases, and it is also an&#xD;
      early symptom of a variety of complex diseases. The classification of tremor has not been&#xD;
      completely unified, mainly including essential tremor, Parkinson's disease tremor, etc., each&#xD;
      form of tremor has Crossover and connection make clinical differential diagnosis difficult.&#xD;
      At the same time, many diseases related to tremor lack pathological, serological and imaging&#xD;
      characteristic changes. Therefore, it is particularly important to find accurate and&#xD;
      objective evaluation indicators for tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By recording a pair of antagonist muscles (active muscles and passive muscles),&#xD;
      electromyography can objectively record the type, degree, amplitude, burst pattern (whether&#xD;
      the burst activity of the antagonistic muscles are synchronized or alternate), and&#xD;
      weight-bearing The effect of drugs on tremor is very valuable for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of tremor; especially for patients with Parkinson's disease, it can be&#xD;
      several years or even decades before they develop motor symptoms, that is, tremor, rigidity,&#xD;
      slowness of movement, and postural instability. There are a wide range of non-motor symptoms,&#xD;
      such as smell, mood, sleep, mental behavior and many other aspects. Compared with dyskinesia,&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms are both a precursor to the onset and an indication of disease&#xD;
      progression. Fully understanding and exploring the law of the occurrence and development of&#xD;
      these non-motor symptoms can provide clues for our early diagnosis and provide us with&#xD;
      opportunities for early implementation of neuroprotective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (Pakinson's disease, PD) are often&#xD;
      atypical, and it is difficult to diagnose it only based on the history and clinical&#xD;
      manifestations. However, when the diagnosis is made when the clinical symptoms are obvious,&#xD;
      the patient's substantia nigra dopamine neurons have been reduced by 60-70%, and the&#xD;
      opportunity for early treatment is lost. A Berg study also showed that treatment when most&#xD;
      neurons in the pre-exercise period have not undergone degeneration can better protect the&#xD;
      nerves and may delay the clinical progress of PD. Therefore, early diagnosis and early&#xD;
      treatment of PD patients are particularly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease include motor symptoms and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms (NMS), the latter of which is often ignored by clinicians. It includes common&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms: such as depression, anxiety, apathy, lack of affect, distraction,&#xD;
      and even hallucinations, delusions, delusions, dementia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, panic&#xD;
      attacks; sleep disorders: periodic limb movement disorders, excessive sleep during the day&#xD;
      and so on. Some of these symptoms can appear before the movement disorder of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, some are accompanied by the movement disorder, and some appear in the middle and&#xD;
      late stages of Parkinson's disease, and aggravate with the aggravation of the movement&#xD;
      symptoms. And its NMS is closely related to the severity of the entire disease of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Objective] To explore the significance of tremor analysis in judging the early diagnosis of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discuss the significance of tremor analysis for the prognosis of the disease. To explore the&#xD;
      diagnostic significance of tremor analysis in patients with Parkinson's disease and benign&#xD;
      tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Design] This is a longitudinal study to evaluate the brainstem of patients at different&#xD;
      stages through VEMP neck, masticatory muscle and eye tests on patients with early and&#xD;
      middle-advanced PD (20 cases each) and healthy controls (40 cases) The function of various&#xD;
      parts is affected. At the same time, combining the patient's neurological function score and&#xD;
      non-motor symptom score to find evidence of early involvement and early intervention.&#xD;

        Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affects 1 to 2&#xD;
        percent of patients over 65 years of age. China currently has nearly 2 million patients&#xD;
        with Parkinson's disease, and the number is expected to grow exponentially in the coming&#xD;
        years. The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease include tremor, rigidity,&#xD;
        bradykinesia, postural instability and other motor symptoms. The static tremor is caused by&#xD;
        cerebellum and basal ganglia circuits, which has nothing to do with the number of dopamine&#xD;
        neurons. Treatment with Mdopa can reduce the tremor amplitude of patients, but generally&#xD;
        does not change the tremor frequency.&#xD;
