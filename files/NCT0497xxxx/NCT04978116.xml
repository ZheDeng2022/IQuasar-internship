  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from infection in elderly patients&#xD;
      and an important cause of antibiotic prescription. Its diagnosis is challenging because of&#xD;
      the lack of sensitivity/specificity of symptoms and chest x-ray (CXR) findings and the high&#xD;
      incidence of alternative diagnoses. Hence, the impact of new diagnostic strategies should be&#xD;
      assessed. CT scan findings have shown to impact diagnosis and management and point-of-care&#xD;
      ultrasonography is frequently used for patients with respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to compare the diagnostic, therapeutic, clinical and cost outcomes of&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies based on CXR (standard of care), low-dose CT scan (LDCT) or lung US&#xD;
      (LUS) in patients &gt;65 years old with suspected pneumonia at the emergency room (ER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate whether a diagnostic strategy using LDCT compared with CXR&#xD;
      leads to a more accurate diagnosis in suspected pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To evaluate 1) whether a diagnostic strategy using LUS compared with&#xD;
      CXR leads to a more accurate diagnosis, or LUS compared with LDCT, 2) the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of CXR, LDCT and LUS, 3) whether a diagnostic strategy leads to a decrease in&#xD;
      antibiotic consumption and 4) a change in clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      transfer to intensive care unit, intra-hospital mortality, 1 and 3-month readmission, 1 and&#xD;
      3-month mortality), 5) to evaluate concordance between physicians at the ER and experts and&#xD;
      6) the association of biomarkers and the presence of an infiltrate, 7) to understand which&#xD;
      factors affect physician confidence in their diagnosis Methods: multicentric individual-level&#xD;
      randomized superiority clinical trial with 3 parallel arms. CXR, LDCT and LUS will be&#xD;
      performed in all included patients. According to the arm, the results of 2 imaging modalities&#xD;
      will be masked to the patients, the investigators and the outcome assessors. Unblinding will&#xD;
      be done on day 5. In case of subsequent clinical deterioration, the physician will be able to&#xD;
      order new imaging and in case of an emergency finding, the concealed results will be&#xD;
      unblinded earlier. At the end of the study, the reference diagnosis will be determined by a&#xD;
      panel of experts using all available data, including all imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enrol 165 patients in each arm for a total of 495 with a power of&#xD;
      0.9, within 2 years of recruitment (approval by the ethical committee of Geneva: 2019-01288).&#xD;

    <measure>Accuracy of the clinician's diagnosis of pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the patient is discharged from the Emergency Room (Day 0 -an average of 10 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The probability of pneumonia will be rated by the clinician in charge, before the patient is discharged from the Emergency Room, on a 3-level Likert scale (&quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;high&quot;).The probability of pneumonia will be rated by the panel of experts a posteriori on the same scale. For the primary outcome, a diagnosis of pneumonia will be positive if the probability is rated &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;high&quot; and negative if the probability is rated &quot;low&quot;. The accuracy will be the proportion of patients with a clinician's diagnosis (either negative or positive) matching with the panel of experts' diagnosis which is considered as the reference. Grouping the levels &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;high&quot; makes sense from a medical decision making perspective since a patient rated &quot;intermediate&quot; will be treated with antibiotics in the same way as a patient rated &quot;high&quot;. In a secondary analysis, the diagnosis of pneumonia will be considered positive only if the probability is rated &quot;high&quot;.</description>

The blinding will be maintained during the first 5 days, and hence will not influence the diagnosis and the treatment of the patient.&#xD;
The clinician in charge will be asked to assess on a 3-level Likert scale the probability of pneumonia (high, intermediate, low level) while considering all available clinical and biological data, plus the imaging modality according to the randomization arm.</description>
