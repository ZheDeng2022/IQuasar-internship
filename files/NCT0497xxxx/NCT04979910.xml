  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to test ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against interleukin&#xD;
      17A (IL-17A), in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study n=28 adult individuals with TRD will be treated with either ixekizumab&#xD;
      or placebo for 4 weeks. Participants will complete screening procedures, body fluid analyses&#xD;
      and brain imaging before and after treatment with ixekizumab or placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADARS) is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those symptoms. Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with differing descriptors for each item. These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range between 0 and 60 points. The MADRS provides a measure of the overall level of depression. Higher score indicates poorer health outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report [QIDS-SR] Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR) is a 16-item self-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The 16 items cover the nine symptom domains of major depression and are rated on a scale of 0-3. Total score ranges from 0 to 27, with ranges of 0-5 (normal), 6-10 (mild), 11-15 (moderate), 16-20 (moderate to severe), and 21+ (severe). Higher score indicates poorer health outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a well-validated 14-item self-report questionnaire commonly used to assess anhedonia. Each item on the SHAPS is worded so that higher scores indicate greater pleasure capacity. A total score can be derived by summing the responses to each item. Items answered with &quot;strongly agree&quot; are coded as &quot;1&quot;, while a &quot;strongly disagree&quot; response was assigned a score of &quot;4.&quot; Total scores on the SHAPS can range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) is an 18-item self-report measurement of anhedonia which consists of a series of statements that must be rated according to how accurate they are for the individual. The scale produces a sub-score that differentiates the role of anticipatory pleasure ('wanting') and is derived of 10 items. Subscales scores from 9-54. Total scores range is 16-108. Lower scores indicate greater levels of anhedonia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a widely administered clinician rated scale that assesses the subject overall illness severity and the degree of improvement from the initial assessment.&#xD;
Illness severity is rated on a 1-7 scale where 1 corresponds to &quot;Normal, Not at All Ill&quot;, 2 is &quot;Borderline Mentally Ill&quot;, the anchor for 3 is &quot;Mildly Ill&quot;, the anchor for 4 is &quot;Moderately Ill&quot;, 5 is &quot;Markedly Ill&quot;, 6 is &quot;Severely Ill&quot;, and 7 is &quot;Among the Most Extremely Ill Patients&quot;. Illness improvement is rated on a 1-7 scale where 1 corresponds to &quot;Very Much Improved&quot;, 2 is &quot;Much Improved&quot;, the anchor for 3 is &quot;Minimally Improved&quot;, the anchor for 4 is &quot;No Change&quot;, 5 is &quot;Minimally Worse&quot;, 6 is &quot;Much Worse&quot;, and 7 is &quot;Very Much Worse&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a comprehensive, semi-structured interview that uniquely measures the full spectrum of suicidality including passive and active suicidal ideation, suicidal intent as well as suicidal behaviors. Full range from 0 to 9, with higher score indicating higher suicidal ideation severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a scale of assessments of anxiety states. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. Higher score indicates poorer health outcomes.</description>
