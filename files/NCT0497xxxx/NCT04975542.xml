  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focused on improving breathing mechanics by using various osteopathic manipulative&#xD;
      therapy (OMT) techniques. The investigators randomly assigned participants to a control group&#xD;
      who received sham treatment and a treatment group who received OMT. The investigators&#xD;
      measured variable pre- and post- treatment on both groups. The investigators observed an&#xD;
      improvement in breathing mechanics in the treatment group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers from Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine (TouroCOM), including&#xD;
             students and staff, were recruited as subjects of this study. Any participant with&#xD;
             recent or past medical history of obstructive or restrictive lung disorders, recent&#xD;
             trauma, or illnesses, and/or chest abnormalities were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Certain study results were excluded on the basis of abnormal baseline measurements,&#xD;
             including but not limited to, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate,&#xD;
             improper spirometer use, technique and/or high variance among the repeated&#xD;
             measurements obtained for each participant.&#xD;
