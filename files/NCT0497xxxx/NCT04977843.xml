  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) is a leading cause of disability, mortality, and&#xD;
      economic burden worldwide. The impact of severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) on the economy&#xD;
      of developing countries like Pakistan is distressing. Pakistan has a large proportion of the&#xD;
      young adult population in the World. Motorbike is the most common locomotive vehicle. These&#xD;
      young ones are in the economically productive part of their lives. Their loss is an&#xD;
      economical set back not only for their families but also for the Nation. Patients with STBI&#xD;
      need standardized management in Neuro-critical care unit (NCCU). Although the setup and&#xD;
      maintenance cost of an effective NCCU is one of the major burden on the budget of any public&#xD;
      sector hospital, but the young survivor in turn can be productive for the Nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During mechanical ventilation, severe traumatic brain injury patients frequently develop&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be evaluated using&#xD;
      Clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS). CPIS is considered as an important clinical&#xD;
      indicator of pneumonia in NCCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) is a minimally invasive procedure done with instillation of&#xD;
      normal saline into subsegments of the lung followed by suction and collection of the&#xD;
      instilled fluid for analysis with flexible bronchoscope. Patients with moderate and severe&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury usually present with altered conscious level, and most of them already&#xD;
      have aspiration of vomitus, debris and secretions which increase the risk of VAP in them.&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar lavage can be helpful in preventing this dreadful VAP by clearing the&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find out the effect of early Bronchoalveolar Lavage on severity&#xD;
      of development of VAP assessed through clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) in TBI&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Severe traumatic brain injury is a serious and ever growing issue of public health and the&#xD;
      social economy of the World. It comprises 10% of all brain injuries and contributes to the&#xD;
      high proportion of disabilities and deaths (McGarry et al., 2002; Mosenthal et al., 2002).&#xD;
      STBI has a high mortality rate with prolonged hospital stay on average 17.5 days (Tagliaferri&#xD;
      et al., 2006). The 14-day mortality on average remained 30.2%and most patients died in 48&#xD;
      hours (Braun CT, 2015). In the United States, approximately 235,000 patients were treated in&#xD;
      the hospital per year due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The estimated annual death rate in&#xD;
      the US is about 50,000 cases per annum, with 21 to 400 billion US dollar annual costs due to&#xD;
      TBI(Corrigan, Selassie and Orman, 2010; Marin, Weaver and Mannix, 2017). The annual cost of&#xD;
      hospitalization due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in China was 800 billion US dollars, with&#xD;
      a mortality rate 9.8% (Liet al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete recovery of a patient of STBI to pre-injury level is uncommon. Approximately 60%&#xD;
      of the patient has ongoing impairment in the area of cognitive competency, gross motor&#xD;
      activity, and recreational activity (Dikmen et al., 2003). Patients with STBI can have airway&#xD;
      obstruction, aspiration, and hypoxia (Jovanovic et al., 2015). Mechanical ventilation is&#xD;
      indicated in many patients with severe TBI(Jovanovic et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015). It&#xD;
      maintains the oxygenation, protects airways, and maintains respiration. Most of the patients&#xD;
      about 80% wean of early within 7 days from the mechanical ventilation without a respiratory&#xD;
      problem, once the acute physiological disorder is corrected. However, 20% of patients still&#xD;
      require prolonged mechanical ventilation after 7 days (Hess and MacIntyre, 2011). During the&#xD;
      first four days, ventilator-associated pneumonia occurs in about 60% of the patients with&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injury (Ensault et al., 2017). The early systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response to head trauma patients predispose to early-onset VAP (Hedrick TL et al., 2008),&#xD;
      while late-onset VAP that occurs after five days of mechanical ventilation (MV) is caused&#xD;
      mainly by drug-resistant bacteria (Garnacho-Montero et al., 2014). Patients on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation have high morbidity, mortality, and infection rate due to acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism from venous thromboembolism (Nair and Niederman,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They also have decreased consciousness levels, disrupted natural defense barriers, decreased&#xD;
      mobility, and lack of ability to protect the airways which can lead to pulmonary&#xD;
      complications. Data is limited about effect of VAP in patients with STBI outcome. However&#xD;
      multi organ failure has been identified as an independent contributor of poor outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with severe TBI(Zygun et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple tool for the diagnosis of VAP was needed, thus a scoring system was developed in&#xD;
      1991, which included 7 clinical parameters for VAP diagnosis and it was named as Clinical&#xD;
      Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) (Pugin J. Et al 1991) . The diagnosis of VAP was made using&#xD;
      body temperature, leukocyte count and morphology, the character of tracheal secretion, PaO2 /&#xD;
      FiO2 ratio, presence of pulmonary infiltration and its progression and microbiological&#xD;
      culture results. A score of 6 or more suggests VAP (Basyigit. 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) is a minimally invasive procedure done with instillation of&#xD;
      normal saline into subsegments of the lung followed by suction and collection of the&#xD;
      instilled fluid for analysis. Loftus et al concluded in their study in 2017 that over half of&#xD;
      all intubated patients with head or chest injury had evidence of pneumonia on Early&#xD;
      Bronchoalveolar Lavage (E-BAL) performed within 48 hours of admission. E-BAL was associated&#xD;
      with early discontinuation of antibiotics (7.3 vs 9.2 days), fewer days on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (10.5 vs 16), fewer tracheostomies (49% vs 75%) and shorter ICU length of stay&#xD;
      compared to L-BAL triggered by clinical suspicion of pneumonia (12 vs 17days). So, they found&#xD;
      E-BAL useful for intubated patients with TBI or chest trauma. But the effect of this early&#xD;
      lavage on severity of VAP assessed on CPIS is lacking. This study will help in determining&#xD;
      the effect of early bronchoalveolar lavage on VAP in ventilated moderate and severe traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury patients and will reflect the effect of early bronchoalveolar lavage on VAP&#xD;
      through CPIS which can serve as prognostic indicator.&#xD;
