  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in neurosurgery and neuroresuscitation have improved patients' prognosis. However,&#xD;
      2% of serious head injuries progress to a vegetative state, this condition persisting at 1&#xD;
      year for 1% of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum state of consciousness is to be distinguished from coma and vegetative state, it&#xD;
      is a condition marked by a severe alteration of consciousness in which there are minimal and&#xD;
      fluctuating, but obvious, signs of environmental consciousness. There is a minimum degree of&#xD;
      response to some stimulations, response generally fluctuating over time. In practice, these&#xD;
      patients are unable to consistently follow simple instructions, but they often have a&#xD;
      preserved visual pursuit (proper rotation of the head when someone enters the room, prolonged&#xD;
      eye follow-up, etc.). Patients with minimal awareness have been shown to perceive emotions&#xD;
      and pain. These patients may exhibit behavioural and emotional changes (smiling, crying&#xD;
      motivated), induced by verbal stimulations (familiar voice). But these events remain&#xD;
      fluctuating during the day or according to the days and interlocutors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the moment, the most commonly accepted strategy since the 1990s remains sensory&#xD;
      stimulation (SS), while knowing that this term includes extremely varied stimulations&#xD;
      (sensory, olfactory, auditory, fixation on a mirror, etc.) without the practice of this&#xD;
      technique being well defined and systematized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that a regular family visit program with auditory, emotional and tactile&#xD;
      stimuli improves the state of consciousness of these patients. Physicians also know that this&#xD;
      SS must be personalized and adapted to the patient's tolerance and premorbid preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS programmes are poorly standardized. Programmes generally consist of a simple, moderate to&#xD;
      high intensity, non-standardized stimulation, presented repetitively and frequently. Indeed,&#xD;
      it has been shown that stimulation must begin early, be frequent, and continue until&#xD;
      reactions appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, investigator want to use the new technologies now commonly used such as&#xD;
      photos, videos or sounds taken by smartphone's relatives of the brain patient-injured in&#xD;
      order to make a personalized 3D film using film editing software and a predefined film frame,&#xD;
      by integrating autobiographical elements and emotional, multisensory (binaural sound,&#xD;
      vibration) integrating, if possible, a certain interactivity (haptic feedback, triggering of&#xD;
      videos by the patient's eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to develop an innovative multi-sensory stimulation technique through a&#xD;
      personalised enriched environment to induce, facilitate and accelerate the return to&#xD;
      consciousness of patients in altered state of consciousness during their initial management.&#xD;
