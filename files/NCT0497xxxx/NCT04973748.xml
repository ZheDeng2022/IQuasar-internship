    <textblock>
      The opioid epidemic is a considerable problem in the United States, and prescription opioids&#xD;
      significantly contribute to the epidemic.1 Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are inherently&#xD;
      at increased risk for opioid dependence as surgical treatment can cause significant pain and&#xD;
      up to 50%2 of patients also suffer from psychiatric comorbidities. Novel methods are needed&#xD;
      to decrease opioid consumption following HNC surgeries to limit the risk of chronic opioid&#xD;
      dependence in these patients. Conditioning therapy with placebo aims to elicit a classically&#xD;
      conditioned response to an inactive medication through consistent pairing of the medication&#xD;
      with a neutral stimulus (i.e. an odor) and has been shown to be effective for decreasing the&#xD;
      amount of active drug require for certain clinical responses, including for acute pain.&#xD;
      However, studies have not been completed for the treatment of acute pain in the inpatient&#xD;
      post-operative setting. The overall goal of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      and effectiveness of open-label conditioning therapy as an adjunct for post-operative pain&#xD;
      management in complex head and neck cancer patients. This open-label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will specifically compare post-operative opioid consumption and pain scales between&#xD;
      patients receiving multimodal analgesia with conditioning therapy and placebo (OLC group) to&#xD;
      those receiving multimodal analgesia, alone (Control group). Findings from this study will&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of conditioning therapy as an innovative approach to decrease opioid&#xD;
      consumption and improve outcomes in head and neck cancer patients and will provide rationale&#xD;
      for development of future large scale trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective Determine feasibility of open-label randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      conditioning therapy for post-operative pain management in complex head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Conditioning therapy with placebo has been studied and shown to be effective for&#xD;
      reducing the amount of active medication required for a variety of medical conditions,&#xD;
      including corticosteroids for psoriasis and amphetamines for ADHD. A more recent study showed&#xD;
      additional promise for acute pain management for spinal cord injury in the inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation facility setting. While these results provide rationale that conditioning&#xD;
      therapy may also be effective for management of acute pain following surgery, trials have not&#xD;
      been completed in this clinical setting. Given behavioral factors associated with the&#xD;
      development of certain types of HNC, these patients often have poor social support and low&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. These factors not only increase the risk for depression and associated&#xD;
      opioid depression, but may also complicate adherence to new treatment methods. This pilot&#xD;
      study will evaluate the feasibility of conditioning therapy for pain control following&#xD;
      complex head and neck cancer surgery with free flap reconstruction in this specific patient&#xD;
      population and clinical setting. Specifically, it will provide preliminary data on&#xD;
      recruitment, retainment and reasons for participant drop out that will help guide the design&#xD;
      of future larger scale trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate whether conditioning therapy with placebo decreases short-term and long-term&#xD;
      post-operative opioid use following HNC surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: While the primary aim of this pilot study is to assess feasibility, it has also&#xD;
      been designed to include adequate sample size for statistical analysis of trends of&#xD;
      post-operative opioid consumption. All study participants will receive standard multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia, including opioids, and will have opioid consumption and pain severity documented.&#xD;
      Patients in the OLC group will additionally begin conditioning therapy on the first&#xD;
      post-operative day (POD 1) and will continue therapy through POD 7. The study is powered to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the addition of conditioning therapy leads to a statistically significant&#xD;
      decrease in baseline opioid consumption, defined as the change in average daily MME from&#xD;
      post-operative days 2-4 to post-operative days 5-7. Data on opioid consumption and pain&#xD;
      levels will be tracked through six weeks following surgery. Trends in absolute and change in&#xD;
      baseline opioid consumption in each group will also help guide development of future studies&#xD;
      and determine if seven days of therapy is adequate to observe an effect on short-term (1 week&#xD;
      following surgery) and long-term (3-6 weeks following surgery) opioid consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with&#xD;
      procedures, drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opioid epidemic is a considerable problem in the United States, with more than 5 million&#xD;
      Americans currently affected by opioid-related substance use disorders.1 While prescription&#xD;
      medications may be thought of as safe and controlled, many opioid-na√Øve patients report&#xD;
      continuing to take prescription opioids for over one year after surgery, and the majority of&#xD;
      heroin users report starting with abuse of prescription opioids.1 At the same time,&#xD;
      prescription opioids have more than doubled from 2001-2013 and multiple studies in other&#xD;
      surgical specialties suggest that patients receive opioids in excess of their peri-operative&#xD;
      pain needs.3,4 Prior efforts to battle this epidemic have included the increased use of&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia, policies to limit the amount of opioids able to be prescribed at one&#xD;
      time, and databases to track prescribing habits across health care facilities. While these&#xD;
      have had some success, there is significant room for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients represent a unique population in that surgical resection&#xD;
      often leads to significant peri-operative pain and disfigurement. A high proportion, up to&#xD;
      50%2, of these patients also suffer from psychiatric comorbidities.5,6 These factors&#xD;
      inherently increase the risk of opioid dependence7 and studies have shown that chronic opioid&#xD;
      use following surgery for HNC is associated with decreased disease free survival.8 Novel&#xD;
      methods are needed to minimize opioid risks in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning therapy aims to elicit a classically conditioned, or Pavlovian, response through&#xD;
      consistent pairing of a medication with a neutral stimulus (i.e. an odor).9 Treatment&#xD;
      involves reinforcement with simultaneous presentation of a characteristic odor with each dose&#xD;
      of active and inactive medication. Prior studies have shown efficacy of conditioning therapy&#xD;
      to decrease the total dose of active medications required for a clinical response including&#xD;
      opioids for pain following spinal cord injury,10 stimulants for ADHD,11 and corticosteroids&#xD;
      for psoriasis.4 In the aforementioned study of corticosteroid use in patients with psoriasis,&#xD;
      researchers compared the effect of standard therapy to partial dosing with reinforcement&#xD;
      (i.e. same number of treatments with patients receiving alternating active ingredient vs&#xD;
      placebo). They found comparable rates of symptom control and relapse between these two&#xD;
      groups.9 Additionally, in patients receiving partial but equivalent dosing, those who were&#xD;
      presented with reinforcement during each treatment had greater control and less relapse of&#xD;
      symptoms than those without reinforcement.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these have been performed as &quot;open-label&quot; studies, where patients were aware of their&#xD;
      group assignment and were informed when each placebo treatment was given. On such study by&#xD;
      Morales-Quezeda, et al evaluated conditioning therapy for treatment of acute pain following&#xD;
      spinal cord surgery in the inpatient rehabilitation facility setting. This open-label study&#xD;
      specifically showed that patients with acute spinal cord injury who received interspersed&#xD;
      placebo doses (in place of opioid medications) had greater reduction in total opioid&#xD;
      consumption from baseline consumption and similar pain control as those who received opioid&#xD;
      medications alone.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that conditioning therapy may also benefit HNC patients by reducing&#xD;
      total opioid consumption required for adequate pain control in the peri-operative setting and&#xD;
      providing an innovative intervention to potentially decrease the risk of opioid dependence in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
