  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this research is to determine the acute effects of ketamine on brain&#xD;
      glutamate, functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in treatment-resistant depression,&#xD;
      explore whether the effects are attenuated by the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone and&#xD;
      relate these findings to antidepressant response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, double-blind, crossover design with two treatment conditions: oral&#xD;
      placebo or oral naltrexone preceding ketamine infusion during neuroimaging in subjects with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in two imaging sessions on two separate days. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a dose of ketamine (IV infusion, 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) during each scan.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either oral placebo or naltrexone 50 mg, 45 minutes before the&#xD;
      initiation of each of the ketamine infusions.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Glutamate</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be in the same session comparing the ketamine infusion period to the pre-ketamine infusion baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes in glutamate and GLX (glutamate +glutamine), referenced to total creatine (tCr), during ketamine infusion as measured by functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) for naltrexone versus placebo pre-treatment conditions.&#xD;
Hypothesis: There will be a significant increase in glutamate measures during ketamine administration compared to a resting baseline condition in a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) /anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region. Pre-treatment with naltrexone will attenuate this increase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resting State Functional Connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be in the same session comparing post-infusion (immediately after ketamine infusion) to the pre-ketamine infusion baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes in functional connectivity as measured by resting state-fMRI post-ketamine administration for naltrexone versus placebo pre-treatment conditions.&#xD;
Hypotheses:&#xD;
Ketamine administration will lead to significant reductions in functional brain connectivity between the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), default mode network (DMN) regions of interest (mPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)), thalamus, insula and ventral tegmental area (VTA) compared to a resting baseline condition. Pre-treatment with naltrexone will attenuate these reductions.&#xD;
Ketamine administration will lead to a significant increase in functional brain connectivity between the sgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to a resting baseline condition. Pre-treatment with naltrexone will attenuate this increase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cerebral Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be in the same session comparing data collected 30 minutes after the ketamine infusion commences to the pre-ketamine infusion baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes in cerebral blood flow during ketamine infusion as measured by arterial spin labelling (ASL) for naltrexone versus placebo pre-treatment conditions.&#xD;
Hypothesis: Ketamine administration will lead to a significant increase in CBF in sgACC, pregenual ACC (pgACC), dorsal ACC (dACC) and thalamus regions of interest compared to a resting baseline condition. Pre-treatment with naltrexone will attenuate these increases.</description>

             least moderate severity but without psychotic features as defined on the MINI 7.0.&#xD;
             Positive and primary diagnoses on the MINI 7.0 will be subject to confirmation at&#xD;
             clinical interview by a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  17-item HAM-D score ≥ 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have failed to respond to 2 or more antidepressants prescribed at minimum effective&#xD;
             dose for at least 6 weeks OR at least 1 antidepressant prescribed at the minimum&#xD;
             effective dose for at least 6 weeks AND a course of evidence-based psychotherapy given&#xD;
             for at least 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is off all drugs likely to interact with glutamate or opioid system at&#xD;
             least 14 days before starting the study (antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, mood&#xD;
             stabilisers, gabapentinoids, opiates, opioid agonists/antagonists/combinations and&#xD;
             stimulants). There are two exceptions. The first is any regular antidepressant(s) the&#xD;
             subject may be taking (apart from MAOIs that are not permitted). Second, is short&#xD;
             acting benzodiazepines or hypnotics for distressing anxiety or insomnia (up to 72&#xD;

             diastolic blood pressure ≥51 mmHg and ≤90 mmHg at the screening visit. An out-of-range&#xD;
             resting systolic blood pressure may be repeated once if a medically valid reason is&#xD;
             present, for example, the subject suffers from white-coat hypertension or has just&#xD;
             come from low outdoor temperatures or experienced stress (e.g. late arrival). The&#xD;
             medically valid reason must be documented and signed by the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
        The following exclusion criteria will apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of bipolar disorder or psychotic disorder on the MINI 7.0. Positive&#xD;
             diagnoses on the MINI will be subject to confirmation at clinical interview by a&#xD;
             psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A first-degree relative with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or&#xD;
             schizophrenia, with the potential participant younger than 33 years (ie, still at age&#xD;
             of risk for a psychotic disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;

             plan and intent defined using the C- SSRS (&quot;Suicidal Behaviour&quot; section and question&#xD;
             5) alongside confirmation at clinical interview with a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of drug or alcohol dependence syndrome (defined as meeting DSM-5 criteria&#xD;
             for any dependence syndrome) on the MINI 7.0. Positive diagnoses on the MINI will be&#xD;
             subject to confirmation at clinical interview by a psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of IV drug use.&#xD;

             renal failure or severe chronic obstructive lung disease, autonomic neuropathies and&#xD;
             active malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
