  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distraction is a non-pharmacological technique that moves focus away from anxiety, discomfort&#xD;
      or unpleasant stimulation to more stimulating or friendly stimulation. Distraction is one of&#xD;
      the most effective, simplest and inexpensive non-pharmacological pain management methods&#xD;
      (Hockenberry &amp; Wilson, 2018). The benefits of using non-pharmacological methods include&#xD;
      decreased pain, distress, and fear reported by the parent, child, and/or observer (Wente,&#xD;
      2013). There are two main types of distraction techniques: active and passive (Mutlu &amp; BalcÄ±,&#xD;
      2015; Wohlheiter &amp; Dahlquist, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the roles of the TICK-B, listening music, and watching cartoon, in relieving pain&#xD;
      and fear of school-age children during PIVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of TICK-B with the effects of the listening music, and watching&#xD;
      cartoon, on reducing pain and fear during PIVC in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of three distraction groups with the control group in relieving pain&#xD;
      and fear during PIVC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous cannulation (PIVC) is an invasive technique. In this technique, a&#xD;
      catheter is entrenched through the skin of the recipient into the lumen of a peripheral blood&#xD;
      vein. It is the second most painful procedure performed in hospitals. Peripheral intravenous&#xD;
      cannulation (PICV) is a common painful procedure for children, and nearly all ill children&#xD;
      have experience with PIVC, and up to 80% of patients receive a peripheral venous cannula in a&#xD;
      hospital. Therefore, the use of effective methods in pain and anxiety relief is very&#xD;
      important during injection procedures in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to relieve pain and fear in children undergoing PICV. Psychological and physical&#xD;
      approaches for coping with children's pain are favored, as well as pharmacological methods.&#xD;
      Application of topical anesthetic creams is the most commonly used pharmacological solution&#xD;
      to reduce pain associated with the medical procedure, or refrigerant preparations, however,&#xD;
      only reduce the perception of pain in children during procedures. These approaches are not&#xD;
      resolved anxiety, a core factor of noncooperation, which encumbers the efficiency of the&#xD;
      needle procedure. For this cause, non-pharmacological approaches are generally recognized as&#xD;
      alternative techniques, which may be used separately or in addition to pharmacological&#xD;
      approaches, to provide sufficient pain and fear relief and to offer children a sense of&#xD;
      control over the situation.&#xD;
