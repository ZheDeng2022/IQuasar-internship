  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the most prevalent medical problems facing children and adolescents today,&#xD;
      particularly among African American adolescents where the rate is alarmingly high. This study&#xD;
      will test the effectiveness of FIT Families, a multicomponent family-based behavioral&#xD;
      intervention that is culturally tailored to meet the unique needs of African American&#xD;
      adolescents with obesity and their caregivers, against a credible attention control&#xD;
      condition. This study has considerable public health relevance because it is delivered by&#xD;
      Community Health Workers, maximizing the potential for the intervention to be sustained, and&#xD;
      may reduce obesity-related health problems for a vulnerable population of adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The alarming rates of obesity among children and adults, particularly among ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, has been identified by the National Institutes of Health as one of the most&#xD;
      serious public health challenges facing our nation in the 21st century. South Carolina (SC),&#xD;
      part of the &quot;Stroke Belt,&quot; has the 3rd highest obesity rate among US children at 39.2% and&#xD;
      the 12th highest obesity rate among US adults at 32.3%. Unfortunately, African Americans in&#xD;
      SC are disproportionately more likely to be overweight or obese (75.7% of adults, 40% of&#xD;
      children), which places them at considerable high-risk for obesity-related diseases such as&#xD;
      asthma, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, and some forms of&#xD;
      cancer. This public health challenge is compounded by the lack of available intervention&#xD;
      strategies specially tailored to meet the unique needs of ethnic minorities. This R01&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, informed by the results from a recently completed NHLBI/NICHD&#xD;
      center grant (&quot;FIT Families Project,&quot; U01HL097889; PI-Naar) that followed the National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute, Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for&#xD;
      developing behavioral interventions, will examine the efficacy of FIT Families compared to a&#xD;
      credible attention control condition. Each of four evidence-based behavioral components of&#xD;
      FIT Families (home-based services, contingency management, motivational interviewing,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral skills training) were culturally tailored and optimized through a proof&#xD;
      of concept sequential multiple randomized trial that produced weight loss among African&#xD;
      American adolescents, a large and understudied population. One hundred and eighty obese&#xD;
      African American adolescents aged 12-17 and their primary caregiver will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two treatment conditions: 1) FIT Families or 2) Home-Based Family Support (HBFS)&#xD;
      attention control condition. It is predicted that FIT Families will lead to greater&#xD;
      reductions in adolescent and caregiver percent overweight, and increases in physical activity&#xD;
      and the use of evidence-based weight management behaviors (self-monitoring of diet and&#xD;
      exercise). If effective, FIT Families, which was carefully developed and adapted through&#xD;
      successive Phases of ORBIT, has the potential to reduce disparities in obesity-related&#xD;
      diseases (cardiovascular and metabolic) by addressing multiple risk factors among African&#xD;
      American families and their adolescent children. Thus, this project has high significance in&#xD;
      terms of potential public health impact and reduction in obesity related healthcare costs.&#xD;

    <description>Home-Based Family Support Group will receive six months of weekly family counseling in the home. The weekly visits have 3 goals: 1) provide basic education in nutrition and physical recommendations for adolescent and adult obesity; 2) assess and monitor weight, physical activity, and diet via logs; and 3) offer opportunities to discuss barriers they identify to adherence to weight loss recommendations. The HBFS CHW will also address non-weight related problems such as peer or family relationship problems during the visits.</description>
