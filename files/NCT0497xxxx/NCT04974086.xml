  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies show early detection of sexual activity in adolescents can improve their health&#xD;
      management and that primary care pediatricians would benefit from supports to address&#xD;
      adolescent health, including sexual and reproductive health. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health (SRH) services clinical decision support (CDS) tool within the electronic&#xD;
      health record (EHR) among clinicians, adolescent patients, and their parents. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include assessment of the CDS tool's impact on clinical measures. The SRH CDS tool&#xD;
      will be embedded within clinical practice and evaluated through a single-armed prospective&#xD;
      cohort study of primary care clinicians, adolescent patients, and parents. The SRH CDS tool&#xD;
      that will support pediatric clinicians by providing evidence-based sexual health-related&#xD;
      screening, treatment, and referrals, as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SRH CDS tool will be embedded within the electronic health record (EHR) and will be&#xD;
      evaluated to include feasibility (through medical record review for EHR utilization data),&#xD;
      pediatric clinician acceptability and usability of the intervention (using surveys and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews), and adolescent and parent acceptability of the approach (using&#xD;
      surveys). The secondary outcomes include measures of clinical impact, including ordering (and&#xD;
      the results) of screening labs, prescribing of contraception and/or human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis, referrals to additional adolescent health services, and&#xD;
      follow-up with those services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts of participants will be involved in the study: 1) Clinicians (attending&#xD;
      physicians, nurse practitioners, and pediatric residents), 2) their English-speaking&#xD;
      adolescent patients, and 3) their parents at included primary care sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 100 adolescent patients for whom the CDS tool is used will be approached in-person&#xD;
      or remotely via text message or phone call after the clinical visit to complete a brief&#xD;
      survey on the acceptability of the treatment provided at the visit, acceptability of that&#xD;
      treatment, satisfaction with potential treatment outcomes, and if they engaged in any&#xD;
      conversations with their parent(s) about any treatment provided at the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, parents of those first 100 adolescent patients will be approached in-person or&#xD;
      remotely via text message or phone call after the clinical visit to complete a brief survey&#xD;
      on the acceptability of the approach to adolescent care workflow (not any specifics about the&#xD;
      actual care provided) as well as any conversations about the visit that occurred between the&#xD;
      parent and adolescent after the visit. Contact information, including phone number, for&#xD;
      potential adolescent and parent participants will be retrieved from the adolescent's medical&#xD;
      record. Additionally, Investigators will approach 50 pediatric clinicians in-person or&#xD;
      remotely via email to complete a brief survey and semi-structured interview on the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the CDS tool. Pediatric clinicians are eligible&#xD;
      if they care for adolescent patients and have used the SRH CDS tool in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from clinician surveys and semi-structured interviews will ensure that the CDS tool&#xD;
      design meets clinicians' needs - ensuring a level of usability, functionality, and usefulness&#xD;
      that supports pediatric clinicians' delivery of sexual and reproductive health care services&#xD;
      to adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures aimed at assessing the clinical impact of the CDS tool include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of contraception or HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis prescriptions written as a&#xD;
           result of the CDS tool,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, and pregnancy tests ordered as a result&#xD;
           of the CDS tool,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of positive gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, and pregnancy tests ordered as a&#xD;
           result of the CDS tool,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And, the percentage of adolescents who successfully follow-up with the Adolescent&#xD;
           Medicine Division.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents no more than minimal risk to study participants, as this is a study aimed&#xD;
      to assess the creation of a tool that helps to improve upon the current delivery of SRH&#xD;
      services provided through pediatric primary care.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention, called the SRH services CDS tool, includes integrating sexual and reproductive health guideline prompts into the electronic health record (EHR). The prompt guides clinicians to assess and broadly respond to adolescents' SRH behaviors through EHR survey data. Through the CDS tool, clinicians will be prompted to provide comprehensive and evidence-based sexual health care for teens including, for example: providing patient-facing education about sexual preventative health topics; facilitating clinician decision-making regarding and prescription of contraception or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); facilitating ordering of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) laboratory tests to improve both risk-based and routine annual preventative screening; linking youth to health preventative services such as PrEP navigators or sexual health educators; and providing external referrals to adolescents, if needed.</description>
