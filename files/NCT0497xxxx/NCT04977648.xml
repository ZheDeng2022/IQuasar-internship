  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal study of the natural disease course intended to recruit&#xD;
      approximately 60 patients with centronuclear myopathies (CNM) in Europe and the United&#xD;
      States. The duration of the study, including the enrollment period, will be approximately 4&#xD;
      years. Data from the study will be used to characterize the natural disease course of CNM, to&#xD;
      identify prognostic variables of the disease and to determine the best outcome measure(s) for&#xD;
      the evaluation of future therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Clinically symptomatic male or female subjects of all ages (newborns included) with&#xD;
             a CNM resulting from a documented mutation in the MTM1 or DNM2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. A written, signed and dated informed consent must be provided to participate in the&#xD;
             study. For subjects &lt;18 years, consent of parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is required;&#xD;
             informed assent can be obtained from the child according to local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Willing and able to comply with all protocol requirements and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Participation in any other interventional study. Participation in a previous study&#xD;
             should be completed at least 4 weeks before the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Currently undergoing or has undergone previous gene therapy or other therapy for&#xD;
             CNM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Current or past abuse of alcohol or recreational/narcotic drugs (with the exception&#xD;
             of caffeine and nicotine), which in the investigator's opinion would compromise the&#xD;
             subject's safety and/or compliance with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, that would make the&#xD;
             subject unlikely to comply with the study procedures. (Note: Subjects in a wheelchair&#xD;
             are not to be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Subject is mentally incapacitated, or parent(s)/legally-authorized representative&#xD;
             are legally incapacitated or have limited legal capacity, or have lack of mental&#xD;
             capacity to fully understand the protocol requirements and complete all study required&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
