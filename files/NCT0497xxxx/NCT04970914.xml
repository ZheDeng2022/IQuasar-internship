    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
