  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study was aimed that acupressure applied on the BL32 point and shower application&#xD;
      reduced the intensity of labor pain experienced by the pregnant women in the active phase of&#xD;
      labor and increased their postpartum comfort&#xD;

      Acupressure and shower are methods that can help reduce pain severity. This study thus aims&#xD;
      to determine the effects of acupressure and shower on labour pain and postpartum comfort.&#xD;
      This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). This study was the control group&#xD;
      consisted of 40 pregnant women, while the experimental groups (acupressure and shower)&#xD;
      consisted of 80 pregnant women in total. The experimental groups received routine labour care&#xD;
      and either acupressure or showers upon reaching three cervical dilations (4-5, 6-7 and 8-10&#xD;
      cm). The control group only received routine labour care. A maternal information form (MIF),&#xD;
      the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VASP) and the Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PPCQ) were&#xD;
      used to collect data. CONSORT checklist was used to report the current study.&#xD;

    <description>This scale is a 0-10 cm ruler developed by Bond and Pilowsky (Hawker et al., 2011; Aslan and Öztürk, 2014; Kömürcü and Ergin, 2014; Bond and Pilowsky, 1996). VASP is a 10 cm ruler which assessment with &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;worst pain&quot; at the other end. A Turkish validity and reliability study of the VASP was performed by Aslan and Öztürk (Aslan and Öztürk, 2014; Kömürcü and Ergin, 2014; Aslan, 2004).</description>

    <measure>Postpartum Comfort Questionnaire (PPCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours after birth</time_frame>
    <description>The 48-item General Comfort Scale, developed by Kolcaba (Kolcaba, 1994), was first adapted into Turkish in 2008 by Kuğuoğlu and Karabacak, who also conducted a Turkish validity and reliability study on the scale (Kuğuoğlu and Karabacak, 2008). Based on the Turkish version of the GCS, Karakaplan and Yıldız (Karakaplan and Yıldız, 2010) developed the PPCQ. The PPCQ is a 5-point questionnaire with 34 items. Participants give items between 1 (strongly agree) and 5 points (strongly disagree). The lowest score possible is 34, and the highest score is 170, with higher scores indicating higher comfort levels.</description>

    <description>In the acupressure uterine contractions were checked before the care application began. Acupressure was applied when the women's cervical dilation reached 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm and 8-10 cm. This method was applied 18 times during uterine contractions. The application stopped at the end of each contraction and resumed once another contraction started. No application was performed between contractions.</description>
