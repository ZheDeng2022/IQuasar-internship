      This study will conduct a multicenter, open, prospective clinical trial to observe the&#xD;
      RecurIndex to assist in predicting the risk of recurrence in patients with early-stage&#xD;
      Luminal-type breast cancer. The aim of this study is to validate the predictive effect of the&#xD;
      RecurIndex on the risk of recurrence in women with early-stage Luminal-type breast cancer in&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
