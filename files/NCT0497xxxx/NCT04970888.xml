    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to assess the effects of combined physical exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive training interventions on cognitive and brain health in patients with heart failure&#xD;
      (HF). Also, the role of sex on the effects of the interventions will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment (CI) affects up to 50% of patients with heart failure (HF), and is&#xD;
      associated with high mortality rates, poor quality of life, reduced functional capacities,&#xD;
      and an overwhelming economic burden in Western countries. Non-pharmacological strategies&#xD;
      could help enhance cognition in HF patients with CI. Combined physical exercise and cognitive&#xD;
      training interventions have recently shown promising enhancement effects on cognition in&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular risk factors and mild cognitive impairment. The effects of&#xD;
      combined interventions have never been tested in HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the effects of combined physical exercise and cognitive&#xD;
      training interventions on cognition in patients with HF. Secondary objectives include: to&#xD;
      characterize baseline and intervention-related changes in cerebral autoregulation and&#xD;
      vasoreactivity and to assess the role of sex on the effects of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred and sixteen participants (36 men and 36 women/group) with stable HF regardless of&#xD;
      aetiology and LVEF will take part in this study. All participants will have signed a written&#xD;
      consent form before taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to sex and LVEF (FEVG &lt; 40% et FEVG &gt; 40%), and will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the 3 following study arms: 1) Combined physical exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive training; 2) Physical exercise alone; and 3) Usual medical care.&#xD;

    <description>The cognitive training will involve attention control training and memory training, with thrice-weekly 30-min sessions.&#xD;
Two of these sessions will involve computer or tablet-based attentional control training targeting dual-tasking, updating and working memory, as well as inhibition and switching. Difficulty of cognitive training will be tailored to participants' performances. The remaining session will consist of memory training. Participants will be instructed mnemotechnic, as well as be taught about memory in aging in general.</description>

    <description>Participants will follow a 20-week physical training program, with 60-min thrice-weekly trainings. The training sessions will start with a 5-min warm-up, followed by an aerobic training (20 min) after which 20-min of resistance/muscular training will take place. The program will end with a 10-min cool-down. Training will be adapted to individuals' baseline capacity as measured by the baseline cardiorespiratory test. For home-training sessions, participants will have access to a complete exercise training program. A certified kinesiologist will supervise trainings. With the Heart rate sensor Polar H10, all the characteristics of the activities will be recorded (type of the activity, intensity, heart rate, duration). A kinesiologist will call participants every week to ensure the smooth running of the exercises training sessions and individualize the care according to the patient's level.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive usual care and be treated according to evidence-based treatments. This will include optimal medical therapy, systematic information regarding dietary and fluid management, and a recommendation for regular physical activity consistent with the latest update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure. Moreover, patients who benefit from a prescription for a cardiovascular rehabilitation program will be able to follow it, but they will not receive other forms of intervention for the duration of the study.</description>
