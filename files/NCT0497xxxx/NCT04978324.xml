  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out about the effect of growth factors&#xD;
      extracted from blood on improving healing of periodontal pockets (Gum pockets) after deep gum&#xD;
      cleaning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood has a lot of cells that help with healing and regeneration. These cells could be&#xD;
      obtained by spinning blood in a centrifuge machine which allows the cells to separate at high&#xD;
      spinning forces. After spinning, the blood will be separated into 3 different layers. The&#xD;
      middle layer has the highest concentration of cells that help in healing and it is called the&#xD;
      leukocyte platelet rich plasma (L-PRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to use participant's own blood to retrieve (L-PRF) and place it in&#xD;
      the diseased tissue around teeth, after the deep cleaning, to examine its effect in improving&#xD;
      the healing and compare the results with gum pockets that haven't received L-PRF&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit VCU Graduate Periodontics clinic 6 times for scheduled study visits after the&#xD;
           initial periodontal exam.:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1st appointment: A digital impression of upper and lower teeth using an intraoral&#xD;
                scanner, a light source laser that will capture digital impressions of the teeth,&#xD;
                will be taken. These digital impressions will be used to create removable resin&#xD;
                stents that fit on top of the teeth which will help in obtaining accurate and&#xD;
                reproducible clinical measurements. The stents will be used on almost all&#xD;
                participant's visits to the graduate periodontics clinic for the duration of the&#xD;
                study for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2nd and 3rd appointment: The deep cleaning will be divided into 2 appointments&#xD;
                which should be less than 2 weeks apart. During each appointment, one arch, either&#xD;
                the upper or the lower arch, will be scaled and root planed. Local anesthesia will&#xD;
                be used to anesthetize the participant before the cleaning. Ultrasonic cleaner and&#xD;
                hand instruments will be used for the deep cleaning. After finishing the deep&#xD;
                cleaning, 36 ml of participant's blood will be collected in 4 tubes through the&#xD;
                antecubital vein. The tubes will be spun in an FDA approved spinning machine to&#xD;
                obtain the liquid and membrane forms of the L-PRF. The L-PRF will then be inserted&#xD;
                in the test sites on one side of the arch while the other side will not receive the&#xD;
                L-PRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4th appointment: Prophylaxis and plaque control 2 weeks after 2nd appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  5th appointment: Evaluation of deep periodontal cleaning and data collection 4-5&#xD;
                weeks after the 2nd appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  6th appointment: Periodontal cleaning and data collection 3 months after 2nd&#xD;
                appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow the oral hygiene instructions given&#xD;
