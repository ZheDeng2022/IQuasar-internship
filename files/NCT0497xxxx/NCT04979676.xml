  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety often reaches its peak during adolescence and may hold a noteworthy impact&#xD;
      both at the social and academic levels. Though some adolescents easily learn to adequately&#xD;
      cope with it, others become overwhelmed by social fears and end up avoiding social events or&#xD;
      facing them with intense suffering. Adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) seldom&#xD;
      seek professional help and often become adults with SAD, making it necessary to timely&#xD;
      intervene during early stages of the disorder and determine what works better, why, and for&#xD;
      whom when trying to change the course of social anxiety in adolescence. Cognitive therapy&#xD;
      (CT) has been the treatment of choice for adult SAD, but research within adolescent samples&#xD;
      is scarce. More recently, third-wave cognitive approaches, namely compassion-focused therapy&#xD;
      (CFT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), have also proven effective in treating&#xD;
      mental disorders, but their efficacy towards adolescents' SAD remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project intends to evaluate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of CT, CFT,&#xD;
      and ACT as applied to adolescents with SAD, in comparison with waiting-listed and&#xD;
      non-disordered controls, after intervention and over a 12-weeks and a 24-weeks follow-up,&#xD;
      using a randomized parallel trial approach. This methodology will allow to simultaneously&#xD;
      test if intervened subjects diverge from the non-intervened SAD subjects and if they get&#xD;
      closer to normative peers. Therapeutic change process will be investigated, specifically if&#xD;
      efficacy is mediated by change in the core constructs of each theoretical framework. Finally,&#xD;
      moderators of change such the initial level of symptomology will be examined, as to determine&#xD;
      which intervention works best for whom. The same procedures will be repeated for each&#xD;
      intervention condition each year, namely recruitment, intervention, and assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide evidence on which form of therapy may be the optimal choice in to&#xD;
      intervene in SAD in general, and when dealing with diverse specific vulnerabilities&#xD;
      associated with social fears. It will also add to the field of empirically validated&#xD;
      therapies, with a specific focus on adolescence. From a societal perspective, the project&#xD;
      will assist in empowering schools to contribute to shape how their students act and develop&#xD;
      into socially apt adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety is characterized by emotional reactivity to social events in which the&#xD;
      individual believes he or she can be subject to the scrutiny of others. Although normative&#xD;
      during adolescence, along with the growing importance attributed to acceptance and&#xD;
      integration with peers, it can come to fulfill criteria for social anxiety disorder (SAD;&#xD;
      McNeil, 2010), which is an intense and disabling experience for adolescents (Rao et al.,&#xD;
      2007). SAD refers to excessive and persistent fear of being evaluated in social interactions,&#xD;
      also with peers, which leads to those situations being faced with high levels of suffering&#xD;
      or, if possible, avoided (APA, 2013). If not subject to specialized intervention, SAD usually&#xD;
      has a chronic course and is associated with the emergence of other psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      (Essau et al., 2004). In Portugal, it is estimated that between 3.6% and 6% of adolescents in&#xD;
      the community meet criteria for SAD, including intense anxiety and frequent avoidance of&#xD;
      social situations, as well as severe impairment of academic and social functioning and r&#xD;
      quality of life (Cunha et al., 2007). Most of these adolescents (i.e., more than 75%) did not&#xD;
      seek or were referred to specialized intervention (Cunha et al., 2007), which points to the&#xD;
      importance of offering acceptable, practical, and effective forms of intervention for PAS.&#xD;
      target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for SAD in adolescence has been based on the cognitive-behavioral model and has&#xD;
      been shown to be effective in clinical (Hayward et al., 2000) and school contexts&#xD;
      (Masia-Warner et al., 2007). With adults, the treatment of choice for SAD is Cognitive&#xD;
      Therapy (CT; Mavranezouli et al., 2015) derived from the model by Clark and Wells (1995).&#xD;
      This model proposes that social anxiety is maintained by cognitive biases (i.e., negative&#xD;
      automatic thinking and self-focused attention) that support the practice of safety or&#xD;
      avoidance behaviors, so that the intervention is aimed at making the focus of attention more&#xD;
      flexible in order to be able to invest in and be exposed to social situations and extract&#xD;
      evidence from them that may help adjust one's own thoughts and social expectations. Based on&#xD;
      a review of evidence of the presence of various components of this model also in adolescents,&#xD;
      Leigh and Clark (2018) propose that it could be applicable to the understanding and&#xD;
      intervention in SAD in adolescents, contributing to better therapeutic results. In fact,&#xD;
      previous work supports the therapeutic effectiveness (Leigh et al., 2021; Leigh &amp; Clark,&#xD;
      2016) and applicability of this approach in different contexts (Creswell et al., 2021; Leigh&#xD;
      et al., 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While cognitive therapy focuses on modifying the cognitive content elicited by self-focused&#xD;
      attention during social events as a means of preventing safety and/or avoidance behaviors in&#xD;
      these situations (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995), third-generation therapies (i.e., Compassion-focused&#xD;
      Therapy - CFT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - ACT) emphasize the modification of the&#xD;
      way the person relates to these cognitive contents. CFT proposes that this relationship be&#xD;
      based on a compassionate attitude, given that psychopathology is based on a relationship with&#xD;
      one's own internal experiences that is excessively critical and punishing, also in children&#xD;
      and adolescents (Carona et al., 2017). There is previous evidence pointing to the association&#xD;
      between self-compassion and social anxiety in adults (Werner et al., 2012) and adolescents&#xD;
      (Gill et al., 2012), as well as to the effectiveness of CFT for SAD in adults (Boersma al.,&#xD;
      2018; Gharraee et al., 2018). As for ACTCAT, its application with adolescents is also&#xD;
      conceived, assuming that psychopathology results from an avoidant relationship with ones' own&#xD;
      negative internal experiences (Hallibturton &amp; Cooper, 2015). Still, along with the scant&#xD;
      evidence linking its core constructs (i.e., psychological flexibility) to social anxiety,&#xD;
      research on the effectiveness of this intervention for SAD is scarce, although pointing to&#xD;
      promising results with adults (Dalrymple, &amp; Herbert, 2007; Khoramnia et al., 2020; Ossman et&#xD;
      al., 2006). The applicability of these therapies to SAD in adolescence remains to be&#xD;
      elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, evidence of the effectiveness of the therapeutic offer for SAD in&#xD;
      adolescence is still scarce. So, it is relevant to explore the therapeutic results of CT, CFT&#xD;
      and ACT, , as well as to explore the mechanisms by which each one enables change and with&#xD;
      whom it can be most effective. Previous research has pointed to the importance of changing&#xD;
      core constructs in the CBT intervention with adults with SBP (e.g., Santoft et al., 2019),&#xD;
      but evidence regarding the therapeutic approaches under study is scarce. In addition, and&#xD;
      considering the relevance of the intervention being adjusted to the characteristics of the&#xD;
      person receiving the intervention (Beck et al., 2010), it is important to explore the&#xD;
      moderators of therapeutic change, namely with regard to the severity of symptoms within what&#xD;
      is proposed to be the main psychological vulnerability for each of the approaches under&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present work intends to use a randomized and parallel clinical trial methodology&#xD;
      (although the different parallel conditions are collected sequentially over time) to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of three therapeutic approaches (i.e., CT, CFT and ACT) with adolescents&#xD;
      with SAD, compared to a waiting list control group and to a normative control group, and&#xD;
      using four data collection times (i.e., pre-intervention/time 0, post-intervention/time 1,&#xD;
      12-weeks follow-up/time3 3, and 24-month follow-up/time 4). All participants included in the&#xD;
      waiting-list control group will receive psychological intervention, after the waiting period.&#xD;
      All procedures involved in this study (i.e., sampling, data collection to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention, and implementation of the intervention) will be&#xD;
      implemented after a positive position from the Ethics Committee of the institution hosting&#xD;
      the investigation, authorization from the General Directorate of Education on the data&#xD;
      collection protocol to be implemented, partnership with national secondary schools,&#xD;
      authorization of guardians/legal guardians of adolescents, and consent of the adolescents&#xD;
      themselves. Furthermore, this investigation will comply with all applicable ethical and&#xD;
      deontological requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling process will include two phases. The first phase will be of screening.&#xD;
      Collaboration protocols will be established with several secondary schools, in the sense that&#xD;
      all 10th and 11th grade students of a school are invited to fill out a self-report&#xD;
      questionnaire that assesses social anxiety, thus contributing to homogeneity with regard to&#xD;
      the age group and social and academic experiences of the potential participants. Students&#xD;
      with scores on this questionnaire above the normative average in Portugal will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in an individual assessment through a semi-structured diagnostic interview, to&#xD;
      verify compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria described elsewhere in this form.&#xD;
      Having fulfilled these criteria, adolescents will be invited to join the study and fill out&#xD;
      selected primary and secondary outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions. They will be allocated to one of the intervention groups or to the waiting&#xD;
      list-control group. The normative control group will also undergo the same screening phase&#xD;
      and will be called for an individual semi-structured diagnostic interview if presenting with&#xD;
      close to average or below average self-reported social anxiety. If then fulfilling inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria for this group, they will be invited to take part in the normative&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT will be implemented in the first year of the research, with 21 participants that will be&#xD;
      recruited at this time; another 10 participants will also be recruited at this time and&#xD;
      allocated to a waiting-list control. Finally, 10 participants will be recruited as part of&#xD;
      the normative control group. All 41 participants will go through the four evaluation moments&#xD;
      and procedures stated above. The 10 participants allocated to a waiting-list control&#xD;
      condition will receive be allocated to the CFT condition in the second year of the research,&#xD;
      along with another newly recruited 11 participants. Another 10 participants will, at this&#xD;
      time, be newly recruited and allocated to the waiting-list control condition. Lastly, 11&#xD;
      participants will be recruited to add to the normative control group. CFT will be applied in&#xD;
      this second year, along with the four evaluation moments for all 31 participants. The 10&#xD;
      participants that composed the waiting-list control group in the second year will be&#xD;
      allocated to ACT intervention in the third year, along with 11 newly recruited participants.&#xD;
      Therefore, the ACT will be applied to 21 participants in the third year of research, which&#xD;
      will also include the evaluation of the participants on the four defined moments. No&#xD;
      participants are assigned to a waiting list control condition at the third year of the trial&#xD;
      because of ethical reasons (i.e., due to the schedule of execution of the trial, such&#xD;
      participants would not be receiving intervention). This design will allow for the&#xD;
      constitution of three 21-participants intervention groups, one 21-participants waiting-list&#xD;
      control group, and one-21-participants normative control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions will follow a structured manual, will be brief (i.e., 10 weekly sessions) and&#xD;
      will be implemented in individual online format via videoconference, according to the time&#xD;
      availability of each adolescent; the facilitator will have adequate training in psychology&#xD;
      and in the therapeutic approach to be implemented. All participants, regardless of the time&#xD;
      and condition to which Collected data will be used to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
      each for the experimental intervention conditions across the four assessment moments, on its&#xD;
      own, in comparison with each other, and in comparison to a waiting-list control condition and&#xD;
      with a normative control group. Psychotherapeutic efficacy is usually tested against&#xD;
      waiting-list control groups, based on the assumption that if the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups started similarly at pre-intervention and present differently at post-intervention,&#xD;
      the intervention is responsible for the observed change. This procedure is well established&#xD;
      in the literature but has seldom been applied to adolescent SAD or to the different&#xD;
      theoretical approaches tackled in this trial. Comparing intervention groups against a&#xD;
      normative group is not a common practice in applied psychology; such comparisons will,&#xD;
      nevertheless, allow to investigate therapeutic efficacy as not only a differentiation from a&#xD;
      clinical population but also as an approximation to normative peers. Processes of change will&#xD;
      also be analyzed based on collected data as reflected in therapeutic change in constructs&#xD;
      that were considered transversal to the intervention (e.g., social anxiety) being mediated by&#xD;
      change in core constructs for each intervention. In addition, the moderating effect of&#xD;
      initial levels of interference and intensity of symptomatology will be explored across&#xD;
      experimental intervention conditions.&#xD;
