  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is trying to see if people from different backgrounds have different feelings when&#xD;
      making treatment decisions about prolapse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study will include patients ages &gt;18 years with prolapse symptoms who have&#xD;
      new patient consultations to Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the new-patient consultation, patients will be contacted to see if they are interested&#xD;
      in the study. If so, informed consent will be obtained before they complete a 1 page&#xD;
      questionnaire that assesses their eligibility for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires are: Decisional Conflict Scale; Pelvic Floor Disorders Autonomy Preference&#xD;
      Index; Control Preferences Scale; Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI 20); Satisfaction&#xD;
      with Decision Scale for Pelvic Floor Disorders; Impression questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will self-identify their zip-code on the patient impression questionnaire. This will&#xD;
      enable a geographic analysis that will assess the relationships of neighborhood and commute&#xD;
      on decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, patients will self-identify their demographic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      URM patients will be those who self-identify as having a non-Caucasian race and/or a Hispanic&#xD;
      ethnicity. Providers seeing patients that are included in this study will also be consented&#xD;
      prior to completing a 1 time demographics questionnaire. Additional clinical data will also&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be able to utilize interpreters to participate. Information regarding the use&#xD;
      of interpreters will be collected. Questionnaires that are available in, and validated in,&#xD;
      non-English languages will be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead study site is Women &amp; Infants Hospital/ Brown University, with additional study&#xD;
      sites planning to participate in the study.&#xD;
