    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of three groups of children (n=40): 1. A group receiving a novel&#xD;
      short-term dynamic play therapy. 2. Dyadic therapy 3. Control group who will not receive&#xD;
      therapy. All children will be assessed for psychopathology (anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      behavioral problems) using standardized instruments such as semi-structured interview and&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires; Cortisol (CT), Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), Oxytocin (OT) and&#xD;
      Secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) will be assessed by using saliva sampling; and&#xD;
      father-mother-child interactions will be videotaped and analyzed. Narrative descriptions will&#xD;
      be obtained from parents, and the interviews recorded for voice analysis. Assessment will be&#xD;
      made at baseline and then bi-monthly for six months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are the most common disorders across the lifespan and tend to have both an&#xD;
      early onset and persistent course throughout life. Since the preschool years mark a sensitive&#xD;
      period for the development and exacerbation of anxiety symptoms in children, which often&#xD;
      persist throughout childhood and adolescence, there is an urgent need to understand this&#xD;
      condition in the most detailed manner and find efficient therapeutic solutions. In this&#xD;
      Randomized control study (RCT), the investigators will test the efficacy of two interventions&#xD;
      for childhood anxiety disorders: a special emotion-focused therapy and a dyadic parent-child&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESGIN Recruitment: consecutive admissions to the preschool clinic at the Intradisciplinary&#xD;
      Center at Herzliya will be asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychiatric diagnosis: will be made by using a combination and integration of the&#xD;
           childhood version of the Schedule for Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders (K-SADS-PL)&#xD;
           and the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA). Diagnosis will be made according to&#xD;
           the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) and Diagnostic&#xD;
           Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early&#xD;
           Childhood (DC 0-5). These semi-structured interviews will be conducted by a clinical&#xD;
           psychologist with a special expertise in evaluation and treatment in preschool children&#xD;
           (YAL). All diagnoses will then be checked with a senior child and adolescent&#xD;
           psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Behavioral profiles: The Child Behavioral Checklist for preschoolers will be&#xD;
           administered to parents and will generate behavioral profiles adjusted for gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive referrals to the clinic will be recruited for the study and will be randomly and&#xD;
      blindly allotted to each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both therapies would have the same duration of 6 months and will consist of 24 weekly&#xD;
      meetings for the child or child-parent dyad, accompanied by 12 bi-weekly meetings with both&#xD;
      parents. Each session will last for approximately 50 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inner World of the Child I-WotCH- - is a novel innovative therapy developed in our&#xD;
           clinic. The therapy is based on modern concepts of early childhood developments&#xD;
           emphasizing themes related to emotional regulation, processes of socialization,&#xD;
           observational research on interpersonal and behavior as well as recent developments on&#xD;
           affiliative neuroscience. More specifically, the therapist, through play, identifies&#xD;
           themes and emotions the child is preoccupied with. The therapist then assists the child&#xD;
           in naming these emotions, validating them, exploring their nature and consequences. The&#xD;
           therapist discusses ways of managing and self-regulating these emotions through methods&#xD;
           that include behavioral techniques, the ability to enlist help from others, and&#xD;
           reframing. In addition, the therapy will address ways of dealing with complex emotions&#xD;
           and enhancing symbolic play and joyfulness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Child-parent psychotherapy- CPP: CPP consists of joint parent-child sessions that focus&#xD;
           on the child's free play and spontaneous parent-child interaction. The CPP therapist&#xD;
           acts to &quot;translate&quot; the developmental and emotional meaning of a child's emotions and&#xD;
           actions to the parent. The target of treatment includes the both the child's and the&#xD;
           caregiver's adaptive conflicts, including a parent's difficulty in providing sensitive&#xD;
           and developmentally appropriate care. CPP fosters parent-child activities that foster&#xD;
           mutual pleasure, interpersonal trust and understanding. In the purpose of this study&#xD;
           only mothers will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION All children will be evaluated at baseline, at bi-monthly intervals during&#xD;
      treatment, and at termination (at 6 months). The evaluation session will be conducted in a&#xD;
      university laboratory (not in the clinical setting) by RA unfamiliar to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts will be noted and as far as possible the details for discontinuing will be recoded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Psychopathology (as noted above):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychiatric diagnosis: will be made by using a combination and integration of the&#xD;
           K-SADS-PL and the PAPA. Diagnosis will be made according to the DSM-5 and DC 0-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Behavioral profiles: The Child Behavioral Checklist for preschoolers will be&#xD;
           administered to parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Parent-Child Relationship:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parent-Child Social Interactions: each five minutes of mother-child, father-child and&#xD;
           triadic interactions with pre-selected toys will be videotaped. Dyadic interaction will&#xD;
           include free play and a challenging task. Interactions will be coded with the Coding&#xD;
           Interactive Behavior manual. The CIB is a global rating system for analyzing social&#xD;
           interactions between two or more partners. The CIB comprises five manuals: newborns,&#xD;
           infants, preschoolers, adolescents/ adults, and the recently added psychotherapy manual,&#xD;
           all based on the same constructs with good psychometric properties. The CIB utilizes a&#xD;
           variety of social settings and observational paradigms (e.g., free play, feeding,&#xD;
           conflict discussion, triadic/family interactions) and has been used in hundreds of&#xD;
           published studies in healthy and high-risk populations and clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following dimensions will be emphasized:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Iintrusiveness- this measures the degree to which the parent interferes with the&#xD;
                child's natural behavior throughout the session, for instance, ignoring the child's&#xD;
                signals, overriding the child's cues and wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Reciprocity: this measures the degree to which the parent and child interact in a&#xD;
                mutual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Acknowledgment: this scale is a central feature of sensitive parenting. this&#xD;
                measures the degree to which the parent is aware and sensitive to child's signals&#xD;
                and expresses them both vocally and by gesture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Avoidance- this measures the degree to which the child avoids the parent and&#xD;
                retreats from the parent's attempts to engage him.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Positive and negative affect: this measures the degree to which the parent&#xD;
                expresses positive or negative emotions towards the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, other dimensions will also be noted and scored, as listed in the CIB&#xD;
           manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mother-Father Relationship: five minutes of Conflictual Discussion between and father&#xD;
           will be videotaped and coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Child Emotion Regulation: the child's ability to regulate his emotions will be rated&#xD;
           using the child's reaction to a challenging task, such as the puzzle task. Micro-coding&#xD;
           of child behavior during the puzzle task paradigm will be conducted on a computerized&#xD;
           system (Noldus Co, Waggeniggen, The Netherlands). Codes are based on our own and others'&#xD;
           research with preschoolers . Child's Self-Regulation will be represented by the sum of&#xD;
           time proportions of each of the following behaviors: withdrawal, gaze aversion, physical&#xD;
           self-soothing and solitary substitutive play.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, parents will fill out the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (TBAQ),&#xD;
           . This questionnaire includes the assessment of child's temperament, emotion regulation,&#xD;
           self-soothing and inhibition control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Parental Representation of Child and the Treatment: Narrative descriptions will be&#xD;
           obtained from parents, and the interviews recorded for voice analysis. Parents will&#xD;
           answer three questions: 1. &quot;Describe your child&quot;; 2. &quot;Describe your child's problems&quot;;&#xD;
           3. &quot;How do you think the therapy will help or helps addressing your child's&#xD;
           difficulties&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Biological Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Hormonal Measures: Saliva will be obtained for the following measure for both parents&#xD;
           and child: OT, CT and DHEA (DHEA from parents only).&#xD;
&#xD;
           OT: Oxytocin is a hormone which appears to be a marker of affiliation and relationship.&#xD;
           It has been shown to be disturbed in conditions where parent-child relationships are&#xD;
           impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CT: is a well known and much studied marker of stress and anxiety. DHEA: this hormone&#xD;
           has also been shown by our group and others to be related to stress and emotional&#xD;
           regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hormonal Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           OT: The liquid samples will be stored at 80ºC. To concentrate samples by 3 or 4 times,&#xD;
           the liquid samples would be lyophilized over-night and kept in 20ºC until assayed. Dry&#xD;
           samples will be reconstructed in the assay buffer immediately before analysis by EIA.&#xD;
           Determination of OT was performed by commercial OT ELISA kit (Assay Design, MI, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           CT: The samples will be stored at -20°C until assayed. Cortisol levels will be assayed&#xD;
           using a commercial ELISA kit (Assay Design, MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           DHEA: In-order to precipitate the saliva, samples will undergo several freeze-thaw&#xD;
           cycles. After the fourth cycle the tubes will be centrifuged at 1500 x g (@3000 rpm) for&#xD;
           20 minutes. Supernatants will be stored at -20°C until assayed. Determination of DHEA&#xD;
           will be performed using a commercial DHEA ELISA kit (Salimetrics, USA). Salimetrics DHEA&#xD;
           kit is a competitive immunoassay specifically designed for the quantitative measurement&#xD;
           of salivary DHEA. On the day of assay, samples will be thawed, and 50 micro-liters will&#xD;
           pipette into the appropriate well of the kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunological measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           SIgA: there is a strong relationship between the immunological system and stress. the&#xD;
           investigators will therefore assay SIgA, which has also been studied in stressful&#xD;
           situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunological measure analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Determination of s-IgA will be performed using a commercial s-IgA ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN&#xD;
           AG: 23560, Luebeck, Germany). The kit provides quantitative in vitro assay for s-IgA in&#xD;
           human saliva. On day of assay, samples will be thawed completely and diluted 1:201 in&#xD;
           sample buffer and further measured according the kit's instructions. Measurements were&#xD;
           performed in duplicate and the concentrations of samples were calculated by using matrix&#xD;
           laboratory (MATLAB 7) according to relevant standard curves. The intra-assay coefficient&#xD;
           of samples and controls was 8.1%, and inter-assay coefficients for samples and controls&#xD;
           were less than 11.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistics all variables will be entered into a data base and then into SPSS. The major&#xD;
           hypothesis will be the relative efficacy of the two interventions would be compared to&#xD;
           control, evaluating symptoms reduction, hormonal level changes and enhancing parental&#xD;
           sensitivity (among other changes in parental behavior). The investigators will perform&#xD;
           variance analysis, correlations, regression and HLM models that will describe the&#xD;
           changes in these variables in each group (two intervention and one control) along the&#xD;
           check up points (baseline, every two months and at ending point).&#xD;
