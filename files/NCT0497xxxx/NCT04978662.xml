  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is the most common metabolic disorder in children and adolescents. Sleep is&#xD;
      important for prognosis and several sleep parameters are related to metabolic control.&#xD;
      However, limited number of studies in children and adolescents showed mixed results and&#xD;
      recommendations about how to address sleep in the clinical care of diabetes in children are&#xD;
      still lacking. There is a need to examine the potential role of sleep in developing&#xD;
      preventive interventions for diabetes management in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors aimed to describe sleep/wake patterns ,sleep problems, and chronotype of children&#xD;
      and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and to assess the relation of sleep measures with&#xD;
      metabolic control and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a prospective observational cross-sectional design. An estimated sample size is&#xD;
      calculated as 83. Children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 6 to 18 years of age will&#xD;
      be recruited from two pediatric endocrinology centers specialized in diabetes. Sleep/wake&#xD;
      pattern will be assessed by actigraphy, and sleep diaries. Sleep disorder will be assessed by&#xD;
      the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) Sleep Disorder Scale, and&#xD;
      Chronotype Questionnaire will be used to determine the chronotype.&#xD;

      The study has a prospective observational cross-sectional design. An estimated sample size is&#xD;
      calculated as 83. Children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 6 to 18 years of age will&#xD;
      be recruited from two pediatric endocrinology centers specialized in diabetes. Sleep/wake&#xD;
      pattern will be assessed by actigraphy, and sleep diaries. Sleep wake patterns will be&#xD;
      assessed by Philips Respironics Mini-Mitter Actiwatch-2 for at least 3 days at home&#xD;
      environment and sleep diaries within 5-minute intervals will be filled out by parents.&#xD;
      Actigraphy is a validated wristwatch-like device that distinguishes sleep from wakefulness&#xD;
      based on accelerometer measured movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disorder will be assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (DSM-5) Sleep Disorder Scale, and Chronotype Questionnaire will be used to determine the&#xD;
      chronotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For metabolic control, targeted standard values will be used for continuous glucose&#xD;
      measurement. (Target daily blood glucose ranges 70-180 mg/dl, &lt;4% &lt;70 mg/dl, &lt;1% &lt;54 mg/dl,&#xD;
      &lt;25% &gt;180 mg/dl, &lt;5% rate &gt;250 mg/dl). The latest Hemoglobin A1c level will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire developed by the investigators including sociodemographic characteristics,&#xD;
      and diabetes related information will be gathered from the patient records.&#xD;

    <description>sleep disorder measured with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) Sleep Disorder Scale. The scale has an 8-item parent form, that could be filled up by parents or legal guardians of children aged between 6-17 years, and a 9-item self report form to be filled up by adolescents aged between 11-17 years. For each item, the caregiver is asked to rate the severity of symptoms related to sleep disorders that occurred within the past 7 days, she/he had observed in his/her child. The scale has a 5-point Likert type rating (1=never, 2=very little/rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=most of the time, 5=almost all the time). Total scores range between 8-40 and higher scores indicate presence of much more severe sleep-related problems.</description>
