    <textblock>
      At least 42 patients between the ages of 30-65, who were followed up in Pamukkale University&#xD;
      General Surgery Breast Polyclinic and planned for breast surgery, will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Those who met the criteria for inclusion in the study and those who voluntarily agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the study, who were preoperatively evaluated, will be randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups using the closed envelope method by matching age, gender, type of surgery and&#xD;
      breast cancer stage. The first of these groups is the study (n=21) and the second is the&#xD;
      control group (n=21).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study group: Patients in the study group will be informed about the postoperative&#xD;
      physiotherapy program and patient education will be provided by the physiotherapist before&#xD;
      the operation. After obtaining the consent of the surgeon performing the operation,&#xD;
      preoperative and post-operative complications (infection, lymphedema, fatigue…) and the&#xD;
      things to be considered (use of upper extremities, skin care, importance of weight control…)&#xD;
      and patient education will be given by the physiotherapist. In addition, respiratory control,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation exercises, gradual passive-active assistive-active range&#xD;
      of motion exercises, stretching exercises will also be demonstrated preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the first postoperative day, with the approval of the surgeon performing the operation,&#xD;
      the postoperative exercise program will be started once a day under the supervision of a&#xD;
      physiotherapist during the stay of the participants in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, participants will be directed to moderate intensity aerobic exercise&#xD;
      (walking, jogging…) for 150 min/week. Information will be given on the importance of physical&#xD;
      activity and increasing the level of physical activity. In addition, a brochure containing&#xD;
      explanatory information about the postoperative physiotherapy program after breast surgery&#xD;
      will be given to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue the exercises as a home program after discharge. During this&#xD;
      follow-up period, the participants will meet again with the physiotherapist every two weeks&#xD;
      for the control, compliance and continuity of the exercises. In these interviews, while&#xD;
      compliance with the exercise program is checked, exercise tolerance will also be determined&#xD;
      and necessary interventions and modifications will be made. In case of any complication&#xD;
      (limitation in physical functions, lymphedema…) during the home program, he will be informed&#xD;
      about meeting with the relevant physician and physiotherapist as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: The patients in the control group will be informed about the postoperative&#xD;
      physiotherapy program and patient education will be provided by the physiotherapist before&#xD;
      the operation. Within the knowledge and approval of the surgeon performing the operation,&#xD;
      preoperatively, respiratory control, diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation exercises,&#xD;
      passive-active assistive-active range of motion exercises are shown by the physiotherapist,&#xD;
      and patient education is provided with information about possible postoperative complications&#xD;
      and what needs to be considered. will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent of all participants was obtained; demographic information will be recorded,&#xD;
      and their physical and psychosocial conditions will be evaluated. Circumference measurements&#xD;
      for lymphedema The extremity volume will be calculated using the Frustum formula. Modified&#xD;
      Constant Murley Score for shoulder and upper extremity loss of function and evaluation of&#xD;
      activities of daily living, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor shortness tests, Tanita for&#xD;
      body composition determination, L-Dex score for bioimpedance analysis, Functional Evaluation&#xD;
      of Breast Cancer Treatment for functional status ( Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#xD;
      -Breast Cancer - FACT-B scale, Cancer Fatigue Scale for fatigue, 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)&#xD;
      for cardiovascular endurance and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) for psychosocial&#xD;
      status will be used. All measurements will be repeated preoperatively (at least 3 days before&#xD;
      the operation), on the 1st postoperative day and 3 months later.&#xD;
