      Background: The serum anion gap (AG) is commonly used as a screening tool for acid-base&#xD;
      disorders. With modern laboratory techniques using ion-selective electrodes to measure the&#xD;
      main electrolyte components of the AG, our definition high AG (HAGMA) should be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aims to assess the diagnostic value of AG and to determine a diagnostic&#xD;
      threshold for HAGMA in a high-prevalence clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Computerized extraction of anonymised data from electronic medical records was&#xD;
      performed. A pre-defined criteria included all inpatients of an acute-care hospital who had&#xD;
      measurements for organic acids (lactate, ketone or salicylate) paired with a serum urea,&#xD;
      electrolyte and creatinine panel.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: The urea &amp; electrolyte (U&amp;E) panel is a common blood test that is often performed&#xD;
      for any ill patients in a hospital. Evaluation of this panel can reveal serious underlying&#xD;
      acid-base disturbances, often a harbinger of further haemodynamic compromise. The detection&#xD;
      of a gap acidosis often is the first indicator of a serious underlying condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AG is a reflection of the unmeasured anions. The anion gap (AG) is derived from the U&amp;E&#xD;
      panel by subtracting measured anions from measured cations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AG = [Sodium] + [Potassium] - [Chloride] - [Bicarbonate] The serum potassium can be included&#xD;
      in the calculation, but due to low variability of serum potassium, most clinicians omit serum&#xD;
      potassium in the calculation of AG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of organic acids (e.g. lactic acid, ketones, uremic toxins) results in a high AG&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and such patients have a significant risk of further clinical&#xD;
      deterioration. It has however been challenging to assess for gap acidosis as the range for&#xD;
      normal AG can vary greatly due to historical differences in the laboratory techniques used to&#xD;
      measure the constituents of AG as well as a component of interindividual variability. In the&#xD;
      past, AG were reported (in milliequivalents per liter, mEq/L) in the range of 9-17&#xD;
      milliequivalents/L or 8-16 milliequivalents/L with older laboratory techniques such as flame&#xD;
      photometry, colorimetric method. In more recent years with the advent of use of ion-selective&#xD;
      electrodes (ISE), published literature suggests that the AG range may be lower as the ISE may&#xD;
      give higher readings of serum chloride. Some clinical texts and laboratories have listed the&#xD;
      reference range of AG as 3-11 milliequivalents/L or 5-12 milliequivalents/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite so, the reference range for serum sodium, potassium and chloride themselves have&#xD;
      remained the same over the years despite changes in laboratory techniques. With such&#xD;
      conflicting information, it is important to re-evaluate the screening or diagnostic threshold&#xD;
      of the AG based on modern laboratory techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic threshold of AG to detect gap acidosis due to organic&#xD;
      acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional ethics committee&#xD;
      (SingHealth centralised institutional review board: 2019/2463). A waiver of consent was&#xD;
      obtained as data was anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study. Data will be extracted from electronic medical and laboratory&#xD;
      records from all inpatient admissions to an acute hospital. Data extracted will be&#xD;
      anonymized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search criteria will include the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all inpatient admissions 2017 - 2020 and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with serum lactate, ketones and salicylates performed, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with urea, electrolytes and creatinine at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be extracted include baseline demographic data, admission date, and laboratory&#xD;
      results including urea / electrolytes / creatinine, albumin, glucose, calcium, phosphate,&#xD;
      magnesium, albumin, liver function test, arterial blood test and hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients had multiple blood samples taken, only laboratory results from a single sample&#xD;
      will be included. This will be selected by an automated algorithm which selects the sample&#xD;
      with the most complete information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan: The patients will be divided into 2 groups - with / without&#xD;
      organic acidosis (elevated serum lactate, ketones and/or salicylates). An area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of AG for the detection of&#xD;
      organic acidosis will be performed. The optimal cut-off threshold will be explored using the&#xD;
      Youden index. Analysis of the diagnostic threshold of AG at different cut-off levels will be&#xD;
      performed and the performance of the AG as a screening test at different cut-off thresholds&#xD;
      will be assessed by reviewing the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive&#xD;
      values and related indicators. A recommended cut-off value will be determined based on a test&#xD;
      sensitivity adjudicated to be acceptable.&#xD;
