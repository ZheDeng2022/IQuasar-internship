      This study aims to evaluate the utility of home-based point-of-care TB testing for early&#xD;
      diagnosis and linkage to care of household contacts of TB patients, addressing the need for&#xD;
      active case finding and early detection of infectious TB. The investigators propose an&#xD;
      exploratory study to 1) investigate the acceptability and feasibility of home-based TB&#xD;
      testing of household contacts using a new portable GeneXpert point-of-care (PoC) platform,&#xD;
      and 2) determine the potential impact of such a home-based testing program on early detection&#xD;
      of TB disease and linkage-to-care (LTC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, WHO estimated that 3.3 million cases of TB had been missed (undiagnosed or with a&#xD;
      significant delay in diagnosis or treatment). &quot;Missed&quot; TB cases are a key driver of TB&#xD;
      transmission, with approximately 9 million individuals developing TB globally each year,&#xD;
      equivalent to 126 cases per 100,000 population. The overall goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      evaluate the utility of home-based point-of-care TB testing for early diagnosis and linkage&#xD;
      to care of household contacts of TB patients, addressing the need for intensive case finding&#xD;
      and early detection of infectious TB. Although well-accepted as an effective strategy for&#xD;
      boosting HIV diagnosis and treatment rates, until recently home-based testing for TB has been&#xD;
      impossible, as there has never existed an effective, mobile PoC technology for rapid&#xD;
      diagnosis of TB. With the development of the new GeneXpert® Omni diagnostic platform from&#xD;
      Cepheid, home-based TB testing is now possible. Now is the time to study whether home-based&#xD;
      testing for TB is feasible, and will contribute to early case detection or improve&#xD;
      time-to-treatment rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has two Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the acceptability and feasibility of using point-of-care technology to&#xD;
           perform home-based TB testing of household contacts of TB patients, with subaim 1(a): To&#xD;
           assess the intent-to-seek care of household contacts symptomatic for TB, and subaim&#xD;
           1(b): To determine the proportion of household contacts symptomatic for TB consenting to&#xD;
           be tested (acceptability) and uptake of treatment referrals by those individuals&#xD;
           infected with TB within 30 days of testing (feasibility);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the outcomes of household contacts screened and tested for TB in their home&#xD;
           compared to those screened and referred for testing in a health facility, with subaim&#xD;
           2(a): To describe the barriers and facilitators to clinic follow-up by household&#xD;
           contacts symptomatic for TB and provided with referral for TB testing or treatment&#xD;
           initiation, and subaim 2(b): To determine whether point-of-care home-based TB testing&#xD;
           reduces time-to-treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory study will be conducted in a high TB prevalence area of Eastern Cape Province,&#xD;
      South Africa. Specifically, households of TB patients initiating treatment at one of 6&#xD;
      collaborating clinics will be offered a point-of-care home-based TB test, with referral for&#xD;
      immediate treatment when testing positive. In accordance with the South African National TB&#xD;
      Management Guidelines (SA-NTMG), all smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients recruited and&#xD;
      consented will be asked to provide a list of all household contacts for a household contact&#xD;
      investigation. The household contact investigation team will then, in keeping with South&#xD;
      African National Department of Health guidelines, seek verbal consent from all household&#xD;
      contacts to conduct TB symptom screening. During symptom screening, intent-to-seek care will&#xD;
      be assessed for all reported symptoms. If one household member screens positive, then the&#xD;
      whole household will be randomized to either the Intervention; home-based GeneXpert&#xD;
      point-of-care (PoC) test or Control arm; standard home-based TB symptom screening with&#xD;
      referral for testing.&#xD;

In this study, all participants enrolled in the Treatment arm will be tested for TB at their household, using the GeneXpert device. Participants enrolled in the Control arm will receive a referral letter, which can be used to access treatment at the nearest health facility. No single participant will be randomized, the whole house will receive a &quot;Blanket Randomisation&quot;.</intervention_model_description>
