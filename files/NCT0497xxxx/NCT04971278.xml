  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NYU's High Risk Program targets patients who may be more likely to have increased&#xD;
      hospitalization due to health conditions that may cause death in the near future. Community&#xD;
      Health Workers, a home visiting doctor service, a supportive care nurse, and behavioral&#xD;
      health specialist engage the population to address a range of biopsychosocial needs with end&#xD;
      goal in increasing support in the community and engaging palliative and hospice care when&#xD;
      appropriate to prevent hospital readmissions, shorten length of stay, reduce hospital&#xD;
      utilization, and decrease overall patient cost with a focus on hospital spend.&#xD;
