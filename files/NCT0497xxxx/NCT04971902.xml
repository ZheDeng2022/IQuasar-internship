      Pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics (PGx) clinical services and medication safety reviews are&#xD;
      currently being offered to PACE organizations under the direction of licensed healthcare&#xD;
      prescribers by CareKinesis d/b/a Tabula Rasa HealthCare. This project aims to include&#xD;
      patients enrolled in PACE organizations with chronic pain and who are prescribed CYP2D6&#xD;
      activated opioids. PGx testing will be performed by contractual PGx vendor with TRHC. PGx&#xD;
      results will be integrated into TRHC's proprietary Clinical Decision Support System&#xD;
      (Medication Risk Mitigation™ Matrix, CareKinesis, Moorestown, NJ) that guides pharmacists to&#xD;
      identify drug-drug interactions (DDIs), drug-gene interactions (DGIs), and drug-drug-gene&#xD;
      interactions (DDGIs).16 Clinical pharmacists will translate PGx results combined with a&#xD;
      comprehensive DDI review into actionable clinical decisions. Clinical pharmacists will&#xD;
      provide medication therapy management recommendation to address medication problems to the&#xD;
      PACE prescriber (physician). PACE prescribers will review the pharmacist's recommendation,&#xD;
      and based on their clinical assessment, the prescriber will decide whether or not to&#xD;
      implement the opioid therapy recommendation.&#xD;

      Tabula Rasa HealthCare (TRHC), doing business as CareKinesis, is the first national pharmacy&#xD;
      that provides science-based medication risk identification and mitigation technologies and&#xD;
      services. CareKinesis utilizes medication decision support tools and pharmacists certified in&#xD;
      geriatrics to provide pharmacy services for various healthcare organizations including PACE&#xD;
      organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a Medicare-Medicaid program that&#xD;
      provides comprehensive medical and supportive services to individuals &gt;55 years of age who&#xD;
      are certified by their state as needing nursing home care. As an alternative to&#xD;
      institutionalization, PACE helps these individuals live safely in their community. The aim of&#xD;
      PACE is to improve overall quality of life in four domains (physical, psychological, social,&#xD;
      and spiritual) using a multidisciplinary approach. In the United States, the vast majority of&#xD;
      PACE organizations collaborate with one pharmacy to dispense drugs, in addition to other&#xD;
      pharmacy services, for their population of participants.15 Presently, CareKinesis services&#xD;
      more than 35 PACE organizations, including approximately 75 PACE sites, across the country.&#xD;
      As a national PACE pharmacy provider since 2011, CareKinesis focuses on improving medication&#xD;
      regimens to reduce medication-related risks while enhancing economic, clinical and humanistic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics (PGx) clinical services and medication safety&#xD;
      reviews are currently being offered to PACE organizations under the direction of licensed&#xD;
      healthcare prescribers by CareKinesis d/b/a Tabula Rasa HealthCare. This project aims to&#xD;
      include patients enrolled in PACE organizations with chronic pain and who are prescribed&#xD;
      CYP2D6 activated opioids. PGx testing will be performed by a contractual PGx vendor with&#xD;
      TRHC. PGx results will be integrated into TRHC's proprietary Clinical Decision Support System&#xD;
      (Medication Risk Mitigation™ Matrix, CareKinesis, Moorestown, NJ) that guides pharmacists to&#xD;
      identify drug-drug interactions (DDIs), drug-gene interactions (DGIs), and drug-drug-gene&#xD;
      interactions (DDGIs).16 Clinical pharmacists will translate PGx results combined with a&#xD;
      comprehensive DDI review into actionable clinical decisions. Clinical pharmacists will&#xD;
      provide medication therapy management recommendation to address medication problems to the&#xD;
      PACE prescriber (physician). PACE prescribers will review the pharmacist's recommendation,&#xD;
      and based on their clinical assessment, the prescriber will decide whether or not to&#xD;
      implement the opioid therapy recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of health-related quality of life (QoL) and pain assessment using the EQ-5D&#xD;
      survey, and numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain will be performed during the study by PACE&#xD;
      prescribers or the PACE interdisciplinary team (IDT) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D) will be performed at baseline and&#xD;
           at the completion of the study (visits 1 and 3, respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS for pain will be performed at baseline (before the PGx testing), 1-2 and 2-3 weeks&#xD;
           after TRHC's pharmacist recommendations (visits 1, 2 and 3, respectively) All PACE&#xD;
           patients will continue to receive usual medical care throughout the study. Changes to&#xD;
           drug regimens will be at the discretion of the patients' PACE prescribers.&#xD;
