  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand how best to promote engagement with remote measurement&#xD;
      technology (RMT) research in major depressive disorder, using the RADAR-MDD infrastructure as&#xD;
      a case study. An adapted questionnaire app with insightful notifications and progress&#xD;
      visualization will be compared against the app as usual, in terms of behavioural and&#xD;
      experiential engagement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote measurement technologies (RMTs) provide an opportunity for real-time, longitudinal&#xD;
      health tracking through a combination of smartphone apps for symptom reporting (active RMT;&#xD;
      aRMT) and mobile/wearable sensors for passive data collection (passive RMT; pRMT). The use of&#xD;
      RMTs to track relapse and remission of symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD) is thought&#xD;
      to be more reflective of patient daily experience, in comparison to retrospective recall&#xD;
      during clinic visits. The Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse- Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (RADAR-MDD) study uses RMTs to identify predictors of MDD relapse. It collects&#xD;
      multiparametric RMT data through the RADAR-base system over a two year follow-up period; aRMT&#xD;
      data is collected via mood-tracking questionnaires in the active app, and pRMT data is&#xD;
      collected via a fitness watch, the Fitbit Charge device. The promise of RADAR-MDD depends&#xD;
      heavily on user engagement with the app. Currently, engagement with aRMT symptom tracking in&#xD;
      the field is hugely heterogeneous and preliminary estimates of the RADAR-MDD study suggest&#xD;
      around 50% completion of fortnightly questionnaires. There are several, in-app methods&#xD;
      available to promote engagement with mHealth tools. Notifications with theoretically informed&#xD;
      content can provide a trigger to perform a behaviour, and data visualisation of progress can&#xD;
      prompt continued data input. It is unclear which combination of in-app features can promote&#xD;
      engagement with the RADAR-base system, while minimising participant burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims to understand how best to promote engagement with RMT research,&#xD;
      using the RADAR-MDD project as a case study. This protocol will outline a mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach to exploring the impact of additional, in-app components on engagement with symptom&#xD;
      tracking via the RADAR-Base infrastructure. First, a two-armed randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will compare the RADAR-MDD questionnaire app as usual with an adapted app with insightful&#xD;
      notifications and progress visualization, aimed at promoting behavioural and experiential&#xD;
      engagement. Engagement will be measured as a) provision of symptom tracking scores over the&#xD;
      12-week study period, and b) the degree to which participants feel experientially engaged&#xD;
      with symptom tracking via the system. Second, qualitative interviews will reveal participant&#xD;
      experiences of the techniques used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has three main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the impact of an adapted smartphone app on behavioural engagement with RMT symptom&#xD;
      tracking, in comparison with the RADAR-MDD app as usual;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the impact of an adapted smartphone app on experiential engagement with RMT&#xD;
      symptom tracking, in comparison with the RADAR-MDD app as usual;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitatively explore the views of participants on the use of an adapted smartphone app to&#xD;
      increase engagement with the RADAR-Base system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings in this field would go some way to providing scalable solutions for engagement in&#xD;
      RMT studies, higher quality results and applications for implementation into clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

    <description>The RADAR-MDD questionnaire app as usual asks participants to complete 3x active tasks per week, with one reminder notification at 9am on a day that a questionnaire is due. The notification reads 'Questionnaire Time. Won't usually take longer than 3 minutes'. The participant is not able to view any data progress, aside from through the Fitbit app, which was present in the original RADAR-MDD study.</description>

    <description>The following components are also present:&#xD;
Notifications: The notification will alternate between the phrases 'Questionnaire Time. Symptom tracking might increase self-awareness of your emotions (Bakker &amp; Rickard, 2018)', 'Questionnaire Time. Symptom tracking is a technique often used in treatment to increase insight into your symptoms (Kramer et al., 2014)', and 'Questionnaire Time. Tracking your symptoms through a smartphone and Fitbit might help research to better understand health conditions'.&#xD;
Progress visualisation: Participants will be able to view their questionnaire completion progress as a visualisation through the app, in the form of a graph.&#xD;
Additional components: An additional text on the home screen of the active app will read 'You can contact your research team between 9am-5pm Mon-Fri if you have questions, onradar-engage@kcl.ac.uk'.</description>
