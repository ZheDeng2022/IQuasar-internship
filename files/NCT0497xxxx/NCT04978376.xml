  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 24 million older adults have prediabetes. Obesity, age related decreases in&#xD;
      lean mass and increases in fat mass, and sedentary lifestyle have been associated with&#xD;
      functional and cognitive decline in older adults. Innovative lifestyle strategies to treat&#xD;
      obesity and pre-diabetes are critically needed. The proposed research will demonstrate that&#xD;
      time restricted eating combined with resistance training is an effective non-pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy to help obese prediabetic individuals reduce body fat, maintain lean mass, prevent&#xD;
      progression of prediabetes to diabetes, and improve cognition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity, age related decreases in lean mass and increases in fat mass, and sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle have been associated with functional and cognitive decline in older adults. It is&#xD;
      expected that the proportion of the population of over 65 will continue to increase as will&#xD;
      the number of older adults with pre-diabetes. Treatment of pre-diabetes and improved&#xD;
      functionality and cognition in older adults include maintaining a healthy weight and regular&#xD;
      exercise. While daily calorie restriction is the most common prescription for weight loss,&#xD;
      intermittent fasting is an alternative to daily calorie restriction producing significant&#xD;
      weight loss. Currently, the most popular form of intermittent fasting is time restricted&#xD;
      eating (TRE). TRE typically involves confining the eating window to 6-10 h and fasting for&#xD;
      the remaining hours of the day. During the eating window, individuals are not required to&#xD;
      count calories or monitor food intake in any way. Current TRE data shows promising results&#xD;
      for diet alone including natural calorie restriction, weight loss, decreased blood pressure&#xD;
      and increased insulin sensitivity all while maintaining a high adherence. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      TRE combined with resistance training (RT) or endurance training (EN)has only been examined&#xD;
      in lean resistance trained young adults, never in older adults or adults with overweight or&#xD;
      obesity. Hypothesis: The present proposal will test the following hypothesis: (1) Both&#xD;
      combination groups will lose significantly more weight than TRE alone or the control. The TRE&#xD;
      + RT group will significantly decrease fat mass and increase lean mass more than the TRE +&#xD;
      EN, TRE alone or control group. The TRE + RT will lose the same amount of body weight but&#xD;
      maintain more lean mass than the TRE+EN group; (2a) The TRE+RT group will experience greater&#xD;
      improvements in insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, HbA1c and other metabolic disease&#xD;
      variables (fasting insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure) versus the&#xD;
      TRE+EN group after the 8-week trial due to reductions in body weight and greater retention of&#xD;
      lean mass; (2b) TRE combined with both EN and RT will be safe in older adults with no&#xD;
      significant intervention related adverse events; (3) TRE combined with both EN and RT will&#xD;
      improve attention and executive function and working memory in the physical activity groups&#xD;
      more than diet alone or the control group. Methods: To test these objectives, a 10-week&#xD;
      parallel-arm pilot trial will be implemented. Older adults with overweight or obesity and&#xD;
      pre-diabetes will be assigned to one of four groups: (1) TRE group, ad-libitum eating between&#xD;
      12:00-20:00 (n=50) (2) TRE + EN ad-libitum eating between 12:00-20:00 with 3-5 days of&#xD;
      supervised endurance exercise per week (n=50) (3)TRE + RT group, ad-libitum eating between&#xD;
      12:00-20:00 with 3-5 days of supervised resistance training per week (n=50) or (4) Control&#xD;
      group, no change in diet or physical activity (n=50). Significance: If the aims of this&#xD;
      application are achieved, this study will be the first to show that TRE with physical&#xD;
      activity is safe in older adults and can be implemented as an alternative to traditional&#xD;
      dieting (i.e. daily calorie restriction) for weight management and lean mass retention. This&#xD;
      study will also show that TRE can be used as an effective non-pharmacological therapy to&#xD;
      improve insulin sensitivity, decrease metabolic risk factors, and improve cognition in older&#xD;
      individuals with obesity and pre-diabetes.&#xD;
