    <measure>Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MPR will be defined as the proportion of participants with ≤ 10% residual viable tumor in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes after completion of neoadjuvant therapy.</description>

    <measure>1-year/3-year Disease-free Survival (DFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The DFS will be defined as the proportion of participants free from disease events at 1st year and 3rd year after the first date of no disease. The DFS will be defined as the time from the first date of no disease to local or distant recurrence or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

    <time_frame>approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EFS will be defined as the proportion of participants free from progression events (EFS events) at 1st year and 3rd year after the first dose. The EFS will be defined as the time from the time of first dose until any of the following events, whichever occurs first: radiographic disease progression as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5 years</time_frame>
