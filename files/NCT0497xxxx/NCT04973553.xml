  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 1, single-ascending dose clinical trial will be conducted. This study will be&#xD;
      designed to test increasing doses of multimodal exercise in successive cohorts of six&#xD;
      participants (cumulative 3 + 3 design)[22] (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum dose is reached when two or more participants experience DLT. DLT, dose-limiting&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'dose' will be defined as the ability to reach a fixed maximal level of exercise (type,&#xD;
      duration (including session length) in the first two weeks post-stroke without experiencing&#xD;
      dose-limiting tolerance (DLT). DLT thresholds will be based on failure to complete more than&#xD;
      20% of prescribed 3-day rehabilitation dose due to pain, rate of perceived exertion, fatigue,&#xD;
      or effort required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and measurement sessions will be held at either at the Stroke or Geriatric&#xD;
      Units at Campus Sint-Jan, Genk or at the rehabilitation unit at Sint-Barbara, Lanaken, with&#xD;
      medical services on site. All participants will be monitored for fatigue and pain pre, during&#xD;
      and at post-intervention daily. The researchers (PI of project [Dr Peter Hallet, ZOL]&#xD;
      Postdoctoral Researcher [Dr Lisa Tedesco Triccas, UHasselt] and PhD/Masters Students&#xD;
      [UHasselt) will conduct the clinical tests and will conduct the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
