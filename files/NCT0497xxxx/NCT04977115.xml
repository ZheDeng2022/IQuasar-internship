  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of capsulotomy assisted by intraocular&#xD;
      caliper and Verion navigation system in phacoemulsification surgery and postoperative visual&#xD;
      quality of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) is an important and technically challenging&#xD;
      procedure in cataract surgery. However, most surgeons perform CCC by experience or referring&#xD;
      to the pupil size, which is highly subjective and the accuracy of capsulorhexis is&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. The investigators developed a new modified intraocular caliper with standard&#xD;
      calibration on the rinse needle, which can measure and locate the position of capsulorhexis.&#xD;
      The surgeon can gently use the blunt needle in the front of the intraocular caliper to&#xD;
      further make corresponding markers on the lens anterior capsule, and then carry out&#xD;
      capsulotomy according to the marks. We found intraocular caliper-assisted capsulotomy can&#xD;
      obviously improve the accuracy of capsulorhexis. The purpose of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      accuracy and postoperative visual quality of intraocular caliper-assisted capsulotomy with&#xD;
      those of digital image projection device VERION navigation system.&#xD;

    <description>Images of the edges of IOL and capsulorhexis are taken at the end of the operation. Image J image analysis software is used to measure the horizontal diameter and vertical diameter of capsulorhexis with the diameter of IOL optical surface (6 mm) as the reference by two independently professional graders at the meantime, and further calculate the deviation of horizontal and vertical diameter of capsulorhexis from the target diameter (5.3 mm) .</description>

    <description>In intraocular caliper-assisted capsulotomy group, a modified intraocular caliper with standard calibration on the rinse needle was used to measure and locate the position of capsulorhexis with 5.3 mm diameter and the principle of pupillary margin in concentric circles. The surgeon could gently use the blunt needle in the front of the intraocular caliper to further make corresponding markers on the lens anterior capsule, and then carry out capsulotomy according to the marks.</description>
