  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare gastrointestinal transit time measured by the SmartPill and the Atmo&#xD;
      gas capsule in patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders. Both of these devices allow&#xD;
      gastrointestinal transit time to be measured, however the SmartPill senses pH changes whereas&#xD;
      the Atmo Capsule measures gas profiles. A total of 60 participants (30 diagnosed with&#xD;
      gastroparesis, 30 with slow transit constipation) will attend Macarthur Clinical School at&#xD;
      Western Sydney University after an overnight fast. Participants will consume a standardised&#xD;
      meal before ingesting the SmartPill and Atmo Capsule. Each participant will carry a data&#xD;
      receiver until passage of the capsules. Anatomical landmarks will be defined by pH changes&#xD;
      (SmartPill) or oxygen profiles (Atmo Capsule). Statistical analysis will be performed via&#xD;
      linear regression and degrees of agreement for measurements between the two devices. Primary&#xD;
      end-points will be the agreement between gastric emptying, small intestinal and colonic&#xD;
      transit times generated by the devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Atmo gas capsule is an ingestible, wireless, gas sensing capsule that is currently being&#xD;
      developed and commercialised as a biomarker tool for gastrointestinal disorders. Following&#xD;
      ingestion, the Atmo gas capsule transmits information about gases and temperature to an&#xD;
      external receiver. The oxygen concentration profiles generated allow the passage of the&#xD;
      capsule between aerobic (small intestine) and anaerobic (large intestine) to be&#xD;
      characterised. The practical application of the Atmo Capsule is currently limited by the need&#xD;
      to validate oxygen concentrations as a marker of position within the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies using intestinal ultrasound have shown that migration of the Atmo capsule&#xD;
      from the stomach to the duodenum, and its passage from terminal ileum to caecum, corresponds&#xD;
      with major changes in oxygen concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartPill measures pH and offers gold-standard measurements of gastrointestinal transit&#xD;
      times. To validate the ability of the Atmo Capsule to measure gastrointestinal transit time,&#xD;
      this device will be compared to the SmartPill. This will allow the equivalence of these two&#xD;
      devices in gastrointestinal transit measurements to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare gastrointestinal transit times using immediately sequential&#xD;
      ingestion of the SmartPill and Atmo capsule in patients with gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
      disorders. A total of 60 participants diagnosed with either gastroparesis (n=30) or slow&#xD;
      transit constipation (n=30) will be recruited by advertisement (via online support group&#xD;
      pages, such as Gastroparesis Australia) and word-of-mouth. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility. Suitable individuals will be sent a Participant Information Sheet&#xD;
      and Consent Form for review. Participants will be asked to stop proton pump inhibitors,&#xD;
      histamine receptor blockers and antacids 3 days prior to the study and during the study.&#xD;
      Medications that affect gastric motility will also be stopped 48 hours before the start of&#xD;
      the study and during the study. Following an overnight fast, participants will attend the&#xD;
      Macarthur Clinical School, Western Sydney University, where the Principal Investigator (Dr&#xD;
      Jerry Zhou) will review the Patient Information Sheet with each participant and obtain&#xD;
      informed written consent. Participants will then be asked to consume a cereal bar with 200mL&#xD;
      of water. Participants will subsequently ingest the SmartPill and Atmo capsule. The order of&#xD;
      swallowing these devices will be randomised with a computer-generated list. Participants will&#xD;
      be monitored for 15 minutes post-ingestion. Subjects will then fast for the next 6 hours,&#xD;
      after which they will consume their normal meals for the rest of the day. The data receiver&#xD;
      for both the SmartPill and Atmo capsule will be worn or kept within 1.5 metres of the body&#xD;
      until passage of the capsule has been confirmed by observation in the toilet bowl or signal&#xD;
      loss from both capsules after a bowel movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, bowel movements and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms will be&#xD;
      recorded in a digital diary (as part of the Atmo receiver system) whilst the Atmo capsule is&#xD;
      in the body. Once both devices have passed from the body, participants will attend Macarthur&#xD;
      Clinical School, where receivers will be returned and an investigator will review the digital&#xD;
      diary with them.The investigator will follow up with the participant via phone or email&#xD;
      approximately one week after the study to enquire about symptoms and adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SmartPill, anatomical landmarks will be identified by changes in pH profiles along&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract as previously reported in the literature. More specifically,&#xD;
      gastric emptying time will be defined by the time of capsule ingestion to the presence of a&#xD;
      sharp rise in pH (more than three units), where the capsule passes from an acidic environment&#xD;
      (pH ≤4) in the stomach to a more basic environment (pH &gt;6) in the duodenum. Small intestinal&#xD;
      transit will be determined by the time between the end of gastric emptying and identification&#xD;
      of the ileo-caecal junction (a fall in ≥1 pH unit distal to gastric emptying). Colonic&#xD;
      transit time will be defined as the time from ileocaecal junction to exit from the body.&#xD;
      Whole gut transit time will be calculated as time of oral ingestion to exit from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Atmo capsule, oxygen profiles will be used to characterise gastric emptying, small&#xD;
      intestinal and colonic transit. Whole gut transit time will be calculated based on a change&#xD;
      in temperature from exiting the body. The primary end-points of this study will be the&#xD;
      agreement between gastric emptying, small intestinal and colonic transit times generated by&#xD;
      the gas-sensing capsule vs wireless pH-motility. Statistical analysis with linear regression&#xD;
      and by degrees of agreement (Bland-Altman tests) of measurements between the two devices will&#xD;
      address these end-points. More subjects will be studied pending the results of this pilot&#xD;
      study. The results, conduct and reporting of this study will conform to the STARD 2015&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
