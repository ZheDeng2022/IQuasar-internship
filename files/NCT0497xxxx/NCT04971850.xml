  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of main problems in the management of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children and&#xD;
      young adults is their screening, and the absence or the weak correlation between clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and polysomnography (PSG). It may be useful to use additional measures together with&#xD;
      PSG to improve the detection and characterization of respiratory events during sleep and/or&#xD;
      correlation with clinical signs of SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether psychological and&#xD;
      neuropsychological test scores correlate with diagnostic PSG results.&#xD;

      One of main problems in the management of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children and&#xD;
      young adults is their screening, and the absence or the weak correlation between clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and polysomnography (PSG). It may be useful to use additional measures together with&#xD;
      PSG to improve the detection and characterization of respiratory events during sleep and/or&#xD;
      correlation with clinical signs of SDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the clinical impact of SDB and the benefit of treatment are still not clear in&#xD;
      children and young adults, including neurocognitive and developmental perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the validation of simplified tools could optimize and simplify the detection of SDB&#xD;
      in children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to perform a diagnostic PSG for routine clinical care will have additional&#xD;
      recordings and questionnaires as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether psychological and&#xD;
      neuropsychological test scores correlate with diagnostic PSG results.&#xD;
