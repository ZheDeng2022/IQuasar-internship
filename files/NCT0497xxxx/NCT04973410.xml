      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the correlation between absolute flow and resistance assessed by&#xD;
           catheter-based thermodilution technique using CoroFlow®-system and myocardial blood flow&#xD;
           (MBF) measured by positron emission tomography (PET) and the tracer [15O] labeled water&#xD;
           ([15O]H2O) (15O-H2O PET)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the correlation between impaired MBF measured with 15O-H2O PET and negative&#xD;
           fractional flow reserve (FFR) and index of microvascular resistance (IMR) level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with angina pectoris and reduced MBF measured with 15O-H2O PET but no hemodynamic&#xD;
      significant stenosis (FFR &gt; 0.80), the IMR is &gt;25 measured with continuous thermodilution&#xD;
      indicating microcirculatory dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We include patients with angina pectoris and suspected coronary disease based on a&#xD;
      cardiac-computerised tomography (CT) scan. Patients are then referred to an 15O-H2O PET (rest&#xD;
      and stress) and then a diagnostic invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with physiological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Computer tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) is a purely an anatomical scan and&#xD;
      can be insufficient in assessing the significance of a coronary stenosis. The latest European&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that, as a supplementary study after heart CT and before invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography (ICA), a myocardial perfusion study is performed to avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several PET flow tracers are available, but 15O-H2O is considered the gold standard for&#xD;
      quantification of regional myocardial perfusion since 15O-H2O is a freely diffusible tracer.&#xD;
      15O-water PET has been validated for measure perfusion in myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15O-H2O is an inert radiopharmaceutical of oxygen-15 (O-15) labelled water used as a tracer&#xD;
      molecule with positron emission tomography (PET). Upon administration, 15O-H2O is freely&#xD;
      diffusible and its distribution, as well as its clearance, are completely dependent on the&#xD;
      rate of blood flow. 15O-H2O PET imaging is golden standard for measure tissue perfusion&#xD;
      including myocardial perfusion. The PET agent 15O-H2O has a very short half-life of about 2&#xD;
      minutes thereby allowing for multiple, serial measurements. Two recent studies have described&#xD;
      the diagnostic accuracy of 15O-H2O PET in comparison to coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both studies, 15O-H2O PET had a sensitivity of 87-95%; specificity was at least 84%. The&#xD;
      study by Danad et al7 is the largest published series to date. A recently published&#xD;
      single-center study compared 15O-H2O PET to imaging using 99mTc and found superior&#xD;
      performance characteristics for the 15O-H2O PET, relative to a truth standard of ICA with&#xD;
      fractional flow reserve (FFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is defined as the maximum achievable blood flow that can still&#xD;
      be maintained to myocardium despite the stenosis. Also described as the ratio between the&#xD;
      pressure distal to the stenosis (Pd) and the pressure proximal (Pa) to the lesion during&#xD;
      hyperemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In randomized trials the benefits of FFR measurements was established by comparing FFR-guided&#xD;
      PCI plus medical therapy with just medical therapy. This showed that patients with stable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease will benefit from FFR-guided PCI plus medical therapy in that the&#xD;
      risk of needing urgent revascularization will be smaller.9 Randomized trials also show that&#xD;
      if an intermediate coronary stenosis - not functionally significant - is measured to have an&#xD;
      FFR ≥0.75, the risk of infarction from that stenosis is less than 1 %. Therefore, these&#xD;
      patients will not benefit from PCI.10 This makes FFR an important tool for assessing which&#xD;
      patients could benefit from a PCI and which are better off with the best medical therapy&#xD;
      available. However, it only describes the flow of the epicardial arteries. FFR value may be&#xD;
      non-significant (&gt;0.80) while the patient may still have angina. This may be due to&#xD;
      microvascular disease. The evaluation of the microvascular status when the FFR indicates&#xD;
      non-obstructive disease (&gt;0.80) currently has IIa indication in the ECS guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermodilution method with the CoroFlow® (Coroventis, Uppsala, Sweden) from which coronary&#xD;
      flow reserve and microvascular resistance can be calculated alongside the FFR value. This&#xD;
      gives us opportunity to study coronary microcirculatory dysfunction and is believed to be&#xD;
      common in patients with angina and no significant disease in the epicardial arteries.&#xD;
      However, there is a gap in evidence in terms of finding the best method to conduct&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of the microcirculatory system independently of epicardial&#xD;
      stenoses.13 Furthermore, the combination of coronary flow reserve and microvascular&#xD;
      resistance measured by invasive thermodilution method (CoroFlow®-system) has not previously&#xD;
      been compared to myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured with the golden standard 15O-H2O PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological assessment protocol The ICA is performed according to present clinical&#xD;
      guidelines through femoral or radial ar-tery. Prior to the coronary angiography, the operator&#xD;
      administrates 250 μg of intra-coronary nitroglycerine. Anticoagulation (5,000 IU heparin) is&#xD;
      administrated before the measure-ment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary physiological assessment is performed in all vessels (left anterior descending&#xD;
      (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA) and the circumflex artery (CX)) with the thermodilution&#xD;
      method measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of&#xD;
      microcirculatory resistance (IMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidewire equipped with a pressure and temperature sensor (PressureWire X, Abbott, IL) is&#xD;
      passed through the guiding catheter. The operator infuses saline at room temperature 3 times&#xD;
      in rest. Hyperaemia is then induced with adenosine was infused intravenously (140 mg/kg/min,&#xD;
      then the operator infuses saline at room temperature at hyperaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coroventis system is used as pressure measuring software. Routine checks are made to&#xD;
      ensure that 'drift' does not occur after the recordings. Drift value of ≤ ±0.02 is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 15O-H20 PET Study participants will be instructed to avoid all caffeine-containing&#xD;
      drinks and foods such as coffee, chocolate, cola, banana and tea for at least 24 hours prior&#xD;
      to the planned admin-istration of adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative myocardial perfusion at rest and during hyperemia will be measured using 2&#xD;
      injections (rest &amp; stress) of 400 MBq of 15O-H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial scout CT scan to localize the heart, a low-dose CT for attenuation&#xD;
      correction (CTAC) of the subsequent PET emission data is performed. Following the CTAC, the&#xD;
      rest and stress PET scans will be performed in that order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rest scan: A PET list mode acquisition of 4 minutes in duration should be started just before&#xD;
      the intravenous injection of 400 MBq of 15O-H2O from a water generator (MedTrace P3 system).&#xD;
      List mode data is reconstructed with ECG-signal to an 8-bin ECG-gated blood pool image of the&#xD;
      first pass (0-50 seconds after injection) and a dynamic data set of 22 frames from 0-4&#xD;
      minutes after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress scan: Pharmacological stress is induced by infusion of adenosine intravenously at a&#xD;
      standard rate of 140µg/kg/min. Following 2 minutes of adenosine injection, vasodilation is&#xD;
      known to reach a steady state, a second dose of 15O-H2O (400 MBq) is injected, and a new PET&#xD;
      scan is performed like the rest scan (list mode imaging initiated before the bolus IV&#xD;
      injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both acquisitions and the stress test, heart rate and blood pressure as well as any&#xD;
      ECG related abnormalities is monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from rest and stress 15O-H2O PET scans will be analyzed using the aQuant software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and power calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student's t-test will be used for continuous variables and non-parametric test for&#xD;
      categorical variables. The diagnostic performance of 15O-H2O PET is assessed by Bland-Altmann&#xD;
      plot and receiver operative curves. The result quality will be assessed according to the&#xD;
      P-value (P&gt;0.05) significance between low and high IMR groups. With a standard deviation of&#xD;
      10, mean difference of 15, power of 80 % and alpha value of 0.05, n=22 patients in total are&#xD;
      needed. To accommodate for drop outs 40 patients i.e. 20 in two groups are included. In group&#xD;
      A will be patients with a non-significant FFR value (&lt;0.80) and an IMR value indicating no&#xD;
      microcirculatory dysfunction (IMR &lt;25). In group B will be patients with a non-significant&#xD;
      FFR value (&lt;0.80) and an IMR value indicating microcirculatory dysfunction (IMR ≥25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results Results, positive, neutral as well as negative or inconclusive, will&#xD;
      be published in an international cardiovascular journal without delay. Publication and author&#xD;
      issues are decided by the steering committee on basis of general involvement in the study&#xD;
      (drafting of protocol, core lab. function, end point committee membership, etc.) and of&#xD;
      number of included patients. The funding companies have no influence on study design, study&#xD;
      conduct, analysis, interpretation and reporting of derived results.&#xD;
