    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this investigational product or medicinal product. Serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, and is an important medical event. A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an investigational product or medicinal product or any existing event that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the investigational product or medicinal product until the end of the safety follow-up period.</description>
