      Biomarkers of heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes: establishment of a biobank and an integrated&#xD;
      approach to clinical and metabolic phenotyping of individuals with established T1DM. In this&#xD;
      project the investigators are searching for biomarkers in 600 patients with established (&gt;5&#xD;
      years) diabetes. The inter-relation and patterns of expression in clinical, (auto)immune,&#xD;
      metabolic, inflammatory and other parameters, and (potential) biomarkers are investogated.&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples are collected annually (over 3 years) in standardized conditions and&#xD;
      biobanked. In addition, 150 patients will undergo additional metabolic testing (such as mixed&#xD;
      meal-tests).&#xD;

      Identifying biomarkers of type 1 diabetes heterogeneity can help to stage the disease, and&#xD;
      identify risks such as the early development of damage and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes has long been considered to be an autoimmune disease in which failure of&#xD;
      immune tolerance induces a specific immune attack on insulin-producing beta-cells. Recent&#xD;
      research shows that the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes is heterogeneous, involving&#xD;
      various beta-cell-specific processes, different genetic predispositions, and several disease&#xD;
      stages. It is very important to recognize this heterogeneity as it results in an accumulation&#xD;
      of differences in outcomes during the course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This heterogeneity requires further elucidation as a heterogeneous disease is likely to&#xD;
      require multiple approaches to stop or cure the pathophysiological pathways. This underscores&#xD;
      the need for more biomarkers to identify this heterogeneity, the different phases of disease&#xD;
      and the effects of interventions and cures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries and research groups, data and samples from newly-diagnosed individuals&#xD;
      (i.e. within the first 6 months after diagnosis) have been collected and studied. Fewer data&#xD;
      and samples are available from patients with longer disease duration. This prompted JDRF to&#xD;
      grant a strategic research agreement (SRA) to Diabeter and UMC Groningen. Both clinics have&#xD;
      access to a substantial clinical database since 1998 with medical record data of &gt; 3500 type&#xD;
      1 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this BIOMARKER project, the investigators intend to analyze hormonal, biochemical,&#xD;
      immunological, inflammatory and psychological biomarkers of type 1 diabetes in patients with&#xD;
      a disease duration of &gt; 5 years. A sample repository (serum, plasma, urine, DNA, RNA) is&#xD;
      established which is also accessible to other interested collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection currently includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting samples (serum, plasma, urine, DNA, RNA) from 600 patients with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
           (&gt; 5 years duration) taken annually at 3 timepoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples from 150 patients who underwent Mixed Meal Tolerance Tests (MMTT with 5&#xD;
           timepoints) at 2 occasions (1-year interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from questionnaires on psychosocial burden, quality of life, neuropathy and&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia completed by the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical datasets on their health, diabetes history, family history and clinical course&#xD;
           during treatment&#xD;
