The scale has 3 sub-dimensions: &quot;Attitude of the Society towards Family Planning&quot;, &quot;Attitude towards Family Planning Methods&quot; and &quot;Attitude towards Birth&quot;. Evaluation of the scale is done as individuals with higher scores have more positive family planning attitudes. The internal consistency and homogeneity coefficients determined by the alpha correlations of the scale were found to be 0.90 in total.</description>
