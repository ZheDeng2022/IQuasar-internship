      The target population for our study is healthy nulliparous pregnant women (first pregnancy)&#xD;
      between the 12-16 week of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject is eligible, written consent will be obtained by person to person contact.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either daily L-citrulline supplementation&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthy nulliparous pregnant women (first pregnancy) between the 12-16 week of pregnancy will&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. The purpose of this study will be to determine if daily&#xD;
      supplementation of oral L-citrulline can reduce the incidence of pregnancy induced&#xD;
      hypertension. This will be a double blind study, subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either L-citrulline (3 gram sachet) or a placebo for a total of 8 weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide urine and blood samples at time of enrollment, be asked to respond to a&#xD;
      phone survey to assess for side effects, and again be asked to provide urine and blood&#xD;
      samples at the end of 8 weeks. Participants will continue with routine prenatal care&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
