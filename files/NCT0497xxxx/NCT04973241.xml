    <textblock>
      Growth changes occur from the intrauterine life to senility, hard tissues like bones and&#xD;
      teeth undergo changes with growth, a change in shape and/or fusion of ossification centers,&#xD;
      the stability of these changes facilitate ease in estimation of age from hard tissue samples&#xD;
      ( Bhalaji ,2006;Reddy,2006; Mohite et al.,2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibles were used for the study for two simple causes: First, there appears to be a lack of&#xD;
      standards utilizing this element and second, this bone is often recovered mostly intact&#xD;
      (Franklin et al.,2008) The mandible is considered the most durable facial bone ;is due to the&#xD;
      presence of a dense layer of compact bone and therefore remains well conserved than many&#xD;
      other bones and the only movable bone of the skull available for gender identification; is&#xD;
      due to the morphological characteristics of mandible, and radiology plays an important role&#xD;
      in it. It is composed of two hemi mandibles united at the midline by a vertical symphysis.&#xD;
      Each one of them is composed of a horizontal body with a posterior vertical extension termed&#xD;
      the ramus(ndira et al.,2012 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular canines are found to exhibit the highest sexual dimorphism.The mean age of&#xD;
      eruption of mandibular canines is 10.87 years, and they are the last teeth to be extracted&#xD;
      with respect to age; so, they can be considered as the key teeth for personal identification&#xD;
      (Khangura et al.,2011; Padmavati et al.,2011; Yuwanati et al.,2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of the mandibular ramus tend to show higher sexual dimorphism, and variations&#xD;
      between the sexes are mostly more marked in the mandibular ramus than in the mandibular body&#xD;
      (Humphrey et al.,1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonial angle is commonly used to determine the rotation of the mandible and to identify&#xD;
      growth pattern, it is a common parameter used to describe orthodontic extractions or surgical&#xD;
      treatments(Kitai et al.,2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies focused on the comparison between CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) and&#xD;
      OPG (Orthopantomograph) for visualization of bone and teeth (Dalessandri et al.,2012 ;Savoldi&#xD;
      et al.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPG is a very popular technique ,the most available and commonly used extra-oral radiography,&#xD;
      its lower cost ,wide area coverage ,ease of preparation have made it an excellent choice for&#xD;
      routine examination of many structures thus useful for research purpose does not involve the&#xD;
      patient any additional exposure or cost(Ghosh et al.,2009 ;Sairam et al.,2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBCT imaging device can obtain undistorted three-dimensional (3D) images of good quality&#xD;
      with a low radiation dose (Yamamoto et al.,2003).&#xD;
