  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients after stroke with upper limb spasticity treated with botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) will&#xD;
      be included in this two-part study. In the first part, goal attainment scaling and&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of motor functioning will be performed before BTX-A application and&#xD;
      after two weeks. In the second part, the patients will be randomised into a test group&#xD;
      performing prescribed regular exercise for two weeks and a control group exercising at their&#xD;
      own discretion during the same period, whereby the patients' health-related quality of life&#xD;
      will be assessed at the beginning and end of the two-week period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goal setting will be performed by the patient together with the physician according to the&#xD;
      SMART principle (specific, measureable, achievable, realistic, time bound). The goals will be&#xD;
      classified according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and&#xD;
      Health. Goal attainment will be assessed using the Goal Attainment Scale - Light.&#xD;
      Comprehensive assessment of motor functioning will address range of motion, spasticity, pain,&#xD;
      degree of motor disability and degree of dependence in daily activities. The prescribed&#xD;
      exercises for the test group will be passive or active, depending on spasticity of the&#xD;
      impaired upper limb. Both groups will keep an Exercise Diary during the second part of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
