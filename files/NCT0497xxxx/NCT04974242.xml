  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POWER is a pragmatic multi-centre, external pilot randomised controlled trial with&#xD;
      feasibility objectives using a parallel group design with 1:1 allocation ratio and integrated&#xD;
      qualitative study. The study aims to answer the question: In adult patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      tears of the rotator cuff and awaiting elective surgical repair, is it feasible to conduct a&#xD;
      future, fully powered, multi-site RCT to test the hypothesis that physiotherapist-led&#xD;
      exercise is superior to waiting-list control in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness?&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tears of the shoulder rotator cuff tendons are a common cause of shoulder pain, disability,&#xD;
      and absence from work. Once a decision to undergo rotator cuff repair surgery has been made,&#xD;
      patients are placed on a waiting list, and it can take weeks or months to receive the&#xD;
      surgery. While waiting for surgery, many patients continue to experience significant pain and&#xD;
      disability, and some will be unable to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment could be delivered to patients while on the waiting list with potential to&#xD;
      reduce pain and disability, and also potentially reduce the need for surgery, there would be&#xD;
      clear and significant patient benefit and also benefit to the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the investigators will aim to find if it is possible to carry out a&#xD;
      larger study to determine if a programme of physiotherapist-led exercise for patients&#xD;
      awaiting surgery to repair torn shoulder rotator cuff tendons is clinically and&#xD;
      cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with 4 NHS hospitals, the investigators will recruit 76 patients waiting for rotator&#xD;
      cuff repair surgery. One group of patients will receive a programme of specific exercise,&#xD;
      supported by a physiotherapist. The second group will just continue waiting for surgery&#xD;
      without additional treatment, which is current standard care. The programme of specific&#xD;
      exercise can be supported over the telephone, via secure video platform, or face-to-face. the&#xD;
      investigators will monitor patients through the study by asking participants to complete one&#xD;
      questionnaire at the start and then three more electronic questionnaires after 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will invite approximately 25 patients to take part in an interview to&#xD;
      discuss experience of the treatments and the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research.&#xD;

    <measure>Health related quality of life assessed using the EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health related quality of life that can be used for the purpose of clinical and health economic evaluation. The EQ-5D-5L consists of questions relating to five health domains and respondents rate their degree of impairment using five response levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. A total of 3125 possible health states can be defined in this way which can then be converted in to a single index value between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
