      Aim of the present study was to determine the intraradicular microbiota of previously root&#xD;
      canal-treated teeth with apical periodontitis using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (ddPCR) and to investigate the antibacterial effectiveness of different intracanal&#xD;
      medicaments [Ca(OH)2 and CHX] that will make classical chemomechanical preparation more&#xD;
      effective. This superiority, parallel, randomized clinical trial was conducted in the clinic&#xD;
      of the Endodontic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul.&#xD;
      Sixteen patients with posttreatment apical periodontitis (one tooth each) were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups according to the intracanal medicament used (n=8, for each):&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide (CH) and 2% chlorhexidine gel (CHX) group. Total bacterial loads, as well&#xD;
      as the amount of Enterococcus faecalis (E.faecalis) were determined before (S1) and after&#xD;
      (S2) chemomechanical preparation and finally, after intracanal medication (S3) by means of&#xD;
      ddPCR.&#xD;

      Eligibility criteria The study population consisted of 16 patients (6 women and 10 men, aged&#xD;
      19-63 years, mean age 34.43) presenting to the endodontic clinic at Istanbul Medipol&#xD;
      University Dental School, for nonsurgical endodontic retreatment of teeth with apical&#xD;
      periodontitis lesions. Sixteen previously root canal-treated teeth exhibiting clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic evidence of chronic apical periodontitis lesions were included in this study.&#xD;
      Radiographically, the diameter of the periapical radiolucency ranged from 2 to 7 mm. Teeth&#xD;
      with post-treatment apical periodontitis had endodontic therapy completed more than 2 years&#xD;
      earlier and required retreatment. Termini of the root canal fillings ranged from 0-4 mm short&#xD;
      of the radiographic apex, with no overfilling. The teeth had intact coronal restorations,&#xD;
      with no obvious exposure of the root-filling material to the oral cavity. Selected teeth had&#xD;
      enough crown structure for adequate isolation with a rubber dam and showed an absence of&#xD;
      periodontal pockets or attachment level deeper than 4 mm. Exclusion criteria were also&#xD;
      applied, as follows: teeth from patients who had received antibiotics within the previous 3&#xD;
      months or who had any general disease, teeth that could not be properly isolated with rubber&#xD;
      dam, teeth with absence of coronary sealing, teeth with periodontal pocket depth &gt;4 mm; and&#xD;
      teeth with crown/root fracture. Only one tooth was included from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canal treatment procedures and sampling Rubber dam and an aseptic technique were used&#xD;
      throughout the endodontic retreatment. After plaque removal and rubber dam isolation, the&#xD;
      operative field was cleaned with 3% hydrogen peroxide and disinfected with 2.5% NaOCl&#xD;
      solution. Then, all coronal restorations, posts and carious defects were removed and access&#xD;
      preparation was completed when the root canal filling was properly exposed. Afterwards, the&#xD;
      tooth (including the pulp chamber), clamp, and adjacent rubber dam were once again&#xD;
      disinfected with 2.5% NaOCl, followed by inactivation with 10% sodium thiosulfate in order to&#xD;
      avoid interference with bacteriological sampling. Sterility control samples (SR1) were taken&#xD;
      from the tooth surface with a sterile Omni Swab (Whatman FTA, Sigma-Aldrich) with an&#xD;
      ejectable head. Paper points were transferred to cryotubes containing phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline (PBS) solution stored at -20°C. In each case, a single root canal was sampled in order&#xD;
      to confine the microbial evaluation to a single ecological environment. In multirooted teeth,&#xD;
      the root with the periapical lesion was selected. If there were periapical lesions in all&#xD;
      roots, the wider canal was selected. Two of the canals included in this study were from&#xD;
      single-rooted teeth, 3 were buccal canals in maxillary premolars, 1 palatal canal in&#xD;
      maxillary molar, and 10 distal canals in mandibular molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Old root fillings were removed using Gates-Glidden drills (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and endodontic files without the use of chemical solvents. The working length&#xD;
      (WL) was established 1 mm short of the apical foramen with an apex locator (Raypex6; VDW&#xD;
      GmbH, Munich, Germany) and then periapical radiographs were taken to ensure that all filling&#xD;
      material was removed. Irrigation with sterile saline solution was performed in order to&#xD;
      remove any remaining materials and to moisten the canal prior to sample collection. Next, the&#xD;
      canal was left filled with saline, and a small hand instrument was placed at the WL and used&#xD;
      to gently file the canal walls. An initial microbiologic sample (S1) was taken from the root&#xD;
      canal with sterile paper points consecutively placed at the WL. Three sterile paper points&#xD;
      were inserted into the root canal for sampling. Each paper point was left in the canal for&#xD;
      about 1 minute. Both the paper points and the endodontic hand instument, without the handle,&#xD;
      were transferred to cryotubes containing 300 μL of PBS solution stored at -20°C. The samples&#xD;
      were transferred to genetic analysis laboratory for further analysis in cold chain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root canals were prepared by using the Revo S files and copious irrigation with 2.5% NaOCl.&#xD;
      The canals were apically enlarged to size 35 (AS35) at the working length. Between each&#xD;
      instrument change, the root canal was irrigated with 5 mL of 2.5% NaOCl solution. Hence, a&#xD;
      total of 30 mL of the irrigating solution was used. After instrumentation was completed, the&#xD;
      smear layer was removed with 17% EDTA, which was left in the canal for 3 minutes, followed by&#xD;
      2.5% NaOCl. The root canal was dried with sterile paper points and flushed with 2 mL of 10%&#xD;
      sodium thiosulfate for 1 min to inactivate the NaOCl solution. Next, a sample (S2) was taken&#xD;
      from the canals as described for S1. After preparation, the canal was medicated with either&#xD;
      the Ca(OH)2 or 2% chlorhexidine gel based on the study group. In the CH group, calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide powder (Calxyl; OCO Products, Dirnstein, Germany) was mixed with saline in a ratio&#xD;
      1:1 and the paste was inserted into the canal by using lentulo spirals (Malleifer-Dentsply).&#xD;
      In CHX group, chlorhexidine gel 2% (Gluco-Chex 2% gel, Cerkamed, Stalowa Wola, Polland) was&#xD;
      placed into the root canals of this group with an Ultradent Capillary Tip (Ultradent&#xD;
      products). All root canals of the 2 above groups were sealed with a 1-mm cotton pellet and at&#xD;
      least 3 mm layer of temporary filling material (Cavit G; 3M ESPE AG, Seefeld, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 7 days, the tooth was isolated, the temporary restoration removed, and disinfection&#xD;
      procedures of the operative field were performed following the same protocol used in the&#xD;
      first visit. A new control sample of the dental crown and dentin surrounding the pulp chamber&#xD;
      was obtained (SR2). The medication was removed with 5 mL of saline solution and by carefully&#xD;
      filing the canal with a master apical file. For the groups using Ca(OH)2, the calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide antimicrobial activity was neutralized with 0.5% citric acid for a period of 1&#xD;
      minute, which was then removed with 5 mL of saline solution. Thus, for the groups with CHX&#xD;
      gel, the medicament was neutralized with a mixture of 0.3% L-α-lecithin and 3% Tween 80&#xD;
      (Zamany A, Spangberg LS (2002) An effective method of inactivating chlorhexidine. Oral&#xD;
      Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology and Endodontics). Next, the root&#xD;
      canals were irrigated with 2 mL of saline solution. The post medicament sample (S3) was&#xD;
      obtained in the same way as the pre-medicament sample was collected and sent for the PCR&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final sampling procedure, smear layer was removed by irrigation with 5 mL17% EDTA&#xD;
      and then, a final rinse with 10 mL distilled water. Completion of the root canal treatment&#xD;
      proceeded with root filling using lateral condensation of gutta-percha. Access cavities were&#xD;
      restored with composite resin (Z250, 3M Corporation, Saint Paul, MN, USA), and a final&#xD;
      radiograph was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total bacterial loads, as well as the amount of Enterococcus faecalis were determined before&#xD;
      instrumentation, after instrumentation and use of the intracanal medicaments, by means of&#xD;
      ddPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA isolation and measurement of DNA concentration DNA was extracted using the QIAamp&#xD;
      DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Before&#xD;
      DNA isolation, samples (the tubes with paper points) were digested at 50-60°C BY vortexING&#xD;
      for 30s in every 10 min in order to ensure disaggregation of all bacteria into the PBS&#xD;
      solution. Afterwards, the paper points were aseptically removed from the suspension and, the&#xD;
      bacterial suspension was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 g. The pellet was then&#xD;
      resuspended in 180 µl buffer ATL supplied by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden,&#xD;
      Germany) and 20 µl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) was added. Samples were incubated for 3 h at 56°C.&#xD;
      Subsequently, total bacterial genomic DNA was isolated according to the protocol of the&#xD;
      QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. The final volume of DNA solution of each sample was 150 μL and was taken&#xD;
      into account during calculation. DNA concentration (absorbance at 260 nm) was determined with&#xD;
      a spectrophotometer (Promega Quantifluor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplification of 16S rRNA genes Primers for Universal and Enterococcus 16S rRNA genes were&#xD;
      designed in this study. After DNA extraction of samples with QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, 700-800 bp&#xD;
      of 16S rRNA sequences were amplified by using universal E8F forward primer&#xD;
      (5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') and universal E1115R reverse primer (5'-AGGGTTGCGCTCGTTG-3') 59.&#xD;
      The final volume of PCR reactions for each isolated bacterial strain was adjusted to 25 µl.&#xD;
      The amplification reactions of 16S rRNA genes were performed with the following conditions. 1&#xD;
      cycle of predenaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30&#xD;
      seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds which continue with a final extension step at 72°C for 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gel (containing ethidium&#xD;
      bromide) in Tris/BoratE/EDTA (TBE) buffer, with gels being analyzed under ultraviolet light&#xD;
      (at 140V for 20 minutes). Their images were visualized under ultraviolet illumination. In&#xD;
      addition, the control and optimization of primers to be used for ddPCR was also done in&#xD;
      conventional PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purification and Sequencing of the 16S rRNA Gene After the PCR reactions, the purification of&#xD;
      PCR products is done by hydrolyzing the excess primers and nucleotides with ExoSap-IT&#xD;
      (Thermo, PN: 78201.1.ML) containing Exonuclease I and Alkaline Phosphatase enzymes. 2 µl of&#xD;
      ExoSap-IT was mixed with 5 µl of PCR product for each sample. The ExoSap reaction is&#xD;
      performed at 37 °C for 15 minutes (enzyme activation) followed by 15 minutes (inactivation)&#xD;
      at 80 °C. Sequencing reactions were performed by using Bigdye™ Terminator v3.1 cycle&#xD;
      sequencing kit (Thermo). The reactions were performed according to the kit manual for all&#xD;
      isolated strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After purification of the products with Exosap, the sequence reaction was performed with&#xD;
      BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo) under the following conditions. After&#xD;
      the sequence PCR, BigDye products were purified by colon method. Zymo ZR DNA Sequencing&#xD;
      Clean-up Kit (Zymo Research, USA) was used for this process. All samples were purified in&#xD;
      accordance with the protocol given in the kit and executed on the 3130XL genetic analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed using primers designed&#xD;
      according to the 16S rRNA region specific to the total bacteria and Enterococcus faecalis&#xD;
      species, after sequencing, absolute quantitation from the bacterial species found in the&#xD;
      paper-point sample. Primer pairs were 16S-F-5'-AGGGAATCTTCSGCAATGGG-3' and&#xD;
      16S-R-5'-ACGCCCAATAAATCCGGACA-'3 for total bacteria and ENT-F-5'-CGCTTCTTTCCTCCCGAGT-3' and&#xD;
      ENT-R-5'-GCCATGCGGCATAAACTG-3' primer pairs for Enterococcus Faecalis. In the PCR reaction,&#xD;
      amplicons amplified with unmarked primer pairs were analyzed by labeling with Eva-Green dye.&#xD;
      For absolute quantitation of Enterococcus and total 16S rRNA, PCR was performed with two&#xD;
      primer pairs from the same sample. 20 µL of PCR mix containing 10 µL of 2X ddPCR EvaGreen&#xD;
      Supermix (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 1864034), 9 µL of nuclease-free water, 0.25 µL of both forward&#xD;
      and reverse primer and 2 ng of DNA from each sample Thermal cycling conditions were: 95◦C for&#xD;
      5 min, then 40 cycles of 95◦C for 30 s and 60◦C for 1 min and two final steps at 4◦C for 5&#xD;
      minutes and 90◦C for 5minutes with a 4◦C infinite hold. After PCR was completed, the sealed&#xD;
      plate was transferred into the plate holder of the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad, cat. no.&#xD;
      1864003).&#xD;
