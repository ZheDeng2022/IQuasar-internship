  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the energy density of snack foods affects&#xD;
      the amounts that preschool children serve themselves and then consume. We will serve snacks&#xD;
      that vary in energy density to preschool children in their childcare centers and measure the&#xD;
      amount they serve themselves and consume. The results will have implications for guidance&#xD;
      about the provision of snacks for preschool children and may help in identifying strategies&#xD;
      for the prevention of obesity in children.&#xD;
