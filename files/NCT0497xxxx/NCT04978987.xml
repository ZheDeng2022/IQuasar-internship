      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific mutation in phospholamban (the PLN R14del mutation), has its origin in the&#xD;
      northern parts of the Netherlands (Figure) and causes a severe lethal dilated and/or an&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. A large proportion of the population of Groningen (1:1000)&#xD;
      carries this mutation. Until now, there is no specific treatment available for patients with&#xD;
      PLN cardiomyopathy. Patients are treated like any other type of heart failure patients,&#xD;
      although PLN cardiomyopathy has a different etiology from &quot;usual&quot; heart failure. Treatment is&#xD;
      therefore insufficient; malignant ventricular arrhythmias and end-stage heart failure at a&#xD;
      young age are very prevalent. To develop treatment options, the investigators aim to study&#xD;
      the following knowledge gaps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathophysiology. The clinical phenotype of PLN R14del cardiomyopathy bears&#xD;
           characteristics of both arrhythmogenic and dilated cardiomyopathy (ACM and DCM). Using&#xD;
           an &quot;omics&quot; approach of plasma, cardiac and skeletal muscle of patients and controls, the&#xD;
           investigators aim to reveal distinct pathways affected by the mutant PLN, unique to the&#xD;
           PLN R14del cardiomyopathy. This will be related to clinical data and mutant PLN&#xD;
           expression levels in both cardiac and skeletal muscle biopsies. Using this extensive&#xD;
           profiling, the investigators aim to identify disease mechanisms and provide the context&#xD;
           for future risk stratification and disease progression monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Penetrance. Subjects with a heterozygous PLN R14del mutation show a wide variety in&#xD;
           phenotype. Within the same family, patients can present either with over heart failure&#xD;
           in their 20's or completely asymptomatic until at least their 70's. So far, no modifiers&#xD;
           have been identified. The investigators will study cardiomyocytes derived from induced&#xD;
           pluripotent stem cells from patients who are severely affected versus family members who&#xD;
           are unaffected but carry the mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment response. The investigators have identified potential treatments, and&#xD;
           confirmed their efficacy in in vivo models of PLN cardiomyopathy. To establish their&#xD;
           efficacy in a human setting, the investigators will generate 3D cardiac tissues of&#xD;
           cardiomyocytes gathered from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients affected in&#xD;
           varying degrees and subject these tissues to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the above purposes, the investigators will collect and analyze the following&#xD;
      data/materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum and plasma of 90 PLN R14del carriers: 30 unaffected, 30 early affected and 30 end&#xD;
           stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy of 20 PLN R14del carriers: 10 unaffected, 10 end stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac muscle biopsy (obtained during left ventricular assist device [LVAD]/ heart&#xD;
           transplant [HTx] surgery) of 30 patients: 10 R14del, 10 arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
           10 dilating cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skeletal muscle biopsy of 10 patients: 5 R14del, 5 non R14del family members&#xD;

        The population consists of patients with PLN R14del, end-stage ACM or DCM, and non-R14del&#xD;
        family members of the PLN r14del patients. For this study, we will include 90 PLN R14del&#xD;
        carriers, subdivided in 30 end-stage R14del patients, 30 early abnormal and 30 unaffected&#xD;
        family members with the PLN R14del mutation and 10 ACM, 10 DCM and 10 PLN R14del&#xD;
        cardiomyopathy patients undergoing LVAD or HTx surgery. Finally, we will recruit a total of&#xD;
        5 PLN R14del cardiomyopathy patients and 5 unaffected (non-R14del) family members for the&#xD;
        skeletal muscle biopsy collection alone.&#xD;
