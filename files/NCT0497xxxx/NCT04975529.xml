  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Game on Philly is a multi-component out-of-school time intervention delivered by trained&#xD;
      sport-based youth development coaches and health navigators using evidenced-based&#xD;
      programming. The program evaluation assesses the impact of this minimal-risk intervention to&#xD;
      reduce the prevalence of obesity-related health disparities in racial and ethnic minority&#xD;
      middle school youth. The program is a virtual sport-based youth development program,&#xD;
      supplemented with nutrition education. The program was modified due to Covid-19 and is&#xD;
      entirely virtual. Using a quasi-experimental design, six schools are assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention arm and six schools are assigned to the comparison arm. Participants in&#xD;
      intervention schools receive access to daily, online after school programming, with live&#xD;
      sessions with sports providers (via Zoom), weekly team meetings with a health coach (via&#xD;
      Zoom), text-messages via the Remind app, and the monthly delivery of Activity Kits directly&#xD;
      to their homes for six months. Comparison school participants receive access to the Game on&#xD;
      Philly app with workout and sports content and receive one activity kit delivery at the start&#xD;
      of the program. Parent-child dyads recruited from each school complete surveys at baseline&#xD;
      and at the end of the 6-month program (follow-up). It is hypothesized that youth&#xD;
      participating in the intervention will experience significantly greater increases in physical&#xD;
      activity at the end of the 6-month intervention compared to youth participating in the&#xD;
      comparison arm (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes will examine changes in dietary intake,&#xD;
      self-efficacy for physical activity and positive youth development.&#xD;
