    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that switching from the current standard of care twice daily Adoport&#xD;
      (Tacrolimus) to once daily Envarsus (tacrolimus) in patients who have impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance post-transplant will lead to an improvement in their glucose tolerance, and may&#xD;
      reduce the subsequent incidence of PTDM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is widely held to be the optimal form of renal replacement therapy for&#xD;
      patients with end-stage renal disease, leading to a longer survival and improved quality of&#xD;
      life in patients receiving a renal transplant compared to those that remain on dialysis.&#xD;
      However renal transplantation brings with it a new set of challenges for the clinician. One&#xD;
      of the most important of these is post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The prevalence of&#xD;
      PTDM has increased over time and may occur in up to a third of all post-transplant patients&#xD;
      making it a critical challenge for transplant physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTDM represents a significant risk factor to both patient and graft survival, with some&#xD;
      studies suggesting an increase of 60% in graft failure and an almost 90% increase in&#xD;
      mortality. This morbidity and mortality is due to the greatly increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease associated with PTDM. In addition to the clinical consequences of PTDM&#xD;
      for patients, there is also a huge economic impact on healthcare, with a diagnosis of PTDM&#xD;
      doubling the cost of healthcare for a transplant patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important risks factors for PTDM include: Black/Asian race, male sex, older patients, receipt&#xD;
      of a 'Donation after cardiac death' kidney, family history of diabetes, BP, raised body-mass&#xD;
      index, Hepatitis C disease, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viraemia, hyperparathyroidism, low HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol, and hypomagnesaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, PTDM is caused by multiple factors associated with renal transplantation.&#xD;
      Steroid use impairs pancreatic beta-cell function, induces gluconeogenesis and glycolysis,&#xD;
      inhibits glycogenesis and leads to insulin resistance. Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor&#xD;
      (CNI), has been associated with increased rates of PTDM when compared to other CNIs (i.e.&#xD;
      cyclosporine). It leads to hyperglycaemia via reduction of pancreatic insulin secretion and a&#xD;
      reduction of GLUT-4 mediated glucose uptake into cells. In addition, it may directly cause&#xD;
      beta cell toxicity and down regulate insulin gene expression. High tacrolimus concentrations&#xD;
      have been associated with the development of PTDM; however, due to its enhanced efficacy in&#xD;
      prevention of acute and chronic rejection, it has become the most widely used&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication in renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 30% of patients post renal transplant have evidence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).&#xD;
      IGT is a key step in the development of PTDM and an opportunity for intervention to prevent&#xD;
      the development of PTDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher peak tacrolimus levels have been associated with islet cell damage leading to&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia, with evidence that this damage may be reversible with changing tacrolimus&#xD;
      exposure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all tacrolimus based regimens may have the same side effects. Envarsus is a newer&#xD;
      tacrolimus formulation, which has significantly altered pharmacokinetic properties and&#xD;
      bioavailability compared to other tacrolimus based regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Envarsus has significantly lower peak to trough ratios and a 30% lower peak concentration.&#xD;
      Both of these unique properties may reduce the beta cell toxicity seen with older tacrolimus&#xD;
      based regimens and lead to an improvement in impaired glucose tolerance.&#xD;
