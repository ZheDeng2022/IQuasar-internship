      This study was a prospective, randomized, comparative study that included female children&#xD;
      with rectovestibular fistulae who were selected from patients with anorectal malformations&#xD;
      treated at the pediatric surgical unit, Assiut University Hospital during the period from&#xD;
      January 2016 to February 2020. The patients were randomly divided into four groups according&#xD;
      to the procedure performed: trans- sphincter anorectoplasty(TSARP), posterior sagittal&#xD;
      anorectoplasty, classic anterior sagittal anorectoplasty (ASARP), and modified ASARP.&#xD;

      Background: The management of a vestibular fistula is a challenge for pediatric surgeons. The&#xD;
      investigator compared four different operative techniques in terms of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, continence, and cosmetic appearance. Patients and methods: This study was a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, comparative study that included female children with rectovestibular&#xD;
      fistulae who were selected from patients with anorectal malformations treated at the&#xD;
      pediatric surgical unit, Assiut University Hospital during the period from January 2016 to&#xD;
      February 2020. The patients were randomly divided into four groups according to the procedure&#xD;
      performed: trans- sphincter anorectoplasty(TSARP), posterior sagittal anorectoplasty, classic&#xD;
      anterior sagittal anorectoplasty (ASARP), and modified ASARP.&#xD;

The anorectal function was measured according to age of continence; younger children who had not attained the age of continence (&lt;3.5 years) had the anocutaneous reflex and anal squeeze on rectal digital examination determined; children older than three and half years had fecal continence rated according to the Templeton score&#xD;

        This study was a randomized, comparative trial involving female children suffering from&#xD;
        vestibular fistula taken from among patients with anorectal malformations treated at the&#xD;
        pediatric surgical unit, Assiut University Hospital from January 2016 to February 2020. The&#xD;
        patients were randomly separated into four groups according to the procedure performed. The&#xD;
        different procedures included were TSARP, PSARP, classic ASARP, and modified ASARP.&#xD;
        Randomization did by copies the names of the techniques on four separate papers and then&#xD;
        the surgeon was blindly chose one paper for each patient. Four pediatric surgeons had&#xD;
        experience in ARMs techniques were performed the repair.&#xD;
