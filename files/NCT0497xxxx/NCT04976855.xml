      The primary objectives for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part I and Part II: Assess safety and tolerability of repeated doses of INDV-2000 in&#xD;
           healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part III: Assess the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of INDV-2000 administered&#xD;
           alone and with SUBOXONE sublingual (SL) film in an opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment&#xD;
           seeking population.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple ascending dose study for 7&#xD;
      days of dosing with INDV-2000 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple ascending dose study for 28&#xD;
      days of dosing with INDV-2000 in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: This part is an open-label study in OUD treatment seeking individuals.&#xD;
