  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommended treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), is&#xD;
      effective. However, its long, multi-component nature makes it challenging to implement in&#xD;
      ordinary primary care, where most people are treated. An important component of CBT-I is&#xD;
      sleep restriction therapy, which may be comparatively easy to carry out in routine primary&#xD;
      care. This project tests whether a brief nurse-led group intervention in primary care based&#xD;
      on sleep restriction therapy for insomnia reduces insomnia severity and is cost-effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Insomnia is typically treated in primary health care. The most common treatment&#xD;
      is hypnotic drugs, despite their limited and short-term effects, the risk for adverse side&#xD;
      effects and dependence, and the fact that CBT-I is the recommended first-line treatment.&#xD;
      Reasons may include lack of knowledge about insomnia, a culture of prescribing hypnotics,&#xD;
      lack of time during consultations, and a shortage of CBT-I providers. Sleep restriction&#xD;
      therapy is one of the core components of CBT-I. It is a behavioral technique that may be&#xD;
      feasible to deliver in routine care with existing resources and time constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate whether brief, behavioral&#xD;
      group therapy in primary care based on sleep restriction therapy reduces insomnia severity&#xD;
      and is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Health care professionals from participating primary health care centers will&#xD;
      complete a 1.5-day digital course on assessing patients for insomnia and delivering the&#xD;
      intervention. Patients who seek primary health care and meet the study criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to sleep restriction therapy or to receive written sleep hygiene information. Both&#xD;
      groups will be free to seek and receive standard care for insomnia. Sociodemographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics will be collected prior to baseline. Study outcomes include insomnia&#xD;
      severity, sleep, daytime symptoms, quality of life, use of hypnotics, sick leave, and work&#xD;
      ability. Outcomes will be assessed over a 24-month period. The cost-effectiveness analysis&#xD;
      will include the number of insomnia-free days at the 12-month follow-up and quality-adjusted&#xD;
      life years.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Study staff entering data will be blinded to the condition. The researchers will provide some supervision to the health care professional who deliver the treatment. The researchers will therefore know the identities of the health care professionals they supervise. However, outcome data will be pseudonymized, so researchers will be blinded during outcome assessment. It is not possible to blind the health care professionals delivering the treatment or patients receiving it.</masking_description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a generic measure of health status that measures quality of life in five health domains: mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain/suffering, and anxiety/depression. The response scale for each domain ranges from no problems (0) to severe problems (3). EQ-5D also includes a visual scale for each theme and for overall health status. Together, the responses form 248 different health profiles, each of which is assigned a point value that makes it possible to compare results.</description>

Respondents place a vertical mark at the point on the line that corresponds to degree that they disagree or agree with the statement. The distance (mm) from the left end of the line to the vertical mark is measured and used as the score. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate stronger agreement with the statement.</description>
