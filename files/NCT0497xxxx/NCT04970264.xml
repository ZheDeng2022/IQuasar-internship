  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open and observational real world study. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to map the genomic variation map of young breast cancer patients in China, and to&#xD;
      analyze the relationship between gene mutation and therapeutic effect of young breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. The secondary purpose was to analyze the relationship between gene mutation and&#xD;
      prognosis of young breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to enroll 2000 young breast cancer patients (≤35 years old). All patients were&#xD;
      detected by targeted next generation sequencing （NGS）(600+ gene panel). Clinical diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment and prognosis information were collected. The Stratification factors mainly include&#xD;
      stage, molecular type and treatment method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study can only be formally carried out with the written approval of the ethics committee.&#xD;
      We regularly submit annual research reports to the ethics committee. We will inform the&#xD;
      ethics committee in writing when the study is discontinued and / or completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were required to sign informed consent before entering the group. All updated&#xD;
      versions of informed consent and written information will be provided to the subjects during&#xD;
      the participant's participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental design stage, the statistical principle was used to make reasonable and&#xD;
      effective arrangements for the relevant factors. Employ statistical experts to calculate the&#xD;
      sample size and data statistics, and participate in the design process. Data collection and&#xD;
      follow-up were conducted by specially assigned personnel, professional doctors were assigned&#xD;
      to conduct data review regularly, and special data management personnel were provided. They&#xD;
      will ensure the authenticity, reliability and security of data throughout the process.&#xD;

        We expect to enroll 2000 young breast cancer patients (18-35 years old). All patients were&#xD;
        detected by targeted next generation sequencing （NGS）(600+ gene panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subgroups were stratified according to different stages, treatment methods and pathological&#xD;
        types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The gene mutation characteristics, treatment sensitive genes and prognosis gene spectrum of&#xD;
        different groups and subgroups were studied.&#xD;
