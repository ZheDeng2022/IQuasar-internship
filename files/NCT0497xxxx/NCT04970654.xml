  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 medicines for children who do not have enough hormone to grow:&#xD;
      somapacitan given once a week (a new medicine) and Norditropin® given once a day (the&#xD;
      medicine doctors can already prescribe). Researchers will test to see how well somapacitan&#xD;
      works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also test if somapacitan is safe. Participants will either get somapacitan or&#xD;
      Norditropin® - which treatment participants get, is decided by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a 52 week treatment period and a minimum of 30 days follow up period.&#xD;
