  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-controlled,&#xD;
      comparator controlled, multi-dose, parallel-group study divided into three treatment periods&#xD;
      and a follow-up period with five treatment groups. This study will be conducted at 1 clinical&#xD;
      research unit (CRU) in the United States (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1 will consist of daily escalating doses of tyramine administered until tyramine&#xD;
      pressor response (defined as the tyramine dose required to increase systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      by at least 30 mm Hg from the daily defined baseline in 3 consecutive measurements within 4&#xD;
      hours after tyramine dosing) is achieved or Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who achieve tyramine pressor response at tyramine doses &gt;/= 200mg and &lt;/= 700mg&#xD;
      are eligible for continuation into Period 2 and will be randomized accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the group to which a participant is randomized, participants will receive&#xD;
      rasagiline, phenelzine, ozanimod (therapeutic dose), ozanimod (supra-therapeutic dose), or&#xD;
      placebo in Period 2. The duration of dosing depends on the group to which a participant is&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 3, all participants will undergo a sham tyramine challenge and receive a single&#xD;
      dose of tyramine placebo. Participants who do not achieve tyramine pressor response following&#xD;
      the sham challenge will continue with the tyramine challenge (ie, tyramine pressor tests) for&#xD;
      up to 12 additional days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who receive at least one dose of study drug in Period 2 will participate in a&#xD;
      follow-up phase during which 2 follow-up telephone calls will be performed, the last of which&#xD;
      will occur approximately 80 to 100 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Be postmenopausal (defined as 2 years after the last period and&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone &gt; 40 IU/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have received surgical sterilization (eg, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;

                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Has a body weight of at least 110 pounds (50 kg); body mass index within the range of&#xD;
             18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is in good health, as determined by no clinically significant findings from medical or&#xD;
             surgical history, 12-lead ECG, PE, clinical laboratory safety tests, and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 to 139 mm Hg, a diastolic blood&#xD;

             Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a participant from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. an unstable SBP (ie, SBP exceeds a maximum range of 15 mm Hg between the lowest and&#xD;
             highest values in three consecutive measurements within 15 minutes during Screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. the presence or history of any clinically relevant abnormality, condition, or disease&#xD;
             (such as glaucoma, liver disease or abnormal liver function tests, cardiovascular or&#xD;
             pulmonary diseases) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may affect absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, or elimination of the IPs, that would prevent the&#xD;
             participant from participating in the study, or which places the participant at&#xD;
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
