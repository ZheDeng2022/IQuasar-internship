    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in Chinese solid tumor&#xD;
      patients with taxanes-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. Duloxetine will be given to&#xD;
      patients who have grade 1 or higher sensory neuropathy according to the NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 and at least 4 on a scale of 0 to&#xD;
      10 points, representing average chemotherapy-induced pain, after taxanes treatment.&#xD;
      Patient-reported pain severity, functional interference, emotion condition and quality of&#xD;
      Life will be assessed weekly using corresponding scales. Blood samples will be collected from&#xD;
      each enrolled subjects before the start of treatment, and the potential biomarkers in&#xD;
      predicting duloxetine efficacy or safety will be explored by genomic profiling.&#xD;

    <description>Scale 1 title: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) Description: Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.&#xD;
Scale 2 title: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Description: HDRS17 uses a 5-point scale of 0 to 4 for most items and a 3-point scale of 0 to 2 for a few items, and higher scores mean a worse symptom. The total scores less than 7 or 7 are indicative of the absence of depression or being normal, 8-16 consider mild depression, 17-23 suggest moderate depression and scores 24 or over are indicative of severe depression.</description>

    <description>Chemotherapy regimens consisting of taxanes will be used according to treatment specifications. Subjects require therapeutic intervention for painful peripheral neuropathy will receive duloxetine 20 mg (orally, once daily) as the starting dose for 1 cycle of 7 days; the current dose will be maintained for effective pain control (NRS ≤ 3 points) and increased by 20 mg at the next cycle assessment for ineffective pain control (NRS &gt; 3 points) up to a maximum dose of 60 mg (orally, once daily). Duloxetine administration will be maintained until the uncontrolled pain (under the condition of treatment with duloxetine at its maximum dose), intolerable toxicity, completed antineoplastic therapy or subject loss of visit, death, withdrawal of informed consent, or other conditions occur. The administration of duloxetine is up to a maximum of 12 weeks.</description>
