  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to assess the effectiveness of a new modality of prescribing&#xD;
      the intensity of physical exercise in cardiovascular rehabilitation programs according to&#xD;
      physiological criteria (heart rate variability measured every morning) in comparison to a&#xD;
      standard non-individualized program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In coronary artery disease patients, cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) reduces cardiac&#xD;
      mortality by 30% when compared to usual drug therapy without CR. Cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      (VO2peak) is the most powerful independent prognostic marker of longevity. An improvement in&#xD;
      VO2peak is also associated with better cognitive performance in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of CR varies between patients. About 25% of coronary disease patients do&#xD;
      not improve their VO2peak after taking part of a CR program. The risk of acute event for&#xD;
      those &quot;non-responder&quot; patients, (i.e. not increasing their VO2peak), is high with a mortality&#xD;
      rate three times higher compared to &quot;responder&quot; individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is playing an important role in exercise&#xD;
      training-induced physiological responses. Based on this, it has been proposed in healthy&#xD;
      subjects to prescribe each exercise session according to ANS parameters (via heart rate&#xD;
      variability, HRV). It has been suggested that high-intensity exercise when HRV parameters are&#xD;
      stable, results in better adaptations to training. Conversely, recovery sessions when HRV is&#xD;
      impaired seem necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 participants with stable coronary artery diseases, and taking part in a CR program will be&#xD;
      included in this study. All participants will have signed a written consent form before&#xD;
      taking part in the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 following study&#xD;
      arms: 1/ standard exercise training ; 2/ Heart Rate Variability-guided exercise training.&#xD;
