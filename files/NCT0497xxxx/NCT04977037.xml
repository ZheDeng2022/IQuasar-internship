      This study evaluates a remotely supervised, home-based therapeutic program to improve&#xD;
      upper-limb voluntary movement in adults with tetraplegia caused by incomplete spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (iSCI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) has been associated with serious reduction in functional&#xD;
      independence. Despite compelling evidence that treatment intensity has a profound effect on&#xD;
      motor recovery only a small fraction of SCI population are able to receive intensive&#xD;
      in-clinic treatment. Difficulty traveling to the clinic, poor adherence to assignments and&#xD;
      high cost are limiting factors. Currently, telerehabilitation programs are emerging as an&#xD;
      alternative effective method of delivery for rehabilitation services. The literature and our&#xD;
      preliminary findings support the model that augmentation of activity in spared corticospinal&#xD;
      tract (CST) axons is a critical mechanism of motor improvement, and furthermore that CST&#xD;
      activity can be increased by repetitive motor training and by electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex (M1). However, there is still lack of knowledge on safety, feasibility&#xD;
      and efficacy of remotely- supervised home-based therapy programs that incorporates&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation and high intensity repetitive arm exercises. To address these&#xD;
      questions, 36 adults (above 18 years) with cervical SCI will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups in a 2:1 ratio (active stimulation group, n=24 vs control group, n=12) and receive&#xD;
      daily treatment, 10 sessions, over 2-weeks. The anodal tDCS will be applied over primary&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) at an intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes and proceed with 60 minutes of&#xD;
      repetitive arm and hand training. Primary outcome measure is change in Graded and Redefined&#xD;
      Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP) from baseline to immediately&#xD;
      after treatment and 4-weeks follow-up. The session will be supervised in real-time via&#xD;
      videoconferencing.&#xD;
