  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP), is the most common cause of physical disability that begins in childhood&#xD;
      and lasts throughout life, affecting 1 in 500 newborns, with an estimated prevalence of 17&#xD;
      million worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social isolation, economic conditions, interruption of treatments, etc. may cause physical,&#xD;
      mental, behavioral and psychosocial changes in children with cerebral palsy. Discontinuing&#xD;
      regular physiotherapy can worsen functional skills and cause complications in children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy. Our aim in this study is to investigate the sustainability of the treatments&#xD;
      of children with cerebral palsy during the pandemic period, their physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      effects, and the relationship between their parents' fear of covid-19.&#xD;
