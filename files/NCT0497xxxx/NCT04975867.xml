  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will investigate important neurocognitive clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with acute severe carbon monoxide poisoning (ASCOP) randomized to receive either therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia or normothermia combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CO-poisoned patients are identified by medical history and carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) value&#xD;
      &gt;5% (&gt;10% in smokers). Patients presenting with acute CO poisoning will receive one HBO.&#xD;
      ASCOP is defined as mental status showing response to painful stimulus or unresponsiveness&#xD;
      requiring intubation for airway protection and ventilation support at the emerency&#xD;
      department, and persistence of depressed mental status despite the HBO. After HBO treatment,&#xD;
      eligible patients who provide consent will be randomly allocated to receive hypothermia, or&#xD;
      normothermia treatment administered in a open label fashion except for blinding of outcome&#xD;
      assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be administered at 1 month and 6 months after CO exposure. In addition,&#xD;
      we will examine the differences in serum markers and mortality between the hypothermia and&#xD;
      normothermia groups.&#xD;
