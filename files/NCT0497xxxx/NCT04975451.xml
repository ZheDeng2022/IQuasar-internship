    <textblock>
      DCb (docetaxel/carboplatin) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Triple-Negative Breast&#xD;
      Cancer have been recommended by NCCN guideline.Combination of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors is&#xD;
      expected to further improvePathologic Complete Response(PCR).This study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ADCb (Anlotinib/docetaxel/carboplatin) as Neoadjuvant Treatment in&#xD;
      Triple-Negative breast cancer. The endpoint of PCR is used as a surrogate marker for&#xD;
      survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of all invasive breast cancer,it is&#xD;
      a subtype lacking estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) amplification. The mainstay of treatment for TNBC is&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, despite its sensitivity to chemotherapy, TNBC is still&#xD;
      associated with a poor prognosis and a higher risk of visceral transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of neoadjuvant therapy include reducing the size of the tumor to suit breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery, avoiding axillary lymph node dissection, making inoperable tumors&#xD;
      operable, and obtaining an in vivo evaluation of the tumor's chemosensitivity.TNBC is usually&#xD;
      recommended for neoadjuvant therapy. Taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant regimens&#xD;
      have become a standard treatment for TNBC, and patients have been proved to have better&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) who achieve a pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Previous studies have shown that adding&#xD;
      carboplatin to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens significantly improved pCR rate in TNBC&#xD;
      patients.The use of immunotherapy, parp inhibitors, and anti-angiogenesis inhibitors can&#xD;
      improve PCR for triple-negative breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to see the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib plus docetaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin Neoadjuvant Treatment for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.&#xD;
