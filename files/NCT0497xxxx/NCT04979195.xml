  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Kuwait, the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases exceeds 5000 patients. Risk factors&#xD;
      of possible risk factors of confirmed COVID-19 infection that developed major organ&#xD;
      dysfunction are not yet identified among patients in Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19&#xD;
      positive patients, assess possible risk factors of confirmed COVID-19 infection who developed&#xD;
      major organ dysfunction, determine risk factors for renal dysfunction and their outcome and&#xD;
      assess the response of critically ill patients to different therapeutic modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, we will revise all medical records of hospitalized patients with&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, during the period between Feb till July 2020. A confirmed case&#xD;
      of Covid-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time&#xD;
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab&#xD;
      specimens.12 We will include only laboratory-confirmed cases in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will extract patients' data with special stress on socio-demographic data, associated&#xD;
      medical co-morbidities as diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic lung&#xD;
      disease, recent exposure history, clinical symptoms or signs of the upper and lower&#xD;
      respiratory system, and laboratory findings on admission. Radiologic assessments will be&#xD;
      included like chest radiography or computed tomography (CT), and all laboratory testing will&#xD;
      be performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will determine the presence of a radiologic abnormality on the basis of the documentation&#xD;
      or description in medical charts of infected patients; if imaging scans were available, they&#xD;
      were reviewed by attending physicians in respiratory medicine who will extract the data. If a&#xD;
      major disagreement between two reviewers happens it will be resolved by consultation with a&#xD;
      third reviewer. Laboratory assessments will include a complete blood count, blood chemical&#xD;
      analysis, coagulation testing, assessment of liver and renal function, and measures of&#xD;
      electrolytes, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase,&#xD;
      ferritin, D dimer, and troponin. The degree of severity of Covid-19 (severe vs. non-severe)&#xD;
      at the time of admission will be defined using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered into a computerized database SPSS program file and cross-checked. If the&#xD;
      core data are missing, requests for clarification will be sent to the coordinators, who&#xD;
      subsequently will contact the attending clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will report patients who are receiving antibiotics, antiviral (different regimens), those&#xD;
      who required oxygen therapy (invasive, non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation, (ECMO)), and those patients who received systemic steroid therapy. Moreover, the&#xD;
      duration of hospitalization will be reported. Also, patients who developed acute kidney&#xD;
      injury will be recorded and if they were dialyzed, all dialysis parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      including any associated complications. All mortality patients will be reported with special&#xD;
      stress on the cause of death.&#xD;

        649 COVID-19 positive patients were identified. Sixty-three were isolated at home and 586&#xD;
        cases needed hospital admission during the period between the 1st week of March till the&#xD;
        end of August 2020. Among the hospitalized cases, 258 needed ICU care while 328 were&#xD;
        managed in the COVID general wards. We compared patients with stable renal function (group&#xD;
        1, n=319) vs. those who developed AKI (group 2, n=267).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We collected the data from COVID-19 positive patients that were diagnosed in all government&#xD;
        hospitals in Kuwait. Clinical features, details of management, and both patient and renal&#xD;
        outcomes were recorded. We compiled patients' data from the electronic database of the&#xD;
        isolation hospitals where COVID -19 cases were managed. Approval for the study was obtained&#xD;
        from the ethical committee of the Kuwait Ministry of Health.&#xD;
