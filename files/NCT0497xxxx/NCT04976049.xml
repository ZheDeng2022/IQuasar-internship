  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to explore the variability distribution of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid&#xD;
      (ALA)associated with bone and soft tissue perfusion in infection patients, using 5-ALA&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging. In additional this study plans to evaluate the change in 5-ALA&#xD;
      distribution from pre to post debridement and to preliminarily determine whether an orally&#xD;
      administered dose of 20mg/kg 5-ALA can predict recurrent infection/treatment failure.&#xD;

      The focus of this study is to (1) Explore variability in distribution of 5-Aminolevulinic&#xD;
      Acid (ALA) in bone and soft tissue infection (2) Evaluate the change in 5-ALA distribution&#xD;
      from pre to post debridement (3) Preliminarily determine whether 5-ALA has the possibility&#xD;
      predict infection / treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection following trauma is one of the most prevalent and challenging complications faced&#xD;
      by orthopedic surgeons in both military and civilian populations, occurring after up to 60%&#xD;
      of open bone fractures. Several factors specific to this trauma place patients at high risk&#xD;
      for infectious complications, including: traumatized tissues, open contaminated fracture,&#xD;
      soft tissue coverage issues, catabolic state due to poly-trauma, prolonged hospitalization&#xD;
      with exposure to nosocomial bacteria, and presence of metallic implants8. Infection requires&#xD;
      one or more unplanned surgical procedures and leads to prolonged morbidity, loss of function,&#xD;
      and potential loss of limb1. Failed treatment for bone infection results in recurrent&#xD;
      infection, requiring repeat surgical procedures in approximately 30% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies are currently being conducted to evaluate the utility of first window Indocyanine&#xD;
      Green (ICG) to identify areas of deficient perfusion. This is based upon the concept&#xD;
      deficient perfusion prevents delivery of antibiotics and endogenous immune cells to&#xD;
      traumatized tissues. In the setting of established infection, poorly perfused bone can be a&#xD;
      nidus for biofilm formation creating resistance to antibiotics. However, in the context of&#xD;
      this work it is becoming increasingly clear that acute (rather than chronic) infections&#xD;
      display hyper vascularity with increased blood flow and neovascularization. Infection is&#xD;
      known to display the enhanced permeability and retention effect with increased vascular&#xD;
      permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no accepted intraoperative tools that can be used to make objective&#xD;
      decisions about which bone and tissue is infected and which is normal. Methods currently used&#xD;
      to guide debridement are quite rudimentary. Clinical judgement is based on the gross&#xD;
      appearance of soft tissue and bone, including color, turgor, and extent of soft tissue&#xD;
      stripping. A burr may be used to look for bleeding bone. More extensive debridement is&#xD;
      thought to minimize risk of index infection or reduce the rate of persistent infection;&#xD;
      however, this comes at the cost of increasingly complex reconstructive procedures to fill&#xD;
      bony defects. Clearly what is needed is a functional imaging system which can identify&#xD;
      infected tissues to guide surgeons in the amount of tissue to debride. In turn, this will&#xD;
      lead to fewer infections and a more effective treatment of surgical site infections (SSIs) at&#xD;
      the fracture site. Both scenarios will allow patients to return to duty or work sooner.&#xD;
