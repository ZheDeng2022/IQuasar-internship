  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, non-inferiority, crossover investigation comparing the Direct Wire&#xD;
      Pacing (DWP) versus standard method to measure Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) in subjects with&#xD;
      FFR indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects requiring on a clinical basis a pressure wire assessment of coronary artery&#xD;
      stenosis(es) will be eligible to take part in the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure wire-based Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) has become the reference standard index of&#xD;
      haemodynamic significance to guide revascularisation of intermediate coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FFR measurement determines the ratio of the maximum blood flow that can be achieved in a&#xD;
      diseased or narrowed coronary artery to the maximum blood flow in a normal coronary artery.&#xD;
      This ratio represents the potential decrease in distal coronary flow relative to coronary&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFR is easily measured during routine coronary angiography using a pressure wire to calculate&#xD;
      the ratio of coronary pressure distal to a stenosis or diseased segment to aortic pressure&#xD;
      under conditions of maximum myocardial hyperemia. An FFR of 1.0 is widely accepted as normal.&#xD;
      An FFR of less than 0.80 is generally considered to be associated with coronary ischemia and&#xD;
      widely accepted in favor of revascularization rather than conservative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard method of measuring FFR is to insert a pressure wire into the coronary&#xD;
      artery while the hyperaemic agent, usually adenosine, is delivered by intracoronary bolus or&#xD;
      continuous intravenous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of adenosine may cause bradycardia and thus cause patient vagal discomfort.&#xD;
      Direct Wire Pacing (DWP) can potentially overcome the drawbacks of the standard method when&#xD;
      measuring FFR. Indeed, DWP allows to transmit an electrical current from the external&#xD;
      pacemaker to the heart thanks to metallic FFR guidewire already used, and thus prevent&#xD;
      bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there are some absolute contraindications to the use of Adenosine such as 2nd or&#xD;
      3rd degree atrioventricular block, untreated sinus dysfunction or long QT syndrome ...DWP&#xD;
      could allow this highly recommended diagnostic tool (1A) to be used in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would therefore like to determine if the measurement of FFR by DWP would be non-inferior&#xD;
      to the standard method to obtain precise FFR values and maximize patient's comfort.&#xD;
