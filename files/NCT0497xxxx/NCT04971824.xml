  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research examines the effect of physiotherapy on treatment success by assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technologies. It is based on a treatment of infertility by physiotherapeutic intervention&#xD;
      after which the participants will undergo a treatment of assisted reproductive technologies&#xD;
      (in vitro fertilisation). The work hypothesis is that physiotherapeutic treatment of female&#xD;
      infertility improves the chances of conception by assisted reproductive technologies.&#xD;

      This is an intervention study which also shows how physiotherapists can improve cooperation&#xD;
      between two professionals (gynaecologists and physiotherapists). The study is based on&#xD;
      physiotherapeutic intervention which consist of three months of physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical therapy program consists of 10 individual therapeutic sessions. Every session&#xD;
      lasts 45 minutes, frequency of the first six sessions is once a week, frequency of the last&#xD;
      four sessions is once every two weeks. The duration for each participant is three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be examined by the physiotherapist during first and last therapy&#xD;
      session and they will be asked to fill questionnaires and to keep records of their exercises,&#xD;
      period and ovulation in their diaries. There will be three validated questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, which measures a health-related quality of life, also&#xD;
      the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory which measures state and trait anxiety and the last one is&#xD;
      the Female Sexual Function Index which measures sexual function in women. The participants&#xD;
      will be asked to do physiotherapeutic exercises as self-treatment every day according to a&#xD;
      handout they get at the first therapy session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from intervention group will be compared to control group in which we use&#xD;
      retrospective data (from year 2019) from Centre of Assisted Reproduction of General&#xD;
      University Hospital in Prague. We will compare the number of women treated by assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technologies but without physiotherapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sum up, in this study we compare the number of women who conceived following the assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technologies with and without physiotherapeutic intervention.&#xD;
