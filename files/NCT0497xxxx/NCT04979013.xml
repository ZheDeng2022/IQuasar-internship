  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center study designed to evaluate changes in short-term biomarkers of potential harm&#xD;
      (BoPH) in healthy adult cigarette smokers of two age groups (Group A: 24-34 years; Group B:&#xD;
      35-60 years) during 14 days of smoking abstinence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the smoking abstinence study is to discover and assess biomarkers that&#xD;
      respond rapidly to smoking abstinence and explore whether the smokers' age influences the&#xD;
      responsiveness of biomarkers to changes in smoking status. The study is a single-center,&#xD;
      parallel cohort, in which generally healthy adult male and female smokers participated.&#xD;
      Smokers of 10-30 cigarettes per day for at least 5 years prior to screening were recruited.&#xD;
      Plasma and urine (24h and spot urine) samples and other biological specimens will be&#xD;
      collected at the baseline and at specified timepoints during the course of the study. The&#xD;
      study will include two primary study cohorts, smokers ages 24-34 years and 35-60 years, to&#xD;
      determine whether age could be a confounder in the qualification of biomarkers. Starting on&#xD;
      Day -2, eligible smokers will be confined at the clinical site for 17 days. Biological&#xD;
      samples will be collected on Days -2 and -1 for baseline study endpoints. On Day 1, smokers&#xD;
      will be switched to smoking abstinence for 14 days. Samples will be collected for endpoint&#xD;
      analysis throughout the 14-day abstinence period.&#xD;
