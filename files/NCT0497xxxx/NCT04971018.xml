    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (ta-VNS) on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in systemic sclerosis&#xD;
      (SSc) patients.&#xD;

      Conduct of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry into the study: After informed consent, patients will be randomised into two arms&#xD;
      (active or sham stimulation). The person responsible for setting the stimulator will make the&#xD;
      randomization via an interactive web response system (IWRS). Only this person will have the&#xD;
      knowledge of the group allocated to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start of ta-VNS sessions according to the 1st modality of stimulation : The patient will&#xD;
      perform 2 stimulation sessions per day at home for 3 months. During this period a clinical&#xD;
      research associate will contact the patient to verify that he does not encounter any problems&#xD;
      with the stimulator. An evaluation visit will be carried out at the end of these three months&#xD;
      by a blind physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wash-out period during 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start of ta-VNS sessions according to the 2nd modality of stimulation : The patient will&#xD;
      perform 2 stimulation sessions per day at home for 3 months. An evaluation visit will be&#xD;
      conducted prior to the start of the sessions and another at the end of the sessions.&#xD;
