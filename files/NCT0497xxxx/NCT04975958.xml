      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of AN2025 and AN0025 in double or triple combination treatments with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced/metastatic tumors. This study consists of&#xD;
      three DLT Observation Periods I, II and III. Observations I and II are double combination&#xD;
      treatments, which will be conducted in parallel, whereas Observation III (the triple&#xD;
      combination treatment) will be initiated only after a thorough review of the safety data from&#xD;
      Observations I and II. In all three Observation Periods, a &quot;6 + 3 design&quot; will be utilized&#xD;
      for dose finding with dose escalation and de-escalation.&#xD;

    <description>During the DLT Observation I, patients will be treated with AN2025 and Atezolizumab until the patient experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdraws consent. The starting dose of AN2025 is 50 mg. If tolerated, then a subsequent cohort will escalate to 100 mg. A dose de-escalation cohort to 80 mg may occur if the 100 mg is not well tolerated. The dose of Atezolizumab will remain constant at 1200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) for each dose level of AN2025 and in each cohort. Atezolizumab is administered intravenously over 60 minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 minutes.</description>

The starting dose of AN0025 is 250 mg. If tolerated, then a subsequent cohort will escalate to 500 mg. If 250 mg AN0025 is not tolerated, de-escalate to 125 mg. The dose of Atezolizumab will remain constant at 1200 mg Q3W for each dose level of AN0025 and in each cohort. Atezolizumab is administered intravenously over 60 minutes.

    <description>The DLT Observation III will be started after safety data review by the investigators and the sponsor of the double combination treatments in Observations I and II. Patients enrolled in Observation III will start with the recommended dose of AN0025 from Observation II, 1200 mg Atezolizumab, and AN2025 will start from 50 mg QD. Patients will be treated with all three study drugs until the patient experiences disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdraws consent. The dose of Atezolizumab will be the same (i.e., 1200 mg Q3W) regardless of dose levels of AN2025 and cohorts. Atezolizumab is administered intravenously over 60 minutes every three weeks. If the first infusion is tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 minutes. The dose of AN0025 as determined in Observation II will remain constant for each dose level of AN2025 and each cohort, unless the investigators and the sponsor determine that the toxicity comes from the AN0025 + Atezolizumab combination.</description>

                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to&#xD;
                  Screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
                  of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment, is she&#xD;
                  considered not of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;

                  post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization: When the female study patient has had surgical bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;

                  assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the&#xD;

                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal contraception methods (e.g., oral, injected, implanted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment period and for&#xD;
             at least 5 months after the last dose of Atezolizumab.&#xD;
