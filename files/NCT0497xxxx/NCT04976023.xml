  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an IgE mediated chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airways&#xD;
      characterized by symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and nasal obstruction .&#xD;
      However, not only this disease is difficult to cure, but also its relapse rate is high,&#xD;
      therefore exerting a certain impact on their daily life, work and study. Nowadays, the main&#xD;
      treatment for allergic rhinitis is the use of western medicine, such as steroids and&#xD;
      antihistamines. However, many clinical studies have found that the curative effect of western&#xD;
      medicine is often not ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic rhinitis belongs to the category of &quot;Rhinitis&quot; in Chinese medicine. From the&#xD;
      perspective of Chinese medicine, this disease is resulted from the deficiency of Qi and Yang&#xD;
      Qi in the lungs, spleen and kidneys. Therefore, according to Chinese medicine theory,&#xD;
      tonifying lung and spleen qi is the treatment principle for AR patients. Among different&#xD;
      Chinese herbal formulae for AR, Yupingfeng san is commonly used for allergic diseases and in&#xD;
      AR patients, due to its warm nature and able to improve the functions of the lungs and&#xD;
      spleen. Yupingfeng san can improve symptoms and quality of life, as well as decrease the&#xD;
      levels of interleukin and IgE in AR patients. This study will use Yupingfeng Powder with&#xD;
      variation to evaluate its effectiveness and safety in treating AR. Hence, this study would be&#xD;
      able to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of Yupingfeng Powder with variation for&#xD;
      AR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rhinitis is broadly defined as inflammation of the nasal mucosa. It is a common disorder that&#xD;
      affects up to 40% of the population. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common type of&#xD;
      chronic rhinitis, affecting 10-20% of the population, and evidence suggests that the&#xD;
      prevalence of the disorder is increasing. AR is a very common clinical disease that can occur&#xD;
      at any age. Severe allergic rhinitis has been associated with significant impairments in&#xD;
      quality of life, sleep and work performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic rhinitis is a complex immune and inflammatory disease. Its pathogenesis has not yet&#xD;
      been fully known, and there is no clear way to cure. It is an IgE-mediated chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease of the upper airways characterized by symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea,&#xD;
      nasal itching, and nasal obstruction, and cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-10 play an essential&#xD;
      role in mediating allergic inflammation. Nowadays, the main treatment for allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      is the use of western medicine, such as steroids and antihistamines. However, many clinical&#xD;
      studies have found that the curative effect of western medicine is often not ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a well tolerated choice for AR patients seeking&#xD;
      complementary and alternative therapies to reduce AR symptoms. In recent years, studies have&#xD;
      found that Yupingfeng Powder not only has few side effects (feeling of abdominal distension&#xD;
      or increased in acne are reported), it can al so increase anti allergic ability and improve&#xD;
      body's resistance, thus showing the advantages of oral Chinese medicine in the treatment of&#xD;
      AR. Accordingly, CHM may influence the gastrointestinal system, including the intestinal&#xD;
      mucosa and gut microbiota, the latter of which is essential for health and closely linked to&#xD;
      diseases. A few systematic reviews and studies indicate that certain probiotics are&#xD;
      beneficial for patients with AR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, fifty-eight eligible subjects will be recruited from Paediatric out-patient&#xD;
      clinic and community, and randomly assigned to receive orally Yupingfeng Powder with&#xD;
      variation or placebo twice a day for 8 weeks, with follow-up for another 8 weeks after&#xD;
      stopping the treatment to observe the duration of efficacy and to explore the mechanism of&#xD;
      Yupingfeng Powder in treating AR with respect to the immune response and gut microbiota.&#xD;
