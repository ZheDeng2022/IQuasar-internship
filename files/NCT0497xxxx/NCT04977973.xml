  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body image concerns are pervasive and can impact multiple aspects of a person's life.&#xD;
      Individuals with negative body image tend to have negative thoughts and feelings about their&#xD;
      bodies, often resulting in unhealthy behaviours. Negative body image is also associated with&#xD;
      mental and physical health conditions. Thus, prevention efforts are crucial to alleviating&#xD;
      body image concerns in young adults as they are considered high-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      self-guided body image program on a mobile-based application for young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: The intervention group will improve significantly on measures of body image at&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up, as compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: The intervention group will reduce significantly on measures of&#xD;
      appearance-ideal internalization, media and peer pressures at post-intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up, as compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The intervention group will improve significantly on the measure of&#xD;
      self-compassion at post intervention and follow-up, as compared to the control group.&#xD;

      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will begin by reading the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) online. Once they&#xD;
      have indicated consent on the online Consent Form, participants will proceed to complete a&#xD;
      set of questionnaire on an online survey platform (Qualtrics) to obtain baseline ratings. The&#xD;
      online questionnaire consists of four measures on body image, body image risk factors and&#xD;
      self-compassion. Participants will also report demographic information such as gender and&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, participants will download the phone application and be guided to navigate the&#xD;
      application. The phone application for the programs in this study is provided by Intellect&#xD;
      Pte Ltd, a Singaporean technology start-up company that collaborates with the supervisor of&#xD;
      this project (OS). All participants will be randomized to one of two conditions- intervention&#xD;
      or active wait-list control-using simple randomisation procedures. Participants in the&#xD;
      intervention condition will participate in 9 days of body image program, while participants&#xD;
      in the active wait-list control condition will participate in 9 days of cooperation learning&#xD;
      program. In both programs, participants will engage in content learning and short activities&#xD;
      daily on the phone application. The anticipated time participants will spend on each programs&#xD;
      is comparable, of about less than five minutes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the same set of online questionnaires immediately&#xD;
      after completing the program (post-intervention measure), and four weeks after completing the&#xD;
      program (follow-up measure). The feedback questionnaire will be administered only&#xD;
      post-intervention. Participants will receive either course credit or a small monetary&#xD;
      reimbursement after completing the program and questionnaire at post-intervention and at the&#xD;
      four weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the six weeks data collection period, all participants will be debriefed about&#xD;
      the purpose of the study. Participants in the active wait-list control condition will be&#xD;
      given access to the body image program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body image measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Image Ideals Questionnaire (BIQ) is a 22-item scale that assesses body image&#xD;
      satisfaction-dissatisfaction by measuring the degree of congruence or discrepancy of one's&#xD;
      perceived and idealized physical attributes. On a scale from 0 (Exactly as I am) to 3 (Very&#xD;
      unlike me), participants rate the degree they resemble their physical ideal on 11 physical&#xD;
      attributes. Next, participants rate the importance that they attain their ideal on each&#xD;
      physical attribute. The cross-products of the discrepancy and importance ratings for each&#xD;
      physical attribute will be obtained and a composite BIQ score will be computed. Higher scores&#xD;
      indicate a greater disparity between one's perceived and ideal physical attributes,&#xD;
      suggesting higher levels of body dissatisfaction. BIQ has good internal consistency, with&#xD;
      Cronbach's α of 0.81 for males and 0.76 for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Appreciation Scale-2 (BAS-2) is a 10-item scale that assesses individuals' positive&#xD;
      attitudes toward their bodies. Items are scored on a scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always).&#xD;
      Scores on all items are averaged with higher scores indicating greater body appreciation.&#xD;
      BAS-2 has excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach's α of 0.96 for males and 0.97 for&#xD;
      females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire-4 Revised (SATAQ-4R) measures&#xD;
      internalization ideals and appearance-related sociocultural pressures. The seven subscales&#xD;
      consist of 31 items for females and 28 items for males on a scale from 1 (definitely&#xD;
      disagree) to 5 (Definitely agree). Higher scores on each subscale indicate higher levels of&#xD;
      internalisation and sociocultural pressures. The internal consistency of the subscales are&#xD;
      good, with Cronbach's α of 0.82 or higher in a sample of university females and Cronbach's α&#xD;
      of 0.75 or higher in a sample of university males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-compassion measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF) is a 12-item scale that measures self-compassion on&#xD;
      six subscales. Each item is scored from 1 (Almost never) to 5 (Almost always). A total&#xD;
      self-compassion score is a grand mean of all six subscale means, with higher scores&#xD;
      indicating higher levels of self-compassion. The internal consistency of the scale is&#xD;
      excellent, with Cronbach's α of 0.86.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      App Engagement Scale is a 7-item scale that measures participants' engagement on the phone&#xD;
      application form 1 (Definitely disagree) to 5 (Definitely agree). A total score is derived by&#xD;
      adding scores from each item. The internal reliability of the scale is good, with Cronbach's&#xD;
      α of 0.84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies that examined mobile and internet-based body image and eating disorder programs&#xD;
      reported intervention effects of small to moderate effect sizes. Using G*power, a small&#xD;
      effect size of Cohen's f = 0.1, and alpha = 0.05, an estimated sample size of 214&#xD;
      participants are required to achieve a power of at least 0.90. Taking into consideration a&#xD;
      potential attrition rate of 30% in app-based interventions, 280 participants are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS Version 26.0. All analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      using two-tailed test with a level of significance at p &lt; .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will first be visually inspected using scatterplots, histograms and boxplots to examine&#xD;
      the distribution of data and identify significant outliers. Data further than three standard&#xD;
      deviations from the mean will be identified as significant outliers. Further analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted with and without the outliers to determine if outliers influence the results&#xD;
      significantly. If outliers influence results significantly, they will be managed using the&#xD;
      Winsorizing method, where outliers will be replaced with the next closest non-outlying data&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will examine baseline differences between the two&#xD;
      conditions on all demographic and dependent variables. If no significant differences are&#xD;
      observed at baseline between the two conditions, two-way 2 (condition) X 3 (time) mixed&#xD;
      factorial repeated measures ANOVA will be conducted to determine if there are significant&#xD;
      changes over time in the intervention and active wait-list control conditions. Any&#xD;
      significant interaction terms (condition x time) will be examined using simple slope&#xD;
      analysis. Tests of statistical assumptions such as Mauchly's Test of Sphericity and Levene's&#xD;
      test for homogeneity of variances will be carried out before the main analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If significant differences are observed at baseline between the two conditions, Analysis of&#xD;
      Covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted, controlling for baseline values. Tests of statistical&#xD;
      assumption for ANCOVA such as independence between covariate and independent variable&#xD;
      (condition), and homogeneity of regression slopes will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both analyses, if participants in the intervention condition improved significantly on&#xD;
      the outcome measures at post-intervention and follow-up compared to participants in the&#xD;
      active wait-list control condition, it provides evidence that the intervention is effective&#xD;
      in improving body image and self-compassion in university students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intent-to-treat analysis will be carried out to address the loss of participants' data due to&#xD;
      attrition, by carrying forward the participants' last reported score. Analyses using one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA on demographic and dependent variables will be done to determine if there are any&#xD;
      significant differences between participants who dropped out and participants who did not.&#xD;
      Any significant differences detected can inform of attrition-related biases in the study.&#xD;
