    <textblock>
      Background and justification: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a disabling and life-threatening&#xD;
      condition that results from a partial or total bowel resection, and has become as the main&#xD;
      cause of Type III, intestinal failure (IF). Immediately after enterectomy there is an&#xD;
      adaptation process consisting of structural, hormonal and metabolic changes to maximize&#xD;
      intestinal function. These changes begin within days of resection and generally continue for&#xD;
      several months. However, recent publications have reported even longer periods of time (up to&#xD;
      5 years) to achieve enteral autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to enhance the natural process of intestinal adaptation through medical or&#xD;
      surgical treatments, called intestinal rehabilitation. During the process, complications&#xD;
      related to intestinal failure or its treatment may arise, jeopardizing the result and even&#xD;
      compromising survival. A better understanding of the medium and long-term results of patients&#xD;
      under medical and / or surgical treatment with SIC is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the improvement recently achieved in managing IF, in most countries, pts are&#xD;
      dispersed and seen by general health-care providers, with limited SBS or IF experience,&#xD;
      causing increasing concern regarding the competence and equity of the care accessible to&#xD;
      suffering pts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained with the RESTORE project in adult patients highlight the relevance of&#xD;
      having registries to better understand the natural history of this disease in adult patients,&#xD;
      proving that a larger number of adult pts with SBS/III-IF can be identified and cared for&#xD;
      than the numbers considered by recognized estimations. [Abstract sent to TTS, 2020].&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no data for pediatric patients with iIF secondary to SIC in Latin America,&#xD;
      so its incidence, prevalence and evolution are unknown. Recent publications from&#xD;
      middle-income countries, exposed the current inequality regarding the different types of&#xD;
      therapies available within a given region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with ICS-FI, there is an unmet need to&#xD;
      create an adequate study that provides the information necessary to establish local and&#xD;
      regional parameters and recommendations on its treatment.&#xD;

      RESTORE amedment 1project, obtained the study number DDI (1384) 1317 from the Institutional&#xD;
      Research and Ethics committee after its approving the choices of participating centers by&#xD;
      RESTORE's Scientific Steering Committee. For participation, those centers needed a full-time&#xD;
      or part-time surgeon-though not necessarily offing rehabilitation surgery or transplantation&#xD;
      or accessing enterohormone (EH) therapies-a therapist with nutritional experience, a&#xD;
      dietitian, and specialized pharmaceutical resources. Participating teams, however, did not&#xD;
      necessarily have to offer rehabilitation surgery or transplantation capabilities or have&#xD;
      access to EH therapies to be elected for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESTORE's aim was assessing the long-term outcomes of SBS pts with IF, under the current&#xD;
      standard of care in order to plumb IF's natural history, the indications for currently&#xD;
      available therapies, and their means of modifying each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Designed: the first prospective, observational, epidemiological, multicenter study in&#xD;
      Argentina of adult pts with SBS-caused type-III IF in Lat-America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, the inclusion of additional centers in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay&#xD;
      and Chile will be required. In pediatric patients, it is proposed to add patients and centers&#xD;
      in Argentina and, if necessary, in other Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Peru,&#xD;
      Chile and Uruguay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients and centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit at least 150 patients in 24 centers. The sample size is based on&#xD;
      the expected number of subjects who may be eligible and willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients of both sexes, diagnosed with Type III-IF due to SBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signature of informed consent and assent as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 8 or more consecutive weeks of PN need&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Less than 8 weeks of need for PN after diagnosis of SBS / IF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Refusal to provide informed consent and assent as appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FI type I and II, and type III without SBS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study will be entered into an electronic CRF and database; with visits&#xD;
      being reinitiated at weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 and then yearly thereafter. Pts that missed 2&#xD;
      or more visits were considered lost from follow-up. Death, recovery of intestinal&#xD;
      sufficiency, and intestinal transplant were considered the end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be summarized and evaluated using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
