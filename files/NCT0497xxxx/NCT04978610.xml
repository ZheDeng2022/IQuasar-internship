  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effectiveness of a 6-week long virtual Acceptance Commitment&#xD;
      group therapy as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to improving other functional outcomes for&#xD;
      adolescents with a chronic medical condition in comparison to no treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 40% of children and adolescents/young adults (AYAs) in the United States suffer&#xD;
      from at least one chronic medical condition, excluding obesity. The emotional and&#xD;
      psychological burden of having a chronic condition in youth can lead this population to&#xD;
      experience higher rates of stress, depression, and anxiety in addition to reduced&#xD;
      health-related quality of life compared to their healthy peers. Acceptance and Commitment&#xD;
      Therapy (ACT) is an intervention that teaches skills such as psychological flexibility,&#xD;
      mindfulness, and cognitive defusion that has been shown to significantly improve&#xD;
      psychological outcomes and quality of life among children and AYAs with chronic conditions.&#xD;
      Few studies, however, have examined the efficacy of this intervention in reducing stress&#xD;
      among children and AYAs with chronic conditions delivered in a group, web-based format. The&#xD;
      need for virtually administered psychological interventions is especially salient amidst the&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic as CDC guidelines discourage in-person gatherings and close contact with&#xD;
      others. The current study aims to: 1) Determine if a web-based group ACT intervention of 6&#xD;
      sessions is more effective than no intervention (waitlist control) in reducing stress among&#xD;
      children and AYAs with chronic conditions, 2) Determine if a web-based group ACT intervention&#xD;
      of 6 sessions is more effective than no intervention in improving other functional outcomes&#xD;
      among children and AYAs with chronic conditions, 3) Evaluate if a web-based group ACT&#xD;
      intervention of 6 sessions improves participants skills in psychological flexibility,&#xD;
      mindfulness, and cognitive defusion. Study population: Children and Adolescents/Young Adults&#xD;
      (ages 14-21) diagnosed with a chronic medical condition seeking care at Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Los Angeles, who are in the normal range of development and are eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Study Methodology: The study is a non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      designed to examine the effect of a web-based group ACT intervention on stress, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, health-related quality of life, and adaptive psychological skills in children and&#xD;
      AYAs with chronic conditions. Statistical analysis: The primary analysis will involve a two&#xD;
      independent samples t-test to compare the mean 6-week PSS scores between the two treatment&#xD;
      groups. Secondary analyses will compare treatment groups on other study outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After informed consent and assent have been obtained and the patient has successfully met the screening criteria, the patient will be enrolled. The study will commence upon the enrollment of approximately 20 participants, at which point participants will be randomized into the Virtual ACT or waitlist (control) group. The intervention group will begin vACT immediately, while the waitlist receive no intervention during the same 6-week time frame. Both groups will take the same baseline questionnaires and post-questionnaires (post, 1 month, and 3 month). After the vACT intervention group finishes, another 6-week vACT session will be offered to the waitlist. The waitlist group will fill out a post-therapy questionnaire again after their 6-weeks. The parents of both groups will fill out a baseline questionnaire and post questionnaires.&#xD;
The investigators will repeat this protocol until 144 participants or 72 caregiver-child dyads.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. SS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items and then summing across all scale items with higher scores correlating to more stress. There are ten items total with the minimum value set at 0 and maximum 40 with higher scores correlating to more perceived stress.</description>

    <description>Revised is an updated version of the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale depicting no pain as a neutral expression as compared with the smiling face of the original measure. The child is asked to point to the face cartoon that depicts how the patients are currently feeling because of their pain. Face measures are thought to measure pain intensity, and the Wong-Baker Faces measure has demonstrated good reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>Parent Rating Scales (PRS) will be used to asses the child's behaviors and emotions. Parents evaluate 173 items on a never, sometimes, often, almost always scale. This is scored using a computer software purchased through Pearson. The raw score is converted to a T-score based on age and gender. The T-score has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. T-scores above 65 are clinically significant in that domain.</description>

    <description>Upon the intervention group's completion of the 6-week long vACT, the control group will then enroll into their own 6-week long ACT intervention. The research protocol for the second 6-week long ACT intervention will mirror the protocol with the original 6-week long ACT intervention, except for one change: participants will NOT complete an additional baseline questionnaire prior to starting the 6-week ACT therapy group. The rest of the protocol remains the same. Namely, before each session, each participant will be required to fill out a short survey on their stress and pain throughout previous week. At the conclusion of the final session, participants will follow the complete post-intervention battery of surveys, which mirrors the baseline measures plus the inclusion of satisfaction surveys assessing the effectiveness of the virtual therapy intervention. Participants will complete the post-intervention follow up battery of questionnaires at 1 and 3 months post-intervention.</description>

    <description>For a period of 6 continuous weeks, participants will meet weekly in a virtual group ACT session with a licensed psychologist hosted on a secure, HIPAA compliant, Zoom account. Each session is 1.5 hours will focus on one ACT concept including Acceptance, Values, Mindfulness, Cognitive Defusion, Experiential Avoidance, and Willingness and Committed Action. Subjects will be given the opportunity to share their thoughts as well as their responses to the exercises at various points throughout the sessions.&#xD;
At the beginning of each session, each participant will be required to fill out a short survey on their stress and pain the preceding week. Participants in the control group will not complete weekly measures. All measures will be completed online via a REDCap survey web link. Follow up measures will mirror initial baseline measures in order to measure the within group and between group changes in study outcomes.</description>
