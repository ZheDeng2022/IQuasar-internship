      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018, the NIH intramural research program had almost 23,000 people taking part in active&#xD;
      clinical research studies. Half of those people were female. More than a third were of&#xD;
      child-bearing age. Researchers want to use data from this group to create a pregnancy&#xD;
      registry. It will be used to collect data about pregnancy and birth outcomes related to&#xD;
      unplanned exposure to research products. These products may include drugs, vaccines,&#xD;
      treatments, and interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data about pregnancies and births from people who took part in an NIH clinical&#xD;
      trial and their partners who became pregnant while in the study or shortly after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of any age and their partners who took part in an NIH clinical trial and became&#xD;
      pregnant while in the study or within 1 year after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by phone. Their clinical trial history will be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed in person, by phone, or virtually. They will be asked about&#xD;
      their health and their trial experience in relation to their pregnancy. They will give&#xD;
      details about their pregnancy and baby (if appliable). They will be interviewed every 6&#xD;
      months for 1 year after the birth of their baby, as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from both NIH and outside medical records will be used. Participants will give their&#xD;
      doctor s name and contact details. They will provide a release for their records to be used.&#xD;
      If needed, they will provide a release for their baby s records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be coded and stored in a database on an in-house NIH secure server. Data may be&#xD;
      used in future studies&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will serve as a pregnancy registry to collect prospective and retrospective&#xD;
      health information from current and former NIH intramural research participants, their&#xD;
      partners and offspring that became pregnant during or within 1 year after participating in an&#xD;
      NIH intramural clinical trials. The registry will provide supplemental data on outcomes of&#xD;
      clinical trial interventions on pregnancy and delivery of offspring as this information is&#xD;
      seldom available because pregnant women are often immediately excluded from study&#xD;
      participation upon becoming pregnant and data from women who became pregnant and their&#xD;
      offspring outcomes is not systematically or routinely collected and evaluated in the&#xD;
      intramural program at the NIH. Partners of women who became pregnant within 1 year following&#xD;
      research study participation in clinical trials will be invited to participate to evaluate if&#xD;
      participation in clinical trials extends to those in close contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect information about pregnancy and offspring outcomes from NIH intramural clinical&#xD;
      trial participants and/or partners of current and former NIH research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Male or female partners of women that participated in NIH intramural clinical trials that&#xD;
      became pregnant while they were on study or within 1 year after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female partners of NIH intramural clinical trials participants that became pregnant while&#xD;
      their partner was or within 1 year after their partner was on a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offspring from birth to 12 months of age and born to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Females that participated in NIH intramural clinical trials and became pregnant while on&#xD;
      study or within 1 year after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female partners of women that participated in NIH intramural clinical trials that&#xD;
      became pregnant while they were on study or within 1 year after.&#xD;
&#xD;
