  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasolabial flaps have limited mobility and may need two stages, mostly for intraoral defects&#xD;
      .The facial artery perforator-based flap is the first true perforator flap in the face. It&#xD;
      allows one-stage reconstruction and allows freedom in flap design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nasolabial perforator flap has certain advantages such as repair using a similar tissue,&#xD;
      a wider rotation arc around the pedicle compared to the other regional flaps, and the primary&#xD;
      closure of the donor area.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, perforator flaps have become popular in many areas of reconstructive surgery. They&#xD;
      provide design freedom and reduce donor-site morbidity. Many traditional local flaps&#xD;
      including nasolabial flaps are based on the use of the axial facial artery with multiple&#xD;
      perforators. Flaps based on one perforator of the facial artery have been introduced and are&#xD;
      used more frequently because of their advantages over perforator flaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent literatures, facial artery provides numerous cutaneous perforators, on&#xD;
      which skin flaps can be islanded, with greater mobility and liability for reconstruction of&#xD;
      small-to-moderate-sized intraoral and facial defects in one stage. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple perforators along the facial artery, a mean of 4 on each half of the face (range:&#xD;
      2-8), with a mean diameter of 0.94 mm (range: 0.53-1.36 mm) and maximum perforators between&#xD;
      20 and 60 mm from the origin along the length of the facial artery. This roughly corresponds&#xD;
      to an area near the angle of the mouth around the nasolabial fold. A local skin flap based on&#xD;
      such perforators can be islanded, with greater freedom in flap designing for reconstruction&#xD;
      of small-to-moderate-sized intraoral and facial defects in one stage Ethical consideration&#xD;
      This study will be approved by the ethics committee of Faculty of Medicine Sohag University.&#xD;
      A written informed consent will be taken from every patient that will be included in this&#xD;
      study and all patients will be informed about the nature &amp; the aim of the study and the&#xD;
      possibility of any complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tumor ablation the facial artery perforator along the nasolabial fold was found and&#xD;
      marked with a handheld Doppler probe. A perforator near the defect was selected to accomplish&#xD;
      a sufficient arc of rotation without tension. The flap was designed to cover the defect based&#xD;
      on one perforator and to hide the donor site in the nasolabial fold. An incision on one side&#xD;
      of the flap was made to the subcutaneous tissue. Undermining of the flap until the&#xD;
      perforators were identified. After the perforators were identified, the flap was redesigned&#xD;
      and an incision was made circumferentially. Dissection of the pedicle was performed until&#xD;
      tension-free transposition was done to cover the defect, and the distal perforators were&#xD;
      sacrificed to help flap movement. For protection against shear forces, the investigators left&#xD;
      a small cuff of subcutaneous fat around the perforator&#xD;
