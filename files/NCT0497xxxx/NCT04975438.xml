    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe AtD (confirmed by a dermatologist) according to the Hannifin and&#xD;
             Rajka criteria or Eichenfield revised criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of AtD symptoms occurring at least 6 months prior to Screening, with stable&#xD;
             disease for at least 1 month prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eczema Activity Severity Index greater than or equal to (&gt;=)16; Investigator Global&#xD;
             Assessment score &gt;=3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 1- Biologic Naïve: Topical First Line Treatment: Documented recent history&#xD;
             (within 6 months before Screening) of: a) either an inadequate response (IR) to&#xD;
             out-patient treatment with at least one topical treatment (intermittent topical&#xD;
             corticosteroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor), topical inhibitors or&#xD;
             Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (Crisaborole); b) or that topical treatments were&#xD;
             otherwise not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Group 2- Dupilumab-Inadequate Responder: Documented history of an IR to dupilumab: a)&#xD;
             either following at least 16 weeks of treatment according to the Investigator's&#xD;
             judgement; b) or intolerant to dupilumab owing to adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other than AtD, the presence of a significant skin morbidity that will influence the&#xD;
             Investigator's ability to assess the severity of the disease (e.g. psoriasis,&#xD;
             confirmed or suspected cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, autoimmune bullous disease, fixed&#xD;
             drug reaction and Stevens Johnson Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any uncontrolled medical conditions, other than AtD, that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator puts the participant at unacceptable risk or will likely&#xD;
             interfere with study assessments or data integrity. Other medical conditions should be&#xD;
             stable at the time of screening and be expected to remain stable for the duration of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with biologic agents (investigational and marketed monoclonal antibodies)&#xD;
             within 12 weeks or 5 pharmacokinetic half-lives (whichever is longer) prior dosing on&#xD;
             Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with Janus Activated Kinase inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib, upadacitinib)&#xD;
             within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to dosing on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, or calcineurin inhibitors within 4&#xD;
             weeks of Screening.&#xD;
