  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion of XTMAB-16 (formerly referred to as KBMAB-16) in normal healthy&#xD;
      male and female participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 normal healthy adult participants will be enrolled and assigned into 2&#xD;
      treatment cohorts with 12 participants (9 on XTMAB-16 and 3 on placebo) in each cohort.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single IV infusion of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg of XTMAB-16 or placebo&#xD;
      on Day 1.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is a healthy adult male or female aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, at&#xD;
             the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant weighs between 45 kg (99 lbs) and 100 kg (220 lbs) and has a body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant agrees to use highly effective method of contraception from the time&#xD;
             of signing consent throughout 90 days after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received any investigational compound within 90 days before&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any clinically significant illness, such as cardiovascular,&#xD;
             neurologic, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, urologic,&#xD;
             immunologic, endocrine, or psychiatric disease or disorder, or other abnormality,&#xD;
             which may affect the participant's safety, increase risk of seizure or lower the&#xD;
             seizure threshold, or potentially confound the study results. It is the responsibility&#xD;
             of the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of any conditions the&#xD;
             participant may have; however, consultation with the Xentria Medical Monitor may be&#xD;
             warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of&#xD;
             XTMAB-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a positive result for drugs of abuse (defined as any illicit drug&#xD;
             use) or alcohol at Screening or Baseline (Day -2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a&#xD;
             history of alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to Screening or is unwilling to agree to&#xD;
             abstain from alcohol and drugs throughout the study.&#xD;
