  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer screening is offered to all women in the United Kingdom (UK) between the ages&#xD;
      of 24.5 and 64 years of age. The majority of screening is performed in primary care and the&#xD;
      rate remains stubbornly below 80%, despite an automated national invitation system. This&#xD;
      study is designed to assess the effectiveness of a physician invitation during a telephone or&#xD;
      face-to-face primary care appointment upon non responders of automated invitations, to&#xD;
      increase the uptake of cervical screening.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that between 800 and 2,000 deaths a year are now prevented due to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the UK's national cervical screening programme and mortality rates have&#xD;
      dropped by over 75% since the 1970s. These statistics corroborate the importance of the&#xD;
      screening programme in reducing mortality from cervical cancer. Cervical screening rates in&#xD;
      the UK remains stubbornly below 80% and interventions are needed to attract the 20% who are&#xD;
      missing out on screening. This prospective observational study is designed to measure the&#xD;
      impact of a physician intervention in a usual healthcare environment, amongst a heterogeneous&#xD;
      patient population to yield replicable real-world results. The intervention arm will receive&#xD;
      a physician intervention to inform them of their overdue screening status, remind them of the&#xD;
      importance of cervical screening and guide them to book a screening appointment. The&#xD;
      screening rate in the intervention arm will be compared to a control made up of patients seen&#xD;
      by other clinicians and receiving unstructured reminders. The results will assist physicians&#xD;
      in deciding whether a structured intervention is anymore effective than the unstructured&#xD;
      advice currently given at improving screening rates in the non responder population.&#xD;

    <description>The principal investigator reviews the medical notes of all individuals they consult over a period of three years to check if they are non responders. If confirmed as non responder, they receive a three-step verbal intervention:&#xD;
&quot;Your cervical cancer screening is now overdue.&quot;&#xD;
&quot;The test is easy to perform and saves thousands of lives from cervical cancer every year.&quot;&#xD;
&quot;Should we book an appointment for cervical screening now so that you make sure you have it done?&quot;&#xD;
Those who are seen face-to-face receive a fourth intervention:&#xD;
An appointment slip is given to the patient to hand to the receptionist. This includes the patient's name and the comment, &quot;book an appointment with practice nurse for cervical screening&quot;.</description>

        cervical screening and have been non responders to the automated national invitation. These&#xD;
        patients are opportunistically recruited when they are consulted by the principal&#xD;
        investigator.&#xD;
