    <textblock>
      Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension occurs in a significant number of people and has no&#xD;
      effective treatment. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is associated with intermittent&#xD;
      episodes of fainting which can be debilitating for the patients. Using sinusoidal galvanic&#xD;
      vestibular stimulation, an oscillating current between the two ears, collaborators have&#xD;
      discovered an effective technique to habituate anesthetized rats that develop vasovagal&#xD;
      responses. The investigators propose to determine whether a similar use of sinusoidal&#xD;
      galvanic vestibular stimulation can eliminate or alleviate neurogenic orthostatic hypotension&#xD;
      and the associated syncope in susceptible human subjects. If so, then sinusoidal galvanic&#xD;
      vestibular stimulation, which is safe and widely used to study muscle sympathetic nerve&#xD;
      activity, can be used in humans, who have a history of syncope and a positive tilt test to&#xD;
      habituate vasovagal responses. Habituation will be accomplished using repetitive periods of&#xD;
      sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation in two 30min sessions three times/week for 2&#xD;
      weeks. Similar 1 hour sessions are routinely used by others when activating muscle&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve activity with sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation without harm to&#xD;
      the subjects. The 30 min periods were chosen because this was effective in producing&#xD;
      habituation of vasovagal responses. The habituating stimulus will be given by applying paste&#xD;
      electrodes over the mastoid processes and plugging the leads into a battery driven-stimulus&#xD;
      box, which when activated by a switch, will provide a very low frequency bipolar, ± 2 mA,&#xD;
      0.025 Hz oscillating current sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation between the mastoids.&#xD;
      Subjects will be seated during the stimulation. The onset and end of the stimulation period&#xD;
      will be denoted by tones, and the subjects will be free to watch television, read, or listen&#xD;
      to music while they are being stimulated. The effectiveness of the habituation will be&#xD;
      determined in several ways: 1) Subjects will keep a history of the number of episodes of&#xD;
      syncope in the inter-test intervals. 2) They will have tilt tests at the beginning and end of&#xD;
      habituation. 3) Their blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded and the investigators&#xD;
      will determine if there is a loss of low frequency (0.025 Hz) oscillations, which the&#xD;
      investigators have found in animal models to disappear when the animals are habituated. 4)&#xD;
      Habituation should be accompanied by an increase in heart rate to counteract the fall in&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syncope is a highly prevalent condition affecting 42% of the population at some point in&#xD;
      life. Physical injury occurs with syncopal events and the danger of injury becomes more&#xD;
      prevalent with age. Syncope accounts for 3% of visits to emergency departments and 6% of all&#xD;
      admissions to hospitals. For patients with frequent recurrent syncope, psychosocial&#xD;
      impairment has an estimated adverse impact on 33% of the assessed aspects of daily life.&#xD;
      There is also a large economic impact, with an estimated $2.4 billion annual cost, mostly due&#xD;
      to hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) results from impaired arterial vasoconstriction that&#xD;
      normally is mediated by the baroreflex in response to gravitational pooling of blood. The&#xD;
      characteristic findings in nOH are a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20 mmHg or&#xD;
      more, or a drop in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 10 mmHg or more, in response to standing&#xD;
      or head-up tilt. What distinguishes nOH from other causes of orthostatic hypotension, such as&#xD;
      vasovagal syncope or dehydration, is a blunted compensatory heart rate increase (&lt;15 BPM).&#xD;
      nOH accounts for 15% of syncope in the general population and 24% of such cases in emergency&#xD;
      room setting. The autonomic failure that precipitates nOH may result from α-synuclein protein&#xD;
      deposits in central glial cells (multiple system atrophy) or in postganglionic autonomic&#xD;
      neurons when associated with Parkinson's disease or primary autonomic failure. Secondary&#xD;
      causes of autonomic failure include diabetic neuropathy and other autoimmune conditions that&#xD;
      selectively target the peripheral autonomic nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no standard of care for people suffering from syncope. Several treatment&#xD;
      options have been explored, including beta blockers, corticosteroids, and pacemakers, but&#xD;
      none of these have been more effective than placebo. The most promising therapy to date has&#xD;
      been repeated static head-up tilts. Vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR) is a term used for the&#xD;
      redistribution of blood by vestibular stimulation through the actions of the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. 60° static head-up tilt activates otolith and body tilt receptors, which&#xD;
      produce cardiovascular changes through the VSR. Using repeated static head-up tilts,&#xD;
      &quot;syncope-sensitive&quot; patients were repetitively tilted 60° for periods of time. This was shown&#xD;
      to habituate the (VSR) and reduce or eliminate syncope in some cases. However, while it was&#xD;
      possible to habituate some subjects with head-tilts, the habituation techniques were too&#xD;
      tedious and impractical to be effective in the general population. If there were a less&#xD;
      tedious procedure that activated the vestibular system, it could be used to habituate syncope&#xD;
      through the VSR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) activates the otolith system. Blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) have been studied in vasovagal responses in&#xD;
      isoflurane-anesthetized Long-Evans rats during sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation&#xD;
      (sGVS) and nose-up tilt. In these studies, susceptible rats developed synchronous ≈20-50 mmHg&#xD;
      decreases in BP and ≈20-50 bpm decreases in HR over seconds that recovered slowly over&#xD;
      minutes in response to repeated vestibular (otolith) stimulation. The sudden decrease in BP&#xD;
      and HR, followed by the slower return to pre-stimulus values, are the main components of the&#xD;
      vasovagal response that underlie and generate vasovagal syncope. It was found that rats&#xD;
      previously susceptible to the induction of vasovagal responses progressively lost their&#xD;
      susceptibility as testing continued. The loss of susceptibility to vasovagal responses&#xD;
      indicates that the rats were habituated through activation of the VSR, using sGVS. It was&#xD;
      concluded that habituation was successful by blocking the occurrence of low frequency&#xD;
      oscillations in BP and HR in rats, which are thought to be the critical elements in&#xD;
      initiating vasovagal responses. The loss of susceptibility in this study was associated with&#xD;
      a rise in HR to oppose the fall in BP. These findings concurred with previous studies&#xD;
      demonstrating habituated responses with static head-up tilts. Why these findings were not&#xD;
      supported by some other studies, remains unclear; but one author suggested the reason for&#xD;
      their findings in humans was that static head-up tilts were sufficiently tedious that it&#xD;
      resulted in non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy for addressing nOH should likely focus on raising BP rather than HR as a fall in&#xD;
      BP is the defining feature of this condition. Studies of the VSR have been performed in rats&#xD;
      without identified vasovagal responses. Yakushin and colleagues applied linear acceleration&#xD;
      in anesthetized rats and found increases in BP that were maximal during upward and forward&#xD;
      translation [36]. HR was unaffected by single translations, but oscillations may influence it&#xD;
      more gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are challenges in the study of various populations affected by syncope. The most common&#xD;
      condition, vasovagal syncope may be difficult to objectively diagnose due to the intermittent&#xD;
      nature of the symptoms. In particular, many patients have normal tilt testing in the&#xD;
      laboratory setting and are only symptomatic during times of physical or emotional stress. A&#xD;
      more easily diagnosed condition, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, is far less&#xD;
      common and patients frequently improve spontaneously after adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on syncope caused by nOH because there is a larger population of&#xD;
      potential subjects and laboratory testing is more reliable. It is our hypothesis that&#xD;
      sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) can be used to produce habituation of&#xD;
      syncope in humans. sGVS has been used to activate muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA)&#xD;
      without side-effects beyond motion-sickness in a few test subjects. During habituation&#xD;
      periods, subjects are able to read, listen to music, and watch TV, etc.&#xD;
