  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the joint project PROVID is to contribute to better outcome prediction for&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients, to better clinical management, and to the development of new therapies. To&#xD;
      this end, the investigators will collect detailed data on the course of COVID-19 patients and&#xD;
      deeply characterize them at the molecular level. The investigators also aim to identify&#xD;
      compounds with the potential to improve outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROVID-PROGRESS study is being carried out as a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter&#xD;
      observational study (case cohort study) with material asservation for genomic, transcriptomic&#xD;
      and proteomic analyzes on adult patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With COVID-19, severe lung damage can be associated with relative well-being. In the course&#xD;
      of disease (several days), sudden lung failure may occur. While the lung initially shows a&#xD;
      relatively high compliance after intubation, lung function deteriorates rapidly to severe&#xD;
      ARDS in most patients. After intubation, patients require mechanical ventilation over a&#xD;
      relatively long period of time (17 days on average).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the clinical management of COVID-19 and its complications, there is an urgent need&#xD;
      for clinical (e.g., scores) and molecular (e.g., biomarkers) predictors of COVID-19&#xD;
      progression and for new therapeutic targets. Advanced age and comorbidities have been&#xD;
      identified as risk factors for fatal disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study inclusion, comprehensive baseline documentation of anamnestic, clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory data is collected on the same day if possible. In addition, all parameters are&#xD;
      collected that may be necessary to assess the severity of a COVID-19 disease (e.g. SOFA, PSI,&#xD;
      C (U) RB-65, ATS minor criteria). Furthermore, data is collected which, according to the&#xD;
      current state of knowledge, may be suitable for an assessment of the prognosis of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease. In particular, questions are asked about known infection risks (living&#xD;
      environment of the patient, lifestyle, previous illnesses, immune competence), the history of&#xD;
      symptoms and tests relating to COVID-19, preexisting medication, the familial risk of&#xD;
      infection as well as ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of inclusion (day 0) and on study visit days 1-6 and 13 - or for discharge if this&#xD;
      occurs before day 6 or day 13 after inclusion - routine laboratory values, score-relevant&#xD;
      data, concomitant medication and microbiological findings are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On discharge of the patient, additional information about his whereabouts is collected. If&#xD;
      the patient dies, the date and cause of death are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 28, 180 and 360 after inclusion in the study, a follow-up survey takes place with&#xD;
      particular attention to the living conditions and quality of life of the patient (EuroQol&#xD;
      health questionnaire EQ-5D-3L), to health-related events such as stroke or heart attack and&#xD;
      to the vital status. If the patient cannot be reached for the follow-up questionnaires, the&#xD;
      including study center will attempt to determine the current contact details or vital status&#xD;
      from relatives, the family doctor or, if necessary, from data from the residents'&#xD;
      registration offices or other state registers, provided that consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study visit days 0, 1-3, 6 and 13, 4 blood samples each (P100 EDTA plasma, citrate plasma,&#xD;
      serum and PAXgene RNA) are taken. A DNA sample (EDTA whole blood) is taken once and at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasopharynx swab is obtained on days 0, 3 and 6. If possible, sputum is obtained for&#xD;
      inclusion and on visit day 6.&#xD;
