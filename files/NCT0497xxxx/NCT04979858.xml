      The primary aim of the proposed research is to test the role of a newly developed reusable&#xD;
      form-fitting fabric mask in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in a community setting comprising&#xD;
      undergraduate students living in dormitories at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia&#xD;
      Tech). A corollary aim is to assess the role of wearing any type of face covering in reducing&#xD;
      spread in the same community setting. A final aim is to assess the social, behavioral,&#xD;
      aesthetic, and usability aspects of wearing face coverings in public settings.&#xD;

      The primary aim of the proposed research is to test the role of a newly developed reusable&#xD;
      form-fitting fabric mask in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in a community setting comprising&#xD;
      undergraduate students living in dormitories at Georgia Tech. The study has been designed&#xD;
      such that it also leads to the corollary aim of assessing the role of wearing any type of&#xD;
      face covering in reducing spread in the same community setting. Yet another aim is to assess&#xD;
      the social, behavioral, aesthetic, and usability aspects of wearing face coverings in public&#xD;
      settings. The study design is to assign student users of masks randomly to the Treatment&#xD;
      group of focal mask users (n=100) and a Control group of other mask users (n=100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Population and Data Collection: The subject population will comprise 200&#xD;
      undergraduate students staying in the dormitories at Georgia Tech, preferably freshmen and&#xD;
      sophomores with meal plans. There will be no restriction of race, gender, or sexual&#xD;
      orientation for this study. The final cohort chosen will attempt to reflect the demographics&#xD;
      of the undergraduate student body at Georgia Tech. The participating subjects will have the&#xD;
      option to withdraw from the study at any time. The recruitment of subjects will be carried&#xD;
      out in collaboration with Georgia Tech Housing through e-mail and web announcements. The&#xD;
      research team will be accessible to the subjects at all times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the informed consent process during recruitment, the Treatment Group will be told&#xD;
      about the use, care and laundering of the focal mask during the study. The planned sample&#xD;
      size of 200 accounts for dropouts, which are likely to occur so that a statistically&#xD;
      significant sample is present to assess the effect of the mask. A randomized study cannot be&#xD;
      undertaken for ethical and practical reasons (e.g., the fact that the behaviors of students&#xD;
      cannot be controlled leading to heterogeneity); therefore, a DID (Difference-in-Difference)&#xD;
      approach that has been used extensively in public health research will be utilized in this&#xD;
      study . The DID method assumes that unobserved heterogeneity in participation is present but&#xD;
      that such factors are time invariant. With data on observations before and after the&#xD;
      treatment intervention, this fixed component can be differenced out. For this reason, the&#xD;
      study is spread over six weeks consisting of three phases: Pre-treatment, Treatment, and&#xD;
      Post-treatment, with each phase lasting two weeks. The two-week period for each phase is&#xD;
      based on the following rationale: The incubation period of COVID-19 virus has been found to&#xD;
      be five days. About 97% of the people who get infected and develop symptoms will do so within&#xD;
      11 to 12 days, and about 99% will within 14 days, which is the basis for the 14-day&#xD;
      quarantine recommended by Centers of Disease Control. The health and well-being of the&#xD;
      subjects will be tracked during the study. Any student falling sick will be given medical&#xD;
      help using on-campus health services. Georgia Tech has a system in place with the ability to&#xD;
      conduct 1,500 tests per day, going to possibly 3,000 per day. If the COVID-19 test is&#xD;
      positive, the subject will be excluded from the remainder of the study. The subject will,&#xD;
      however, be compensated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: During the study, demographic, behavioral, and mask use data will be&#xD;
      recorded and appropriately de-identified. No specimens will be obtained from the subjects.&#xD;
      All the collected data will be access limited, and destroyed when no longer needed to perform&#xD;
      the study or analysis or after completion and publication of the study, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. COVID-19 diagnoses will be self-reported by the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, each subject will provide the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject Profile: Demographic information, class schedule, dining plans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Practice Data: Mask usage practice (type, duration), typical social&#xD;
           interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study, each subject will provide the following data every day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Metrics: Temperature, Typical COVID-19 symptoms (if any)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mask Usage Data: Type and duration of mask usage including washing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity Data: Classes attended, group meetings, social and dining interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, each subject will provide the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usability: Comfort, Ease of Donning/Doffing, Impact on Communication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shape Conformability: Conforms to face, Shape retention after washing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of Care: Ease of washing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aesthetic and Social Perceptions: Style, Perceptions of others, Impact on personal&#xD;
           behavior and degree of social interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Difference-in-Difference (DID) methodology will be used to analyze the data from the&#xD;
      Control and Treatment groups. The difference in infection rates between the groups will help&#xD;
      determine the role of the focal mask.&#xD;
