      Traditional Chinese medicine treatment is the original advantage in China for early stroke&#xD;
      intervention. Xinglouchengqi decoction is an important prescription for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute stage of stroke proposed by Academician Wang Yongyan. Early intervention can&#xD;
      significantly improve the condition of patients and reduce the degree of neurological&#xD;
      function deficit, but its mechanism of action is not clear.EEG, network graph theory and&#xD;
      metabonomics are applied in evaluating the treatment of stroke, and to explore the mechanism&#xD;
      of Xinglouchengqi decoction to improve the nerve injury of acute stroke patients. 30 stroke&#xD;
      patients with acute period will be as the research object, using the observational cohort&#xD;
      studies, to measure the dynamic of nerve function defect, EEG signals and other clinical&#xD;
      information. Based on EEG to construct the brain functional network in the acute stage of&#xD;
      stroke and to study the brain network mechanism of Xinglouchengqi decoction in improving the&#xD;
      nerve injury of patients. Meanwhile, based on the study of metabolomics, the potential&#xD;
      biomarkers and the metabolic pathway will be analyse to explore the pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      substance.&#xD;

    <description>the composition of Xinglouchengqi decoction: 9 g raw rhubarb, 9 g mirabilite, 6 g dananxing, 30 g quangualou decoction was uniformly prepared by the pharmacy department of our hospital. Decoction form was adopted, one dose per day, one dose of 200 mL decoction, and the decoction was taken in morning and evening twice and half an hour after meals. The observation period was 5 days: from 72 hours to 7 days after onset.</description>
