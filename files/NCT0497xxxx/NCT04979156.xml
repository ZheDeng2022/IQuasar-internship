  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional monopolar or bipolar transurethral resection of bladder tumors is the most&#xD;
      common method for resection of a bladder mass. En bloc resection has demonstrated success in&#xD;
      the literature utilizing different techniques and lasers, including utilizing the Ho:YAG and&#xD;
      Tm:YAG lasers. A recent metanalysis revealed several benefits to laser en bloc resection&#xD;
      including less complications and lower recurrence rate.22 Subsequently, laser technology has&#xD;
      also advanced with the development of a super pulsed TFL which overcomes many limitations of&#xD;
      prior traditional lasers. Olympus' SOLTIVE™ TFL, which has demonstrated improved&#xD;
      maneuverability and control, has a shallow depth of tissue penetration at 0.15mm leading to&#xD;
      precise resection and optimal hemostasis. Despite these beneficial characteristics and&#xD;
      qualities along with the promising utility of en bloc resection, the Olympus SOLTIVE™ TFL has&#xD;
      not been described in en bloc resection of bladder tumors. The investigator seek to determine&#xD;
      if the proposed benefits of this device can be realized both pathologically and clinically in&#xD;
      en bloc resection of bladder tumors.&#xD;

      This is a prospective study investigating the use of the SOLTIVE™ Thulium Super pulse laser&#xD;
      for the treatment of bladder tumors via en bloc resection in patients who present for&#xD;
      treatment at the University of Kansas Health System. The study pretreatment evaluation and&#xD;
      follow up schedule are the same as used routinely in daily practice, in accordance with&#xD;
      standard of care practices. Routine labs (e.g. complete blood count, basic or complete&#xD;
      metabolic panel, urinalysis and urine culture), and imaging will be obtained as per standard&#xD;
      care at the provider's discretion based on the patient's history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective data collection of the patients with bladder cancer undergoing en bloc&#xD;
      resection will be conducted in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical, surgical and bladder cancer history will be obtained by the surgical team&#xD;
      in the pre-operative setting, per standard of care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be taken to the operating room per standard of care for resection of one or&#xD;
      more bladder tumors. The SOLTIVE™ Super Pulsed Thulium laser will be utilized for resection&#xD;
      of the tumors in an en bloc fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for en bloc resection of bladder tumor Tumor marked with a circular coagulation&#xD;
      blockage border approximately 1.0 cm away from the edge. All visible vessels around the tumor&#xD;
      will be coagulated and lasered before the incision to reduce bleeding. Along this mark, a&#xD;
      fan-shaped incision into the bladder wall is made until the muscle layer is visible uplift&#xD;
      tumor by the force of the irrigation and use of the laser tip, gradually exposing the tumor&#xD;
      base tumor base is disconnected tumor is then removed en bloc. If it is unable to be removed&#xD;
      through the resectoscope in one piece due to its size, it may be cut into 2 pieces at the&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the surgeon's discretion, the procedure may be converted to a traditional TURBT utilizing&#xD;
      either monopolar or bipolar loop electrocautery. Other intraoperative/postoperative decisions&#xD;
      based on surgeon discretion and standard of care treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each specimen will be collected and sent en bloc to the pathology department. Ameer Hazma,&#xD;
      MD, a genitourinary pathologist, will review all specimens to decrease interobserver&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary symptoms before and after the procedure will be evaluated. This will be assessed via&#xD;
      an electronic questionnaire that will be sent to study participants. Symptoms will be&#xD;
      evaluated pre-operatively the morning of surgery as well as on post-operative day #3, 7, and&#xD;
      14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No validated questionnaire for evaluation of urinary symptoms after bladder tumor resection&#xD;
      currently exists. From clinical experience, the symptoms patients most commonly report&#xD;
      include frequency, urgency, dysuria, or hematuria. The investigator will therefore modified&#xD;
      the existing American Urological Association's Symptom score to address these symptoms on a&#xD;
      shorter term basis.&#xD;
