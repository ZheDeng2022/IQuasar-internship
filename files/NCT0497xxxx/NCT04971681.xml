      This will be a single site randomized, 2-session, within-subject cross-over design pilot&#xD;
      study. 20 enrolled (of 30 consented) subjects reporting varying levels of binge and high&#xD;
      intensity drinking, defined as at least 2 episodes of drinking 4 (for women) or 5 (for men)&#xD;
      drinks on an occasion over the last 5 weeks, (unless determined by PI that drinking history&#xD;
      meets study objectives), will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized to undergo one session&#xD;
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or sham immediately followed by our&#xD;
      rate control intravenous (IV) alcohol self-administration (ASA) paradigm. Subjects will then&#xD;
      return 7-14 days later and undergo the same sequence of events with the opposite intervention&#xD;
      (i.e. rTMS or sham) from session 1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study intends to address the critical unmet need to develop novel treatments for&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder (AUD), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), that&#xD;
      directly impact drinking behavior. Binge drinking and high intensity drinking, or consumption&#xD;
      meeting at least binge criteria, is a high-risk alcohol self-administration (ASA) pattern&#xD;
      associated with the binge-intoxication stage of AUD and the rewarding effects of alcohol. We&#xD;
      propose to quantify the impact of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) rTMS on ASA using our novel&#xD;
      &quot;rate-control&quot; paradigm. The rate control paradigm allows subjects to determine how quickly&#xD;
      their breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) will change (increase, decrease, or stay the same)&#xD;
      over the next 3-5 minute epoch, at the end of which brief computer-assisted assay of craving&#xD;
      for alcohol and subjective response attributed to alcohol's effect on stimulation, sedation,&#xD;
      liking and well-being in a manner comparable to the Brief Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale&#xD;
      (BAES). Each assay requires less than 20 seconds to complete and will be administered during&#xD;
      the last ~0.5 minutes of alcohol delivery but before selection of the next rate of exposure.&#xD;
      The ensemble provides detailed self-administered time course of alcohol exposure and&#xD;
      corresponding time-stamped series of quantified perceptions for analysis. This approach has&#xD;
      demonstrated sensitivity in associating self-reported high intensity drinking and the time&#xD;
      until a binge alcohol exposure of 80 milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our premise is that clinically impactful neuromodulation should change ASA. Coupling rTMS to&#xD;
      a laboratory-assessed ASA paradigm could document causal changes in drinking behavior&#xD;
      attributable to modulation of specific neural circuits. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      generate preliminary data supporting our central hypothesis - rTMS targeting to the mPFC, a&#xD;
      primary cortical input to the frontal-striatal reward (FSR) circuit, will decrease the rate&#xD;
      of alcohol self-administration.&#xD;
