  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opicapone (OPC) is a third generation catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (COMTi)&#xD;
      developed by BIAL-Portela &amp; Cª, S.A. It is approved as adjunctive therapy to preparations of&#xD;
      L-DOPA/DDCI in adult patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who&#xD;
      cannot be stabilized on those combinations. Carbidopa and benserazide are both DDCIs used in&#xD;
      association with L DOPA. When OPC is co administered with L DOPA/DDCI, peripheral COMT is&#xD;
      inhibited and thus L DOPA plasma levels increase, increasing L DOPA bioavailability. The&#xD;
      purpose of this Phase III study is to explore the potential of OPC to enhance the clinical&#xD;
      benefit of L-DOPA in L DOPA treated patients in the early stages of Parkinson's Disease (PD)&#xD;
      (patients without end-of-dose motor fluctuations, 'non fluctuators').&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OPC in subjects with early&#xD;
      idiopathic PD receiving treatment with L DOPA plus a DDCI, and who are without signs of any&#xD;
      motor complication (consisting of fluctuations in the motor response and/or involuntary&#xD;
      movements or dyskinesias).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, eligible subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms (OPC 50 mg, or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio, and enter a 24-week&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double blind period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the double-blind period, subjects may enter an additional 1-year, open-label&#xD;
      period, at the discretion of both the Investigator and subject, in which all subjects will be&#xD;
      treated with OPC 50 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Post-study Visit (PSV) will be performed approximately 2 weeks after the End of Study Visit&#xD;
      (EOS) or Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be administered in combination with existing treatment of L-DOPA/DDCI.&#xD;
