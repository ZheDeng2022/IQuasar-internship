  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-ICU long term sequelae- defined as &quot;post intensive care syndrome&quot; (PICS) manifest with a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of psychological and cognitive impairments, affecting over two-thirds of ICU&#xD;
      survivors and leading to increased rehospitalization, health care costs, impaired quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL), inability to return to work and burden for families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD), anxiety symptoms, and depression&#xD;
      after ICU stay is high and has been demonstrated in up to 50% of post-ICU population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, over the last years, an important effort has been made for the development of ICU&#xD;
      aftercare and follow-up clinics with the aim to detect and to minimize post-ICU sequelae and&#xD;
      improve outcomes. However, the utility of these follow-up programs and their effect on&#xD;
      outcome has not been completely demonstrated.&#xD;

      This is a single center, prospective observational study, which will be conducted at&#xD;
      Policlinico San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy. Patients admitted to the ICU from more than&#xD;
      72 hours will be consecutively included during a 2 years period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the incidence of post-discharge mortality in patients&#xD;
      admitted in ICU at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months of outcome of patients&#xD;
      admitted in ICU assessing QoL, anxiety, depression, PTSD, physical ability, cognitive&#xD;
      function, sleep disorder and return to previous life; Self- and observer reported cognitive&#xD;
      disability at 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge; prognostic factors for poor outcome, and&#xD;
      emotional and burden of care impact on the patient's caregivers.&#xD;
