  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of the study is to mitigate the spread of the pandemic in miners, a&#xD;
      population of high-risk, rural essential workers who are susceptible and vulnerable to&#xD;
      COVID-19, partly based on exposure to particulate air pollution, and who are predominantly&#xD;
      racial/ethnic minorities in New Mexico (NM) (3, 11). The study objective is to provide&#xD;
      proof-of-principle for frequent point-of-care molecular testing as a workplace surveillance&#xD;
      tool to monitor and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that frequent workplace molecular surveillance is an effective method&#xD;
      to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and discover novel host risk factors for the virus. The site&#xD;
      of molecular surveillance (intervention site) will be a surface coal mine in McKinley County,&#xD;
      NM, located just outside the Eastern Agency of the Navajo Nation, comprised of 66% minority&#xD;
      miners. This site offers a unique opportunity for a community-based study of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection in this population. Miners at the intervention site will provide nasal swabs before&#xD;
      beginning their work shift on alternate days that will be analyzed with a 'screening'&#xD;
      molecular test (12). This test is ideal because it is low cost, simple, portable,&#xD;
      point-of-care, rapid, and can be performed by minimally trained professionals in&#xD;
      low-infrastructure settings. The control site is a similar coal mine in Campbell County,&#xD;
      Wyoming (WY). Both mines, operated by the same company, have similar engineering,&#xD;
      administrative, and personal protective measures in place. The rationale for this study is to&#xD;
      establish the suitability of longitudinal molecular surveillance to prevent and control&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in this unique population by completing the following specific aims.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the acceptance rate to frequent point-of-care molecular&#xD;
      workplace surveillance among miners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Miners will have a cumulative acceptance rate of frequent testing at â‰¥85%, with&#xD;
      the added objective of exploring difference in acceptance by miner characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the ability to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by&#xD;
      point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance in a real-world setting of miners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The sensitivity of the screening test in a real-world study setting is a)&#xD;
      comparable to that described by others in controlled settings, and b) positively associated&#xD;
      with viral load in upper respiratory specimens (latter measured in nose and nasopharynx using&#xD;
      quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the effectiveness and implementation costs of frequent&#xD;
      point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance on reducing incident infection rates of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3A: Frequent point-of-care molecular testing over six months in the intervention&#xD;
      mine will result in lower incident seropositivity rates compared to the control mine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3B: Frequent point-of-care molecular surveillance in the intervention mine is&#xD;
      cost-effective compared to the control mine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine novel predictive host factors associated with incident&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection in miners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Miners with incident infection demonstrate less frequent use of cloth&#xD;
      face-coverings outside the workplace, greater mine dust exposure intensity, presence of&#xD;
      dust-related lung disease, and racial/ethnic minority status than those not infected.&#xD;

        Less than 600 subjects will be recruited at all mine sites in this longitudinal study. Of&#xD;
        these, less than 250 miners will be recruited from the NM mine. at the edge of Navajo&#xD;
        Nation (i.e., intervention mine). The remaining less than 350 miners will be recruited from&#xD;
        the Wyoming Control mine.Both surface coal mines, operated by the same company, have&#xD;
        similar engineering, administrative and personal protective measures in place, including&#xD;
        SARS-CoV-2 symptom &amp; fever screening. While there will be frequent point-of-care molecular&#xD;
        testing at the intervention site, seroprevalence (baseline and 3 and 6 m) will be measured&#xD;
        as an outcome at both sites.&#xD;
