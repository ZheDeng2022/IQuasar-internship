  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered&#xD;
      TT-4 in subjects with advanced selected solid tumors. The dose escalation portion of the&#xD;
      study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      TT-4.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label dose-escalation Phase I/II clinical study, designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD, anti-tumor activity, and efficacy of TT-4 in subjects diagnosed&#xD;
      with Colorectal Cancer (CRC), Gastric cancer (GC), Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and locally&#xD;
      advanced, unresectable, or metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (PANC); who have failed or are not&#xD;
      eligible for standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases. Dose escalation (Phase 1) will be to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TT-4 in subjects with advanced subjects diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer (CRC), Gastric&#xD;
      cancer (GC), Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic&#xD;
      Pancreatic Cancer (PANC); who have failed or are not eligible for standard of care treatment.&#xD;
      Dose expansion (Phase 2) will be to further explore the safety and tolerability of the MTD&#xD;
      and/or RP2D, PK, PD, antitumor activity, and efficacy of TT-4.&#xD;
