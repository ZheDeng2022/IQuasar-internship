  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to assess the capability of physicians (breast surgeons and pathologists) to recognize&#xD;
      breast cancer in images of fresh lumpectomies generated with the Histolog Scanner, a recent&#xD;
      large field-of-view confocal laser scanning medical imaging device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in female worldwide and breast-conserving surgery (BCS)&#xD;
      became the most frequently performed surgical treatment for women with early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer. The ability to identify subclinical and deep-seated tumor during BCS is still&#xD;
      difficult, and the surgeon must rely on nonspecific visual changes and manual palpation of&#xD;
      subtle irregularities to guide cancer excision. Although there is no consensus on negative&#xD;
      surgical margins, at least 20 % of patients undergo more than one procedure to achieve&#xD;
      acceptable margins as part of breast-conserving strategy. The development of reliable&#xD;
      intraoperative assessment tools which can provide a timely indication of whether re-excision&#xD;
      in tumor bed after BCS is indicated at the time of primary surgery would be an asset. The&#xD;
      Histolog Scanner is a recent confocal microscope designed for fresh tissue ex-vivo medical&#xD;
      imaging with high resolution and speed to guide intraoperative assessment and offer support&#xD;
      in clinical decision making. Allowing the quickest and most effective intraoperative&#xD;
      assessment of breast surgical specimen regardless of center clinical workflow and&#xD;
      intraoperative availability of pathologist, is the aim of this international study. The main&#xD;
      objective is to demonstrate that both pathologists and surgeons are able to detect breast&#xD;
      cancer tissues in Histolog Scanner images of breast surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh Breast surgical specimens with breast cancer (invasive or in-situ) will be imaged with&#xD;
      the Histolog Scanner prior Standard-of-Care final assessment in pathology. Content of the&#xD;
      images will be reviewed by a board of expert pathologists using the gold standard&#xD;
      (H&amp;E-stained images) as reference. Blind assessment of the breast cancer content of these&#xD;
      Histolog Scanner images will be realized by breast surgeons and pathologist.&#xD;
