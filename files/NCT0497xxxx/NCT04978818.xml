      The main goal of this study is to compare the Haemophilus influenzae type b antibody response&#xD;
      in American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) infants to two licensed vaccines: Vaxelis and&#xD;
      PedvaxHIB.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children aged &lt;5 years have&#xD;
      experienced invasive H. influenzae type b (Hib) disease at a rate that is at least 5 times&#xD;
      higher than the general U.S. population. In the pre-vaccine era, the incidence of Hib disease&#xD;
      peaked earlier for AI/AN children at 4-5 months than general US children at 6-9 months.&#xD;
      Therefore, prevention efforts for AI/AN populations focused on identifying a vaccine that&#xD;
      would protect against disease in early infancy. Studies in AI/AN children revealed that the&#xD;
      Hib conjugate vaccine with the capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate&#xD;
      polysaccharide [PRP]) coupled to the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis&#xD;
      (OMP) induced anti-PRP IgG titers that correlated with protection (GMC ≥0.15 μg/mL) and&#xD;
      demonstrated high efficacy after a single dose in infancy. Hib PRP-OMP was licensed in 1991&#xD;
      as PedvaxHIB; following introduction of a two-dose primary series and a booster dose, the&#xD;
      rate of Hib disease decreased substantially among AI/AN children. The importance of PRP-OMP&#xD;
      vaccine to disease control was highlighted in the 1990s in Alaska when use of a non-PRP OMP&#xD;
      Hib vaccine was associated with an increase in disease incidence in AN children. In 1999, the&#xD;
      American Academy of Pediatrics Committee for Native American Child Health released its&#xD;
      official preference for Hib PRP-OMP for use in AI/AN populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of Hib vaccine coverage similar to or greater than the national average, AI/AN&#xD;
      populations periodically experience pediatric cases of invasive Hib disease. In contrast to&#xD;
      the pre-Hib vaccine era, a majority of these cases occur in fully vaccinated children beyond&#xD;
      the first year of life. This epidemiologic shift in the age at which disease occurs may&#xD;
      indicate ongoing transmission in the presence of waning immunity following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaxelis is a licensed hexavalent combination vaccine that contains Hib PRP-OMP and antigens&#xD;
      (Hepatitis B surface antigen, Diphtheria Toxoid, Tetanus Toxoid, Acellular Pertussis [DTaP],&#xD;
      and Inactivated Polio Virus [IPV]) to protect against diseases caused by 5 other organisms.&#xD;
      Vaxelis contains 3.0 µg/mL of PRP-OMP antigen, compared to 7.5 µg/mL in PedvaxHIB. This lower&#xD;
      concentration of PRP-OMP has been shown to be less reactogenic and similarly immunogenic to&#xD;
      higher doses. Vaxelis is approved for administration as a 3-dose primary series at 2, 4, and&#xD;
      6 months of age. A booster dose with a different licensed Hib vaccine (e.g., PedvaxHIB,&#xD;
      ActHib) is required at 12-15 months. Vaxelis Hib PRP-OMP was found to be highly immunogenic&#xD;
      post-dose 2 at 4 months and post-dose 3 at 6 months. However, immunogenicity post-dose 1 was&#xD;
      not measured in the phase 3 clinical trials of this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In June 2019, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) passed a&#xD;
      resolution supporting inclusion of Vaxelis in the Vaccines For Children Program for the&#xD;
      general U.S. population. This vaccine was made available for routine use in the U.S. in 2021.&#xD;
      A preferential recommendation for use of this vaccine in AI/AN children was not given because&#xD;
      post-dose 1 immunogenicity data were not available. To support policy recommendations to&#xD;
      protect the health of the AI/AN community, a study is needed to assess non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      post-dose 1 immune response to Vaxelis compared to the current recommended product&#xD;
      (PedvaxHIB). It is important to demonstrate that infants vaccinated with Vaxelis will be&#xD;
      protected early in life, given the historic early peak of Hib disease and the evidence that&#xD;
      Hib still circulates in village-based and reservation-based AI/AN communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study finds that Vaxelis and PedvaxHIB provide comparable protection after one dose,&#xD;
      this would support the ACIP making a preferential recommendation for Vaxelis for AI/AN&#xD;
      infants. This would expand the options of preferred vaccines for AI/AN infants and&#xD;
      potentially provide more long-lasting protection given that 3 doses would be given as part of&#xD;
      the primary series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, phase IV study of the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      two licensed Hib vaccines among AI/AN infants. The study will enroll approximately 330 AI/AN&#xD;
      infants on Navajo Nation, on White Mountain Apache (WMA) Tribal lands, and in Anchorage,&#xD;
      Alaska who are 6-12 weeks of age and due to receive their first set of routine infant&#xD;
      immunizations. Eligible infants whose parents provide written informed consent will be block&#xD;
      randomized to one of two study arms - either Vaxelis or PedvaxHIB. Participants will make 5&#xD;
      study visits over the course of approximately 5 months. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      Vaxelis group will receive the vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, and randomized to the&#xD;
      PedvaxHIB group will receive the vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four blood samples will be collected: at ages 2, 3, 6, and 7 months. These specimens will be&#xD;
      tested by ELISA to assess anti-PRP antibody levels. Among infants vaccinated at 2 months of&#xD;
      age, the anti-PRP IgG GMC 30 days post dose 1 of Vaxelis will be considered non-inferior if&#xD;
      the ratio of the GMC in the Vaxelis group relative to the PedvaxHIB group is &gt;0.67. The&#xD;
      statistical criterion we are using to define non-inferiority corresponds to the lower bound&#xD;
      of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) on the anti-PRP IgG GMC ratio [Vaxelis /&#xD;
      PedvaxHIB] being &gt;0.67. A sample size of 150 evaluable children per group will provide at&#xD;
      least 80% power to detect non-inferiority using a one-sided two-sample t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will also be given other routine pediatric immunizations that are not part&#xD;
      of the study regimen, per ACIP schedule and recommendations, (e.g., DTaP and IPV at 2, 4 and&#xD;
      6 months, and hepatitis B vaccine at 2 and 6 months, for participants randomized to&#xD;
      PedvaxHIB; Prevnar13 at 2, 4 and 6 months, and the rotavirus vaccine series at either 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6 months (if given RotaTeq) or 2 and 4 months (if given Rotarix). Inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine will be offered at 6 months of age, as appropriate based on season.&#xD;
