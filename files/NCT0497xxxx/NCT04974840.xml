    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treadmill training combined with thera-band&#xD;
      resistance to body support and forward propulsion would be more effective than treadmill&#xD;
      training alone in improving over-ground walking ability and reducing energy cost in chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients. This study will also characterize the neuromuscular and kinematic strategies&#xD;
      to adapt to resisted treadmill walking in non-impaired adults and stroke patients.&#xD;

      This study includes chronic stroke patients who will be randomly assigned to treadmill&#xD;
      training combined with thera-band or treadmill training alone group to receive 30 min per&#xD;
      session, 2 sessions per week for 8 weeks walking training . Functional balance (Berg Balance&#xD;
      Scale), gait characteristics during preferred and maximal speed level walking, and oxygen&#xD;
      uptake during 5-minute bouts of treadmill walking will be assessed before and after training&#xD;
      and at 2-month follow-up. Clinical sensorimotor function assessment, including hand grip&#xD;
      strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      lower extremity motor scale will also be conducted for subject characterization.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive walking training on treadmill with thera-band at the waist. The direction of the thera-band resistance will be straight backward, backward-toward-right, and backward-toward-left. For each direction, the level of resistance and treadmill speed will be adjusted to allow the participants to perceive a 10-minute training to be 'slightly difficult'.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive treadmill walking training at a speed that will be adjusted to allow the participants to perceive a 10-minute training to be 'slightly difficult'. For each session, there will be three 10-min treadmill walking bouts.</description>
