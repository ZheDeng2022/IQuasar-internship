    <textblock>
      As human beings live longer, geriatric disease develop, one of which was stroke whose&#xD;
      prevalence elevated by aging. Increased spasticity is a common symptom after stroke and may&#xD;
      hinder patient from rehabilitation. The spasticity was evaluated by subjective judgement&#xD;
      before. However, in the recent studies, the electrophysiological test, an objective&#xD;
      evaluation, showed possibly positive correlation with the spasticity. They compared stroke&#xD;
      patients' hemiplegic side with non-hemiplegic side by H/M ratio which showed significant&#xD;
      difference. The stroke patients included in studies had stroke onset over 2 years. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators wonder if H/M ratio can evaluate spasticity in stroke patients onset within 2&#xD;
      years and if H/M ratio is correlated to spasticity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a condition that insufficient brain blood supply due to ischemia or hemorrhage&#xD;
      causes brain cell death, which impacts normal function of motor, sensory, and speech,&#xD;
      depending on the damaged location. Over the world wide, the incidence of stroke is 119 per&#xD;
      100,000 population per year with death rate up to 10-42% in one month after stroke. The&#xD;
      survivor developed varying degrees of spasticity up to 42.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the conventional physical examination, modified Ashworth scale is used to evaluate&#xD;
      spasticity, but its results may be influenced by temperature, joints range of motion,&#xD;
      subjective judgement by tester or patient's nervousness. In the previous studies, spasticity&#xD;
      between hemiplegic side and sound side showed significant difference in ratio of H/M&#xD;
      amplitude, H/M threshold and H/M slope. Among them, H/M slope is the most sensitive tool and&#xD;
      may be correlated to increased spasticity because H/M slope showed higher value in people&#xD;
      with Brunnstrom stage III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients included in previous studies had disease onset over 2 years. The gold&#xD;
      recovery stage after stroke is within 6 months. During this time, many methods can be used to&#xD;
      reduce spasticity, such as medicine, stretching exercise, and injection. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      very important whether H/M ratio for spasticity evaluation can be performed in patients with&#xD;
      disease onset less than 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, according to onset time, participants will be assigned to three groups: less&#xD;
      than 6 months, 6 months to 2 years, and over 2 years. All the participants will accept&#xD;
      electrophysiological test over four limbs to collect data of H/M ratio of slope, maximal&#xD;
      amplitude and threshold. Hemiplegic side will be compared with sound side for significant&#xD;
      difference. The relation between H/M ratio and modified Ashworth Scale will also be&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;

    <description>To compare the hemiplegic side and sound side difference, investigators will exam four limbs twice and obtain two data of H and M. Electrodes were placed on each limb and the electrical impulse from low to high ampere will elicit several data of H and M from low to high values. Average of H slope will be calculated and divided by average of M slope, without unit.</description>

Electrodes were placed on each limb and the electrical impulse from low to high ampere will elicit several data of H and M from low to high values.

    <description>Investigators will evaluate if increasing H/M slope is positively correlated with increasing modified Ashworth Scale(MAS). The MAS is used to measure muscle tone, with score of 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4. The higher score means the higher muscle tone.</description>
