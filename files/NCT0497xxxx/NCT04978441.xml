      The research goal is to find a correlation between patient personality characteristics,&#xD;
      patients' mood and glycemic control. Eventually, using this information may allow treating&#xD;
      physicians the ability to better balance glucose blood levels in patients with T1DM, by&#xD;
      recognizing influencing psychological parameters. The conclusion from this research will add&#xD;
      to other physiological parameters that are being studied today, and in the future will be&#xD;
      integrated into an artificial pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that there is a correlation that hasn't been studied in the past&#xD;
      between personality characteristics, daily emotions and the ability to balance glucose blood&#xD;
      levels in patients with T1DM.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), is an autoimmune disease in which cells from the immune&#xD;
      system attack the beta cells, that produce insulin, in the pancreas. As a result of the&#xD;
      subsequent complete insulinopenia, glycemic levels rise, and the patient completely relies on&#xD;
      exogenous administration of sub-cutaneous insulin injections. The patients must adjust the&#xD;
      amount of insulin along the day in accordance with measured glucose blood levels and their&#xD;
      activities (eating, physical activity, etc.) Recently patients diagnosed with T1DM, are&#xD;
      eligible for a continuous glucose monitor with FLASH technology (Freestyle Libre glucose&#xD;
      monitor), within the Israeli health medical basket services. As a result, nowadays treating&#xD;
      physicians can better monitor glucose blood levels during the day. The Freestyle Libre&#xD;
      constantly measures subcutaneous glucose levels, translating them using a specifically&#xD;
      designed algorithm to projected blood glucose levels. This allows for improved glycemic&#xD;
      control and more accurate insulin dosing decisions for the patient with a tool to assess&#xD;
      disease severity and control for the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using advanced algorithms, there is an enormous research effort in order to create an&#xD;
      artificial pancreas- a glucose blood level monitor that informs an insulin pump regarding the&#xD;
      amount of insulin that should be injected throughout the day. This will replace the patients&#xD;
      ongoing burden of managing their glycemic levels and reduce patient dosing errors. In order&#xD;
      to improve the already existing algorithms, inserting additional parameters into the equation&#xD;
      may improve the predictive value of the algorithms, and thus improve the ability to balance&#xD;
      glycemic levels in different situations. So far, most of the research in this area was&#xD;
      performed using physiological parameters (heart rate, physical activity, nutrition, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the suggested study the researchers wish to examine the influence of character and&#xD;
      emotions on glycemic levels during the day. Finding a correlation between the mental and mood&#xD;
      status and glycemia may allow for the creation of a more accurate algorithm, to better&#xD;
      predict and balance glycemic levels in patients with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that there is a significant correlation between baseline&#xD;
      personality characteristics, changing emotions throughout the day, and glycemic levels in&#xD;
      patients with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The research goal is to find a correlation between patient personality characteristics,&#xD;
      patients' mood, and glycemic control. Eventually, using this information may allow treating&#xD;
      physicians the ability to better balance glucose blood levels in patients with T1DM, by&#xD;
      recognizing influencing psychological parameters. The conclusion from this research will add&#xD;
      to other physiological parameters that are being studied today, and in the future will be&#xD;
      integrated into an artificial pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that there is a correlation that hasn't been studied in the past&#xD;
      between personality characteristics, daily emotions, and the ability to balance glucose blood&#xD;
      levels in patients with T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, participants will receive an explanation of nature, duration, and&#xD;
      side effects required during the research period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, the following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and socioeconomic background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personality characteristics questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history including the most recent blood tests During that visit, the participant&#xD;
           will download a designated application for his mobile device and will receive&#xD;
           instructions on using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the follow-up period will be a week. During that period the patient will not&#xD;
      change their current treatment or lifestyle. The patient will report their emotions,&#xD;
      treatment, physical activity, behavior, and nutrition using a specifically designed&#xD;
      smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the data collection week, and following their next visit to the clinic,&#xD;
      glycemic information will be downloaded from the patients' CGM/FGM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile application: the designated application, will be built specifically for the study.&#xD;
      The application is a questionnaire that is always available to the patient, in an accessible&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the application, the patient will be able to fill out the questionnaire at any time,&#xD;
      asking participants for details about their mood and emotions at the time. In addition, the&#xD;
      app will collect data, if the participant will confirm it, which is collected by the smart&#xD;
      device (steps, pulse, etc.) The data will be stored on a computer that is locked with a&#xD;
      password, there will be complete separation between the patient's identifying data and the&#xD;
      research related data. Data analysis will include correlation studies between the different&#xD;
      parameters collected- specifically looking for emotional patterns/ events that affect&#xD;
      glycemia.&#xD;
