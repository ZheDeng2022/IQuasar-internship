  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to initiate a pharmacotherapy protocol for at-risk&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer in order to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and uncontrolled pain during cancer treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring treatment of his or her newly diagnosed mucosal or cutaneous head and neck&#xD;
      cancer per standard of care guidelines that meet all enrollment criteria will be identified&#xD;
      and enrolled after obtaining informed consent. This will occur in the clinic setting, and&#xD;
      subsequent screening and work up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized into one of the two study groups (Treatment v Control)&#xD;
      via a computer-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group: Participants will be prescribed a starting dose of venlafaxine immediate&#xD;
      release (IR) 37.5 mg twice daily. The IR formulation was selected due to its ability to be&#xD;
      crushed for those patients who rely on parenteral administration of medications. The dosing&#xD;
      will be increased at a rate of 75mg per week, to reach a desired dose of 300mg, divided into&#xD;
      150mg BID dosing. This dosing was selected due to the need for at least 150mg to see&#xD;
      noradrenergic effects. For patients with hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, or&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease, the starting dose is 37.5 mg once daily, and the dose is increased&#xD;
      by increments of 37.5 mg per day, to a maximum of 187.5 mg per day, given in two divided&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Participants will not receive any pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Treatment Group will meet with a dedicated research collaborator via&#xD;
      telephone on a weekly visit (for a maximum of 3 visits) as the medication is being titrated&#xD;
      up to ensure tolerability. If at any point there are side effects or concerns regarding&#xD;
      tolerability of medication, a collaborating psychiatrist who specializes in treatment of&#xD;
      depression is available for consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will follow up 6-8 weeks after beginning their chosen treatment&#xD;
      regimen for their HNC as determined for them by their standard of care evaluation. They will&#xD;
      complete all of the study questionnaires at this visit. Vital signs will be collected at this&#xD;
      visit as well as concomitant medications and any adverse events they may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will continue every three months following this visit per the patient's&#xD;
      standard of care return to clinic visits. It is anticipated that participants will be seen in&#xD;
      clinic during Months 6, 9, and 12 as follow up for their standard of care treatment regimen.&#xD;
      Vital signs, concomitant medications, adverse events, and responses to questionnaires will be&#xD;
      collected at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant duration will be up to one year. If at any point, patients meet criteria for MDD,&#xD;
      they will be referred to a mental health counselor.&#xD;

    <description>The degree of depression in patients who currently do not show signs of depression at the beginning of undergoing HNC treatment. This will be assessed using the following validated questionnaires: Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS SR-16). For both questionnaires, an increase in score is considered to show a higher degree of depression.</description>
