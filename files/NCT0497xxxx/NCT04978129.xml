  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most successful young adult alcohol or marijuana interventions involve the provision of&#xD;
      accurate, nonjudgmental personalized feedback, but notably the inclusion and effectiveness of&#xD;
      protective behavioral strategies (PBS) content is inconsistent. Moreover, active components&#xD;
      of brief interventions are not well understood, and findings have been inconclusive regarding&#xD;
      whether PBS mediates intervention efficacy of college student personalized feedback&#xD;
      interventions (PFIs), with only some studies showing evidence of mediation. One possible&#xD;
      reason for these findings is that investigators often do not know young adults' motivations&#xD;
      for using (or not using) PBS or the quality of PBS use across individuals or across drinking&#xD;
      occasions. The proposed study will provide an in-depth examination of which PBS young adults&#xD;
      are motivated to use (including implementation quality) and reasons that young adults may or&#xD;
      may not use PBS. Understanding why young adults are choosing not to use PBS on specific&#xD;
      occasions or do not engage in effective or high-quality PBS use on certain occasions has&#xD;
      significant clinical implications, whereby interventions may need to spend more time&#xD;
      increasing motivations to use PBS in an effective manner or work on reducing perceived&#xD;
      barriers (i.e., reasons individuals are not using PBS). Clinicians may then be better able to&#xD;
      work with young adults in various settings to reduce or prevent excessive alcohol and&#xD;
      marijuana use and related consequences. The proposed research has high potential for making a&#xD;
      substantial impact on the field and public health (particularly as more states permit legal&#xD;
      access to marijuana for those over 21) as it will address a problem of high importance&#xD;
      (alcohol and marijuana use) by being the first to develop and refine a PBS intervention that&#xD;
      specifically focuses on motivations for alcohol and marijuana PBS use and non-use as well as&#xD;
      quality of use, which is an overlooked aspect of current PBS-related intervention approaches.&#xD;
      The development of more efficacious interventions to reduce the proportion of young adults&#xD;
      who engage in excessive alcohol use and who experience consequences is a key priority of the&#xD;
      NIAAA. Related, development of more effective interventions to reduce risk from marijuana use&#xD;
      is an area of great importance for the NIDA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of young adults who use both alcohol and marijuana do so simultaneously.&#xD;
      Simultaneous Alcohol and Marijuana (SAM) use is defined as using alcohol and marijuana at the&#xD;
      same time so that their effects overlap. Individuals who engage in Concurrent Alcohol and&#xD;
      Marijuana (CAM) use are often characterized as those who report both alcohol and marijuana&#xD;
      use within the same time period (e.g., past month, past week). An increasing body of&#xD;
      literature has documented CAM and SAM use on a given day among young adults. Event-level&#xD;
      findings show SAM use is associated with increased risk for consequences, compared to&#xD;
      marijuana use alone or CAM use. Given that the investigators' focus in this application is on&#xD;
      daily-level substance use behaviors, the investigators define CAM use as using both&#xD;
      substances on the same day, but not so that their effects overlap. Interventions should focus&#xD;
      on reducing drinking as well as drinking that occurs in conjunction with marijuana use to&#xD;
      provide a more comprehensive evaluation of intervention efficacy. The proposed research in&#xD;
      this application will develop and test a novel online and text message (TM) protective&#xD;
      behavioral strategies (PBS) intervention to reduce alcohol, marijuana, CAM, and SAM use and&#xD;
      related negative consequences among young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way interventions could prevent or reduce alcohol- and marijuana-related consequences is&#xD;
      by promoting the use of PBS, which are behaviors that individuals can use to limit&#xD;
      consequences and/or reduce substance use. PBS are often incorporated into brief interventions&#xD;
      or TM interventions in the form of skills training. Despite the empirical support for&#xD;
      including PBS content in brief interventions, findings have been inconclusive regarding&#xD;
      whether PBS mediate intervention efficacy among college students. One possible explanation is&#xD;
      that skills-based PBS interventions prematurely focus on &quot;how&quot; to use PBS, but not &quot;why&quot; PBS&#xD;
      might be used or used with high quality. Research is needed to determine motivations for when&#xD;
      and why young adults may or may not decide to use PBS to reduce harm while using alcohol&#xD;
      and/or marijuana, which can then enable investigators to better address these motivations in&#xD;
      brief interventions. Research has yet to examine how alcohol and marijuana PBS use on a given&#xD;
      day relates to an individual's use of alcohol alone or marijuana alone in comparison to CAM&#xD;
      or SAM use. The proposed study will fill these critical gaps by identifying the extent to&#xD;
      which motivations for PBS use and nonuse (marijuana or alcohol) and quality of PBS use&#xD;
      (degree of effectiveness or degree of implementation) differ when using alcohol alone versus&#xD;
      concurrently or simultaneously with marijuana. The overall goal of this research is to inform&#xD;
      a pilot study of a newly developed alcohol and marijuana PBS intervention. The proposed&#xD;
      research will (1) collect pilot data to establish feasibility and acceptability and test the&#xD;
      interactive online and TM PBS intervention (baseline, 2-month) while also (2) collecting&#xD;
      event-level data to examine daily-level associations among PBS motivation/quality, PBS use&#xD;
      and non-use, alcohol and/or marijuana use, and negative consequences with a focus on how PBS&#xD;
      may differ on CAM or SAM use days compared to alcohol-only days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine motivations for alcohol and marijuana PBS use (and non-use of PBS) as well as&#xD;
      quality of PBS use among young adults (ages 18-24) who use both alcohol and marijuana. The&#xD;
      present study will conduct online focus groups (10 groups, N=10 individuals per group) and&#xD;
      cognitive interviews (N=10) to determine why young adults use or do not use specific PBS&#xD;
      related to alcohol and/or marijuana use. Focus groups will address how PBS use or motivations&#xD;
      to avoid consequences may differ by gender (male, female, non-binary). Focus groups and&#xD;
      cognitive interviews will discuss the level of quality in which PBS are used and various&#xD;
      contexts in which PBS may or may not be used. Discussions will consider use of either&#xD;
      substance alone on a given day as well as SAM or CAM use on a given day and will include ways&#xD;
      in which the motivations and quality of PBS could be incorporated into an online and TM PBS&#xD;
      intervention, as well as elicit feedback on mock intervention material. Using an exploratory&#xD;
      sequential mixed methods design, an iterative process of focus groups and cognitive&#xD;
      interviews will inform the development and delivery of the intervention to be tested in the&#xD;
      pilot study (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study with young adults (N=200; ages 18-24), who typically use alcohol&#xD;
      and marijuana at least two days per week, to determine feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effect sizes (to inform a future R01 application). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention or wait-list control. The intervention is a brief&#xD;
      interactive online intervention focusing on self-selected alcohol and marijuana PBS messages&#xD;
      and motives for using alcohol- and marijuana-related PBS and includes intervention content&#xD;
      delivered via TMs three days a week (random day, Friday, Saturday) over eight consecutive&#xD;
      weekends. All participants will report PBS use, motivations for PBS use (and non-use),&#xD;
      quality of PBS use, readiness to change, and alcohol and marijuana use in morning surveys&#xD;
      timed to occur the day after the intervention TMs for those in the intervention group. The&#xD;
      proposed research in this application will provide an in-depth understanding of young adults'&#xD;
      PBS use and has potential to develop a more efficacious intervention for these co-occurring&#xD;
      or simultaneous alcohol and marijuana behaviors.&#xD;
