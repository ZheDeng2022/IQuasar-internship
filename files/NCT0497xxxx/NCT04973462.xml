      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety (side effects and / or adverse&#xD;
      effects) of Triazavirin and Oseltamivir as treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Egyptian&#xD;
      patients in military hospitals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged, followed by a rapidly&#xD;
      spread due to strong human-to-human transmission in china. Based on the clinical&#xD;
      presentation, the pneumonia was determined to be a viral infection; the virus was initially&#xD;
      named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and then, formally, severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most districts have reported zero increase of coronavirus&#xD;
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases since March 2020. As of 11 March 2020, a total of 80 955&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of&#xD;
      international concern on 30 January 2020. The mortality rate was found to be 3.9% according&#xD;
      to the data at that time. Given the human-to-human transmission and high infectivity of the&#xD;
      disease, COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading in Republic of Korea, Iran, Italy, the United&#xD;
      States, and Europe. A number of studies and reports have identified a median incubation&#xD;
      period of 4 d and have determined that the top four symptoms include fever, cough, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, and chest tightness/pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most unfortunate fact is that there have been no effective therapies for preventing and&#xD;
      treating COVID-19 to date. Although Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be&#xD;
      effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, the data obtained thus far are primarily from in vitro&#xD;
      studies, but their effectiveness in vivo still questionable. Interferon, Lopinavir/ritonavir,&#xD;
      Arbidol, Ribavirin, and the therapeutic application of plasma antibodies have also been&#xD;
      recommended as alternatives for the treatment of patients with COVID-19; however, the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of these drugs remain to be verified in patients, and their applications&#xD;
      are yet to be validated by scientifically sound randomized clinical trials (RCTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triazavirin (TZV), a new antiviral drug, has been on the market in Russia since 2015. It is a&#xD;
      synthetic compound analogue to the purine nucleoside bases. The principle mode of action of&#xD;
      TZV is inhibiting the synthesis of viral RNA and preventing the replication of genomic&#xD;
      fragments. Because of its multiple-target mechanism of action, TZV has a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      antiviral activity against RNA-containing viruses, including influenza A virus (H5N1, etc.),&#xD;
      influenza B virus, tick-borne encephalitis, and Forest-Spring encephalitis, both in vitro and&#xD;
      in animal models in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oseltamivir is a first-line antiviral drug, especially in primary hospitals of military&#xD;
      medical hospitals. During the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 who are symptomatic have used Oseltamivir. Considering its popular and&#xD;
      important role as an antiviral drug, it is necessary to evaluate oseltamivir in the treatment&#xD;
      of COVID-19 . Oseltamivir inhibits the neuraminidase enzyme, which is expressed on the viral&#xD;
      surface. The enzyme promotes release of virus from infected cells and facilitates viral&#xD;
      movement within the respiratory tract. In the presence of neuraminidase inhibitors, virions&#xD;
      stay attached to the membrane of infected cells and are also entrapped in respiratory&#xD;
      secretions.&#xD;
