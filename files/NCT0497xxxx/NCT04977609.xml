  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis affects the majority of stroke patients in the acute phase. In post-stroke motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation patients can re-learn motor sequences through repetitive training. Research&#xD;
      showed that virtual reality (VR) can be effectively used in upper limb motor rehabilitation&#xD;
      by training motor coordination and gestures in an immersive virtual environment. Another&#xD;
      promising line of intervention in post-stroke rehabilitation is the use of music, with&#xD;
      evidence supporting the notion that a rhythmic accompaniment promotes the recovery of motor&#xD;
      coordination in patients with hemiparetic stroke. Furthermore, studies showed a beneficial&#xD;
      effect of the observation of movements performed by a third person in patients with&#xD;
      post-stroke hemiparesis. Based this evidence, the present study aims at testing the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a novel music-based VR intervention designed for upper limb motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation in post-stroke hemiparetic patients. The treatment consists in upper limb&#xD;
      repetitive training activities through the imitation of movements synchronized with a musical&#xD;
      accompaniment and is delivered in 10 sessions over 2 weeks, supervised by a physical&#xD;
      therapist. Participants wear a VR headset through which they observe egocentric 180° 3D&#xD;
      videoclips. The experimental condition (group A) will be compared with a no-music condition&#xD;
      (group B), to test the specific effect of music, and with traditional physiotherapy&#xD;
      rehabilitation (group C), to test the efficacy of the approach. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      the patients undergoing the experimental intervention (group A and group B) will show a&#xD;
      greater upper limb motor function improvement, as compared to the active control group. As a&#xD;
      secondary endpoint the investigators expect the music component to induce a greater motor&#xD;
      improvement as compared to the experimental condition without music.&#xD;
