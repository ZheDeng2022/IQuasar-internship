  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AIRB research team will compare the use and effectiveness of each intervention (Mind the&#xD;
      Gap, Remaking Recess and Self Determination Learning Model of Instruction) with and without&#xD;
      the addition of our implementation strategy, UNITED. In all groups, the research team will&#xD;
      train community practitioners using remote delivery of professional development modules&#xD;
      specific to the intervention, and active coaching for up to 12 sessions as dictated by the&#xD;
      intervention procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will pair UNITED with three interventions that cover the ages of early&#xD;
      childhood, childhood, and adolescence. These include Mind the Gap (MTG), a family navigation&#xD;
      intervention for children newly diagnosed under age 8, Remaking Recess (RR), a school-based&#xD;
      social/peer engagement intervention for children ages 5-12, and Self-Determination Learning&#xD;
      Model of Instruction (SDMLI), a self- advocacy intervention for adolescents (13-22 years; 22&#xD;
      is the upper age limit of high school for individuals with disabilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Remaking Recess, school personnel will be working with children with ASD using the&#xD;
      Remaking Recess Intervention (play-based intervention done during recess). School personnel&#xD;
      will be trained to implement the intervention. The total time commitment for the school&#xD;
      personnel is about 30 hours. The total time commitment for the parents with ASD who will sign&#xD;
      consents and fill out a demographic survey is about 15 minutes. The total time commitment for&#xD;
      children with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) is about 5 hours during their&#xD;
      regularly scheduled recess period throughout the school year.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remaking Recess (RR) will include 112 elementary school personnel (e.g., playground staff,&#xD;
      classroom aides, teachers); and 152 children with ASD/NDD ages 5-12 (2-5 per school).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RR targets school staff on the recess yard who supervise all students, including those with&#xD;
      ASD/NDD. Training in RR will be remote, with all schools receiving a 60-90 minute didactic&#xD;
      training during district professional development days which has been successful in previous&#xD;
      studies. Active coaching (via remote methods, most likely zoom) will occur weekly with staff&#xD;
      at school for 10-12 sessions during RR implementation with enrolled students. In prior&#xD;
      studies, various school personnel (e.g., teachers, counselors, bus attendants, noontime&#xD;
      aides, classroom assistants, and one-to-one paraprofessionals) have served as intervention&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 assessment time points. At entry, the teachers/school staff will fill out&#xD;
      Demographic, Implementation Climate Scale, Teacher perceptions, Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
      (CGI-I), Social Network survey, and fidelity forms. The Staff Diary will be completed on an&#xD;
      ongoing basis coinciding with coaching sessions. At the midpoint of the study (midpoint of&#xD;
      school year) and at exit (end of the school year), they will fill out Implementation Climate&#xD;
      Scale, Teacher perceptions, Clinical Global Impression (CGI-S, CGI-I), Social Network survey,&#xD;
      and fidelity forms. The Social Network survey will be completed once in the following school&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in RR will be randomized to receive UNITED, exploratory implementation&#xD;
      strategy, or implementation as usual (IAU). UNITED is premised on the idea that successful&#xD;
      implementation in organizations like schools and early intervention systems requires a&#xD;
      team-based approach, in which the team is thoughtfully assembled, develops a plan for&#xD;
      implementation, assigns roles and responsibilities, and carefully tracks and supports&#xD;
      implementation and sustainment in all its stages. To address these requirements, the research&#xD;
      team combined two well-tested strategies. The first is social network analysis (SNA) through&#xD;
      which we will systematically identify members of the team who will implement each&#xD;
      intervention. The second is TeamSTEPPS (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and&#xD;
      Patient Safety), an evidence-based set of teamwork tools that optimizes target population&#xD;
      outcomes by improving communication and teamwork skills. The research staff will approach the&#xD;
      school leaders (2 at maximum) and explain Remaking Recess. After the school leaders agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will complete a site agreement to participate and then fill&#xD;
      out the Social Network Assessment (SNA) to provide names, roles, and emails of staff at the&#xD;
      agency that have significant roles in the school that relate to the Remaking Recess&#xD;
      intervention. The research staff will then email these school personnel the SNA as well.&#xD;
      After receiving the completed SNA assessments, the research team will randomize each&#xD;
      organization to UNITED vs Implementation as Usual (IAU). The research team will use the data&#xD;
      from these assessments to assess both arms of the study. Additionally, for those randomized&#xD;
      to UNITED, Dr. Elizabeth McGhee Hassrick at Drexel University and her team, will provide the&#xD;
      research sites the top 2-5 school personnel identified by the SNA as key for intervention&#xD;
      implementation support. This team will be invited to participate in the UNITED implementation&#xD;
      team. If they agree, they will complete a School Personnel Consent (UNITED/IAU) before&#xD;
      beginning any UNITED training. For both UNITED and IAU schools, the school personnel that&#xD;
      will be implementing Remaking Recess will fill out the Remaking Recess School Personnel&#xD;
      Consent (Implementor) before beginning any study procedures.&#xD;
