  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of siltuximab to decrease the severity of cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurological syndrome (ICANS) in patients&#xD;
      who will receive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      hematological malignancies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients eligible to receive CAR T-cell therapy for FDA-approved indications in hematological&#xD;
      malignancies will be enrolled in this study on the day of CAR T-cell infusion. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed until they develop grade 1 or higher CRS and/or ICANS. On developing these&#xD;
      syndromes, siltuximab will be administered with close monitoring and follow-up for resolution&#xD;
      of symptoms. If symptoms continue to worsen, then an additional dose of siltuximab will be&#xD;
      given. If the symptoms leading to CRS do not resolve, then rescue tocilizumab will be&#xD;
      administered. The study's primary endpoint is to assess the response rate of siltuximab in&#xD;
      the resolution of CRS within 14 days. The study's secondary endpoint is to assess the&#xD;
      response rate of siltuximab in the resolution of ICANS, the safety of siltuximab, and the&#xD;
      overall response rate of CAR T-cell therapy.&#xD;
