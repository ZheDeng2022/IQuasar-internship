  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative vascular mapping with echo-Doppler is acknowledged as indispensable to create an&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula for haemodialysis (AVF). The conditions for performing this examination&#xD;
      are not always ideal (venous vasospasm in cool temperatures, variability of the volume status&#xD;
      in the dialysis patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the use of a loco-regional anaesthesia (LRA) results in the vasodilation&#xD;
      of the limb thus rendering it possible to use the veins which were initially considered too&#xD;
      small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the functionality of our AVF when ultrasound&#xD;
      identification was used by the surgeon after the LRA. These results have been compared with&#xD;
      those of the preceding year during which this identification was not implemented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective study in the year 2020 during which all the&#xD;
      patients (n=90) had an AVF creation with preoperative venous identification by the surgeon at&#xD;
      university hospital of TOULOUSE (France)(echo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients gave their consent, and the database was anonymised upon completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were seen in a preoperative consultation with venous mapping carried out by a&#xD;
      physician specialised in the use of Doppler ultrasonography. Following this consultation, a&#xD;
      type of fistula was programmed in accordance with the Silva criteria (notably a vein with a&#xD;
      diameter of over 2.5mm and an artery of 2mm). On the day of the operation, loco-regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia was performed under sonographic guidance according to the previous description .&#xD;
      The decision of the block approach and the choice of local aesthetic agent was left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon carried out an ultrasound and modification of the type of AVF was then made if&#xD;
      the Silva criteria differed from those described during initial consultation. The&#xD;
      modification could be a more distal creation, a more proximal creation, a change of vein or a&#xD;
      change of artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators succeeded to create more distal AVF when the vein had a diameter of over&#xD;
      2.5mm after LRA. Furthermore, the investigators reassembled the AVF when the vein appeared&#xD;
      too small or residual (for example, following the attachment of an infusion having occurred&#xD;
      between mapping and the surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same team of 4 surgeons participated in the creation of the AVF for both the echo group&#xD;
      and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were given a preoperative assessment of their heart function and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors (HTA, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidaemia). Prior strokes and coronary diseases&#xD;
      were also registered as well as the patients' BMI and American society of anesthesiology&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of the good development of the haemodialysis access is based on the National&#xD;
      Kidney Foundation's criteria: Blood flow&gt;600ml, diameter over 6mm and lower depth of 6mm. On&#xD;
      the other hand, permeability was based on the criteria of the Society for Vascular Surgery :&#xD;
      primary permeability lasts from the creation to the first dilation episode or transposition&#xD;
      of anastomosis required to maintain the access. Assisted primary permeability ends at the&#xD;
      time of the first occlusion episode. Secondary permeability ends with the abandonment or the&#xD;
      definitive withdrawal of the AVF due to failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first postoperative consultation took place at around the 6th week after the creation&#xD;
      which is the normal time necessary for the smooth development of an AVF .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compared all these results with our control group which consists of all the&#xD;
      patients who had a native AVF placed during the year 2019 without having received immediate&#xD;
      preoperative ultrasound and therefore there was no alteration in the surgical project in&#xD;
      relation to that planned at the time of the consultation. Demographic data was similarly&#xD;
      compiled and all the evaluation criteria compared&#xD;
