      Firstly, the application effect of the existing predictive models, SOAR and GWTG-Stroke, was&#xD;
      verified in Guangdong acute ischemic Stroke population, and the clinical application effect&#xD;
      of the existing predictive models was verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the predictive value of clinical indicators was analyzed, SOAR and GWTG-Stroke&#xD;
      scores were optimized, and an improved prediction Model (New Model) was constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third is to apply the New Model to clinical practice, collect clinical data and evaluate&#xD;
      the prediction effect of the Model, and evaluate the prediction efficiency of the improved&#xD;
      prediction Model.&#xD;

      This research is mainly divided into two parts. The first part is to verify and optimize the&#xD;
      existing prediction model. Through continuous collection of clinical data of acute ischemic&#xD;
      Stroke patients hospitalized in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital from January 2017 to&#xD;
      December 2021, including baseline indicators and end point events, based on the existing&#xD;
      prediction model (SOAR, GWTG-Stroke), The predictive probability was calculated and compared&#xD;
      with the actual mortality during hospitalization. The ROC curve, calibration curve and&#xD;
      decision curve were used to evaluate the model's differentiation, calibration and clinical&#xD;
      application value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using retrospective data, multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the predictive&#xD;
      value of baseline clinical indicators, screen risk factors, and optimize the prediction model&#xD;
      of SOAR and GWTG-Stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) was used to select variables, and logistic regression&#xD;
      model was used based on Akaike Information Criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIC) was used to construct an improved mortality risk prediction Model (New Model). Decision&#xD;
      curves were used to compare the models. Combined with the clinical significance of the&#xD;
      indicators, the construction of the prediction Model was improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model was validated internally by resampling with computer simulation. The second part is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical application effect of the improved prediction Model. The clinical&#xD;
      data of acute ischemic stroke patients hospitalized in Shenzhen Second People's Hospital and&#xD;
      Shenzhen Longhua District People's Hospital from January 2022 to December 2023 are collected&#xD;
      continuously. The New Model is applied in the clinic, and the New Model is validated in the&#xD;
      external time and space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate prediction effectiveness and extrapolation.&#xD;
