    <textblock>
      The research study is an intervention and feasibility crossover design pilot study designed&#xD;
      to assess if consuming 3 study foods made with either soybean oil or palm oil per day for 4&#xD;
      weeks can alter whole blood, plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids and body weight in&#xD;
      overweight/obese adults. Additionally, the study will assess the adherence to consuming 3&#xD;
      study foods per day for 4 weeks and to assess if participant remain unaware of (or masked to)&#xD;
      which study food group (soybean oil vs palm oil) they are consuming.&#xD;

      The objectives of the study include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine changes in whole blood, plasma and erythrocyte linoleic acid after 4 weeks&#xD;
           of consuming 3 foods products made soybean oil and determine changes in plasma and&#xD;
           erythrocyte oleic acid and palmitic acid after 4 weeks of consuming 3 food products per&#xD;
           day made with palm oil in overweight/obese adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine changes in body weight in overweight/obese adults during four weeks of&#xD;
           consuming 3 food products per day made with soybean oil and during four weeks of&#xD;
           consuming 3 food products per day made with palm oil&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is evidence of unmasking of the two food product groups (soybean&#xD;
           oil or palm oil) during the study in participants and in study coordinators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine adherence of consuming 3 food products per day made with either soybean or&#xD;
