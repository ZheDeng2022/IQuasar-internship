  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is the ideal feeding method and that in the absence of breastfeeding the bottle&#xD;
      and cup feeding are common alternatives. There is a lack of evidence regarding superiority of&#xD;
      either of these methods. This study aimed to evaluate bottle feeding and cup feeding in&#xD;
      preterm infants on the outcomes of full breastfeeding and discharge time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 20 million infants are born preterm each year (&gt;37 weeks) and this number is&#xD;
      increasing. The preterm newborn population is potentially unable to be fed orally for a long&#xD;
      time in the postnatal period.However, it is not a disease that preterm infants cannot be fed&#xD;
      orally as soon as they are born. Since the physiological functions are not yet fully mature,&#xD;
      their adaptation to the external uterine environment is more complicated.This situation also&#xD;
      means a long hospital stay. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has&#xD;
      determined oral feeding of the preterm baby as the main criterion for discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preterm infants, sucking and swallowing coordination occurs in the 32 to 34 gestation&#xD;
      weeks.Oral feeding skills are developed by applying various sensorimotor interventions and&#xD;
      cue-based feeding protocols to increase oral feeding performance.Tube feeding (orogastric and&#xD;
      nasogastric) is widely preferred as their oral-motor skills are still immature.As postnatal&#xD;
      age increases, alternative oral feeding methods are often used along with tube feeding.Bottle&#xD;
      feeding, cup feeding spoon feeding and syringe feeding are the most popular methods in&#xD;
      clinical practice. While determining the most available method of oral feeding in preterm&#xD;
      infants, the selection criteria include their capacity to facilitate the transition to full&#xD;
      breastfeeding to help sustain breastfeeding to shorten the duration of hospitalization and to&#xD;
      ensure sufficient nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct full breastfeeding is the important and most recommended feeding method in new-borns.&#xD;
      However, since full breastfeeding is not immediately possible in preterm infants, they&#xD;
      definitely need an alternative feeding method.&#xD;

    <description>Preterm infants fed with bottle (n=78) and cup (n=80) were compared in terms of transition to full breastfeeding. The transition period from oral feeding to full breastfeeding is different for every preterm infants. There is no specific time frame in the study. For this outcome, infants were evaluated for time from oral feeding to full breastfeeding.</description>
