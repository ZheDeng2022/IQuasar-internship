      The treatment options and prognosis of patients with borderline pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) between 21-24 mm Hg&#xD;
      measured by right heart catheterization (RHC) are understudied. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the treatment effect of endothelin-receptor antagonist (Ambrisentan) for&#xD;
      patients with borderline PAH when comparing with placebo. Accordingly, 420 patients with&#xD;
      borderline PAH will be included in this prospective, randomized, double- blind, parallel&#xD;
      group, placebo-controlled study. Repeat screening is required if last screening was performed&#xD;
      &gt; 30 days ago. Baseline medical history will be obtained and physical examination will be&#xD;
      conducted before signed consent and randomization. Moreover, an electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
      laboratory testing, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) at supine will be carried out&#xD;
      before randomization and during follow-up. Subjects have to meet all inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      have no anyone of exclusion criteria. This study will comprise 3 stages: 1) screening period&#xD;
      (0-30 days), 2) 1-year study period (365 ± 30 days), 3) extended follow-up duration 3 years ±&#xD;
      30 days. Repeat measurements of cardiac function, hemodynamic, exercise capacity, and&#xD;
      clinical events will be scheduled at the end of study.&#xD;
