  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shared decision making (SDM) is an approach where clinicians and patients make decisions&#xD;
      together using the best available evidence. An understanding of the patient's treatment&#xD;
      goals, the advantages and disadvantages of treatment options, and the likelihood of achieving&#xD;
      the outcomes are important to patients. International guidelines recommend that all patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at pre-dialysis stage should be educated to improve their&#xD;
      knowledge and understanding of their condition and to choose the options for kidney&#xD;
      replacement therapy (KRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these recommendations, pre-dialysis educations are often infrequent. Many patients&#xD;
      feel unprepared. Wrong or insufficient understanding due to insufficient explanation of&#xD;
      treatment can lead to negative emotions. This may lead to a situation in which the patient&#xD;
      loses the opportunity to make patient's own choices, resulting in emergency dialysis or&#xD;
      dialysis modality that is not suitable for patients. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of SDM on starting the unplanned dialysis in CKD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a multicenter, open-label, randomized, pragmatic clinical&#xD;
      trial. A total of 1,170 participants who have CKD grade 5 without dialysis will be randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups. Patients in the conventional group will have education using leaflets.&#xD;
      Patients in the extensive informed decision making (EIDM) group will receive more detailed&#xD;
      education using booklets than those in the conventional group. Shared decision making (SDM)&#xD;
      group patients will have education according to questionnaires of self-assessment items using&#xD;
      a self-developed counseling calendar.&#xD;

    <measure>Patients' satisfaction assessed by Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ZUF-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0, 2, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ZUF-8 is an 8-items questionnaire to assess satisfaction in patients using a scale from 1,&quot;poor&quot; to 4,&quot;excellent&quot;. Originally, ZUF-8 used a 4-point scale, but in this study, the investigators further extended the scoring system of this questionnaire from four to five incremental stages of perceived satisfaction, i.e. &quot;poor (1),&quot; rather good (2),&quot; good (3),&quot; very good (4),&quot; extraordinary (5)&quot;. The minimum value is 8 and the maximum value is 40. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Patients' evaluation of the SDM process assessed by Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0, 2, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SDM-Q-9 questionnaire is a nine item measure. Items are reported with six response options ranging from 0, &quot;completely disagree&quot;, to 5, &quot;completely agree&quot;. In this study, six response options were converted into five incremental stages, i.e. &quot;strongly disagree (1),&quot; somewhat disagree (2),&quot; neither disagree nor agree (3),&quot; somewhat agree (4),&quot; strongly agree (5)&quot;. To calculate the total scale score, items are summed resulting in a range from 9-45. Higher scores reflect a participant's participation in shared decision making regarding their treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patients' adherence to medication assessed by Morisky 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0, 2, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MMAS-8 is an 8-items questionnaire and the scale included 7 items with yes/no response options and 1 item with a 5-point Likert scale response option. Cumulative score based on 8 items are used to obtain final adherence score ranging from 0 to 8. Adherence is defined accordingly as low (score 0-5), medium (score 6-7) and high (score 8).</description>
