  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major causes of long-term disability. Most stroke survivors suffer from&#xD;
      arm paresis even in the chronic phase. There is a need to develop novel strategies to augment&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy in stroke rehabilitation. One potential method to enhance treatment&#xD;
      efficacy is through the &quot;priming&quot; technique. Among all priming techniques, mirror therapy&#xD;
      (MT) has been proposed to be a promising method to augment effects of motor re-training. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a 3-year research project to determine the effects of MT-priming on&#xD;
      augmenting stroke interventions. The investigators select two types of evidence-based&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation, the task-specific training and the impairment-oriented training, to be&#xD;
      primed by MT based on their unique treatment benefits on restoring arm ability. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will provide customized home practice corresponding to each type of&#xD;
      interventions. Specifically, the investigators will (1) examine immediate and long-term&#xD;
      effects of MT priming with task-specific training versus MT-priming with impairment-oriented&#xD;
      training, relative to a dose-matched control therapy on motor function, arm activities,&#xD;
      quality of life, etc; (2) provide comprehensive evaluations based on the ICF model to&#xD;
      identify the specific benefits of MT-priming regimens; and (3) explore demographic and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of participants that may predict treatment outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) at 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity subscale of the FMA will be used to assess motor impairment. FMA contains 33 items (scale 0-66). The higher summed score means the greater recovery of motor impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Motor Activity Log (MAL) at 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAL is a subjective outcome measure of an individual's real life functional upper limb performance. The MAL is administered by semi-structured interview to determine (a) how much (Amount of Use - AOU), and (b) how well the individual uses his upper limb (Quality of Movement - QOM) in real life.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL) at 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NEADL is a postal questionnaire to monitor the level of ADL disability in patients discharged into the community after rehabilitation. The tool assesses 21 activities within four categories: mobility, kitchen activities, domestic activities, and leisure activities. It provides an extended ADL score that is highly correlated with more complex, self-reported interviewer-administered measures of disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Stroke Impact Scale Version 3.0 (SIS 3.0) at 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS 3.0 is a stroke-specific health-related quality of life instrument. It consists of 59 items assessing 8 domains (i.e., strength, hand function, activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living, mobility, communication, emotion. memory and thinking and participation). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with lower scores indicating greater difficulty in task completion during the past week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) score at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT quantifies the motor functions of the upper limbs through timed and functional tasks.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Grip strength at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Jamar Plus Digital Hand Dynamometer (Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL, USA) was provided for measuring grip strength. Unilateral grip and bilateral grip are included.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI) at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAHAI measures arm and hand functions on 13 actual bilateral tasks on a 7-point scale (1 to 7). The properties of the CAHAI were studied, showing great interrater reliability and convergent and discriminant cross-sectional validity.</description>
