  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of an intervention to improve Lynch syndrome&#xD;
      cascade screening uptake. The investigators will conduct a pilot study among 15 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome and 5 genetic counselors to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      intermediate outcomes of an educational workbook containing exercises and resources to&#xD;
      improve family communication among individuals with Lynch Syndrome and first-degree relatives&#xD;
      of individuals with Lynch Syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genetic counselors of patients with Lynch Syndrome and patients with Lynch Syndrome will test&#xD;
      a planning tool (referred to as an educational workbook) for cascade screening. Five genetic&#xD;
      counselors and 15 patients with Lynch Syndrome will be recruited from the UNC Health System&#xD;
      and the Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center. Genetic counselors will identify patients&#xD;
      with Lynch Syndrome and introduce the study opportunity to potential patient participants.&#xD;
      All patients and genetic counselors will complete a telephone enrollment call and provide&#xD;
      informed consent to participate. Enrolled patients will work with enrolled genetic counselors&#xD;
      to complete the first workbook exercise and then patients will complete the remaining&#xD;
      exercises alone for over approximately 1 month. After genetic counselors and patients have&#xD;
      completed using the workbook, the investigators will conduct qualitative virtual interviews&#xD;
      over Zoom and a post-intervention electronic survey to understand the participants'&#xD;
      experiences using the workbook. The investigators aim to understand the feasibility of using&#xD;
      the workbook as an intervention in clinical practice to improve genetic testing uptake in&#xD;
      families with Lynch Syndrome.&#xD;
