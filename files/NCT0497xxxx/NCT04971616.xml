      The purpose of this study is to design a self-assessment scheme for clinical assessment of&#xD;
      shoulder, neck and lower back function and compare the consistency between clinical&#xD;
      assessment and self-assessment. The body parameters (BMI, age, gender), daily activities&#xD;
      (daily steps, sedentary), work and rest time (sleep time, quality) were collected through&#xD;
      wearable devices, evaluating the risk factors of shoulder, neck and lower back discomfort.&#xD;
