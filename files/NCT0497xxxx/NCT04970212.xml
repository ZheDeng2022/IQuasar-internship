      Clinical study planned to demonstrate that the BioTraceIO Lite Tissue Damage Map (TDM),&#xD;
      available post-procedure, is effective at estimating the area of tissue damage as measured on&#xD;
      24-hour post-procedure (T=24hrs) contrast-enhanced CT scan and that it is safe, based on an&#xD;
      assessment of device-related Adverse Events.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BioTraceIO Lite is intended to provide physicians with adjunctive information in their&#xD;
      clinical assessment of tissue damage created by liver tissue ablation, as part of their&#xD;
      overall post-procedure clinical assessment.&#xD;

      Multi-center (up to 5 investigational sites) prospective single-arm clinical investigation 50&#xD;

    <description>Incidence and severity of device-related adverse events (including serious adverse events (SAE)) occurring between the beginning of the liver tissue ablation procedure and the completion of the T=24hrs contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan.

    <measure>Effectiveness - DICE</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between the tissue damage area based on BioTraceIO Lite Tissue Damage Map (TDM) as measured immediately at the end of the ablation procedure (T=0) (from the oblique ultrasound plane that was monitored during the procedure) to the tissue damage area based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) taken 24-hours post-procedure (T=24hrs) (from the corresponding 2D CECT plane), as assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient. The acceptance criterion for the study is that the mean Dice similarity coefficient must be â‰¥ 80%.&#xD;
Dice similarity coefficient = (2*TP)/(2*TP+FN+FP) When TP - True Positive; FN - False Negative; FP - False Positive</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Scheduled and indicated for standard-of-care liver tissue ablation for either&#xD;
             hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic liver tumor(s) using either RF or MW&#xD;
             energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Single tumor, or multiple tumors only if the distance between the ablated tumor and&#xD;
             all other tumors is at least 8 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Distance between the tumor and the edge of any previous necrotic zones is at least 5&#xD;
             cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Single ablation, using a single ablation needle, per tumor.&#xD;

             Investigator's clinical discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject cannot tolerate/undergo contrast-enhanced CT (e.g., due to contrast media&#xD;
             allergy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Planned ablation includes adjunctive means other than RF or MW energy (e.g., ethanol,&#xD;
             hepatic artery embolization, etc.) or overlapping ablations using a single ablation&#xD;
             needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ablation area cannot be visualized continuously using ultrasound throughout the entire&#xD;
             ablation procedure.&#xD;
