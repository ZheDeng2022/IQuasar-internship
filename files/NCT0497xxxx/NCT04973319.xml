  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer who have poor outcomes after endocrinotherapy and&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy can be significantly improved by the use of anti-HER-2 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody trastuzumab. In the current clinical practice of neoadjuvant therapy, trastuzumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy can significantly increase the pCR and improve the outcomes in&#xD;
      patients. However, there seems to be no available treatment for patients who have no pCR and&#xD;
      still have residual tumors except for sequential trastuzumab treatment for 1 year. Compared&#xD;
      with trastuzumab, a HER-2 macromolecule inhibitor, pyrotinib has a different site of action&#xD;
      and an increased EGFR target. Compared with lapatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and&#xD;
      HER-2, pyrotinib is an irreversible inhibitor, with the ability to achieve a better curative&#xD;
      effect at a lower human plasma exposure level. This trial is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab followed by sequential&#xD;
      pyrotinib treatment in non-pCR patients after neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the interest has greatly increased in how to proceed with postoperative&#xD;
      intensive adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer patients who have not reached pCR and&#xD;
      still have residual lesion after neoadjuvant therapy. Relevant efficacy and safety data have&#xD;
      been continuously verified in clinical trials, and some treatments have been clinically&#xD;
      approved. Moreover, new attempts and explorations are still going on in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Based on the preliminary clinical findings, it is planned to design a randomized controlled,&#xD;
      open-label, multi-center phase III clinical study that will explore the efficacy of&#xD;
      trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab for 1 year followed by sequential pyrotinib vs. touzumab&#xD;
      combined with pertuzumab for 1 year, aiming to verify that dual-target adjuvant therapy with&#xD;
      sequential use of pyrotinib maleate tablets is superior to dual-target adjuvant therapy alone&#xD;
      in HER-2 positive early breast cancer patients who have not reached pCR after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. If this clinical trial achieves a positive result, the use of pyrotinib maleate&#xD;
      tablets will be promoted for early breast cancer patients who have not reached pCR and still&#xD;
      have residual tumor lesions after neoadjuvant therapy with an attempt to further achieve&#xD;
      improved outcomes and prognosis.&#xD;
