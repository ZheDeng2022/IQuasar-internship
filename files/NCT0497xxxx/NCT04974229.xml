  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal observational cohort study to investigate the value of prognostic factors,&#xD;
      here sensory profiles , and others, in the development of central sensitization in the low&#xD;
      back pain population. A type 2 prognostic factor research following the PROGRESS framework.&#xD;
      Sensory profiles are identified a prognostic factors which can predict the development of&#xD;
      central sensitization in the low back pain population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After performing an univariable linear regression analyses the regression model predicts the&#xD;
      dependent variable, central sensitization, significantly, and the models are significant&#xD;
      prediction factors of the development of central sensitization. In unadjusted analyses, all&#xD;
      four sensory profiles were significantly associated with the development of central&#xD;
      sensitization (P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adjusting for pain, disability, age, and duration of low back pain, baseline sensory&#xD;
      profiles remained significant predictors of central sensitization. On the other hand, all&#xD;
      other predictor variables did not contribute to the prediction of central sensitization.&#xD;

    <measure>Central Sensitization Inventory score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The validated questionnaire Central Sensitization Inventory which scores on a 5 point scale ranging from 0-100. A higher score indicated a higher degree of central sensitization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile score</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile measures 4 sensory profiles (sensation avoiding, sensation sensitive, sensation seeking, low registration) on ad 5 point scale, and is validated in the low back pain population. Scores range from 15-60 points per variable. A higher score means a higher degree of sensitivity for the specific sensory profile.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Pain Rating Scale measures experienced level of pain, which consist of one question ranging van 0 (no pain)-10 (most extreme pain imaginable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Disability Index score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index evaluates the effect on seven life-related domains. Each domain is measured by 1 question, with a total of 7 questions, on an 11 point scale, from 0 (no disability) to 10 (completely disabled). Previously established reliability and internal consistency are acceptable in patients with chronic pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>age</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The included age (years) ranged from 18-60 score. A higher age indicates a worse prognoses of low back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>duration of low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of low back pain was assessed in weeks. The included duration of low back pain ranged from 0-6 weeks. A longer duration is not better or worse.</description>
