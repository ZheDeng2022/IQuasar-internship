  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of screening common&#xD;
      mental health difficulties in fathers and partners of women accessing perinatal mental health&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Where women have mental health disorders, this can put significant strain on their partners.&#xD;
      As well as supporting the mother and dealing with worries and uncertainty about her&#xD;
      wellbeing, partners may take on additional childcare and household duties alongside&#xD;
      maintaining work commitments. As a result, mental health professionals are considering ways&#xD;
      to involve and support partners and other family members where women are accessing specialist&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will involve the screening of fathers/partners of women accessing&#xD;
      perinatal mental health services, for mental health disorders including depression, anxiety&#xD;
      disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous empirical evidence has largely&#xD;
      focussed on fathers but we will include partners i.e., whoever the mother identifies as her&#xD;
      partner, therefore including individuals in same sex relationships or when the main partner&#xD;
      is a stepparent. The screening questionnaires will help us to understand the mental health&#xD;
      needs of fathers/partners of women who are being cared for by perinatal mental health&#xD;
      services. This will also help us see if partners find it acceptable to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on their mental health and family functioning online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of participants will be approached across a 6-month period. The first;&#xD;
      fathers/partners of women being treated in a Mother and Baby Unit. The second;&#xD;
      fathers/partners of women being treated in community services (i.e. community Perinatal&#xD;
      Mental Health Services). The third; fathers/partners of women who have not experienced mental&#xD;
      health difficulties in the perinatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fathers/partners in the clinical groups will initially be approached by clinicians in the&#xD;
      relevant service (Mother and Baby Unit or Community Perinatal Mental Health Teams). They will&#xD;
      be asked for verbal consent to be contacted by the research team. The research team will then&#xD;
      contact the participant and provide further information about the study and obtain informed&#xD;
      consent. Participants in the control group will be recruited online via social media and&#xD;
      through local charities and community groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fathers/partners will be invited to complete screening questionnaires on their mental&#xD;
      wellbeing -(the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Gotland Male Depression&#xD;
      Scale, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), the City Birth Trauma Scale), a&#xD;
      demographic questionnaire and the Couple's Satisfaction Index. Participants will be able to&#xD;
      complete these questionnaires online or via hard copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will help to inform our understanding of whether fathers/partners find it&#xD;
      acceptable to complete mental health screening questionnaires. It will also help to identify&#xD;
      if fathers/partners are more at risk of developing mental health difficulties if the mother&#xD;
      is also experiencing a mental health difficulty.&#xD;

        Three groups of fathers/partners will be invited to take part in the study -&#xD;
        fathers/partners of women being treated in a mother and baby unit, fathers/partners of&#xD;
        women being treated in community services and fathers/partners of women who are not&#xD;
        accessing mental health services. Participants will be recruited via the SLaM Mother and&#xD;
        Baby Unit and Community perinatal teams. The community sample will be recruited online via&#xD;
        social media and through local community groups/charities. Fathers/partners in the&#xD;
        community sample will be asked to confirm that the mother is not currently accessing mental&#xD;
        health services and hasn't accessed mental health services during the perinatal period&#xD;
        (pregnancy to 12-months post-partum).&#xD;
