  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult gallstones are found in about 10-15% of endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) performed for choledocholithiasis. There are several&#xD;
      options for the treatment of difficult biliary lithiasis including mechanical lithotripsy and&#xD;
      peroral cholangioscopy with electrohydraulic lithotripsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treating difficult&#xD;
      biliary lithiasis with ML and with EHL. The effectiveness is defined by the complete&#xD;
      cleanliness of the biliary tract in a single endoscopic session&#xD;

      Difficult gallstones are found in about 10-15% of endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) performed for choledocholithiasis. There are several&#xD;
      options for the treatment of difficult biliary lithiasis including mechanical lithotripsy and&#xD;
      peroral cholangioscopy with electrohydraulic lithotripsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treating difficult&#xD;
      biliary lithiasis with ML and with EHL. The effectiveness is defined by the complete&#xD;
      cleanliness of the biliary tract in a single endoscopic session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 30 days of the procedure, the effective clearance of the biliary tract will be&#xD;
           assessed with CholangioRM (or EUS where MRI is contraindicated). If residual&#xD;
           choledocholithiasis is present, patients will be considered as late failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the safety of the treatments under study, defined by the incidence of&#xD;
           adverse events during the procedure (e.g. perforation, hemobilia) and in the observation&#xD;
           period after the procedure (e.g. cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that can be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with &quot;difficult&quot; biliary tract lithiasis that could not be treated by standard&#xD;
      techniques, such as balloon and/or basket catheter under fluoroscopic vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients cannot be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if they have a surgically-altered gastrointestinal anatomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if they have any evidence of biliopancreatic malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if they are under 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if they are in a state of pregnancy or are breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if it's impossible to obtain informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, while performing ERCP for choledocholithiasis, stones are found that cannot be removed&#xD;
      using standard treatment, they will be treated by assigning these patients to either the&#xD;
      treatment group with ML under fluoroscopic vision or to the EHL treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned using a randomization method in blocks with a ratio of 1:1 for each&#xD;
      patient enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo ERCP, either under general anesthesia, or under observation by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, and depending on which group they have been assigned to, will be treated&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EHL: after administration of IV antibiotic therapy, we will proceed to cholangioscopy&#xD;
           with SpyGlass ™ DS (Boston Scientific Corporation, USA), treatment of difficult biliary&#xD;
           lithiasis with electrohydraulic lithotripsy with Autolith probe (Northgate Technologies&#xD;
           Inc USA) and subsequent complete cleaning of the biliary tract using the fluoroscopic&#xD;
           technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ML: we will proceed under fluoroscopic vision with TTS mechanical lithotripter&#xD;
           (Trapezoid, RX Wireguided Retrieval Basket, Boston Scientific) with mechanical&#xD;
           fragmentation of the stone and subsequent complete cleaning of the biliary tract using&#xD;
           the fluoroscopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each procedure, the following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the execution time from the insertion of the cholangioscope or lithotripter inside the&#xD;
           biliary tract until the complete cleaning of the biliary tract is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurrence of possible adverse events related to the procedures and/or anesthetic&#xD;
           issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any failure of a technique and / or the need to switch a patient to the other treatment&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 50 patients eligible for the study will be required.&#xD;
