  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is presently the first cause of disability worldwide. The most recommended&#xD;
      interventions by clinical guidelines are exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy although&#xD;
      the effect is modest. However, no approach is superior when given to a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      subjects with chronic low back pain (CLBP). This is probably due to the multiple factors&#xD;
      associated with CLBP which are biophysical, psychological and social. Thus, each patient&#xD;
      presents with a unique profile of factors contributing to their pain and could benefit from&#xD;
      an approach tailored to their profile. In other words, it is crucial to identify the right&#xD;
      treatment, for the right person, at the right moment. For example, the presence of important&#xD;
      psychological factors such as anxiety and depression are risk factors for low back pain to&#xD;
      develop and persist over time. The main aim of this project is to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      to perform a large clinical trial comparing the efficacy of a two physiotherapy's approaches&#xD;
      to treat CLBP (i.e., a psychologically-informed physiotherapy intervention compared to usual&#xD;
      physiotherapy) in patients with CLBP presenting a high level of psychological factors.&#xD;

      Low back pain is presently the first cause of disability worldwide. The most recommended&#xD;
      interventions by clinical guidelines are exercises and cognitive behavioral therapy although&#xD;
      the effect is modest. However, no approach is superior when given to a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      subjects with chronic low back pain (CLBP). This is probably due to the multiple factors&#xD;
      associated with CLBP which are biophysical, psychological and social. Thus, each patient&#xD;
      presents with a unique profile of factors contributing to their pain and could benefit from&#xD;
      an approach tailored to their profile. In other words, it is crucial to identify the right&#xD;
      treatment, for the right person, at the right moment. For example, the presence of important&#xD;
      psychological factors such as anxiety and depression are risk factors for low back pain to&#xD;
      develop and persist over time. Empowerment of physiotherapists and patients on the optimal&#xD;
      management of psychosocial factors, in addition of the usual care delivered in physiotherapy,&#xD;
      may be a potent strategy to improve the treatment effect especially with patients presenting&#xD;
      a complex clinical profile. This empowerment may be done through psychologically-informed&#xD;
      physiotherapy, an approach incorporating strategies from cognitive behavioral therapy into&#xD;
      the physiotherapy usual practice. However, the feasibility to perform a clinical trial&#xD;
      including psychologically-informed physiotherapy in the context of the Quebec's healthcare&#xD;
      system remains to be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this project is to determine the feasibility to perform a pilot randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial testing the efficacy of a psychologically-informed physiotherapy&#xD;
      intervention in CLBP patients with a high level of psychosocial factors compared to usual&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Specific aims are related to feasibility (1) and sample size estimation (2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test (a) strategies to recruit participants with high level of psychosocial factors&#xD;
           and physiotherapists (PT) (recruitment rate and retention), (b) the physiotherapists and&#xD;
           participants adherence to intervention, (c) the risk of contamination between treatment&#xD;
           sites and (d) specific challenges;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gather data to estimate the required sample size for a future full-scale randomized&#xD;
           clinical trial using physical functioning as main outcome, and pain intensity, quality&#xD;
           of life, fear of movement, catastrophizing, self-efficacy, pain pressure threshold,&#xD;
           exercise-induced hypoalgesia and temporal summation as additional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that this project will be feasible in terms of recruitment for both&#xD;
      patients (~30) and PT (6-8), will show good patients and physiotherapists' adherence to&#xD;
      intervention and low contamination between treatment sites. An improvement for all&#xD;
      pain-related outcomes in both groups, but more in the psychologically-informed physiotherapy&#xD;
      group, is also expected.&#xD;
