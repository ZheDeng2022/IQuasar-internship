  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the correlation between ATM alterations identified using NGS profiles&#xD;
      with ATM protein expression levels from tumor tissue assessed by IHC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address whether ATM genomic aberrations could be used to&#xD;
      enrich for patients with ATM LoP. Screening of unselected patient populations for ATM protein&#xD;
      loss is likely to a lead to high failure rate by IHC testing, as the prevalence of this is&#xD;
      expected to be low. This study could allow for identification of the types of ATM aberrations&#xD;
      that lead to ATM LoP, and thus significantly decrease IHC failure rate by pre-selecting&#xD;
      patients harboring such aberrations. In this study the investigator will be collecting&#xD;
      archival tumor tissue or fresh tissue which will be assessed for ATM LoP and compared to NGS&#xD;
      data. Additionally, patients whose tumors exhibit ATM LoP within this study could potentially&#xD;
      enroll onto the treatment study REFMAL 721/ART0380C001.&#xD;
