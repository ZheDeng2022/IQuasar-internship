  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility and outcome of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody (Tislelizumab, BeiGene) combined with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy for locally&#xD;
      advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cT1b-3N1-2M0, cT3-4aN0M0) patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective randomized phase II&amp;III clinical trial sponsored by Shanghai Zhongshan&#xD;
      Hospital with other twelve hospitals in China participating in. 476 patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cT1b-3N1-2M0, cT3-4aN0M0) are&#xD;
      recruited and randomly assigned into the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with&#xD;
      immunotherapy group (nCRT plus anti-PD-1 Group) and the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group&#xD;
      (nCRT Group) according to the proportion of 1:1. The safety, efficacy of protocols and&#xD;
      prognosis of patients are compared between the two regimens.&#xD;
