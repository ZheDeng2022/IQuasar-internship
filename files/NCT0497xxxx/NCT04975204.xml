  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3909 is an inhibitor targeting at B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 protein. By binding to BCL-2&#xD;
      protein, TQB3909 releases Pro apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2-Anatagonist/Killer 1(BAK),&#xD;
      BCL-2 associated X (BAX) protein and BCL-2 associated death (BAD) protein, promotes the&#xD;
      release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, phosphatidylserine eversion, stimulates caspase 3&#xD;
      / 7 activity and caspase 3 / 9 cleavage, and induces apoptosis.&#xD;
