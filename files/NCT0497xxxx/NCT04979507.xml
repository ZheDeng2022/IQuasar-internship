    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a multifaceted, chronic relapsing disorder suffered by millions&#xD;
      of men and women in the United States. AUD is associated with disrupted sleep continuity and&#xD;
      architecture, which impact health-related quality of life, and contribute to relapse.&#xD;
      However, many alcohol-sleep interactions and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear,&#xD;
      especially those involving AUD and chronic sleep problems. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is&#xD;
      altered long into abstinence, with excess duration and intensity of REM sleep, which is a&#xD;
      predictor of relapse. Emotion deficits, including affective flattening and mesocorticolimbic&#xD;
      hypo-responsiveness to emotional stimuli, are also consistent findings in AUD and predictors&#xD;
      of relapse. Here, our investigators bring these two components together, building on an&#xD;
      emerging literature showing that REM sleep is important for neural emotion regulation,&#xD;
      calibrating emotions to promote next-day adaptive emotional functioning. Our investigators&#xD;
      propose that the REM sleep-emotion pathway is dysfunctional in AUD, contributing to the&#xD;
      deficits in emotion regulation in AUD shown by us and others, which could then lead to&#xD;
      increased craving and relapse. Our investigators study male and female AUD patients compared&#xD;
      to age- and gender-matched healthy controls, using 2 within-subject sleep conditions:&#xD;
      uninterrupted sleep; selective REM sleep reduction, followed by functional neuroimaging with&#xD;
      emotion reactivity and regulation tasks the following morning. Our investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine specific effects of experimental REM sleep reduction on next-day neural emotional&#xD;
      reactivity in AUD compared to healthy controls and compared to a night of uninterrupted sleep&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a multifaceted, chronic relapsing disorder&#xD;
      suffered by 9.8 million men and 5.3 million women in the United States.4 Current treatment&#xD;
      approaches have met with only limited success in preventing relapse,5 although&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy that improved sleep in AUD was recently shown to help maintain abstinence.6-9&#xD;
      Targeting multidimensional pathways may more effectively treat AUD and prevent relapse than&#xD;
      targeting singular pathways. Here, our investigators aim to investigate links between two&#xD;
      factors important in AUD and relapse: altered sleep, specifically rapid eye movement (REM)&#xD;
      sleep, and poor emotion regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic alcohol use is associated with disrupted sleep continuity and structure, which impact&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and contribute to relapse.10 Polysomnographic (PSG) studies&#xD;
      show improvements with extended abstinence, however, sleep does not always return to normal&#xD;
      levels, and sleep alterations are predictors of relapse.11-13 Our investigators and others&#xD;
      have shown that REM sleep is persistently higher in recovering AUD patients relative to&#xD;
      healthy controls (CTL), suggesting chronic changes to REM sleep homeostasis,2,10,13,14 which&#xD;
      are likely maladaptive. Importantly, excess duration and intensity of REM sleep (high REM&#xD;
      pressure) are predictors of relapse.15,16 Attention has mostly focused on sleep continuity&#xD;
      and slow wave sleep measures in AUD recovery. The functional significance of excess REM sleep&#xD;
      in AUD is poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigators and others1,17,18 have also found that AUD individuals show deficits in&#xD;
      emotion regulation, including affective flattening and mesocorticolimbic hypo-responsiveness&#xD;
      to emotional stimuli (i.e. dampened emotional reactivity), which contribute to increased&#xD;
      craving and relapse.19,20 An emerging literature links REM sleep with neural emotion&#xD;
      regulation.21-26 A proposed homeostatic model26 posits that the unique neurobiology of REM&#xD;
      sleep (e.g. cholinergic activation combined with adrenergic suppression) enables it to fulfil&#xD;
      a role in promoting next-day adaptive emotional functioning. In support of this model,&#xD;
      selective reduction of REM sleep in healthy subjects leads to next-day hyper-reactivity to&#xD;
      emotional stimuli.27 Also, lower prefrontal gamma (30-40Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG)&#xD;
      activity in REM sleep, indexing reduced central adrenergic activity,28 relates to more&#xD;
      appropriate reactivity to emotions, reduced amygdala (AMYG) activity, and increased&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) functional connectivity the next day.29 Our pilot data&#xD;
      suggest that central adrenergic activity is not effectively suppressed in REM sleep (higher&#xD;
      frontal gamma), suggesting that the REM sleep-emotion recalibration link is dysfunctional in&#xD;
      AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigators, therefore, propose here that REM sleep in recovering AUD patients is&#xD;
      maladaptive for emotion regulation, affecting neural pathways of emotion processing,&#xD;
      contributing to their poor emotion regulation. Baker and Műller-Oehring combine their&#xD;
      expertise in AUD, sleep, fMRI, and emotion research, and use a novel experimental&#xD;
      within-subject, counterbalanced design with two experimental conditions: uninterrupted sleep&#xD;
      and selective REM sleep reduction, each followed by a morning fMRI scan. Our investigators&#xD;
      will investigate relationships between PSG-measures of sleep, specifically REM sleep, and&#xD;
      next-day emotional functioning (fMRI) in AUD patients, abstinent for &gt; 6 months, compared to&#xD;
      age- and sex-matched CTL. Our investigators will also evaluate whether the extent to which&#xD;
      AUD individuals demonstrate a capacity to normalize neural emotional regulation after a REM&#xD;
      sleep reduction challenge relates to normalization of behavioral measures of emotion&#xD;
      reactivity, regulatory control ability, and levels of craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Unterinterrupted sleep: Determine relationships between sleep and next-day neural&#xD;
      emotional functioning in AUD. Hypothesis (H)1: (a) Relative to CTL, AUD will have poorer&#xD;
      sleep quality (shorter sleep duration, more awakenings) and exaggerated REM sleep features&#xD;
      (excess duration and intensity [number of eye movements]) and (b) blunted next-day negative&#xD;
      emotional tone defined as reduced neural reactivity to emotional content (blunted mesolimbic&#xD;
      responsiveness and less functional connectivity among emotion networks [amygdala-PFC]), H2:&#xD;
      Higher REM sleep prefrontal gamma (&gt;30Hz) EEG activity will predict impaired next-day mPFC&#xD;
      engagement and top-down control of the amygdala in AUD and CTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: REM sleep disruption: Determine direct effects of experimental REM sleep reduction on&#xD;
      next-day neural emotional functioning in AUD. H3: In AUD and CTL, specific REM sleep&#xD;
      reduction will heighten next-day emotion reactivity and amygdala-PFC functional connectivity&#xD;
      relative to uninterrupted sleep. H4: After REM sleep reduction, next-day emotional&#xD;
      responsiveness and amygdala-PFC functional connectivity in ALC will be similar to that of CTL&#xD;
      after uninterrupted sleep. H5: In AUD, greater responsiveness of the emotion system to REM&#xD;
      sleep manipulation (i.e. greater increase in emotion reactivity relative to uninterrupted&#xD;
      sleep condition), will be associated with better behavioral measures of emotion reactivity&#xD;
      and regulation on fMRI tasks, and decreased craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these studies can advance understanding of mechanistic links between sleep&#xD;
      processes and emotional brain function in AUD. Findings will inform an R01 application aimed&#xD;
      to investigate effects of sleep manipulation as a pathway to resetting neural emotion&#xD;
      regulation circuits for relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH STRATEGY 2. Significance Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex and&#xD;
      multideterministic chronic relapsing disorder suffered by 9.8 million men and 5.3 million&#xD;
      women in the US.4 Globally, AUD is the most prevalent of all substance use disorders,&#xD;
      associated with substantial costs to the health care system and society due to loss of&#xD;
      productivity, injury, early retirement, and mortality.30 In 2010, the cost of excessive&#xD;
      alcohol use in the US was $249 billion. 31 Remission rates are low, with fewer than 50% of&#xD;
      people with an AUD achieving remission after several years follow-up.32 Breaking the cycle of&#xD;
      relapse is a critical goal of current pharmacological and other treatment approaches but with&#xD;
      limited success.5 Sleep disruption is ubiquitous in AUD patients and persists for years into&#xD;
      sobriety; it is associated with a poor quality of life, psychosocial problems, suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, and risk of relapse.33,34 It is unknown how sleep disruption increases relapse risk&#xD;
      and existing therapies that target insomnia do not necessarily reduce relapse, although they&#xD;
      improve functioning.33 In fact, the functional significance of many aspects of disturbed&#xD;
      sleep in AUD remains unclear. There is a need to uncover psycho-physiological processes that&#xD;
      link sleep disturbance and relapse, which could be targets for AUD treatment. The&#xD;
      significance of this proposal lies in the combined investigation of sleep physiology and&#xD;
      neural emotion regulation pathways to determine whether the REM sleep-emotion regulation link&#xD;
      is dysfunctional in AUD. Findings will inform a future R01 proposal to harness the power of&#xD;
      sleep to restore emotional balance, reduce relapse, and lead to better management of AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus on REM sleep in abstinent AUD. Poor sleep is common in AUD during periods of drinking,&#xD;
      acute withdrawal, subacute, and chronic abstinence.13 Sleep disturbances can persist for&#xD;
      years into sobriety, with long sleep onset latency, sleep fragmentation, and prominent&#xD;
      abnormalities in polysomnographic (PSG) measures of slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep.34&#xD;
      Two longitudinal studies showed deficits in SWS and excess REM sleep early in abstinence,&#xD;
      persisting into sobriety,13,35 with excess REM sleep even at 27 months.13 Our investigators&#xD;
      also showed excess REM sleep (pilot data) in AUD studied up to 2 years into sobriety relative&#xD;
      to matched controls,2 supporting others.36-38 REM sleep differences were unrelated to number&#xD;
      of days abstinent, suggesting that this sleep alteration is not a rebound effect due to&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal, and may reflect alcohol-induced alterations in neurobiological sleep&#xD;
      processes.10 Excess REM sleep, therefore, likely reflects an unhealthy state that is&#xD;
      maladaptive. Increased REM sleep pressure (more REM density, shorter latency to REM sleep&#xD;
      and/or more REM sleep) predicts relapse (reviewed in 39): Increased &quot;REM pressure&quot; at&#xD;
      admission predicted relapse in 80% of AUD at 3-month follow-up.16 Similarly, others found&#xD;
      increased REM pressure in early abstinence predicted relapse 6 months later, with 70% correct&#xD;
      classification.38 Thus, REM sleep abnormalities (increased REM sleep and REM density)&#xD;
      conceptualized as greater REM pressure, are evident long into sobriety in AUD and predict&#xD;
      relapse; however, functional significance of REM sleep abnormalities in AUD are poorly&#xD;
      understood. Our investigators hypothesize that ineffective REM sleep-related emotional&#xD;
      regulation is one pathway to craving and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy REM sleep and emotion regulation. Sleep is key for emotional well-being and plays an&#xD;
      adaptive role in the processing of daily emotions (reviewed in 40, 41). REM sleep in&#xD;
      particular has a crucial role in emotion modulation.21-26 During REM sleep, there is&#xD;
      selective activation of emotion-related brain regions that are involved in emotional&#xD;
      processing during wakefulness (e.g. amygdala).42,43 According to the REM sleep emotional&#xD;
      homeostasis hypothesis, the unique neurobiological state of REM sleep enables it to promote&#xD;
      adaptive emotional next-day functioning.21 Emotion can be decoupled from memory during REM&#xD;
      sleep44-47 and REM sleep serves an &quot;emotion recalibration&quot; function, priming key brain&#xD;
      regions before an emotional experience to ensure appropriate reaction.21 There is support for&#xD;
      these two hypothesized roles of REM sleep at behavioral and neural levels.22,23,27,29,48&#xD;
      After a night of undisturbed sleep, subjective emotional reactivity and amygdala reactivity&#xD;
      to previously-encountered (pre-sleep) emotional stimuli were decreased and connectivity&#xD;
      between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontral cortex increased.29 In contrast, amygdala&#xD;
      reactivity to emotional stimuli increased across a day of wakefulness compared to first&#xD;
      encounter (morning). Importantly, participants with the lowest levels of REM sleep&#xD;
      high-frequency prefrontal gamma EEG activity (a validated indirect marker of central&#xD;
      adrenergic activity28,49-51) showed the largest overnight decrease in emotion reactivity.&#xD;
      This effect was specific for gamma frequency, frontal sites, and REM sleep.29 Also, selective&#xD;
      REM sleep reduction amplifies behavioral and neural emotional reactivity to visual stimuli in&#xD;
      healthy subjects.27 These findings demonstrate the importance of healthy REM sleep physiology&#xD;
      in regulating next-day emotions. Most studies have been done in healthy individuals with&#xD;
      intact REM sleep physiology. Here, our investigators build on current theory supporting a&#xD;
      causal effect of healthy REM sleep on emotion regulation to investigate relationships in AUD.&#xD;
      REM sleep physiology is altered in abstinent AUD but whether it contributes to maladaptive&#xD;
      emotion regulation (i.e. has functional consequences) is unknown, and is the focus of this&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion regulation in AUD. Emotion plays a role in motivating behavior. Alcohol has a high&#xD;
      reinforcing value, can change mood and temporarily alleviate feelings of anxiety. Excessive&#xD;
      chronic drinking is accompanied by many emotional changes ranging from apathy and emotional&#xD;
      flatness to deficits in comprehending emotional information.18,52 According to Koob's model&#xD;
      of addiction,53 repeated cycles of drinking and withdrawal result in an allostatic&#xD;
      down-regulation of brain systems maintaining emotional tone that then leads to a cycle of&#xD;
      negative emotional state and increased relief-motivated drinking. These negative emotional&#xD;
      states persist in abstinence.54 Accordingly, deficits in emotion processing are frequently&#xD;
      observed in AUD55-61 accompanied by specific abnormalities in the structure and function of&#xD;
      neural networks that regulate emotion.62,63 Neuroanatomically, the reinforcing and rewarding&#xD;
      alcohol effects are transmitted via dopaminergic and glutamatergic projections in the&#xD;
      mesolimbic corticostriatal system, which originates in midbrain nodes, and connects to the&#xD;
      limbic system via the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, and to the medial&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex.64,65 Deficits in prefrontal regions affect the higher-order (top-down)&#xD;
      processing of emotional states. AUD (relative to CTL) show less anterior cingulate activation&#xD;
      during decoding of negative emotional facial expressions.60 Our investigators observed low&#xD;
      prefrontal activation to positive emotional content in AUD (relative to CTL) adding to the&#xD;
      model of downregulation of the frontal monitoring system in AUD, even for positive-emotion.&#xD;
      Thus, prefrontal regions play a role in the regulatory control of emotion-related behavior66&#xD;
      and their involvement is inversely related to amygdala activity.67 It is plausible that the&#xD;
      emotional impairments in AUD are due to a dysfunctional prefrontal-amygdala circuitry - the&#xD;
      same circuitry involved in REM sleep emotional homeostasis. Maladaptive REM sleep in AUD&#xD;
      (excess REM sleep; exaggerated REM features; high REM gamma prefrontal EEG activity) (pilot&#xD;
      data) may contribute to imbalanced emotional homeostasis, associated with impaired&#xD;
      prefrontal-amygdala regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion and reward systems closely interact.68. Incentive stimuli elicit approach behavior.&#xD;
      Alcohol cues gain incentive salience with the development of AUD (incentive salience&#xD;
      theory69) and can initiate drinking behaviors and decrease responsiveness to negative&#xD;
      emotion.70 Neuroadaptations (upregulation of ventral striatal reward and downregulation of&#xD;
      limbic emotion pathways18) that occur with chronic alcohol consumption53,71 are crucial for&#xD;
      the negative emotional tone in AUD, contributing to increased craving and&#xD;
      relapse.1,17,18,63,72-75 Sex differences. Men and women process emotions differently.76,77&#xD;
      AUD women are 2-3 times more likely to have mood disorders than men, and AUD men are twice as&#xD;
      likely to have antisocial personality disorders.59 Both male and female AUD have excess REM&#xD;
      sleep compared to controls (Table 1).2 It is unknown if the REM sleep-emotional pathway&#xD;
      functions differently in men and women in healthy or AUD subjects: our investigators will&#xD;
      explore that possibility, which can lead to insights into what may differentially motivate&#xD;
      men and women to abuse alcohol.78-80 In summary, our investigators build on literature&#xD;
      showing (1) excess REM sleep and (2) deficits in emotion processing in AUD, both linked to&#xD;
      relapse. Our investigators explore if maldaptive REM sleep leads to degraded sleep-dependent&#xD;
      emotion regulation, contributing to emotional imbalance in AUD individuals vulnerable to&#xD;
      emotional regulation difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. INNOVATION There is both theoretical and methodological innovation. Innovation lies in:&#xD;
      (1) assessment of mechanisms linking REM sleep features and emotional dysregulation in AUD.&#xD;
      Results could advance research beyond singular mechanistic pathways towards multi-level&#xD;
      integrated pathways, potentially leading to novel interventions to transform AUD from a&#xD;
      recurring relapsing disorder into a treatable, manageable disorder through sleep-emotion&#xD;
      modifications; (2) novel use of experimental REM sleep reduction protocol to directly&#xD;
      investigate the potential role of REM sleep in emotional dysregulation in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. APPROACH 4.1. Preliminary studies. Dual sleep and MRI studies in AUD. Investigators&#xD;
      (Colrain, Baker) have examined PSG sleep and brain structure in AUD and comparison&#xD;
      CTL.2,81,82 PSG data are shown in Table 1. AUD had more awakenings, Stage 1, less SWS&#xD;
      (particularly male AUD), and more REM (male and female). REM sleep did not correlate with&#xD;
      time since last drink, suggesting that REM sleep excess is not a rebound effect after removal&#xD;
      of alcohol. Figure 1 shows frontal EEG power in REM sleep. High-frequency gamma power was&#xD;
      higher in AUD than CTL. Our investigators hypothesize that higher REM gamma (indirect marker&#xD;
      of adrenergic activity associated with less effective REM sleep emotional regulation29) will&#xD;
      be associated with impaired mPFC engagement and top-down control of the amygdala in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REM sleep predicts relapse. In another sample of AUD (n=21, 9 female83,84) studied with&#xD;
      multiple PSG across 6 months of recovery, REM sleep tended to be higher in those who later&#xD;
      relapsed, supporting the literature.16,38 These sleep data show 1) abnormal REM sleep in&#xD;
      abstinent AUD (excess amount and high REM sleep frontal gamma power) and 2) our experience in&#xD;
      recruiting and studying PSG in AUD over multiple visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotion regulation in AUD.1 Using fMRI, MPI-Müller-Oehring found evidence for a dysfunctional&#xD;
      prefrontal emotion regulation system in abstinent AUD (n=26). Figure 2 (upper panel) shows no&#xD;
      midbrain-limbic response to neutral color-word Stroop interference1 in AUD and CTL, but a&#xD;
      significantly enhanced response to alcohol and emotion words in AUD (but not CTL). The&#xD;
      opposite pattern occurred for prefrontal activation (lower panel): CTL activated prefrontal&#xD;
      control regions to overcome interference from emotion and alcohol word content, but AUD&#xD;
      showed a blunted dlPFC response. This downregulation of the frontal monitoring system is key&#xD;
      to the emotion regulation deficit in AUD. Our investigators will use this fMRI task to test&#xD;
      whether emotion dysregulation in AUD is linked to dysfunctional REM sleep and particularly&#xD;
      enhanced prefrontal gamma EEG activity. Craving: Frontal hypoactivation together with&#xD;
      alcohol-sensitized midbrain-limbic hyperactivation, that overlapped with that to negative&#xD;
      emotion, represent a neural mechanism through which emotional dysregulation can lead to&#xD;
      alcohol craving. Accordingly, in AUD, higher alcohol craving correlated with higher&#xD;
      alcohol-related mesolimbic activity (r=.39, p=.025) and blunted emotion-related prefrontal&#xD;
      (dlPFC) activity (r=.45, pFDR-corrected=.011).1 Emotion reactivity in AUD.17 Figure 3, upper&#xD;
      panel: Viewing alcohol and emotion pictures during fMRI activated mesolimbic-corticostriatal&#xD;
      regions, in particular the parahippocampal gyus, amygdala, thalamus, dorsal striatum, insula,&#xD;
      and occipital regions and fusiform face area (FFA). Activation of thalamostriatal reward&#xD;
      regions overlapped for emotion and alcohol pictures, providing a neurofunctional link for&#xD;
      processing of emotion and reward. Lower panel: Compared to CTL, AUD showed blunted insula and&#xD;
      PFC reactivity to emotion although they clearly processed emotional faces (e.g. activated&#xD;
      fusiform face area, parahippocampal, and lingual regions, even more than in CTL). Craving: In&#xD;
      AUD, craving correlated with greater striatal activity to alcohol pictures (Rho=.71, p=.048);&#xD;
      also see 85. These task-activated fMRI pilot data show 1) the overlapping alcohol-emotion&#xD;
      brain systems in AUD, 2) poor frontal top-down emotion regulation and altered mesolimbic&#xD;
      emotion reactivity are potential pathways to craving and relapse.&#xD;
