    <textblock>
      An open-label, dose-ranging influenza challenge study in healthy adult volunteers to&#xD;
      determine the optimal infection dose and safety of a recombinant H3N2 (A/Texas/&#xD;
      A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2, clade 3C3a) influenza strain. The goal of this study is to find a&#xD;
      challenge virus dose that is safe and can achieve a symptomatic influenza Attack Rate (AR)&#xD;
      that will be sufficiently high for utilization in future vaccine or intervention studies. The&#xD;
      optimal dose of the three considered is broadly defined as the minimum challenge virus dose&#xD;
      that elicits the highest AR without meeting safety-stopping criteria. Additionally, viral&#xD;
      recovery, clinical symptoms, and immune responses over the post-challenge period will be&#xD;
      described by challenge dose group. This study will last for up to 1 year depending upon the&#xD;
      number of challenge cohorts enrolled given the adaptive dose-escalation design. The&#xD;
      populations are healthy males and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding females aged = 18 and &lt; 46&#xD;
      years of age with a serum HAI antibody titer of &lt;/=1:40 against influenza A/Texas/71/2017&#xD;
      (H3N2), clade 3C3a.The study will enroll and challenge up to 106 (plus 8 shams) healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers with the H3N2 (A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2), clade 3C3a) influenza virus challenge&#xD;
      strain. The primary objectives are: 1) To determine the optimal infectious dose1 of a&#xD;
      recombinant influenza virus (A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2), clade 3C3a) to be used as a clinical&#xD;
      challenge strain in future vaccine efficacy or intervention studies as assessed by viral&#xD;
      shedding and clinical symptoms. 2) To describe viral detection by quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from study subjects at&#xD;
      baseline and post-challenge. 3) To document clinical symptoms from self-reported surveys and&#xD;
      standardized symptom scales at baseline and post-challenge.&#xD;

      years of age with a serum HAI antibody titer of &lt;/=1:40 against influenza A/Texas/71/2017&#xD;
      (H3N2), clade 3C3a.The study will enroll and challenge up to 106 (plus 8 shams) healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers with the H3N2 (A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2), clade 3C3a) influenza virus challenge&#xD;
      strain. Subjects will be pre-screened for study inclusion to have serological HAI antibody&#xD;
      titers of &lt;/=1:40 against the clinical challenge strain. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially into dosing cohorts and will be randomly assigned to receive a single&#xD;
      dose of either placebo (sham inoculum) or a virus dose between 104 to 106 Median Issue&#xD;
      Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) (in an allocation of 1:12 to 1:17). Dose titration will be&#xD;
      conducted under an adaptive escalation schedule whereby dosing will start at the lowest dose&#xD;
      104 TCID50 and only escalate to the next dose if a pre-determined infection and symptomatic&#xD;
      attack rate are not met and the dose is determined to be safe and no pre-defined halting rule&#xD;
      is met. The attack rate (AR), defined as the percentage of subjects meeting shedding and&#xD;
      symptom criteria for symptomatic influenza virus infection (see clinical case definition&#xD;
      below), will be determined for each challenge dose group in order to identify the optimal&#xD;
      infectious dose (55%-80% AR). This adaptive, dose-ranging approach allows adjustments to&#xD;
      challenge dose group size and escalation dose schedule to be informed by the AR and safety&#xD;
      results. The primary objectives are: 1) To determine the optimal infectious dose1 of a&#xD;
      recombinant influenza virus (A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2), clade 3C3a) to be used as a clinical&#xD;
      challenge strain in future vaccine efficacy or intervention studies as assessed by viral&#xD;
      shedding and clinical symptoms. 2) To describe viral detection by quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from study subjects at&#xD;
      baseline and post-challenge. 3) To document clinical symptoms from self-reported surveys and&#xD;
      standardized symptom scales at baseline and post-challenge. The secondary objectives are: 1)&#xD;
      To assess the safety profile of a live recombinant influenza strain (A/Texas/71/2017 (H3N2),&#xD;
      clade 3C3a) following challenge in healthy adult volunteers. 2) To describe the host serum&#xD;
      antibody responses at baseline and post-challenge. 3) To describe&#xD;
      anti-Hemagglutination(HA)-stalk antibody titer at baseline and post-challenge.&#xD;
