      The objective of this study was the collection and testing of clinical samples to determine&#xD;
      the clinical performance in terms of diagnostic accuracy measured by specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity of the Access anti-Hepatitis C Virus (anti-HCV) assay on the DxI 9000 Access&#xD;
      Immunoassay Analyzer. The Design Input Document (DID) indicates performance requirements and&#xD;
      minimum target enrollment numbers (based on those in the CTS) of blood donor, hospitalized&#xD;
      patient and known HCV antibody (Ab) positive samples for novel anti-HCV assays. A secondary&#xD;
      objective was to determine the false initial reactive rate (IRR) of the Access anti-HCV&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involved a multicenter, prospective and retrospective collection of samples, and&#xD;
      testing of samples with the investigational Access anti-HCV assay. Subject sample enrollment&#xD;
      was targeted to be approximately 8,000 specimens including approximately 6,000 blood donors&#xD;
      and 1,500 hospitalized individuals for the specificity populations and 500 confirmed HCV Ab&#xD;
      positive patients for the sensitivity population, required by European Union's Common&#xD;
      Technical Specification for clinical validation of in vitro diagnostic medical devices and&#xD;
      marketing needs to align with competitor submissions. Retrospective collection included HCV&#xD;
      Ab positive genotyped samples from existing vendor collections meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples collected were anonymized, leftover, remnant samples and therefore member state&#xD;
      or Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee approval was not required.&#xD;
      Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for sample antibody status determined&#xD;
      by a CE-marked anti-HCV assay (Abbott ARCHITECT anti-HCV assay for hospitalized patient and&#xD;
      positive samples or Abbott PRISM HCV assay for blood donor samples) and Immunoblot testing&#xD;
      with FUJIREBIO INNO-LIA HCV Score, if necessary. HCV RNA Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or&#xD;
      genotyping was requested or was available on all Immunoblot positive samples for further&#xD;
      characterization, but these results were not used to determine final antibody status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of hospitalized patient samples (target 700/1500) and the majority of positive HCV&#xD;
      Ab samples were collected and stored frozen prior to testing. A targeted portion of 800&#xD;
      hospitalized patient samples, 30 known positive samples and all blood donor samples were&#xD;
      collected and tested fresh. Fresh blood donor and fresh hospitalized patient samples were&#xD;
      used to determine false Initial Reactive Rate (IRR).&#xD;
