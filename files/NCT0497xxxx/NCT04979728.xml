      The study will assess the feasibility of self-collected DBS at home for adherence monitoring&#xD;
      in PWH by comparing self- vs. clinic-collected DBS for the quantification of TFV-DP and&#xD;
      FTC-TP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare self vs. clinic collection of dried blood spots (DBS) for the quantification&#xD;
           of tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and emtricitabine-triphosphate (FTC-TP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the acceptability, capability and preference of at-home DBS self-collection.&#xD;

      Persons with HIV (PWH) receiving care at the uchealth infectious diseases clinic will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study at a routine clinic visit where blood collection is planned as standard&#xD;
      of care. Once consented, demographic and clinical data will be obtained. Clinical data that&#xD;
      will be collected from participant and medical records will include: age, gender, race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, medication history, duration of ARV therapy, visit labs (e.g., hematocrit, CD4&#xD;
      count, HIV VL), and self-reported adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood from venipuncture will be collected in EDTA at the time of their clinic visit, which&#xD;
      will be transported to the Colorado Antiviral Pharmacology Laboratory (CAVP) for dried blood&#xD;
      spot (DBS) processing, storage, and analysis. In addition, participants will be provided with&#xD;
      necessary materials for at-home self-collection of DBS, including 903 Protein Saver Cards,&#xD;
      lancets, gauzes, pre-packed alcohol swabs, band aids, storage bags, desiccant and pre-paid,&#xD;
      pre-addressed mailing envelopes for the self-collection (supplies for 3 attempts will be&#xD;
      provided). They will receive a short, in-person training for sample collection, handling and&#xD;
      mailing (including a web-accessible instructional video and an instructional handout that the&#xD;
      participant can view at their leisure). Participants will also be provided with a short paper&#xD;
      questionnaire to respond to at home, which will investigate preference, acceptability and&#xD;
      capability of DBS self-collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to spot 2-3 drops of blood onto a provided DBS card within 24&#xD;
      hours of their clinic visit, discarding the first drop of blood. Collection date and time&#xD;
      will be documented on the DBS card. Verification of collection time by research personnel&#xD;
      will be done via FaceTime or timestamped video of DBS self-collection (i.e., directly&#xD;
      observed self-collection). The rationale for self-collecting DBS within 24 hours of the&#xD;
      clinic visit is TFV-DP concentrations are expected to be comparable given the 17 day&#xD;
      half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After spotting, participants will allow the DBS card to dry for at least 2 hours (up to&#xD;
      overnight) and will mail the DBS card in the provided pre-addressed mailing envelopes to CAVP&#xD;
      within 24 hours of collection. Upon receipt in CAVP, DBS cards will be stored at -80Â°C until&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Acceptability will be assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM). The AIM consists of four questions. For each question, responses range from 1-5, with 1 = completely disagree and 5 = completely agree. The responses to the four questions are then averaged to get an overall acceptability score.</description>
