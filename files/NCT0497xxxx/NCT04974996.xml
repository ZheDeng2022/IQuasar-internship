    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      loncastuximab tesirine in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,&#xD;
      vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy, and identify the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for the combination therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study in participants with previously untreated&#xD;
      DLBCL, with a dose escalation part followed by dose expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated by loncastuximab tesirine in combination with R CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study participation for each participant is defined as the time from the&#xD;
      date of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow-up period, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period of 6 cycles&#xD;
      (cycles of 3 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits) for up to&#xD;
      approximately 3 years from end-of-treatment (EOT).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female participant aged 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pathologic diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as defined by the 2016&#xD;
             World Health Organization classification (including participants with DLBCL&#xD;
             transformed from indolent lymphoma), or high-grade B cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease as defined by the 2014 Lugano Classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample. (If&#xD;
             tissue block is not available, slides from a FFPE block may be acceptable for&#xD;
             eligibility upon consultation with the Sponsor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate organ function as defined by screening laboratory values within the following&#xD;
             parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^3/μL (off growth factors at least 72 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥75 × 10^3/μL without transfusion in the past 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (4.96 mmol/L), transfusion allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma&#xD;
                  glutamyl transferase (GGT) ≤2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN (participants with known Gilbert's syndrome may have a&#xD;
                  total bilirubin up to ≤3 × ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min by the Cockcroft and Gault equation&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A laboratory assessment may be repeated a maximum of two times during the&#xD;
             Screening period to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥50%, assessed by echocardiography or&#xD;
             cardiac multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception from the time of giving informed consent until at least 9 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug. Men with female partners who are of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from the time&#xD;
             of giving informed consent until at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone&#xD;
        bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or who have not been&#xD;
        postmenopausal (i.e., who have not menstruated at all) for at least one year. A&#xD;
        postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical&#xD;
        cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be&#xD;
        used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
        hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single&#xD;
        FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Highly effective forms of birth control are methods that achieve a failure rate of less&#xD;
        than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Highly effective forms of birth&#xD;
        control include: hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable, patch, intrauterine devices),&#xD;
        male partner sterilization, or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is&#xD;
        the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The double-barrier method (e.g., synthetic condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with&#xD;
        spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal,&#xD;
        post ovulation), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and&#xD;
        spermicide-only are not acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known history of hypersensitivity to or positive serum human anti-drug antibody (ADA)&#xD;
             to a cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) antibody&#xD;

          2. Previous therapy with loncastuximab tesirine, rituximab, anthracycline, or&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known history of hypersensitivity to any component of study treatment (loncastuximab&#xD;
             tesirine and rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone&#xD;
             [R-CHOP])&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous treatment for aggressive lymphoma (with exception of short corticosteroid&#xD;
             course [up to 7 days] for symptom management)&#xD;

&#xD;
