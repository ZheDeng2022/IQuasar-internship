    <textblock>
      This is A non-blinded trial. Oral radioiodine was given 24 hours after the second injection&#xD;
      of rhTSH, and scanning was done 48 hours after the radioiodine administration. Each patient&#xD;
      was scanned first following rhTSH and then scanned after thyroid hormone withdrawal.&#xD;

    <description>rhTSH: rhTSH(0.9 mg) was administered intramuscularly (IM) once daily (qd) for 2 days. Twenty-four hours following the second dose of rhTSH.Oral radioiodine was given 24 hours after the second injection of rhTSH, and scanning was done 48 hours after the radioiodine administration.&#xD;
Thyroid hormone withdrawal: Patients stop taking thyroid hormone for 14 days, and then monitor the level of thyroid stimulating hormone every week. When TSH&gt;30mU/L, an ablative activity of 131I was administered.and scanning was done 48 hours after the radioiodine administration.</description>
