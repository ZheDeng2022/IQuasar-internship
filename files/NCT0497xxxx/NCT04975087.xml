  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by&#xD;
      disorders of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The disease can be seen in systemic&#xD;
      involvement by affecting any organ. It may result in skin, lung and kidney involvement as&#xD;
      well as symptoms such as vasculitis and neuropathy. Patients with PSS often report fatigue as&#xD;
      an important symptom to manage. Fatigue, defined as an overwhelming feeling of fatigue, lack&#xD;
      of energy, and exhaustion, is associated with poor health and functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is a common symptom of pSS. This symptom is the most important cause of loss of&#xD;
      function in patients. It is thought that as a result of fatigue in pSS, decrease in mental&#xD;
      health related to physical activity level and quality of life in patients, sleep problems,&#xD;
      depression and loss of ability to work. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the&#xD;
      occurrence of fatigue among sjogren patients, but its underlying physiological basis has not&#xD;
      been adequately defined. Therefore, it is a complex, multifaceted and poorly understood&#xD;
      symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In population-based studies, approximately 20% of healthy adults report experiencing fatigue,&#xD;
      and this rate rises to 60%-70% among patients with autoimmune disorders. Fatigue is the most&#xD;
      common non-exocrine symptom in pSS, and the prevalence of fatigue disability among patients&#xD;
      with pSS has been reported to be approximately 70%.&#xD;

      In order to evaluate fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome patients, questionnaires such as&#xD;
      FACIT Fatigue Scale, Sjögren's Syndrome EULAR Patient Reporting Index, Fatigue Severity&#xD;
      Scale, Fatigue Multidimensional Assessment Scale and Short Form-36, which are also used in&#xD;
      many disease groups, are used. Although the importance of the effect of fatigue on pSS&#xD;
      patients has been demonstrated in studies, most of the fatigue assessment questionnaires used&#xD;
      are not pSS specific. For this reason, Bowman et al. They developed the Fatigue and&#xD;
      Discomfort Profile - Sikka Symptoms Scale (PROFAD-SSI) to assess multidimensional fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with pSS, considering disease symptoms. PROFAD-SSI is scored from 0 to 7 on an&#xD;
      8-point Likert scale. The 19-item scale evaluates patients in 8 different dimensions: somatic&#xD;
      fatigue, mental fatigue, arthralgia, vascular dysfunction, oral dryness, ocular dryness,&#xD;
      cutaneous and vaginal dryness.&#xD;
