  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare non invasive ventilation to high flow nasal cannula&#xD;
      oxygen for the management of patients admitted with an acute respiratory failure due to an&#xD;
      acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema is a leading cause of acute respiratory distress in&#xD;
      patients admitted in an Emergency Department. With diuretics and nitrite derivative,&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation is the first-line treatment of acute pulmonary oedema recommended by&#xD;
      the European Society of Cardiology. Noninvasive ventilation is able to reduce the respiratory&#xD;
      rate faster than standard oxygen therapy, to improve oxygenation, and some data suggest it&#xD;
      could reduce the mortality rate. NIV may be poorly tolerated in certain patients, in whom it&#xD;
      is associated with failure of treatment and poor outcomes. High-flow nasal cannula heated and&#xD;
      humidified oxygen (HFNO) is a ventilatory support used in ICU and recently introduced in&#xD;
      Emergency Departments. As compared NIV and standard oxygen therapy, HFNO reduces the&#xD;
      mortality rate in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure hospitalized in an ICU.&#xD;
      In addition, in these patients, HFNO is also better tolerated than noninvasive ventilation.&#xD;
      Some data suggested HFNO is superior to standard oxygen therapy in acute pulmonary oedema and&#xD;
      could have a similar clinical effect to NIV. However, there is no research that has compared&#xD;
      tolerance of patients admitted in an ED with acute pulmonary oedema and treated by HFNO or&#xD;
      NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be treated with NIV or HFNO. NIV will be provided with an emergency&#xD;
      and transport ventilator (Monnal T60, Airliquide, Antony, France) and HFNO will be provided&#xD;
      with an AirVO2 device (Fisher and Paykel, New Zealand). Patients will be treated in an&#xD;
      Emergency Department immediately after their admission and their consent. Treatment will be&#xD;
      provided for a minimum of one hour. Tolerance of patients will be measured under treatment&#xD;
      using a comfort numerical scale from 0 - well comfortable to 10 extremely uncomfortable.&#xD;
      Clinical and biological patterns will be also recorded. Patients will be followed from their&#xD;
      inclusion to 28 days after their inclusion.&#xD;
