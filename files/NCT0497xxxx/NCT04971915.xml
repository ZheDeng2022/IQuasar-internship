  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine whether 3months of wearing minimalist footwear causes changes in&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters of the foot and the biomechanical parameters of the foot and lower&#xD;
      limb.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The minimalist footwear represents an alternative style of footwear wearing, which could&#xD;
      allow the foot to move more naturally compared to the footwear wearing in conventional&#xD;
      footwear. That footwear is characterized by no cushioning, wide toe box, zero foot drop, thin&#xD;
      sole (1,5 - 8 mm), low weight, and high flexibility of footwear. This study aims to determine&#xD;
      the effect of minimalist footwear on the foot and lower limb's anthropometric and&#xD;
      biomechanical parameters during long-term wearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a parallel interventional study. The sample size consists of 20&#xD;
      healthy individuals, which will be divided into two groups, experimental and control groups,&#xD;
      by randomization. All participants undergo the initial examination and baseline and final&#xD;
      measurement focused on the foot anthropometry and kinetics and kinematics of the foot and&#xD;
      lower limb during walking. Besides, the experimental group undergoes a 3months intervention&#xD;
      of wearing minimalist footwear, during which the participants will record their movement&#xD;
      behavior by electronic diary.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of wearing the minimalist footwear in recommended progression during the interventional period (3months). The using progression will start at around one hour a day in the first week, then will be increased to fully use (if possible) over the final period according to the participant´s tolerance rate to the footwear wearing. The consultation about the subjective effect of footwear will take place after the first month of wearing. Also, there will be the opportunity to consult any issue connected with footwear or their wearing through the duration of research.</description>
