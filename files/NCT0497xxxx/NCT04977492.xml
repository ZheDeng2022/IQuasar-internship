    <textblock>
      Excessive Lateral Pressure Syndrome (ELPS) is a series of clinical symptoms caused by various&#xD;
      factors, such as patella tilt, adaptive contraction of the Lateral retinacular and unbalanced&#xD;
      Pressure on the medial and Lateral joint surfaces of the patellofemoral. The concept was&#xD;
      first proposed by Ficat in 1977. Patellofemoral pain syndrome has long been lumped together&#xD;
      as widespread pregenitual pain and Patella malalignment syndrome as Patellofemoral pain due&#xD;
      to poor Patella alignment.Kramer et al. found that the main cause of patellofemoral pain and&#xD;
      increased pressure on the lateral patellofemoral surface was excessive pressure on the&#xD;
      lateral retinaculum. Later, this view was accepted by more scholars, and lateral&#xD;
      patellofemoral compression syndrome was gradually regarded as an independent syndrome and&#xD;
      more studies were conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with lateral patella compression syndrome, early manifestations are usually pain&#xD;
      in the soft tissues around the patella. Fulkerson et al. in 1985 found pathological changes&#xD;
      in the nerve fibers in the lateral retinaculum through a pathological study, which is the&#xD;
      basis for early lesions showing only pain in the soft tissues around the patella.As the&#xD;
      disease progresses, uneven pressure on the medial and lateral facets of the patellofemoral&#xD;
      joint will gradually lead to damage of the medial and lateral facets of the articular&#xD;
      cartilage, eventually leading to irreversible damage of the articular cartilage and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatment of lateral compression syndrome is varied, and in recent years, the&#xD;
      most commonly used surgical methods include: incision lysis, percutaneous lysis,&#xD;
      arthroscope-assisted percutaneous lysis, arthroscopic release, etc.These traditional surgical&#xD;
      methods all have obvious complications, such as intra-articular dislocation of patella,&#xD;
      recurrence of lateral compression due to postoperative adhesion of the support band,&#xD;
      patellofemoral joint instability, intra-articular hematoma, etc.Although there are many&#xD;
      surgical treatment methods for lateral compression syndrome, there is still no recognized&#xD;
      standard treatment. Due to the fact that its effect and evaluation criteria cannot be&#xD;
      unified, accurate horizontal comparison cannot be made among different regions and different&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports medicine, Peking University third hospital Guoqing Cui, a professor at the set of the&#xD;
      lateral retinaculum extracapsular release, at the same time in the release of the lateral&#xD;
      retinaculum complete retaining articular capsule and lateral patellofemoral ligament, this&#xD;
      procedure can obviously improve patellofemoral joint trajectory anomalies and significantly&#xD;
      reduce joint surface pressure, at the same time reduce the surgical trauma, try to keep the&#xD;
      original structure,The complication of patellofemoral joint can be greatly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research focuses on 1 January 2015 to December 2018 to the undergraduate course to see a&#xD;
      doctor and accept the lateral retinaculum extracapsular release of 100 patients were&#xD;
      retrospectively study, through the follow-up, compare the preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      radiographic data, clinical manifestations, signs, etc., to evaluate the surgical effect and&#xD;
      explore the pathogenesis of patellar lateral compression syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, to explore the etiology, development and outcome of the disease, is&#xD;
      helpful for the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, avoid the irreversible injury&#xD;
      of the patient's knee joint, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of knee replacement, and save medical resources.At the same time, the external&#xD;
      capsule release of the lateral retinacular joint created by Professor Cui Guoqing will have a&#xD;
      profound impact on the surgical treatment of the lateral retinacular joint.&#xD;
