    <textblock>
      Up to 45 Patients aged 12 to 39 with osteosarcoma (bone cancer) that had recurred in the&#xD;
      lungs and has recently been surgically removed will be enrolled. Patients will receive&#xD;
      OST31-164 infusions every 3 weeks over 48 weeks and be followed after that for 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study in patients (12-39 years) with a&#xD;
      recent history of pulmonary recurrent osteosarcoma that has been completely resected. Planned&#xD;
      enrollment is a maximum of 45 patients who will receive OST31-164 as a single agent every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 48 weeks with 4 doses constituting 1 treatment cycle (12 weeks per cycle). Each&#xD;
      patient will receive treatment at a dose of 1x109 CFU until week 48 or until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient meets any other treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria. Following treatment discontinuation, all patients will enter a 3-year survival&#xD;
      follow-up period. Exploratory evaluation of immune response will be conducted. If available,&#xD;
      tissue from the recent resection will be sent to the COG Biobank for future genomic and&#xD;
      pathologic analysis by the COG.&#xD;
