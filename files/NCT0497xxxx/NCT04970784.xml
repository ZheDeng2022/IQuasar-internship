  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that going to the emergency room is a risk factor for loss of&#xD;
      independence in the elderly. It has been shown that the period following an emergency room&#xD;
      visit without hospitalization is a period of vulnerability for the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional decline, or loss of functional autonomy, of the elderly is associated with an&#xD;
      increase in institutionalization, mortality and costs to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have highlighted the risk factors for functional decline in the elderly, such as&#xD;
      pre-existing functional and cognitive decline, undernutrition, but no model of care has yet&#xD;
      prevented the risk of loss of autonomy after a stay in the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full and early geriatric assessment could prevent functional decline after the emergency&#xD;
      room visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of a dedicated geriatric sector on&#xD;
      the functional decline at 1 month of patients admitted to emergencies without hospitalization&#xD;
      by comparing an intervention group (patient having benefited from the geriatric sector) and a&#xD;
      group witness (&quot;classic&quot; emergency patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of this sector on the number of falls at&#xD;
      home as well as the readmission rate within 1 month of going to the emergency room.&#xD;
