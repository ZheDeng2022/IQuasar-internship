      This prospective cohort study aims to provide the evidence-based clinical guide to help&#xD;
      decide the revaccination doses of hepatitis B vaccine that the high-risk young adults without&#xD;
      hepatitis B seroprotective antibodies (anti-HBs titer&lt;10 mIU/mL) need to take.&#xD;

      Purpose For young adults born after the neonatal hepatitis B immunization program, especially&#xD;
      those who were 20-33 years old after 1987, additional hepatitis B vaccination may have the&#xD;
      benefit of strengthening protection from acute hepatitis B infection among high-risk groups.&#xD;
      However, how many doses are most appropriate for the protection of high-risk groups is still&#xD;
      an issue to be resolved. This study aims to provide the evidence-based clinical guide to help&#xD;
      decide the revaccination doses of hepatitis B vaccine that the high-risk young adults without&#xD;
      hepatitis B seroprotective antibodies (anti-HBs titer&lt;10 mIU/mL) need to take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods From August 2021 to July 2024, the investigator will invite young&#xD;
      adults born in Taiwan over the age of 20 and born after 1987, who have received a full course&#xD;
      of hepatitis B vaccine at least three doses at their infant period. Those who are all&#xD;
      negative for hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) and surface antigens (HBsAg) are&#xD;
      enrolled to 4 groups according to the anti-HBs titer concentration (anti-HBs titer between&#xD;
      2.5-10 mIU/mL is a low concentration, anti-HB titer less than 2.5 mIU/mL is an extreme low&#xD;
      concentration) with one or two doses of hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) administered,&#xD;
      respectively. Each group recruits 60 cases to reach a total of 240 participants. Each&#xD;
      participant was followed for 12 months, and the anti-HBs titer concentration was measured in&#xD;
      0, 7-10 days, 28 days, 24- 28 weeks, and 48-52 weeks. The investigator will calculate the&#xD;
      anti-HBs titer reaction rate and immune response after receiving hepatitis B vaccine(s) at&#xD;
      each stage, and do further univariate and multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results This prospective cohort study can help understand the difference in the&#xD;
      anti-HBs titer response after 1 or 2 revaccination doses by the anti-HBs titer concentration&#xD;
      as well as the two different types of hepatitis B vaccination in childhood It is expected to&#xD;
      provide an important reference for the administration of hepatitis B vaccine in young adults&#xD;
      of high-risk groups.&#xD;
