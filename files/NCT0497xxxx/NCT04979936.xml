      The aim of this study is to compare between early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus&#xD;
      percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by delayed interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy as&#xD;
      regards the operative and postoperative complications&#xD;

      A-Study setting: Department of Surgery, main university hospital, Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Alexandria University, Egypt. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-Study design: Retrospective clinical trial C-Study subjects: The target population are&#xD;
      patients with preoperative diagnosis of grade II acute cholecystitis Those patients were&#xD;
      subjected to surgery either early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or delayed laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy after percutaneous cholecystostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria of the study patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Specific written informed consent approved by our Institution's Ethics Committee was&#xD;
      obtained from all the treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -contraindication to laparoscopy,Refusal of study participation, cirrhosis, grade I or III&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis D-Sample size calculation: a minimum sample size required per group is 88&#xD;
      to detect decline in the proportion of the primary outcome from 20% to 5%, at 5% level of&#xD;
      significance and 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-Sampling technique: By using eligibility criteria, 220 patients that were planned to&#xD;
      undergo laparoscopic Cholecystectomy were randomly selected from the surgery department in&#xD;
      main university hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University. They were randomly&#xD;
      separated into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experiment group: (90 patients) underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by delayed&#xD;
      interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy A control group: (130 patients) underwent early&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All the participants were initially evaluated and re-evaluated&#xD;
      during follow up period of 30 days for the outcome measures. Non blinded trial was done due&#xD;
      to difficulty in using blinding in operative intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: every patient in the study sample was subjected to the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigations ( pre and postoperative):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory: WBC, CRP, lever functions Radiologic imaging: ultrasonography, CT abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention: An experiment group: underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by&#xD;
           delayed interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A control group: underwent early laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surgical Technique: laparoscopic cholecysctomy Postoperative Course: post-operative&#xD;
           complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Outcome Measurement and Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow up period: both groups were re-evaluated at 1, 2, 6 months. They were&#xD;
                evaluated for the positive and negative outcome measures. There were no cases lost&#xD;
                to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Outcome measures that were assessed after the follow up period were:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary outcome measures: operative and postoperative complications as conversion,&#xD;
                biliary injury, bowel injury, they were assessed by clavien dindo classification&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Outcome measures: ASA score, Tokyo score and some investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative&#xD;
      variables were summarized using mean and standard deviation after data exploration using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov- Smirnov test. Qualitative variables were described using number and percent.&#xD;
      Associations between the two groups and other categorical variables were assessed using&#xD;
      Chi-square test (Fisher or Monte Carlo). Comparisons between the two groups as regards the&#xD;
      quantitative variables were assessed using Student t-test. All Statistical tests were done at&#xD;
      5% level of Significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk estimates were calculated as Relative risk, Absolute risk reduction, Number needed to&#xD;
      treat and population Attributable Risk percentage to detect the risk of development of the&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative complications in the intervention and control group.&#xD;
