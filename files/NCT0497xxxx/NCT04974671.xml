      This Phase II trial will evaluate progression-free survival after Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy to oligoprogressive (1-5) lesions in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients on any&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen with last dose of systemic therapy within 3&#xD;
      months prior to trial enrollment. Alternative local therapy (including but not limited to&#xD;
      metastectomy or radiofrequency ablation) to one or more of the oligoprogressive lesions is&#xD;
      allowed provided at least one of the lesions is receiving Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy will be delivered on nonconsecutive days (if &gt;1&#xD;
      fraction) for a total of 1-5 fractions depending on anatomic site at the treating physicians&#xD;
      discretion. Treatment to multiple sites can be delivered sequentially or concurrently, at the&#xD;
      treating physicians discretion. Patients will undergo response-assessment imaging (CT&#xD;
      chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast and/or PET CT scan and/or MRI plus or minus contrast),&#xD;
      and response to treatment will be measured via RECIST. The acute and long-term toxicity will&#xD;
      be monitored and graded per CTCAE 5.0 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/). Patients will continue on&#xD;
      the same immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen during Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy planning and delivery, and after completion of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy&#xD;
      until progression of disease as defined by RECIST criteria. The immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor-containing regimen can be continued beyond RECIST progression of disease if the&#xD;
      treating physician feels that a patient will continue to benefit. Each eligible patient will&#xD;
      be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board in the presence of medical and radiation&#xD;
      oncology and will be seen in consultation in a Yale-affiliated radiation oncology department&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Is receiving TKI as part of their most recent systemic therapy regimen for their&#xD;
                  mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Has brain-only oligoprogression. Subjects with brain and systemic&#xD;
                  oligoprogression can still be considered, however treatment of brain metastases&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or&#xD;
                  any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 2 weeks of the first protocol&#xD;
                  treatment. The use of low-dose steroids for management of chronic conditions is&#xD;
                  allowed (up to 12mg prednisone orally per day or the equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Has had prior radiation therapy within 2 weeks of the first protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active&#xD;
                  treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially&#xD;
                  curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3&#xD;
                  months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a&#xD;
                  syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects&#xD;
                  with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an example of an&#xD;
                  exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators&#xD;
                  or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Those with a&#xD;
                  history of hypothyroidism who are now stable on hormone replacement will not be&#xD;
                  excluded. Those with Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, current&#xD;
                  pneumonitis or evidence of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;

              10. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
                  the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through&#xD;
                  120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
                  [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Has serious medical comorbidities precluding radiotherapy. These include subjects&#xD;
                  with lung metastases with interstitial lung disease, connective tissue diseases&#xD;
                  such as lupus or scleroderma, Crohn's disease in subjects where the GI tract will&#xD;
                  receive radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Substantial overlap with a previously treated radiation volume. Prior&#xD;
