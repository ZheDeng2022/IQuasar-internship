  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BRAVE study is a randomized controlled trial carried out by the Northwest Portland Area&#xD;
      Indian Health Board and the mHealth Impact Lab. The team recruited 2,330 AI/AN teens and&#xD;
      young adults nationwide (15-24 years old) via social media channels and text message and&#xD;
      enrolled 1,030 to participate in the 9-month study. Teens and young adults enrolled in the&#xD;
      study received either: 8 weeks of BRAVE text messages designed to improve mental health,&#xD;
      help-seeking skills, and promote cultural pride and resilience; or 8 weeks of Science&#xD;
      Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) text messages, designed to elevate and re-affirm&#xD;
      Native voices in science, technology, engineering, math and medicine; and then received the&#xD;
      other set of messages. Retention in the study was high, with 87% of participants completing&#xD;
      both BRAVE and STEM intervention arms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 2.1 million self-identified American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN&#xD;
      or Native) youth under the age of 24 living in the United States. Like many teens, AI/AN&#xD;
      youth report frequent technology use and poor mental health outcomes, including trauma,&#xD;
      stress, anxiety, depression, and suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support Native youth, the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) launched We&#xD;
      R Native in 2012, a holistic health resource for Native youth, by Native youth&#xD;
      (www.weRnative.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this broad reach and utilization is promising, more focused research is needed to&#xD;
      better understand the acceptability and usability of the mental health messages delivered by&#xD;
      We R Native, and systematic research is needed to determine whether We R Native's messages&#xD;
      actually improve mental health and resilience, teach mental health skills (like coping&#xD;
      skills, mindfulness, help-seeking, and use of suicide prevention chat-lines, etc.), and&#xD;
      promote healthy social norms - all protective factors against suicide and substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Housed at the Colorado School of Public Health, the mission of the mHealth Impact Lab is to&#xD;
      facilitate the rapid and rigorous development, implementation, and evaluation of mobile and&#xD;
      digital technology for health promotion and disease prevention that address inequalities in&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research teams tested whether We R Native's BRAVE messages improved self-efficacy and&#xD;
      behaviors related to mental health, resilience, and cultural pride; as well as the relative&#xD;
      impact of user engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRAVE study will improve the relevance, efficacy, and utilization of mental health&#xD;
      resources delivered through We R Native' messaging channels - reaching a high-risk,&#xD;
      underserved population - and will create new mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      mHealth interventions. Both teams are committed to sharing resultant data collection tools&#xD;
      and processes with those working in the field.&#xD;
