  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension had higher&#xD;
      level of perceived stress, used maladaptive coping strategies and poor health-related quality&#xD;
      of life. Therefore, stress management program was applied to reduce their perceived stress,&#xD;
      improve their coping strategies, improve their health-related quality of life and&#xD;
      psychological health of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension in&#xD;
      current study. The main objectives of the current study were to observe the effects of stress&#xD;
      management program on perceived stress, coping strategies and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      using pre-experimental research design. Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and&#xD;
      hypertension were selected through purposive sampling technique to apply the eclectic&#xD;
      approach of the stress management program. Total 110 patients with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension completed the program from 114 patients who gave inform consent for&#xD;
      participation in the first session. Perceived stress scale, WHOQOL and Coping strategies&#xD;
      questionnaire were administered at the pre and post-levels of the program. Further, base line&#xD;
      of targeted domains variables was also filled from the participants at pre, mid and&#xD;
      post-levels to access the efficacy of the program which was formulated according to previous&#xD;
      research data by the researcher. The stress Management program consisted of 10 session which&#xD;
      were delivered to eight groups (diabetic and Hypertensive) in five weeks. Each session had&#xD;
      the duration 90 minutes and two sessions were conducted in one week.&#xD;
