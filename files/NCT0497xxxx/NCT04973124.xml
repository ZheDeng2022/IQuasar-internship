    <textblock>
      Older patients are more prone to adverse cognitive outcomes such as postoperative delirium&#xD;
      (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Both conditions are associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of death, functional decline, and health care costs. The presence of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system has detrimental effects on the&#xD;
      regulation of neurotransmitter signaling in different areas of the brain, especially the&#xD;
      hippocampus, ultimately resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. Neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies have provided important information on the structural and functional networks&#xD;
      involved in the pathogenesis of POD and POCD. Strong evidence has shown a decrease in the&#xD;
      integrity of the default mode network (DMN), along a continuum from normal aging to mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2&#xD;
      adrenergic agonist with sedative and analgesic properties but minimal respiratory effects.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that dexmedetomidine reduces serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      POCD. The expected results are to analyze the change in the integrity of the DMN from the&#xD;
      preoperative period to the first weeks after discharge given by the two anesthetic strategies&#xD;
      (SEVO vs SEVODEX). In addition, it seeks to evaluate (1) Changes in the integrity of the DMN&#xD;
      at 3 months. (2) Modulation of structural changes in white matter integrity as measured by&#xD;
      DTI. (3) Patient performance in specific cognitive function tests and serum inflammation&#xD;
      biomarkers between the pre- and postoperative period. For the analysis, the Generalized&#xD;
      Linear Model (GLM) will be used, in which the integrity of the DMN is the dependent variable.&#xD;
      As predictors will use the anesthetic groups (SEVO and SEVODEX) and the measurement time&#xD;
      (preoperative, 1 to 3 weeks after discharge and 3 months later as levels). With this work we&#xD;
      aim to provide a mechanistic explanation of the observed neuroprotective effects of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine in anesthesia protocols for elderly patients. Furthermore, this work will&#xD;
      possibly promote functional connectivity as a possible clinical biomarker of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in this vulnerable population.&#xD;

      Cognitive impairment after anesthesia in older patients The average age of the world&#xD;
      population is rapidly increasing as is the number of elderly patients who undergo surgery.&#xD;
      According to projections of the last census, the Chilean population is also undergoing a&#xD;
      process of demographic ageing. Elder patients are more prone to adverse cognitive outcomes&#xD;
      such as post-operative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The&#xD;
      observed overall incidence of POD and POCD is 40% and 10% respectively and both can represent&#xD;
      transient or permanent brain damage. Both conditions are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      death, functional decline, and health care costs. POD is an acute and transient condition&#xD;
      that occurs during the first few days after surgery. In contrast, POCD manifests with more&#xD;
      subtle deficits in memory, attention, and cognition over a much longer period of time (months&#xD;
      to years). Even though the increase in age and the degree of frailty are well known risk&#xD;
      factors for adverse postoperative cognitive outcomes, the etiology of these conditions&#xD;
      remains poorly understood and most likely involves a combination of patient, surgical, and&#xD;
      anesthetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical trauma and inflammatory response Several studies in animals and humans have shown&#xD;
      that surgical trauma triggers immune and inflammatory responses that can potentially generate&#xD;
      neuroinflammation and degeneration. Neuroinflammation is a localized inflammation occurring&#xD;
      in both the peripheral and central nervous system in response to trauma, neurodegeneration,&#xD;
      bacterial or viral infection, autoimmunity and toxins. The pathogenesis of surgery-induced&#xD;
      neuroinflammation involve the release of biomolecules known as damage-associated molecular&#xD;
      patterns (DAMPs) such as the high molecular group box 1 protein (HMGB1). The various DAMPs&#xD;
      molecules released activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways in bone marrow&#xD;
      derived monocytes20. The activated monocytes increase the activity and expression of&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase 2 isozyme (COX-2), expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta&#xD;
      (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). These pro-inﬂammatory&#xD;
      cytokines promote further release of HMGB1 from injured cells, further activation of&#xD;
      monocytes, and finally disruption of the blood brain barrier allowing pro-inﬂammatory&#xD;
      mediators to enter the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that the magnitude of postoperative cognitive impairment is&#xD;
      strongly associated with the levels of pain and inflammation. Major surgeries, like cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and major orthopedic surgery, have been associated with POCD in up to 50% of&#xD;
      patients. Regarding memory formation and brain cognitive processes, the presence of&#xD;
      pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in the central nervous system have detrimental effects on the&#xD;
      regulation of neurotransmitter signaling in different brain areas, especially the&#xD;
      hippocampus, ultimately resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. For&#xD;
      example, the hippocampus is readily affected by pro-inﬂammatory factors, which break the&#xD;
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-to- N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid or&#xD;
      N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) balance in glutamatergic synapsis, disrupting the process of&#xD;
      long-term potentiation, and thus the ability to form memories. Additionally, HMGB1 produced&#xD;
      in the brain increases the influx of glutamate in hippocampal neurons, which ultimately&#xD;
      results in glutamate toxicity, neuronal death and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic neurotoxicity Anesthetics induced neurotoxicity has become an area of great&#xD;
      concern in recent decades due to numerous studies showing anaesthetics may promote&#xD;
      neuroapoptosis in immature brains of animals. Although, general anesthetics are normally&#xD;
      considered safe in adults, several studies suggest that anesthetic exposure is associated&#xD;
      with postoperative cognitive dysfunction in adult patients. Most used inhaled general&#xD;
      anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane) are highly lipid-soluble and can rapidly&#xD;
      access the brain in high concentrations. Since they act on many receptors, such as&#xD;
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and NMDA receptors, second messenger systems, enzymes, and even&#xD;
      cytoskeletal components, it is not surprising that they might be involved in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative changes in vulnerable populations, especially after high concentrations and&#xD;
      long exposure times. There is strong evidence in animals to support that exposure to&#xD;
      anesthetics can induce dose-dependent neurotoxicity. Cellular degeneration from isoflurane&#xD;
      exposure have shown to result in altered white matter integrity indicating damage in fiber&#xD;
      tracts, leading to the development of neurological and cognitive deficits. In addition,&#xD;
      volatile anesthetics have been shown to increase concentrations of the β-amyloid protein and&#xD;
      can lead to hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, changes that are paramount in the&#xD;
      cytotoxicity of Alzheimer's disease. Studies using in vitro models have provided consistent&#xD;
      evidence that volatile general anesthetics suppress transmission in different types of&#xD;
      synapses, altering neuronal network excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine neuroprotection Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alfa-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      agonist with sedative and analgesic properties but minimal respiratory effects.&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine produces its sedative effects by acting at the locus coeruleus, analogous to&#xD;
      the natural induction of sleep, and independent of NMDA or GABAA receptors. In intensive care&#xD;
      units, dexmedetomidine's anti-inflammatory, organ-protective, and sympatholytic effects have&#xD;
      been associated to better outcomes when compared to benzodiazepine sedative regimes. A recent&#xD;
      study in septic patients showed that individuals receiving dexmedetomidine had more days free&#xD;
      of brain dysfunction and were less likely to die than those that received lorazepam sedation.&#xD;
      There is also growing evidence of dexmedetomidine organ protective properties in ischemia&#xD;
      reperfusion, inflammation, and traumatic brain injury models. A randomized control trial&#xD;
      reported a 60% reduction of POD after an infusion of dexmedetomidine. Another randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial showed improved cognitive function and quality of life in 3-year survivors,&#xD;
      as well as increasing survival up to 2-years after a low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion in&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. In a recent meta-analysis, dexmedetomidine administration showed an&#xD;
      overall 40% reduction in the risk of POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms of dexmedetomidine are not clear, several&#xD;
      mechanisms have been proposed. In animal models, dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      severity of neuroinflammation, neuro apoptosis, expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and TLR-4,&#xD;
      as well as the reduction of astrocyte and microglial activation. It also has been shown that&#xD;
      it promotes the recovery of neurogenesis in aged mouse in a model of postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Other researchers have suggested that the protective effect may be due to an&#xD;
      inhibitory effect in the gap junctions, which are involved in the integrity of the brain&#xD;
      blood barrier. In addition, dexmedetomidine administration has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      sevoflurane-induced apoptosis in several cortical and subcortical brain regions of neonatal&#xD;
      rats. Human studies have shown that dexmedetomidine reduces serum pro-inﬂammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and POCD compared to saline on postoperative day 1 in patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. A recent study showed a correlation between the level of reduction of&#xD;
      pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and POCD on postoperative day 1, suggesting a link between cytokine&#xD;
      levels and the severity of cognitive dysfunction. The protective effects of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      from cognitive dysfunction in surgical contexts is relatively well established. The main&#xD;
      proposed molecular mechanism of action is believed to be due to a reduction of&#xD;
      neuroinflammation. However, in terms of brain activity patterns, the questions of how&#xD;
      volatile anesthetics are increasing the risk of cognitive dysfunction, and how&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine protects against these risks remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods bring&#xD;
      new opportunities to study neuronal activity and neuroplastic changes of the human brain. In&#xD;
      broad terms, MRI analysis can be separated into structural and functional methods. In terms&#xD;
      of brain structure, a previous study found that patients with white matter abnormalities in&#xD;
      the cerebellum, hippocampi, thalami and the anterior brain, observed using diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI) prior to surgery, were associated with a higher incidence and severity of&#xD;
      delirium. In a follow-up study of the same patients performed one year after surgery, the&#xD;
      authors found that white matter abnormalities of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes&#xD;
      were associated with delirium severity Although, the evidence is still scarce and the results&#xD;
      of previous studies have shown inconsistencies between MRI structural markers and clinical&#xD;
      findings, the possibility of being able to observe direct biomarkers of cerebrovascular and&#xD;
      neurodegenerative features of brain damage appear as a valuable approach to improve our&#xD;
      understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind POD and POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional connectivity and the Default mode network In addition to structural analysis, MRI&#xD;
      allows for the study of the dynamics of the functioning brain. At rest, specific brain areas&#xD;
      show coherent activation, measured as the correlation of their Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent&#xD;
      (BOLD) signal. The most prominent of these networks is the Default Mode Network (DMN), which&#xD;
      arises spontaneously in normally functioning brains when at rest. The DMN comprises a&#xD;
      collection of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), parietal cortex, and the&#xD;
      hippocampus. This network is particularly relevant for aging and dementia since DMN&#xD;
      structures are vulnerable to atrophy, deposition of the amyloid protein, and generally show a&#xD;
      reduced glucose metabolism. Neuroimaging studies have provided important information about&#xD;
      the functional networks involved in POD and POCD pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid evidence has shown a decreased in the integrity of the DMN (reduced functional&#xD;
      connectivity) along a continuum from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and to&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. However, in the context of post-operative cognitive decline, previous&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies have focused on finding patient's features as predictors of POD and&#xD;
      POCD, leaving aside the possible effect that the anesthesia technique could have on the&#xD;
      surgery-induced disruption of the DMN and its link to cognitive impairment. Here we propose&#xD;
      to study the neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine in terms of neuroinflammation but also&#xD;
      in terms of the preservation of the integrity of functional and structural connectivity in a&#xD;
      brain network known to be affected in patients with cognitive impairment.&#xD;
