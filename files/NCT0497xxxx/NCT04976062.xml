  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the IMPACTavi prospective cohort study is to test feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      clinically indicated intravascular coronary imaging with NIRS-IVUS in addition to routine&#xD;
      coronary angiography in patients scheduled for TAVI, to improve assessment of CAD severity in&#xD;
      this challenging group of patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequent in patients referred for transcatheter&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement (TAVI) and there is evidence for a subsequent prognostic impairment.&#xD;
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is believed to improve prognosis in selected cases,&#xD;
      which is why current guidelines recommend PCI to be considered in case of coronary artery&#xD;
      diameter stenosis &gt; 70% in proximal segments. Beyond those cases, selection is hampered by&#xD;
      inherent shortcoming of the assessment of CAD severity by angiography alone as well as&#xD;
      clinical and complex hemodynamic interactions between both pathologies. In patients with CAD&#xD;
      alone, the FDA-cleared near-infrared spectroscopy and intravascular imaging (NIRS-IVUS) dual&#xD;
      imaging catheter (Indfraredx, Inc., Bedford, USA) has proven the ability to reliably measure&#xD;
      lipid plaque burden as well as to identify patients and plaques at increased risk for future&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events. NIRS-IVUS imaging offers the unique possibility to improve&#xD;
      angiographic CAD severity assessment in patients referred for TAVI, avoiding the influence of&#xD;
      hemodynamic interactions and pathophysiological overlap between CAD and severe AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMPACTavi trial is designed as a prospective, non-randomized cohort study to investigate&#xD;
      whether NIRS-IVUS-derived lesion characteristics will allow identification of patients likely&#xD;
      to suffer adverse clinical events during clinical follow-up after TAVI. Patients with severe&#xD;
      aortic stenosis will be qualified for enrollment if routine coronary angiography during&#xD;
      diagnostic workup before TAVI shows evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one&#xD;
      native vessel without prior stent implantation and at least one lesion requiring NIRS-IVUS&#xD;
      imaging for clinical indications, and if at 30mm of total NIRS-IVUS pullback length in&#xD;
      sufficient quality for offline analysis have been obtained. Clinical indication, technique&#xD;
      and timing of PCI and TAVI will be at the discretion of the interdisciplinary heart-team. The&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed during clinical follow-up out to 24 months.&#xD;
      Findings from NIRS-IVUS imaging will be analyzed on a patient- and lesion-level, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate correlations of high- vs. low-risk lesion characteristics to the incidence of&#xD;
      patient- and lesion-level MACE.&#xD;

    <description>The NIRS-IVUS technique is an intravascular imaging technique, combining morphological information derived from intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and molecular information on plaque composition, namely its respective lipid-core burden, using spectral differences between cholesterol and collagen, detected by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A combined NIRS-IVUS pullback results in a color-coded map indicating the probability of lipid-rich plaque presence in yellow, co-registered to the corresponding IVUS cross-sections.</description>
