  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries to the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis are common and occur in an estimated 25% of&#xD;
      all rotational ankle fractures. Anatomic reduction of the syndesmosis has been associated&#xD;
      with improved functional outcome as well as decreased rates of posttraumatic arthritis. Both&#xD;
      screw fixation and suture fixation have become accepted standards of care for treatment of&#xD;
      syndesmotic injuries. Recent literature would suggest trends favoring suture fixation over&#xD;
      screw fixation with improved quality of syndesmotic reduction, postoperative range of motion,&#xD;
      and improved maintenance of syndesmotic reduction. However, the evidence remains&#xD;
      heterogeneous, and patient reported outcomes have failed to show a superiority of one method&#xD;
      over the other. Additionally, there have been no studies that demonstrate objective gait&#xD;
      outcomes comparing screw versus suture fixation for syndesmotic injuries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized study. Patients with isolated rotational ankle injuries&#xD;
      with syndesmotic instability will be randomized to either screw fixation or suture fixation&#xD;
      for treatment of their syndesmotic injury. Patients will be followed postoperatively for one&#xD;
      year following surgery with documentation of both clinical outcomes and subjective patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes. Additionally, postoperative gait patterns will be measured and compared&#xD;
      between patients who had syndesmotic injuries treated with screw fixation versus suture&#xD;
      fixation&#xD;

Theoretical maximum and minimum scores are 100 and 0, respectively.</description>
