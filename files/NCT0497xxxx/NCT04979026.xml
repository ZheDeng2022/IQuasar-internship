  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), has long been recognized as the&#xD;
      most frequent complication within 7 to 14 days after orthopedic surgery, especially total&#xD;
      joint arthroplasty. Without prophylactic therapy, the incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      reaches up to 60% following orthopedic surgery. The possible damage to the vessel wall during&#xD;
      the operation, the venous stasis caused by long-term bed rest, and the hypercoagulability of&#xD;
      the blood after the surgery are the 3 main reasons for the formation of DVT. In most cases,&#xD;
      the thrombi resolve spontaneously; however, some of them (about 1~4%) may develop into&#xD;
      symptomatic and even fatal DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle pumping exercise is currently suggested for the patients with joint placement surgery&#xD;
      to prevent the formation of lower-extremity DVT after orthopedic surgery. However, the&#xD;
      compliance of the exercise at home is unclear. In order to remind the patients to the active&#xD;
      ankle exercise and record the executive rate, a device was developed to help the patient to&#xD;
      exercise in the hospital and at home. The device will remind the patient to exercise at&#xD;
      specific time point by verbal and vibrations, and detect the range of motion during the&#xD;
      exercise for further analysis. The aim of this study is to access the effect of a&#xD;
      non-invasive novel device in preventing the formation of lower limb DVT. Maximum venous&#xD;
      outflow, maximum venous capacity, and blood rheology were measured and the incidence of DVT&#xD;
      was recorded for the data analysis.&#xD;

      Background. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has long been recognized as the most frequent&#xD;
      complication that occurs 7-14 days after total knee replacement (TKR). Physical therapy,&#xD;
      including active ankle pumping exercises and intermittent pneumatic compression, is suggested&#xD;
      for the prevention of DVT. However, the exercise implementation rate is not clear,&#xD;
      particularly at home. In order to remind the patients to exercise after TKR, a watch with&#xD;
      voice and vibration alarms at the set time was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The first aim of this study was to compare the effect of active ankle movement with&#xD;
      and without reminders on the prevention of DVT. The second aim was to compare the difference&#xD;
      in the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression and active ankle movement on the&#xD;
      prevention of DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Methods. The patients were divided into three&#xD;
      groups according to the therapeutic protocols. The patients in group 1 conducted active ankle&#xD;
      pumping without any reminders, those in group 2 underwent intermittent pneumatic compression,&#xD;
      and those in group 3 conducted active ankle pumping with a regular watch alarm. The&#xD;
      parameters of blood flow, namely peak flow velocity and flow volume, in the bilateral common&#xD;
      femoral vein and popliteal vein on the 1st, 3rd, and 14th days after surgery were measured&#xD;
      using the echo technique, as an index to evaluate the effect of DVT prevention among the&#xD;
      three groups.&#xD;

    <description>If the peak blood flow, flow volume, and blood echo image were the same as that of stasis, but the contour of the vein was incompressible under a slight compression, the cases were recorded as deep venous thrombosis.</description>
