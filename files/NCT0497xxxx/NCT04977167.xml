  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, repeat-dose, non-randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity and establish a recommended dose of&#xD;
      HG146 administered orally (PO) alone (Part 1) or co-administered (Part 2) with PD-（L）1&#xD;
      inhibitor in subjects with refractory/relapsed solid tumors or Lymphoma. Part 1 consists of a&#xD;
      dose escalation phae,Part2 consists of a dose escalation phase and a cohort expansion phase.&#xD;
      In Part 1, escalating doses of HG146 will be evaluated as guided by the &quot;3+3&quot; approach. In&#xD;
      Part 2A, escalating doses of HG146 in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor will be evaluated as&#xD;
      guided by the &quot;3+3&quot; approach. In Part 2B, subjects will receive a single dose level of HG146&#xD;
      as identified based on data from Part 2, in combination with PD-(L)1 inhibitor . A total of&#xD;
      approximately 96 subjects will be enrolled in this study, approximately 36 for dose&#xD;
      escalation cohorts, and approximately 60 in the expansion cohorts.&#xD;
