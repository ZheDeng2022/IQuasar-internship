      This study is to collect and summarize the cases of airway obstruction after anterior&#xD;
      cervical operation through retrospective case analysis, to explore the risk factors of airway&#xD;
      obstruction after anterior cervical operation, to provide the basis for the construction of&#xD;
      evaluation system and provide reference for the nursing of postoperative complications.&#xD;

      1. Research objects The clinical data of patients who underwent anterior cervical surgery&#xD;
           in our department from 2010 to 2019 were retrospectively collected. The cases of&#xD;
           patients who underwent reoperation and those who did not underwent reoperation and the&#xD;
           causes of airway obstruction were analyzed. They were evaluated by ward doctors,&#xD;
           anesthesiologists and ward nurses according to clinical standards. The following&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. Inclusion criteria: patients undergoing&#xD;
           anterior cervical surgery from 2010 to 2019; Age ≥ 18 years old. Exclusion criteria: age&#xD;
           ≤ 18 years old; Patients with neck tumor, infection and goiter; Neck soft tissue and&#xD;
           bone structure deformity; Ankylosing spondylitis; Oral and laryngopharyngeal diseases;&#xD;
           Hysteria or mental illness; Postoperative anesthesia can not be normal resuscitation&#xD;
           patients; Nervous system diseases: such as Parkinson's disease. Patients with airway&#xD;
           obstruction due to epidural hematoma underwent reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grouping of patients:①Case group: patients who underwent anterior cervical spine surgery&#xD;
           from 2010 to 2019 and had airway obstruction and re intubation in a short time after&#xD;
           surgery. ②Control group: among the patients who never had reoperation of postoperative&#xD;
           airway obstruction, the number of cases closest to this time point was collected&#xD;
           according to the maximum matching ratio of 1:4 according to the operation time of&#xD;
           patients in case group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research methods The exposure history of various possible risk factors in the past was&#xD;
           collected by inquiring and consulting medical records. Through literature review, the&#xD;
           most direct cause of airway obstruction after anterior cervical surgery is the&#xD;
           compression of trachea caused by neck hematoma, the increase of respiratory secretions,&#xD;
           airway obstruction, dyspnea and even asphyxia. In the research of Li Haoxi, Chen&#xD;
           Xiongsheng and other experts, it is pointed out that the age, smoking, body mass index,&#xD;
           hypertension, operation mode, operation time and number of operation segments of&#xD;
           patients have a significant impact on the airway obstruction after anterior cervical&#xD;
           surgery, which is consistent with some foreign related reports. The risk of airway&#xD;
           obstruction in smokers and those aged 60 or above increased significantly compared with&#xD;
           those who did not smoke and &lt;45 years old. Meanwhile, the incidence rate of chronic&#xD;
           pharyngitis in smokers was significantly higher than that in non-smokers. With the&#xD;
           increase of smoking time and age, chronic pharyngitis was also a high-risk factor.&#xD;
           According to the statistical results of the study, the incidence of re intubation of&#xD;
           airway obstruction after single segment anterior cervical surgery was 0.3%, and the&#xD;
           incidence of airway obstruction was 4.97% with the increase of surgical segments.&#xD;
           Studies suggest that prevention of hematoma, intraoperative clear exposure and thorough&#xD;
           hemostasis are the first factors, and treatment of possible active bleeding. In the&#xD;
           study, a case of hematoma in a patient with hypertension was taken as an example to&#xD;
           point out that patients with hypertension will have the risk of bleeding again after&#xD;
           operation. When the patient has obvious obesity, the neck is short and thick in&#xD;
           appearance, and tissue edema is easy to occur after operation, resulting in drainage&#xD;
           affected. ①preoperative assessment: age, gender, height, weight (BMI), smoking history,&#xD;
           drinking history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pharyngitis, neck&#xD;
           circumference and sleep monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraoperative factors: operation mode, operation segment location, operation time,&#xD;
                intraoperative blood loss, anesthesia recovery time. ③Postoperative evaluation:&#xD;
                respiratory condition, blood oxygen, blood pressure, drainage volume, limb muscle&#xD;
                strength, expectoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore the relationship between risk factors and airway obstruction, the&#xD;
      exposure proportion of each index in case group and control group was compared.&#xD;
