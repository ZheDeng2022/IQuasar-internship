  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease(DKD) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease across the world. Early identification of DKD is vitally important for the effective&#xD;
      prevention and control of it. However, the available indicators are doubtful in the early&#xD;
      diagnosis of DKD. This study aims to develop a novel system of multidimensional network&#xD;
      biomarkers (MDNBs) to estimating early diabetic nephropathy, and further validating the&#xD;
      performance of the novel systemin in prediction of the risk for early diabetic nephropathy by&#xD;
      a nested case-control study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of more than 5 years of diabetes without DKD were recruited. At the&#xD;
      baseline visit, the patients' serum, plasma and urine were collected after obtaining informed&#xD;
      patient consent. Simultaneously, the basic information, anthropometric indicators (including&#xD;
      height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure), past history, family&#xD;
      history, menstrual history, birth history, medication history, lifestyle of the patients were&#xD;
      registered, and the corresponding laboratory examination and auxiliary examination were&#xD;
      carried out according to the diagnostic process. All data and data were entered into the&#xD;
      database for later analysis. After 5years of follow up, subjects will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups(the new onset DKD group and the non-DKD group), the base line level of MDNBs were&#xD;
      tested in the two group to validate the performance of the novel MDNBs in in prediction of&#xD;
      the risk for early diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;

    <description>a novel system of multidimensional network biomarkers (MDNBs) based on a widely targeted metabolomics. Our previous study demonstrated that the combination of Linolelaidic Acid (C18:2N6T), L-Dihydroorotic Acid, and Azoxystrobin Acid might serve as a potential multidimensional network biomarkers of DKD. So we create a panel of MDNBs containing these biomakers as primary outcome measure.</description>

        The diagnosis of T2DM in our study complied with the criteria set out by the American&#xD;
        Diabetes Association. The inclusion criteria are as follows: for all patients diagnosed&#xD;
        with T2DM without CKD. After five years of following upï¼Œparticipants were recruited and&#xD;
        then divided into two groups: T2DM group without nephropathy(non-DKD, UACR urinary&#xD;
        albumin/creatinine ratio &lt; 3 mg/mmol) and DKD group with microalbuminuria and&#xD;
        macroalbuminuria (DKD, UACR &gt; 3 mg/mmol)&#xD;
