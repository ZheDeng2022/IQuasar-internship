  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe type and extent of organ specific late adverse&#xD;
      effects in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases and&#xD;
      after surgery for colorectal cancer with involvement of the urinary bladder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study all patients giving written informed consent will be&#xD;
      distributed a questionnaire asking questions on bowel function, urinary function, pain,&#xD;
      sexual function and lymphedema. All these aspects will be investigated using validated&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

        The investigators will prospectively include patients who have undergone surgery at Aarhus&#xD;
        University Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, and Skåne University&#xD;
        Hospital, Malmö. Inclusion in Denmark will start February 2021 and in Sweden Summer 2021.&#xD;
        Inclusion period is 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The HIPEC cohort will be established as a cross-sectional study. For newly operated&#xD;
        patients, inclusion will happen shortly after surgery with prospective questionnaire&#xD;
        follow-ups at 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion. For patients who have undergone CRS+HIPEC&#xD;
        more than 3 months ago, initial inclusion can take place at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60&#xD;
        months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in the PE cohort will be included shortly after surgery with follow-up at 3&#xD;
        months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
