  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalized medicine is a concept in which medical care is individualized to a patient based&#xD;
      on their unique characteristics, including comorbidities, demographics, genetics, and&#xD;
      microbiome. After major surgery, some patients are at increased risk of opioid dependence. By&#xD;
      identifying unique genetic and microbiome markers, clinicians may potentially identify&#xD;
      individual risk factors for opioid dependence. By identifying these high risk patients&#xD;
      early-on, personalized interventions may be applied to these patients in order to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of opioid-dependence.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to identify associations with genetic variants, gut&#xD;
      microbiome, and metabolomics (i.e. exosome profiling) with postoperative opioid use in&#xD;
      surgical patients. Patients will be recruited preoperatively who underwent lower extremity&#xD;
      joint replacement. The following tests will be performed: 1) genome-wide single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms and structural variation, with a particular focus on the following genes: COMT,&#xD;
      BDNF, SCN11a, OPRM1, ACBC1, CYPD26, CYP34A, ANKK1, OPRD1, OPRK1,NGFB, UGT2B7, FFAR2, FFAR3,&#xD;
      GABRG2, SLCO1B1, DRD4; 2) longitudinal gut microbiome sampling; and 3) exosome profiling -&#xD;
      blood will be collecting for RNAseq and plasma for metabolomics and extracellular vesicle&#xD;
      characterization with ultimate impact on in vitro cell function. These genes were selected&#xD;
      because they have been shown to be associated with opioid use, opioid metabolism, and pain.&#xD;
      Furthermore, subjects will fill out surveys preoperatively, including: pain catastrophizing&#xD;
      scale, brief pain inventory, PROMIS-29, and fibromyalgia survey criteria. Other data&#xD;
      collected will include body mass index, age, sex, comorbidities, lifestyle habits, and&#xD;
      medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that there will be clinically significant associations with patient&#xD;
      genetics, microbiome, exosome profiles with their postoperative opioid use. Such findings&#xD;
      will help personalize pain interventions for high-risk patients undergoing knee or hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty in order to help improve postoperative pain control and reduce incidence of&#xD;
      chronic opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1. To validate and identify pharmacogenomic associations with acute&#xD;
      postoperative opioid use (during the first 48 postoperative hours) and chronic opioid use (at&#xD;
      &gt;3-4 months after surgery) in patients who underwent lower extremity joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2. To identify gut microbiome and metabolomics associations with acute&#xD;
      postoperative opioid use (during the first 48 postoperative hours) and chronic opioid use (at&#xD;
      &gt;3-4 months after surgery) in patients underwent lower extremity joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3. To identify blood RNAseq patterns, plasma metabolic markers, extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles, and impact of plasma on in vitro cell metabolism associated with acute&#xD;
      postoperative opioid use (during the first 48 postoperative hours) and chronic opioid use (at&#xD;
      &gt;3-4 months after surgery) in patients underwent lower extremity joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning approaches will be used to combine all data to improve prediction of the&#xD;
      primary outcomes.&#xD;
