  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is aimed at investigating the efficacy of eye movement desensitization and&#xD;
      reprocessing (EMDR) psychotherapy for treating depression and comorbid anxiety symptoms. EMDR&#xD;
      has been scientifically established as an evidenced based level-A treatment for PTSD.&#xD;
      However, researchers have started assessing its efficacy for depression and other&#xD;
      psychological disorders. Preliminary evidence indicates that EMDR has the potential to treat&#xD;
      depression, however, it has not yet been established as an evidence-based intervention.&#xD;
      Anxiety most often comorbid with depression. literature suggests that when depression is&#xD;
      treated, the comorbid anxiety symptoms are also reduced. Hence, the effect of EMDR therapy on&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, when treating depressive symptoms would also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 40 volunteers will be sought from community through advertising, and through&#xD;
      referrals and will be randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions. Participants&#xD;
      of experimental condition will be offered eight phase EMDR therapy in a period of 12-14&#xD;
      weeks. Participants of control group will receive counselling as usual sessions for 12-14&#xD;
      weeks. Measurement of the depression and anxiety symptoms for Experimental group will be&#xD;
      recorded at Time 1, (baseline, time frame: 0 week). Time 2 (after history and preparation for&#xD;
      EMDR, time frame: 3 weeks). Time 3, (after EMDR treatment, time frame: 12 weeks) and at T4, (&#xD;
      post treatment follow-up, Time frame: 24 weeks. For Control group, measurements will be&#xD;
      recorded at T1, T2 and T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will be the first registered Randomized Control Trial (RCT ) as per&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, that will explore the efficacy of EMDR in treating depression and&#xD;
      comorbid anxiety. The results of the study will provide the scientific bases to use EMDR as a&#xD;
      treatment of choice for depression and anxiety. Many clients do not respond to&#xD;
      pharmacological as well other psychological treatments despite bearing huge financial cost.&#xD;
      EMDR therapy can be a short-term treatment that may provide relief from symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, and as a result, the functioning and quality of life of the&#xD;
      participants will also improve. This study will also guide further research to explore the&#xD;
      effects of EMDR on other trauma-based disorders and comorbid conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the foremost cause of global disease and disability burden . It often coexists&#xD;
      with other chronic diseases and exacerbates health related outcomes . The prevalence rate of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety is on the rise in Pakistan due to various challenging conditions .&#xD;
      Hence, there is a greater need to find new and effective treatment/s, that would supplement&#xD;
      the existing treatments in treating depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression is usually treated through antidepressants, counselling or psychotherapy. However,&#xD;
      antidepressants have shown a meek advantage over placebos, and its use increases with rise in&#xD;
      the severity of depression. Therefore, pharmacological treatment should only be opted for if&#xD;
      depression is moderate to severe and does not respond to psychotherapy; or when psychotherapy&#xD;
      is not available . Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the recommended therapy to treat&#xD;
      depression . It significantly reduces relapse rate occurrence . A meta-analysis of 28 studies&#xD;
      found CBT effective in reducing the relapse rate significantly for Major Depression compared&#xD;
      to pharmacotherapy . On the contrary, the meta-analysis of 70 studies reported a linear and&#xD;
      steady decline in the effectiveness of CBT across time with contemporary CBT seemingly&#xD;
      providing less relief from depressive symptoms as compared to its effectiveness reported in&#xD;
      previous years. EMDR therapy has also been researched to treat depression. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence exists through case studies and limited research that EMDR has the potential to&#xD;
      treat trauma induced depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbidity of Depression and Anxiety: Anxiety and depression occupy top ten of leading&#xD;
      causes of global disease burden . World Health Organization estimated that 4.4% of the global&#xD;
      population was living with depression and 3.6% was suffering from an anxiety disorder.&#xD;
      Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depression comorbid substantially and pervasively&#xD;
      with depression . It leads to impaired functioning and requires additional treatment . The&#xD;
      depression anxiety co-occurrence was also found to be significant across developmental&#xD;
      periods, and the relationship between the two disorders was linked to stressful events&#xD;
      experienced in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence rate of depression and anxiety in various localities in Pakistan ranges from&#xD;
      22% to 60 %, which is very high compared to other developing countries . Hence, it is a&#xD;
      significant mental health concern requires serious attention. Hence, EMDR efficacy to treat&#xD;
      depression and comorbid anxiety is explored through this study. According to a meta-analysis,&#xD;
      psychotherapy targeted at treating depression can also decrease anxiety symptoms compared to&#xD;
      control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is scientifically validated and an&#xD;
      integrative psychotherapeutic intervention which was initially introduced as a treatment for&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is a strong research support for EMDR efficacy&#xD;
      in treating PTSD and comorbid conditions. literature suggested EMDR as a positive treatment&#xD;
      for depression . A meta-analysis on treatment of PTSD and depression showed that EMDR seems&#xD;
      to have significantly stronger effect on comorbid depression than CBT. However, research in&#xD;
      this regard is scant. Studies conducted so far suggests that EMDR has a greater potential to&#xD;
      treat depression and anxiety . An unpublished pilot study (N=16) conducted earlier by this&#xD;
      researcher has provided preliminary support for this assumption. The current study will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of EMDR therapy on depression and comorbid anxiety symptoms on a&#xD;
      sample of 40 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions: Is EMDR an effective intervention for treating depression? Can EMDR also&#xD;
      reduce comorbid anxiety symptoms in depressed individuals? Will the quality of life and&#xD;
      functioning of the participants improve after amelioration of depressive and anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms? Objectives: The objectives are to assess the efficacy of EMDR in treating&#xD;
      individuals with depression, analyze EMDR's impact on comorbid anxiety symptoms and find the&#xD;
      effects of EMDR on the quality of life and functioning of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) There will be significant reduction in the depressive symptoms of the&#xD;
      experimental participants after treatment as compared to symptoms reported before treatment.&#xD;
      (2) There will be significant reduction in comorbid anxiety symptoms of experimental&#xD;
      participants after treatment as compared to symptoms reported before treatment. (3) The&#xD;
      quality of life and functioning of experimental participants will improve after EMDR&#xD;
      treatment as compared to quality of life and functioning reported before treatment. (4) There&#xD;
      will be significant reduction in the depressive symptoms of experimental group participants&#xD;
      after treatment compared to depressive symptoms of control group participants. (5) There will&#xD;
      be significant reduction in comorbid anxiety symptoms of experimental group after treatment&#xD;
      compared to the symptoms reported by the control group participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Participants' selection will be based on inclusion criteria assessed through&#xD;
      clinical interview, scores on research instruments and signing of the informed consent.&#xD;
      Assessment and random assignment to an experimental and a control condition will be carried&#xD;
      out by an independent assessor who will be blind to the research hypotheses. The baseline&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted at T1 i.e Week 0. The second assessment T2, will be carried out&#xD;
      after 3 weeks for both the groups. During these 3 weeks experimental group participants will&#xD;
      provide history, learn safe place and other grounding techniques, and select targets for EMDR&#xD;
      treatment. The control group will carry on with treatment as usual. For the next 6-9 weeks&#xD;
      both the groups will receive their respective treatments. Third assessment (T3) will be&#xD;
      carried out after treatment completion for both the groups at week 12 . Experimental group&#xD;
      participants will have a follow-up assessment (T4) after week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of Paired and Independent t-test would evaluate EMDR treatment effects&#xD;
      within and between groups. Results would be discussed and published after the study is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
