    <textblock>
      A clinical characterization of a large cohort of patients with different severities of AD and&#xD;
      ocular symptoms/atopic keratoconjunktivitis (AKC). The data will contribute to assess the&#xD;
      frequency of complications in order to give a rationale for focused prevention and treatment&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD), a very common inflammatory skin condition of child and adulthood, is&#xD;
      strongly associated with ocular disease. Accordingly, about 20% experience conjunctivitis at&#xD;
      some point, and many have chronic disease. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is the most&#xD;
      feared as it may lead to blindness. Little is known about the etiology, the immune&#xD;
      infiltrate, as well as predictive factors of AKC and the clinical characteristics of AD&#xD;
      patients who develop this entity. We expect this project to enable clinicians to better&#xD;
      identify AKC patients in the future as well as improve the understanding of the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of AKC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ocular findings will be compared between AD severity and a control group without ocular&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
