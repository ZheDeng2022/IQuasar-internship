  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This web-based experimental study aims to ascertain whether promoting an active (i.e.&#xD;
      conscious and autonomous) choice process about physical activity results in better&#xD;
      behavioural outcomes (e.g. physical activity) and psychological outcomes (e.g. physical&#xD;
      activity intention) compared to promoting a passive choice process in physically inactive&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this web-based experimental study, the investigators will use a pre-test post-test&#xD;
      four-arm parallel design to compare the effect of promoting an active choice process versus a&#xD;
      passive choice process about physical activity on behavioural outcomes (e.g. physical&#xD;
      activity behaviour, perceived increase in physical activity) and psychological outcomes (e.g.&#xD;
      physical activity intention, commitment) among physically inactive adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of four groups. Participants in group GA+ will be&#xD;
      encouraged to make a very active choice by weighing advantages and disadvantages of physical&#xD;
      activity, considering personal values, identifying barriers and engaging in action and coping&#xD;
      planning. The intervention for group GA is similar, but lacks the action and coping planning&#xD;
      exercises. In the other two groups, a passive choice process will be promoted by only&#xD;
      providing information: Group G will read the national physical activity guideline and group&#xD;
      GI will read the guideline and information about possible advantages and disadvantages and&#xD;
      barriers to physical activity. Behavioural and psychological outcomes will be assessed at the&#xD;
      first measurement and follow-up measurement. Regression analyses will be performed to examine&#xD;
      intergroup differences. In addition, sensitivity analyses and a process evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
