             following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Group1: Lip volume deficit with ROSSI score between 1.5 and 3 on at least the&#xD;
                  upper lip, or on both the upper and the lower lips with up to 1 point difference&#xD;
                  in ROSSI score between upper and lower lips;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Group 2: Moderate to severe nasolabial folds (NLFs) with WSRS scale score 3 or 4&#xD;
                  for each side of the face;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Group 3: Mild to significant volume deficit at the cheeks level with MFVDS score&#xD;
                  2 to 4 at each side, with up to 1 point difference in MFVDS scale score between&#xD;
                  the two sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Investigator Live-Evaluator (ILE) and Injector must independently agree that the&#xD;

             10-day washout period.]&#xD;

             intense pulsed light, radio frequency, dermabrasion, chemical peel, or other ablative&#xD;
             or non-ablative procedures) within 6 months prior to entry in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
