      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different forms of&#xD;
      personalized feedback intended to help students make their best personal choices to support&#xD;
      their health and well-being in college.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risky substance use among college students is a widespread challenge that requires innovative&#xD;
      prevention methods to address. A primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      receiving different types of personalized feedback on the substance use and wellbeing of&#xD;
      college students. This preliminary efficacy will be evaluated through a multi-part randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing four conditions: (1) resources program, (2) on-line Personalized&#xD;
      Feedback Program (PFP), (3) on-line Substance Use Feedback Program (based on brief&#xD;
      motivational intervention (BMI) principles), and (4) PFP+BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first time point, participants will be randomly selected into one of four conditions.&#xD;
      Participants have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the conditions. All&#xD;
      participants will complete follow-up surveys at two additional timepoints (30 day follow-up;&#xD;
      3-month follow-up) to determine any changes that have occurred since they took part in their&#xD;
      program at Time Point 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final survey, all participants, regardless of their initial group, will be invited&#xD;
      to receive all of the personalized feedback components available across all conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study have great potential to enhance the effectiveness of college student&#xD;
      substance use prevention programming and improve college student wellbeing.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in well-being will be assessed using 14 items from the which ask about the following three domains: emotional, social, and psychological well-being. These domains will be combined to give participants an overall well-being score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Resource use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be provided with a checklist of available campus resources at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and asked which of the following VCU campus resources they've used. Our team developed the list of resources based on currently available resources for students at VCU.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program Satisfaction questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked questions related to their satisfaction with their assigned program. Number of questions varies from 6 to 14, depending on the assigned program. Scores will be averaged to yield comparable scores across programs.</description>

    <measure>Change in Risk Comprehension as assessed using 10-item questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in risk comprehension will be assessed using 10 questions related to participants' beliefs about what factors contribute to substance use and mental health. Responses are summed to yield a single score.</description>
