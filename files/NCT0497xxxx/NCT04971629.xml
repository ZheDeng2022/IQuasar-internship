  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a leading cause of disability,&#xD;
      affecting the quality of life, pain, and physical functioning of 4.6 million Canadians. About&#xD;
      half of OA patients have limited response to primary therapy. The number of OA patients&#xD;
      continues to rise, affecting the quality of life of those with OA. There is a dire need to&#xD;
      develop future effective treatment options. Cannabis is a potential therapy for those with OA&#xD;
      and may provide analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and disease modifying effects. The common&#xD;
      barriers to use are a lack of knowledge regarding efficacy, access, and commonly used&#xD;
      products, doses and routes of administration. No high-quality clinical trials of cannabis for&#xD;
      OA have been conducted, leaving physicians struggling to guide and inform patients regarding&#xD;
      symptom relief. Findings from clinical trials of cannabis for other painful conditions have&#xD;
      been variable, perhaps due to suboptimal cannabis products and failure to consider important&#xD;
      patient characteristics. The goal of the current study is to characterize patient- and&#xD;
      cannabis-level factors that are associated with OA pain and address other knowledge gaps.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the heterogeneity of OA, it is likely that any therapeutic (or harmful) effect of&#xD;
      cannabis will vary based on patient characteristics and levels of cannabinoids in the&#xD;
      cannabis product used. In this study, the investigators will measure the association between&#xD;
      patient- and cannabis-level characteristics and patient outcomes among OA patients who use&#xD;
      cannabis to manage their MSK symptoms and those who do not. 1) A number of patient-level&#xD;
      factors are capable of modulating the symptoms and pathology of OA. These include microRNAs&#xD;
      (miRNAs), metabolites, and cytokines/growth factors. Alterations in these molecules have been&#xD;
      detected in the blood of patients with OA and thus are potential biomarker candidates of&#xD;
      disease, prognosis or even therapeutic efficacy. Biomarkers will be measured in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with OA to investigate whether they predict the perceived effectiveness of cannabis&#xD;
      and whether they differ among cannabis users and non-users. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will look at the correlation between biomarker(s) levels and patients' reported outcomes&#xD;
      among cannabis users vs non-users. 2) Chondrocytes from OA joints express a wide range of&#xD;
      cannabinoid receptors, so there is the promise that these cells could respond to&#xD;
      cannabinoid-based medicines. In a subset of cannabis users, tissue samples from the knee will&#xD;
      be collected to determine if the products being consumed penetrate the tissues. 3) Due to the&#xD;
      varied chemical constituents in cannabis products, and the lack of clear understanding of the&#xD;
      pharmacological effects of hundreds of varieties of medical cannabis, there is a need for&#xD;
      in-depth investigations into cannabis strains produced in Canada and those consumed by&#xD;
      patients. Research led by our group found that industry products vary from batch to batch and&#xD;
      labeling can be inaccurate, highlighting the need for further investigation into the&#xD;
      relationship between cannabis' chemical constituents and its clinical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1200 adults with knee osteoarthritis, 600 participants who use medical cannabis to&#xD;
      manage their symptoms and 600 who do not use it will be included. All participants will&#xD;
      complete a set of questionnaires that will collect information about demographics, medical&#xD;
      condition(s), current pharmaceutical pain management, and cannabis use (if any). In addition,&#xD;
      these questionnaires will evaluate pain severity and the impact of pain on day-to-day life,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Participants will also be required to provide a&#xD;
      blood sample to identify biomarkers. An additional blood sample will be collected from&#xD;
      participants who use cannabis to measure level of cannabinoids in the blood. In a subset of&#xD;
      105 participants (100 cannabis users and 5 cannabis non-users) undergoing total knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery, samples of tissue discarded during surgery will be collected.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PDI measures the degree to which aspects of a patient's life are disrupted by chronic pain. Patients indicate the overall impact of pain on 7 categories in their life (family/home responsibilities; recreation; social activity; occupation; sexual behaviour; self-care; life-support activities) on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 7 (worst disability).

    <description>The PHQ-8 is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-8 is an adaptation of PHQ-9 depression module which scores the DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). The item9 &quot;How often during the past 2 weeks were you bothered by thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way?&quot;, was deleted.
