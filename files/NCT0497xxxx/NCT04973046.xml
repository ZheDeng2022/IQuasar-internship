  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue oxygen saturation monitoring was a useful indicator of blood flow insufficiency in the&#xD;
      gastric tube leading to anastomotic leakage during radical esophagectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One cause of anastomotic leakage after radical esophagectomy is blood flow insufficiency at&#xD;
      the cervical anastomosis site. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen patients, who underwent radical esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction, were&#xD;
      studied. The regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) was measured at the tip (point pre 0)&#xD;
      and 2, 4, and 6 cm on the anal side of the tip (point pre 1, pre 2, and pre 3, respectively)&#xD;
      before the gastric tube was raised to the cervical site through the retrosternal route. After&#xD;
      that, rSO2 was measured at the tip, 2 and 4 cm on the anal side of the tip (points post 0,&#xD;
      post 1, and post 2), the actual anastomotic site (point AN), and the chest skin as an&#xD;
      indicator of whole-body oxygenation . The relationship between rSO2 scores and the rate of&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage was determined.&#xD;
