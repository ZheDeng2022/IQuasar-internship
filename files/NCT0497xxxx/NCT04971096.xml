  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate whether the consumption of probiotics can improve the symptoms of&#xD;
      patients with mild cognitive impairment; also evaluate the effects of probiotics on patients'&#xD;
      blood, oxidation and stress related indicators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal&#xD;
      aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It can involve problems with memory,&#xD;
      language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. Probiotics&#xD;
      are regarded as active microorganisms. When consumed in sufficient amounts, participants can&#xD;
      regulate intestinal flora, intestinal permeability, inflammation and antioxidant reactions in&#xD;
      the body, and may produce host health, including delaying disease and regulating metabolic&#xD;
      disease progression and prevent complications.&#xD;

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE (end point scare-baseline score)/ Baseline score*100% ≥ 12%</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function, The maximum MMSE score is 30 points. A score of 20 to 24 suggests mild dementia, 13 to 20 suggests moderate dementia among the elderly; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual-spatial skills.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Memory Scale-III, WMS-III (end point scare-baseline score)/ Baseline score*100% ≥ 12%</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The WMS-III has most representative standardization databases to assess memory and make optimal clinical recommendations. The 11 subtests that comprise the index scores average 60 min, ranging from 45 to 75 min, to administer. The time needed to administer the 13 subtests required to generate all of the summary and index scores is 80 min, with a range of 65 to 95 min.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument, CASI</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) has a score range of 0 to 100 and provides quantitative assessment on attention, concentration, orientation, short-term memory, long-term memory, language abilities, visual construction, list-generating fluency, abstraction, and judgment, higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a global summary measure designed to identify the overall severity of dementia. Six different content areas are rated individually (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). CDR is calculated on the basis of testing six different cognitive and behavioral domains such as memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies performance, and personal care. The CDR is based on a scale of 0-3: no dementia (CDR = 0), questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5), MCI (CDR = 1), moderate cognitive impairment (CDR = 2), and severe cognitive impairment (CDR = 3).</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index, ISI</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a rating tool used to gauge of sleeping. Higher values represent a worse outcome. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>

    <measure>Change in Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a self-report measure of depression in older adults. Users respond in a &quot;Yes/No&quot; format. The GDS was originally developed as a 30-item instrument. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on age, education, and complaints; 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and 12-15 indicate severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale, HAM-A</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A was one of the first rating scales developed to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms, and is still widely used today in both clinical and research settings. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-16, QLESQ-16</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire-16 is a valid, reliable self-report instrument for assessing quality of life. The minimum raw score on the Q-LES-Q-16 is 14, and the maximum score is 70, higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scale for GI symptoms (VAS-GI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale for GI symptoms, VAS-GI (visual analogue scale, VAS 0-10) was designed to measure the response of symptoms and well-being in patients after taking PS23, total score is 0-100, higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Color Trails Test (CTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 Weeks Assessed</time_frame>
    <description>Color Trails Test (CTT) is developed to be free from the influence of language and cultural bias, the CTT assesses sustained attention in adults.</description>
