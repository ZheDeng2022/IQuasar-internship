    <textblock>
      In collaboration with involved healthcare professionals and a patient advisory committee,&#xD;
      this study tests the feasibility of using the Opal smartphone app to daily capture&#xD;
      self-reported physical and psychological symptoms and vital signs among 50 people who are&#xD;
      self-isolating at home with COVID-19. A healthcare team at Montreal's MUHC will remotely&#xD;
      monitor their condition and offer advice and teleconsultations, as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the current pandemic, guidelines were issued by public health authorities&#xD;
      to follow the progression of COVID-19 in the community, identify and treat affected people,&#xD;
      and limit transmissions. About 90% of people with COVID-19 only exhibit mild symptoms and&#xD;
      recover. However, a small percentage of people experience serious symptoms and require&#xD;
      hospitalization for severe shortness of breath or low oxygen levels. The current public&#xD;
      health protocol is to identify people with COVID-19 and isolate them from others at home to&#xD;
      prevent the virus from spreading. Currently, there is no consensus on how to effectively&#xD;
      follow-up and treat individuals with COVID-19 who are self-isolating at home. Research is&#xD;
      urgently needed. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of one strategy for home-based&#xD;
      COVID-19 follow-up . The Opal app for COVID is a mobile application that will allow the&#xD;
      completion of a daily symptom and vital sign follow-up questionnaire that will be monitored&#xD;
      by a healthcare team. Educational material will also be provided through the app. The study&#xD;
      will especially assess the acceptability and usability of the smartphone app.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of having confirmed COVID-19 infected participants register for the Opal app and complete a daily questionnaire on symptoms related to their physical and mental health as well as on certain key vital signs (e.g., oxygen saturation, heart rate, temperature). A nurse will check the questionnaire results each day and determine the need for a teleconsultation with an infectious disease physician. Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 14 days, depending on their symptoms.</description>
