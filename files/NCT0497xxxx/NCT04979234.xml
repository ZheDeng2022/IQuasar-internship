      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an endoluminal gastric plication using an&#xD;
      endoluminal-suturing device to improve severe OSAS in patients with a BMI above or equal to&#xD;
      28 kg/m² until 34.9kg/m².&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the most critical public health burdens worldwide. Its prevalence is&#xD;
      increasing, as well as its comorbidities. The main comorbidity of obesity on the respiratory&#xD;
      system is the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The prevalence of OSAS in the obese&#xD;
      population is around 45%. OSAS increased cardiovascular risk and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      The most alterable risk factor of OSAS is obesity. Therefore, weight loss is the cornerstone&#xD;
      of the treatment. There is some evidence of the efficacy of weight loss surgery (lap band,&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy, biliary pancreatic deviation, duodenal switch, and Roux-and-Y-gastric&#xD;
      bypass) to improve OSAS. Current recommendations suggest bariatric surgery management for&#xD;
      patients with a BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 and OSAS. However, most studies have limited scientific value&#xD;
      (retrospective observational trials), and the follow-up of patients is limited, mainly due to&#xD;
      patients' inadequate compliance. Moreover, until now, there is no reliable predictor for the&#xD;
      percentage of reduction of AHI caused by weight loss. On the other hand, there is no approved&#xD;
      treatment in patients presenting a BMI between 28 kg/m² to 34.9kg/m² and OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic endoluminal approaches to address obesity have become an important topic of&#xD;
      interest over the past decade. Endomina® (Endo Tools Therapeutics, Gosselies, Belgium) is a&#xD;
      novel restrictive endoluminal approach. This new procedure permitted a weight loss of 29 % on&#xD;
      average sustained at one year. This technique was not yet evaluated in patients with 28 kg/m2&#xD;
      ≤ BMI ≤ 34.9/m2 to improve OSAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current feasibility study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an endoluminal gastric&#xD;
      plication using an endoluminal-suturing device to improve severe OSAS in patients with above&#xD;
      or equal to 28 kg/m², BMI until 34.9kg/m².&#xD;
