      A) Setting and location:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The CBCT Scans of this study will be obtained from the data base available at the&#xD;
           department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University,&#xD;
           Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Being a retrospective study, CBCT scans of Egyptian patients who have already been&#xD;
           subjected to CBCT examination as part of their dental diagnosis and/or treatment&#xD;
           planning will be included according to the proposed eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B)Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on sample size calculation, a sample of 173 hemi-palate belonging to Egyptian&#xD;
      individuals will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Details about variable&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Diameter of GPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Location of GPF in relation to maxillary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The distance between the GPF and the midline maxillary suture (MMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The distance between the GPF and the posterior border of the hard palate (PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Number of foramina.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Type of the hard palate and relation to GPF location:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatal index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatal height index&#xD;
&#xD;
      D)Data sources/ Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective Data collection will be performed after the CBCT scans are pooled from the&#xD;
           computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the CBCT examinations will be scanned using CBCT machine (Planmeca promax 3D Mid).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT scans using different fields of view, with 0.4mm voxel size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following parameters will be measured on these images in sagittal, coronal and axial&#xD;
           planes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Diameter of GPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Location of GPF in relation to maxillary molars as described by Ajmani (1994).&#xD;
                Between the upper first and second molar - A In the midline of the upper second&#xD;
                molar - B Between the upper second and third molar - C In the midline of the upper&#xD;
                third molar - D Distal to the upper third molar - E&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The distance between the GPF and the midline maxillary suture&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The distance between the GPF and the posterior border of the hard palate (PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Number of GPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Type of the hard palate and relation to GPF location:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatal index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatal height index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT scans will be interpreted by two oral radiologists independently; blinded from&#xD;
           demographic data of the patients and from the results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of them will evaluate the images twice with a period of two weeks between the two&#xD;
           reading sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then inter-observational and intra-observational reliability between the observers will&#xD;
           be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Addressing potential sources of bias:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No source of bias. CBCT scans will be coded and interpreted by two oral and maxillofacial&#xD;
      radiologists independently blinded from demographic data of the patients and from the results&#xD;
      of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the diameter and location of the greater palatine foramen&#xD;
      in a sample of Egyptian population. Based upon the results of Ikuta, Carla Renata Sanomiya,&#xD;
      et al 2013, the diameter of greater palatine foramen= 3.1 mm (±0.47). Acceptable margin of&#xD;
      error=7%, a total sample size of 173 hemi-palate will be sufficient. Sample size calculation&#xD;
      was performed using Benchmark Six Sigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G) Sampling strategy: The sample will be collected by convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H) Quantitative variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgrouping will be created to assess the variables regarding the gender and side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diameter of GPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Location of GPF in relation to maxillary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The distance between the GPF and the midline maxillary suture (MMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The distance between the GPF and the posterior border of the hard palate (PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of foramina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Type of the hard palate and relation to GPF location:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Palatal index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Palatal height index&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences), version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Numerical data will be described as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation or median and range. Categorical data will be described as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages.&#xD;
