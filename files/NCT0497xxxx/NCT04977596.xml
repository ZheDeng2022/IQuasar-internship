      1. Imaging findings (including CT and MRI images) of both well-differentiated G3 PNET and&#xD;
           poorly differentiated PNET were studied;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The CT imaging findings of G3 stage PNET and pancreatic cancer were compared to&#xD;
           establish a Logistic regression diagnostic model, and the survival analysis of the two&#xD;
           was compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cox regression was used to study the risk factors for survival prognosis of&#xD;
           well-differentiated and poorly differentiated PNET based on CT image features&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to the latest WHO Classification of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (NET) in 2019,&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNET) are divided into well-differentiated and poorly&#xD;
      differentiated PNETs.The former is divided into G1, G2, and well differentiated G3.There are&#xD;
      few studies on the survival outcomes of these two differentiated PNET types.The G3 imaging&#xD;
      manifestations of the two types of differentiation have not been studied yet, and G3 PNET is&#xD;
      often clinically misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer, so it is necessary to differentiate the&#xD;
      imaging manifestations and survival time of the two types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 71 patients with PNET in our hospital from January 2012 to January 2019 and 58&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer from February 2014 to August 2015 were retrospectively&#xD;
      collected. Complete survival time data of all patients after telephone follow-up were&#xD;
      obtained.Since G3 PNET is very rare, the investigators enrolled 9 patients with G3 PNET in&#xD;
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and 7 patients with&#xD;
      G3 PNET in the Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Military Medical University from January 2013&#xD;
      to October 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT images of PNET and pancreatic cancer were analyzed independently by two radiologists&#xD;
      specializing in abdominal diagnosis, in which G3 lesions were evaluated simultaneously on MRI&#xD;
      images and the others were evaluated only on CT images.Records clinical data and imaging&#xD;
      characteristics: gender, age, tumor markers, tumor shape, size, tumor characteristics, edge,&#xD;
      the expansion of the shrinking, pancreas, pancreatic pancreatitis, enhancement scan, arterial&#xD;
      phase and portal phase lesions and the ratio of pancreatic parenchyma around, liver&#xD;
      metastasis, peripheral vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis.&#xD;
