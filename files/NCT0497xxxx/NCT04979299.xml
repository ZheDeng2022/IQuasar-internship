      This study aims to test for a &quot; wheelchair effect &quot;, as a potential impact of stigma, during&#xD;
      the evaluation of clinical global impression of depression.Elderly patients will be asked to&#xD;
      sit in a wheelchair, or in a regular chair during recording a 5 minute video of spontaneous&#xD;
      speech collected the iCGI semi-structured interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videos are showed to 10 different psychiatrists whom each proceed to 10 iCGI rating&#xD;
      assessments.The psychiatrists are blinded evaluators. They are not aware of the real&#xD;
      objective of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric, randomized study of depression severity assessments (by iCGI) for&#xD;
      wheelchair sitting elderly patients versus regular chair sitting elderly patients.The iCGI is&#xD;
      a validated scale to assess depression severity through 5 min videos viewing of&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. The frame of the interviews is made to obtain the material&#xD;
      provided by the patients expected to facilitate the formation of an &quot;impression&quot;, an&#xD;
      empathetic feeling, based on phenomenological concepts. The clinical interview is close to&#xD;
      day-to-day clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized (1:1) into 2 groups: &quot;wheelchair&quot; group and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, a 5-minute video of spontaneous speech collecting the semi-structured&#xD;
      iCGI interview is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These videos will square the participant's face, torso, and thighs, with a ¾ angle, in order&#xD;
      to visualise the patient and the chair he is sitting in. The face will not be blurred in&#xD;
      order to access non his non-verbal communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The videos are viewed by 10 different psychiatrists whom each proceed to 10 iCGI rating&#xD;
      assessments, The psychiatrists are blinded evaluators. They are not aware of the objective of&#xD;
      the study focusing on the impact of the wheelchair. They will be decepted with the&#xD;
      information that the study aim to evaluate the iCGI, as a new version of the CGI with elderly&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 videos each psychiatrist have to assess are randomly selected following the next rules&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Un unbalanced number of wheelchair and regular chair videos, so as they don't guess the&#xD;
           study directly focuses on the wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The wheelchair/regular chair video ratio is 7/3 or 3/7 for each psychiatrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each video is visualised once by one psychiatrist. Our objective is to highlight an&#xD;
           assessment bias related to physical disability in depression in the elderly with the aim&#xD;
           of improving the practices of all professionals involved.&#xD;
