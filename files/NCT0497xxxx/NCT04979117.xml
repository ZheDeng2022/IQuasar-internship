    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a painful condition of the inferior and medial heel. Symptoms&#xD;
      worsens with the first steps in the morning or after prolonged sitting and long periods of&#xD;
      standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of PF is made according to the typical anamnesis and physical examination,&#xD;
      based on the emerge of local point tenderness over the heel and proximal fascia due to the&#xD;
      pressure applied by the physician. Heel pain exacerbates by the first steps in the morning or&#xD;
      after rest and with prolonged standing. Unless there is an inflammatory disease such as&#xD;
      spondyloarthropathy, there is no laboratory finding indicating plantar fasciitis. Imaging&#xD;
      methods are very useful for making an accurate diagnosis. Because the main problem is in the&#xD;
      soft tissue, plain radiography has limited diagnostic value, but can be helpful in&#xD;
      identifying calcaneal stress fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very successful in showing the inflammatory process of&#xD;
      soft tissue. However, it does not seem possible to use MRI scans routinely because of the&#xD;
      cost and time it requires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PF can be evaluated with ultrasonography with the advantages of being non-invasive,&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive, easy to access and apply, and is increasingly used in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Color Doppler evaluation is a very valuable part of musculoskeletal sonographic&#xD;
      examination and facilitates the clinician's decision as an inflammation marker. Power Doppler&#xD;
      US is quite sensitive to tissue or probe movement, especially at low pulsed repetition&#xD;
      frequency (PRF). Flash artifacts may be observed. However, Doppler USG has limited&#xD;
      sensitivity at low flows and small vessel structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superb microvascular imaging (SMI) (Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) is a new mode of&#xD;
      vascular imaging that provides visualization of activity in microvascular structures or in&#xD;
      structures that have low flow rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      the SMI modality in plantar fasciitis with color Doppler and gray scale US. Therefore, a&#xD;
      prospective study will be conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of SMI, gray scale&#xD;
      US, color Doppler US and Power Doppler US. The null hypothesis that there is no difference&#xD;
      between Doppler US and SMI methods in the detection of increased inflammatory activity in&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed only one time at the admission time to the outpatient clinic</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to indicate his/her perceived pain intensity (most commonly) along a 100 mm horizontal line. This rating is then measured from the left edge gives the VAS score. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity and lower scores indicates less pain intensity.</description>

    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed only one time at the admission time to the outpatient clinic</time_frame>
    <description>Heel tenderness index (HTI) will be assessed by physician; based on assessing pain on palpation (0=no pain, 1=painful, 2=painful and winces, 3=painful, winces and withdraws).</description>

    <measure>Foot Function Index (FFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed only one time at the admission time to the outpatient clinic</time_frame>
    <description>This index aims to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales.</description>
