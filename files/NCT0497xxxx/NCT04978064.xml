    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the need and feasibility of randomising a sufficiently large&#xD;
      number of women exposed to IPV during pregnancy in a full-scale future randomised trial. To&#xD;
      achieve this, the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estimate rates of consent to randomization, and the rates of adherence and dropout&#xD;
           following randomization (for the use in sample size estimation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine recruitment duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. examine the women's perception about the benefit of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. determine the reasons for acceptability, non-adherence, and obstacles to recruitment,&#xD;
           randomisation and consent through qualitative interviews&#xD;

      Introduction. Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy, a condition as common as&#xD;
      obstetrics conditions like gestational diabetes, is associated with maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      complications. Systematic detection of IPV is not well established in antenatal screening&#xD;
      probably because the effectiveness of protective interventions has not been evaluated. Among&#xD;
      mothers exposed to IPV, e-health interventions during pregnancy may be beneficial. Prior to&#xD;
      performing a full-scale effectiveness trial for such an intervention, a pilot study is&#xD;
      required to assess the need and feasibility of randomising a sufficiently large number of&#xD;
      women at exposed to IPV during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The eIPV trial is a randomised pilot study nested within a cohort of consenting&#xD;
      mothers at &lt;12 weeks' gestation who screen positive for IPV in the first antenatal visit and&#xD;
      accept an e-health package (psychological counselling by videoconference) in Spain and&#xD;
      Denmark. Twenty eligible mothers from the above cohort will be randomised to either&#xD;
      intervention or control. The intervention group will receive the e-health package as part of&#xD;
      the cohort. The control group will be invited to accept a delay in the intervention (e-health&#xD;
      package eight weeks later). After consenting to delay, the control group will provide&#xD;
      comparative data without losing the opportunity of obtaining the intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will determine estimates of rates of informed consent to randomization, and the&#xD;
      rates of adherence and dropout following randomization. Qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted to examine the women's perception about the benefit of the intervention, reasons&#xD;
      for acceptability and non-adherence, and obstacles to recruitment, randomisation and consent.&#xD;
      The results will inform the feasibility and variance of key clinical outcome measures for&#xD;
      estimation of sample size of the full-scale effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comment. The pilot study nested within the cohort study will allow us to obtain information&#xD;
      about the rates of IPV in pregnancy, the acceptability of an e-health intervention and the&#xD;
      availability of participants for randomisation into a large effectiveness trial.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention group: Women positive for IPV who accept the e-Health intervention and who have been randomly allocated in the intervention group will receive the e-health package as the rest of the cohort, as well as the baseline and outcome measurements. The e-health package will include six video counselling sessions by trained providers and the access to a mobile application for designing security plans, an adapted version of the mobile application &quot;My Plan&quot;. The content of the six individually tailored sessions will be based on the Dutton's Empowerment Model and the Psychosocial Readiness Model.&#xD;
Control group: women positive in IPV who accept the e-Health intervention package will be asked for a second consent to receive a delayed intervention (8 weeks later) and to complete as the baseline and outcome measurements. Women can request to leave the control group at any time and to receive the intervention immediately (in which case they data will be part of the cohort study).</description>
