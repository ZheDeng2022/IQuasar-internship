    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death among women in the Middle&#xD;
      East, including Jordan. Sex-specific data focused on cardiovascular disease have been&#xD;
      increasing steadily, yet is not the subgroup of young women. This study focuses on classical&#xD;
      and novel risk factors of cardiovascular disease in young women compared with older women.&#xD;

      This is the introduction of a new study at Istishari entitled: &quot;The Classical Risk Factors in&#xD;
      Young Middle Eastern Women with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease&quot; This is an&#xD;
      investigator-initiated, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical research in Jordan is a basic responsibility of all medical sectors in the country.&#xD;
      Despite the drastic growth and advances of medical services, the volume of the local medical&#xD;
      research is, at best estimate, scarce. The emerging role of private medical groups, private&#xD;
      hospitals, and residency programs in cooperation with other medical sectors and medical&#xD;
      schools, in conducting, presenting, and publishing such studies should be encouraged and&#xD;
      supported. A major indicator of judging the credibility and quality of any medical research&#xD;
      project is to look at the conferences the research was presented at and the journals it was&#xD;
      published in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the 10th major project of the Jordan Collaborating Cardiology Group (JCC) and the&#xD;
      first in cooperation with the Istishari Hospital Internal Medicine Residency Program (see&#xD;
      Appendix 1. Timeline of JCC Group studies) The first project was JoHARTS that evaluated&#xD;
      coronary risk factors and dyslipidemia in 5000 individuals with ACS, stable CAD, and non CAD&#xD;
      patients. The 2nd project was CAPRIS evaluated the prognostic implications of hs-CRP in ACS&#xD;
      from admission to 1 year. The 3rd project was MINTOR that evaluated onset, triggers,&#xD;
      reperfusion strategies, and hospital mortality in more than 950 Jordanians with acute&#xD;
      ST-elevation MI. The 4th project was GLORY study that evaluated the prevalence of&#xD;
      glucometabolic states among ACS patients, prognosis up to 1 year, and TIMI risk score . The&#xD;
      5th was JoPCR1 that evaluated outcome post PCI in 2426 ACS and non ACS patients in 12&#xD;
      tertiary care centers for the incidence of death, stent thrombosis, revascularization,&#xD;
      bleeding, impact of gender, DM, renal dysfunction, and age on outcome, GRACE, and CRUSADE&#xD;
      risk scores. The 6th is the colchicine study of AF prevention in open heart surgery, one is&#xD;
      completed with 1 mg dose and one is ongoing with reduced dose. The 7th and 8th projects are&#xD;
      ongoing and study statin eligibility in patients admitted with MI (Statin EPIC) and decade or&#xD;
      more survivors after coronary revascularization. The 8th was the Jordanian AF study which&#xD;
      evaluated patients with AF in ambulatory and out-patient settings. The 9th was the JoCORE&#xD;
      study that evaluated acute CV events due to the stresses of the covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One population subgroup is under studied in the world literature as well as the local&#xD;
      literature. The young women who have documented CVD. This group represents only a small&#xD;
      proportion of the CVD population in all countries.&#xD;
