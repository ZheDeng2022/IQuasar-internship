  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A culturally tailored program that creates a safe, open space to increase knowledge,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, skills, and comfort related to sexual and reproductive health, including&#xD;
      HIV/STI and teen pregnancy prevention, mental health, and substance use risk reduction&#xD;
      behavior, and strengthens protective factors, decision-making skills, and connections to&#xD;
      trusted adults may help participants chart a path toward optimal health. To address a&#xD;
      significant gap in evidence-based, culturally-tailored sexual and reproductive health&#xD;
      services for Black and African American adolescents, Public Health Management Corporation&#xD;
      (PHMC) is conducting a rigorous evaluation of an innovative group-level, two pronged&#xD;
      intervention called Talking Matters using an individual randomized control trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design. Due to social distancing guidelines during COVID-19 at the start of the study, all&#xD;
      Talking Matters activities, including recruitment, screening, consent, intervention&#xD;
      implementation, and data collection, will be conduct virtually and remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developed and piloted over the past two years through FY2018 Phase I New and Innovative&#xD;
      Strategies (Tier 2) to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and Promote Healthy Adolescence funding from&#xD;
      the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), Talking Matters is a promising group-level,&#xD;
      two-pronged intervention tailored for urban Black and African American 14 to 19 year old&#xD;
      adolescents who are recruited from school- and community-based settings in Philadelphia, PA.&#xD;
      Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, the Transtheoretical Model, and Self-Determination&#xD;
      Theory, and using evidence-based Motivational Interviewing strategies, the primary goals of&#xD;
      Talking Matters are to reduce adolescents' risk for teen and unplanned pregnancy, sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, and to strengthen protective factors improve optimal&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two prongs of Talking Matters include (1) an adolescent-focused five-session, group-level&#xD;
      intervention called We Get to Choose (WGTC) and (2) an adult-focused three-session,&#xD;
      group-level training called Let's Talk Real Talk (LTRT). An opportunity to connect WGTC&#xD;
      participants to trusted adults who completed LTRT is provided during one facilitated session&#xD;
      conducted each quarter. Adult participants of the LTRT training are not human subjects of the&#xD;
      Talking Matters study.&#xD;

    <description>Talking Matters is a group-level, two-pronged intervention for Black and African American 14 to 19 year old adolescents recruited from school- and community-based settings in Philadelphia, PA. Goals are to reduce teens' risk for unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV, and to strengthen protective factors to improve health. The two prongs include (1) an adolescent-focused five-session, group-level intervention called We Get to Choose (WGTC) covering sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge and skills, decision making and self-worth, healthy relationships, substance use and mental health; and (2) an adult-focused three-session, group-level training called Let's Talk Real Talk (LTRT) to build SRH knowledge and skills to communicate with teens about SRH. An opportunity to connect WGTC participants to trusted adults who completed LTRT is provided during one facilitated session conducted each quarter. LTRT participants are not human subjects of the study.</description>
