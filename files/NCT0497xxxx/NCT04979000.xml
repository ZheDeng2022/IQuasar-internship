  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-control study designed to evaluate the role of anatomic site, gender and race&#xD;
      in human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC). We will&#xD;
      explore the role of HPV, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, in HNSCC by tumor site with&#xD;
      particular emphasis on the sinonasal cavity as well as differences in risk factors for&#xD;
      HPV-positive HNSCC by gender and race.&#xD;
