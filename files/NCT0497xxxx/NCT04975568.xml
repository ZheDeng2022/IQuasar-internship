    <textblock>
      Low Back Pain (LBP) is one of the most usual illness in our society. Therapeutic Exercise&#xD;
      (TE) has been shown the most effective and cheaper treatment in patients suffering LBP, but&#xD;
      the lack of engagement to the therapeutic exercise programs is related with later acute LBP&#xD;
      and chronic situations, despite symptoms slightly improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of personalized therapeutic exercised programs in patients suffering LBP has been&#xD;
      shown nowadays, improving symptomatology and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies help patients to engage more in treatment, while time that health education&#xD;
      make people &quot;active patients&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Home Therapeutic Exercise Program&#xD;
      (HTEP) based in an app with McGill's exercised adding 6 face-to-face sessions every 15 days&#xD;
      with a physical therapist .&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low back pain is defined as pain and discomfort, localized below the costal margin and above&#xD;
      the inferior gluteal folds, with or without leg pain . Sub-acute low back pain as low back&#xD;
      pain persisting between 6 and 12 weeks; chronic low back pain as low back pain persisting for&#xD;
      12 weeks or more. It is not usual define specific causes of LBP, no more than 15 % patients&#xD;
      have a define cause. Non-specific low back pain is defined as low back pain not attributed to&#xD;
      recognizable, known specific pathology (e.g. infection, tumor, osteoporosis, ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis, fracture, inflammatory process, radicular syndrome or cauda equina syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LBP is one of main world health problems, 23.9 % world citizens suffer LBP over a month in&#xD;
      their life. World aging foresee this percentage will increase more in women from 40 to 80&#xD;
      years old. In 2017 LBP was an important men and women chronic health problem in Spain, the&#xD;
      second cause more important in women with 23.5 % Spanish women suffering it and the third one&#xD;
      in men with 15.8 % Spanish men suffering it. LBP is also the most important cause of work&#xD;
      absenteeism with general back pain and migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LBP is related with sedentary lifestyle. Recurrent low back pain is usual. There are several&#xD;
      studies searching LBP's risks and LBP's risks factors but they did not show a clear reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies about app beef up treatment engagement and treatment effectiveness. Last studies&#xD;
      about engagement and health improvement using app had shown positive results in diabetes&#xD;
      patients, hypertension patients, heart pathology or daily pain management without help (for&#xD;
      example Keele Pain Recorder app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a wide and proven evidence of the improvement in symptomatology using app to&#xD;
      prescribe exercise in patients suffering LBP according to Sunil et al papers (aerobic daily&#xD;
      programs plus 7 specific exercise towards LBP treatment), proposing health mobile apps as an&#xD;
      important tool to chronic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But in front of the positive situation of a better engagement, app use has a couple of&#xD;
      limitations as the reinforcement that a face-to-face control provides ant the information&#xD;
      that a specialist health professional can add to the app mobile development to improve the&#xD;
      final results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      LBP is one of the most important health problems of our society. The present study postulates&#xD;
      the possible link between technology and real treatment, proposing a HTEP created to&#xD;
      non-specific LBP with an app, using McGill's Big Three exercise as the base of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McGill's Big Three Exercise are 3 basic and low complexity exercises to treat any patient who&#xD;
      is suffering non-specific low back pain, that had shown a real effectiveness in order to&#xD;
      reduce pain intensity and to get better functionality. McGill proposed 3-exercise warm up&#xD;
      before the Big Three &quot;Curl up&quot;, &quot;Side Bridge&quot; and &quot;Bird Dog&quot; that had to be executed in an&#xD;
      isometric contraction. Maximal muscular contraction had to be under 8 seconds, because longer&#xD;
      contraction would reduce effectiveness as McGill showed in one of his studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will propose an individualized McGill Program using an app as support to the two&#xD;
      arms of the study, and the main difference will be that experimental group will have a&#xD;
      face-to-face control every 15 days and the control group will work only with the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      App development has the supervision or three specialized physical therapists in LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of 6 face-to-face sessions executed by physical therapist to the personalized&#xD;
      HTEP provided by the app is more effective at improving pain intensity, functionality,&#xD;
      quality of life and treatment engagement in patients suffering non-specific LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effectiveness of adding face-to-face supervision sessions executed by Physical&#xD;
      Therapist to a HTEP with an app in people suffering non-specific LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifics&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding face-to-face supervision sessions executed by&#xD;
           Physical Therapist to a HTEP with an app in people suffering non-specific LBP reducing&#xD;
           pain intensity measured by PI-NRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding face-to-face supervision sessions executed by&#xD;
           Physical Therapist to a HTEP with an app in people suffering non-specific LBP improving&#xD;
           functionality measured by Oswestry scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding face-to-face supervision sessions executed by&#xD;
           Physical Therapist to a HTEP with an app in people suffering non-specific LBP improving&#xD;
           life quality of life measured by SF-12 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate patient satisfaction degree of a semi presential treatment measured by PSQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding face-to-face supervision sessions executed by&#xD;
           Physical Therapist to a HTEP with an app in people suffering non-specific LBP improving&#xD;
           engagement treatment analyzing app database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: randomized and controlled pilot study, in a two arms study with parallel&#xD;
      interventions the experimental one and the control one. The study will blind randomization,&#xD;
      patient assessment and data analysis. Patient randomization will take place at &quot;Universidad&#xD;
      Complutense de Madrid&quot; using random permutations model of Moses and Oakford. Study&#xD;
      characteristics itself prevent their blinded application cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluators (baseline, intervention, and post-intervention) will be different&#xD;
           professionals that physical therapist will provide face-to-face sessions, and they will&#xD;
           ignore in which group patients are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical therapist that provide face-to-face sessions will not have any evaluation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assure blinded randomization assessment, recruiters and evaluators of&#xD;
      assessment group of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Study Subjects: 90 patients suffering&#xD;
      non-specific LBP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This study has a paper published in 2018 as reference and the standard deviation&#xD;
      was 2 in pain measure variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.5 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, 90 subjects (45 in&#xD;
      the control group and 45 in the experimental group) are necessary to recognize as&#xD;
      statistically significant a difference greater than or equal to 1.5 units. The standard&#xD;
      deviation is assumed to be 2, and it has been anticipated a drop-out rate of 10 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis. Before starting the study, all patients will be asked to sign&#xD;
      an informed consent in the first session where it will take place the initial assessment&#xD;
      including the collection of patient data records and the booklet of questionnaires and&#xD;
      clinical measurements using the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive weekly 3 sessions of his personalized HTEP and experimental group&#xD;
      will receive also 6 group session every 15 days t controlled by a physical therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At first session, before treatment, variables PI-NRS, SF-12 and Oswestry variables will&#xD;
           be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2 weeks after baseline, before treatment, PI-NRS variable will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4 weeks after baseline, before treatment, SF-12 and Oswestry variables will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 6 weeks after baseline, before treatment, PI-NRS variable will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 8 weeks after baseline, before treatment, SF-12 and Oswestry variables will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 10 weeks after baseline, before treatment, PI-NRS variable will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 12 weeks after baseline the patient will be re-evaluated. PI-NRS, Oswestry, SF-12, PSQ&#xD;
           and engagement variables will be measure The following week to the end of treatment, the&#xD;
           patient will be re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 22.0 program (IBM statistical&#xD;
      software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average and the standard deviation of quantitative variables will be calculated for the&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of the sample. In non-normal distributions the nonparametric sum of the&#xD;
      ranges of Wilcoxon and Chi Square test will be performed, as well as the homogeneity in&#xD;
      baseline will be displayed by overlapping confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparative analysis, developed according to the intention to treat:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A MANOVA (ANOVA for repeated measures) test should be carry out to evaluate the&#xD;
           interaction between levels of inter - subject factor (treatment) and the intra- subject&#xD;
           (main variables response in time) to be interpreted in case it is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm whether this interaction effect is significant, pairwise comparisons will be&#xD;
           made of the inter-subjects factor levels (treatment) for each level of main response&#xD;
           variables over time using the Bonferroni method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study and measures taken to reduce them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking: The nature of the applied treatments prevents masking therapists and patients. This&#xD;
      limitation is inherent to the type of treatment evaluated and common with other forms of&#xD;
      treatment with similar characteristics, in which therapist should inevitably know the type of&#xD;
      treatment that is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this limitation does not prevent the controlled clinical trials carried out on these&#xD;
      technologies from being of higher methodological quality. Thus, in this study, randomization&#xD;
      of patients will be blind, allocation of the random sequence, the assessment of patient&#xD;
      evolution and analysis of results.&#xD;
