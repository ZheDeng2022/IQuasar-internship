    <textblock>
      This phase 1/2 trial will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose Selection) is designed to&#xD;
      find the dose of dapansutrile with acceptable tolerability in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Part 1 will consist of up to 2 dose selection cohorts to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of dapansutrile + pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant melanoma to find the&#xD;
      recommended part 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 will include a lead-in phase of dapansutrile&#xD;
      monotherapy at 500 mg PO BID. At day 15, combination therapy with pembrolizumab will be&#xD;
      initiated. Dose escalation is planned to a maximum of 1000 mg BID of dapansutrile +&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (Dose Expansion) is designed to assess preliminary efficacy of dapansutrile +&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in PD-1 resistant melanoma. Once all patients in Part 1 have completed 4 weeks&#xD;
      of dapansutrile therapy, the expansion phase will start enrolling. Part 2 will also include a&#xD;
      14-day lead-in period of dapansutrile monotherapy at the RP2D.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, per AJCC 8th Edition Staging&#xD;
             Criteria, not amenable to local therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male participants must agree to use a reliable method of contraception (refer to&#xD;
             Section 6.4.1) during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug and must refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants must not be pregnant or breast feeding and meet at least one of&#xD;
             the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A WOCBP must agree to use a reliable method of contraception (refer to Section&#xD;
                  6.4.1) during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose&#xD;
                  of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants must have received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb as part of their most recent&#xD;
             line of therapy prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants must have progressed on or after treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb&#xD;
             administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
             or other therapies in their most recent line of therapy. PD 1 treatment progression is&#xD;
             defined by meeting all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has received at least 8 weeks of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has demonstrated progression after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb therapy as defined by&#xD;
                  RECIST v.1.1. The initial evidence of progressive disease (PD) is to be confirmed&#xD;
                  by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented&#xD;
                  PD, in the absence of rapid clinical progression (as defined in 7.c)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progressive disease has been documented within 6 months from the last dose of&#xD;
                  anti-PD-1/L1 mAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Progressive disease must be determined according to iRECIST ii. This determination&#xD;
             is made by the investigator. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD&#xD;
             documentation will be considered the date of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
             d. Patients who progress while receiving or within 6 months of receiving the last dose&#xD;
             of anti-PD-1/L1 mAb in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting will be included. Inclusion&#xD;
             of patients who progress within 6 months of stopping neoadjuvant or adjuvant&#xD;
             anti-PD-1/L1 mAb will be capped at 20% of the total study population. Inclusion of&#xD;
             patients who progress while still receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant anti-PD-1/L1 mAB&#xD;
             will not be capped.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The participant provides written informed consent for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Measurable disease based on RECIST v.1.1. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated&#xD;
             area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Multiple target lesions will be allowed and will be selected based on standard&#xD;
                  RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The following cutaneous lesions will be considered measurable lesions: lesions ≥&#xD;
                  10 mm in longest diameter or multiple melanoma lesions which in aggregate have a&#xD;
                  longest diameter of ≥ 10 mm, when measured by caliper.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have available archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional&#xD;
             biopsy of a tumor lesion. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are&#xD;
             preferred to slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to archived tissue, but archived sample can&#xD;
                  be used at baseline provided that the patient has only had anti-PD-1/L1 based&#xD;
                  regimen since obtaining the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Biopsies may be taken from any amenable lesion, but it is preferable to use the&#xD;
                  same lesion throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Biopsy may be taken from previously irradiated lesions only if they have&#xD;
                  progressed since radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patient may still be eligible for study if tumor is not amenable to safe biopsy&#xD;
                  or biopsy is judged by patient or treating physician to not be in their best&#xD;
                  interest.&#xD;

&#xD;
               8. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 x ULN unless participant is&#xD;
