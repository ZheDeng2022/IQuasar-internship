      The objective of this research is to determine beneficial impact of mango phytochemicals in&#xD;
      lean and obese individuals for cognitive function and gut health. Investigate how obesity&#xD;
      impacts the efficacy of mango polyphenols on cognitive function and health. Investigate the&#xD;
      ability of probiotic bacteria to optimize the absorption and efficacy of mango phytochemicals&#xD;
      in lean and obese individuals.&#xD;

      Rationale: In obesity, interactions between adipocytes and macrophages are of increasing&#xD;
      importance to understanding obesity and chronic diseases. Dietary compounds, such as&#xD;
      polyphenols, are expected to cause significant changes in inflammatory biomarkers in lipid&#xD;
      tissue that are different from those in blood. To capture any changes of macrophages&#xD;
      interacting with lipid tissue and associated biomarkers, lipid biopsies were collected in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study day: Participants were advised to not eat anything after dinner at 7-8pm the&#xD;
      night (A 12-hour fast). Drink plenty of water, at least 8 fl oz in the evening and 8 fl oz in&#xD;
      the morning. Participants were advised to eat a well-balanced meal consisting of 25%&#xD;
      protein-rich food, 25% whole grain high-fiber carbohydrate, and 50% fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      prior to beginning of fast. Prior to the first study session, participants were asked to fill&#xD;
      out a 72-h nutritional report with all food and drinks consumed using a website&#xD;
      (www.mynetdiary.com)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study day: Participants were asked to consume 400 g of cubed, fresh mango during the early&#xD;
      morning hours of the study day starting right after the baseline blood draw. If they were in&#xD;
      the placebo group, they were asked to take one placebo capsule daily. The placebo used in&#xD;
      this study consisted of vegetable cellulose (HPMC USP) filled with 100% microcrystalline&#xD;
      cellulose USP. If they were in the probiotic group, they were asked to take one capsule of&#xD;
      the Renew Life Ultimate Flora &quot;Extra Care&quot; probiotic daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment: In this study participants were placed into one of four different groups&#xD;
      depending on their BMI. The study treatment depended on which study group they were in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI 18-23, Group 1: They were asked to consume a single portion of 400g of mango and take one&#xD;
      placebo capsule every day for the duration of the 8-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI 18-23, Group 2: They were asked to consume a single portion of 400g of mango and take one&#xD;
      probiotic capsule every day for the duration of the 8-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI 27-35, Group 1: They were asked to consume a single portion of 400g of mango and take one&#xD;
      placebo capsule every day for the duration of the 8-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI 27-35, Group 2: They were asked to consume a single portion of 400g of mango and take one&#xD;
      probiotic capsule every day for the duration of the 8-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects did not know if they received probiotic or placebo capsules as part of their study&#xD;
      treatment. During all sessions, subjects were asked questions about their general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Session 1 (Days 1-3): Blood samples (30 mL or 6 teaspoons each) were taken before and 2&#xD;
      hours after mango consumption (Days 1, 2, and 3) by the study phlebotomist. Subjects were&#xD;
      asked to collect approximately 3 fl. oz (half a cup) of urine in the morning of Days 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3, and 3 fl. ox (half a cup) in the evening of Days 1 and 2. They were also asked to&#xD;
      collect a stool sample to bring on Day 1. The researchers gave the subjects containers for&#xD;
      the urine and a kit for stool collection, as well as instructions on how to collect each of&#xD;
      those samples. Instructions on how to transport those samples were also given to them. During&#xD;
      Study Session 1 (Day 1), subjects took two cognitive function tests (Trail Making and Digit&#xD;
      Span).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Session 2 (Day 29): The study phlebotomist collected a single blood sample (30 mL or 6&#xD;
      teaspoons) from the subject's arm. Participants were also asked to collect a stool sample&#xD;
      using a collection kit we will provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NeuroTracker Sessions: During the last two weeks of the study (between days 43 and 56),&#xD;
      subjects were asked to come to our facility to perform a total of ten sessions using the&#xD;
      NeuroTracker, a cognitive function test. They could perform up to one session per day, and&#xD;
      all ten sessions were completed between days 43 and 56. Before each session, subjects were&#xD;
      asked to fill out the NeuroTracker questionnaire (to assess their emotional, mental, and&#xD;
      physical state) and a food log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Session 3 (Days 54-56): Blood samples (30 mL or 6 teaspoons each) were taken right&#xD;
      before and 2 hours after mango consumption (Days 54, 55, and 56) by the study phlebotomist.&#xD;
      Subjects were asked to collect approximately 3 fl. oz (half a cup) of urine in the morning of&#xD;
      Days 54, 55, and 56, and 3 fl. ox (half a cup) in the evening of Days 54 and 55. They were&#xD;
      also asked to collect a stool sample to bring on Day 54. The researchers gave the subjects&#xD;
      containers for the urine and a kit for stool collection, as well as instructions on how to&#xD;
      collect each of those samples. Instructions on how to transport those samples were also given&#xD;
      to them. During this session (Day 54), subjects took two cognitive function tests (Trail&#xD;
      Making and Digit Span). On Day 56, we measured the participant's body fat using an Omron&#xD;
      Handheld Body Fat Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Function Testing: On Days 1 and 54, we assessed the cognitive function of the&#xD;
      subjects by giving them the following tests: The Trail Making Test (TMT A&amp;B) and the Wechsler&#xD;
      Adult Scale-Revised Digit Span test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last two weeks of the study (between days 43 and 56), subjects were also run&#xD;
      through our NeuroTracker program. This was to test their spatial awareness. The TMT A&amp;B Test&#xD;
      assesses measure of attention, speed, mental flexibility, spatial organization, visual&#xD;
      pursuits, recall, and recognition. The Wechsler Adult Scale-Revised Digit Span is a measure&#xD;
      of mental tracking, memory, and mental flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid biopsy - Optional: This study included an optional lipid biopsy component and&#xD;
      participants were free to agree to participate in this procedure at the beginning and end of&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure was performed under supervision of the study physician Dr. Bramhal and&#xD;
      performed by Dr. Jim Fluckey and Dr. Steven Riechman.&#xD;
