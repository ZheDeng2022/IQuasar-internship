  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This small pilot randomized controlled trial will test whether a brief, web-based&#xD;
      intervention inspired by the principles of motivational interviewing helps high-risk men who&#xD;
      take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) moderate their alcohol use, and improve key outcomes of&#xD;
      PrEP care, including adherence, persistence, and STI rates. Men with a history of &quot;lapses&quot; in&#xD;
      PrEP adherence will be randomly assigned to either (1) use the web-based intervention, called&#xD;
      Game Plan for PrEP, or (2) watch video clips encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g., sleep&#xD;
      hygiene, balanced diet; attention-matched control). Participants will complete STI testing&#xD;
      and submit dried blood spot (DBS) samples to facilitate analyses of alcohol use and PrEP&#xD;
      adherence biomarkers at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months during the study period.&#xD;
      Participants will also complete online surveys at baseline, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This small, pilot randomized controlled trial will explore preliminary evidence for the&#xD;
      efficacy of Game Plan for PrEP, a brief, web-based intervention inspired by brief&#xD;
      motivational interventions. The study will test whether Game Plan for PrEP is efficacious in&#xD;
      reducing heavy drinking and sexually-transmitted infection (STI) incidence, and improving&#xD;
      PrEP adherence/persistence, among heavy drinking MSM who are on PrEP, but who report a recent&#xD;
      history of missing 3 or more consecutive doses in the past month. In this study, we will&#xD;
      randomize 50 gay and bisexual men to receive either (1) Game Plan for PrEP (GP4PrEP) or (2)&#xD;
      an attention-matched control at the same PrEP care/monitoring visit that they reported&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria. We will use self-report measures of alcohol use collected at&#xD;
      1-, 3-, and 6-months and changes in a biomarker of alcohol use collected at baseline, 3-, and&#xD;
      6-months to explore whether Game Plan for PrEP reduces binge drinking compared with control.&#xD;
      We will also use data from a biomarker of PrEP adherence to explore whether Game Plan for&#xD;
      PrEP improves PrEP adherence versus control.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be asked to use Game Plan for PrEP for however long they wish. Game Plan for PrEP is a web-based intervention that provides users with feedback about how much their risk for HIV is reduced on PrEP, their risk for bacterial STIs, and helps them make a plan to take their medication regularly and reduce their risk for STIs. Game Plan for PrEP also providers users with feedback about their alcohol use compared to others in their age group and encourages them to make a plan to reduce it.</description>
