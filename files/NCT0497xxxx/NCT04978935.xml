  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effect of the care protocol, which consists of&#xD;
      independent nursing interventions, which play an important role in accelerating the recovery&#xD;
      process of the patient, such as the patient's position, mobilization, use of spirometry, and&#xD;
      providing shoulder exercises after thoracotomy. The hypothesis of this research is; the care&#xD;
      protocol applied to the patients after thoracotomy has an effect on the patients' pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and on the mobilization of the patients, the development&#xD;
      of complications, the time of chest tube removal and the discharge&#xD;

      Methods: In the study, 80 patients were randomly assigned to the study and control groups.&#xD;
      Nursing interventions will be applied to the patients included in the study group (n=40),&#xD;
      starting from the 0th day (the first day spent in the intensive care unit) after the&#xD;
      thoracotomy in line with the prepared care protocol application steps until discharge.&#xD;
      maintenance protocol; It will consist of position of the patient, mobilization, use of&#xD;
      spirometer and shoulder exercises. The primary outcome of the research is the effect of the&#xD;
      maintenance protocol used in the improvement of respiratory function on respiratory function&#xD;
      tests. The secondary outcome of the research is to determine the effect of the care protocol&#xD;
      on mobilization, complication development status, chest tube removal and discharge time in&#xD;
      patients. The results are obtained by recording PFT values on the 1st, 5th and discharge days&#xD;
      before and after thoracotomy. Postoperative (0.,1.,2.,3.,4.,5.) days and discharge day;&#xD;
      mobilization, complication development status, chest tube removal time and discharge date&#xD;
      will be recorded on the Patient Results Form.&#xD;

    <masking_description>80 patients by randomization will be divided into groups A and B. Group A will be determined as the study group and group B as the control group. The information showing the nurses included in the research sample is assigned to the A and B groups will be put in an opaque envelope. This envelope will be kept by the coordinator researcher (GAU). When the researcher (DS) goes to the patient for the application, after filling the &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot;, she will open the envelope and find out which group the patient is in. The participants will be blinded. The researcher (DS), on the other hand, cannot be blinded due to the nature of the research. When the research is completed, the data will be transferred to the computer environment by a statistician who does not know the A and B groups, and the data will be analyzed by a statistician independent of the research and the findings will be reported.</masking_description>

    <description>In the control group (n=40), interventions for the position, mobilization and spirometry of the patient are applied to all patients in the clinic where the study was conducted. However, these applications are not made in accordance with a certain order and protocol. Shoulder exercises are not routinely taught to patients. In the study, no additional application will be made to the control group other than the routine treatment and care practice of the clinic.</description>

    <description>Care protocol will be applied to the study group (n=40), starting from the first day spent in the intensive care unit.Care protocol consists of patient's position, mobilization, use of spirometer and shoulder exercises. The bed head of the patient will be raised 30°-45° in line with the application steps. In the study, the patient's in-bed and out-of-bed mobilization will be provided by considering the mobilization application steps, and the patient will be asked to stay out of bed for two hours on the 0 th day after surgery. The patient will be asked to stay out of bed for six hours from the first postoperative day until discharge. After the thoracotomy, the conditions that the doctor considers as complications will be recorded.The time of chest tube removal and the day of discharge will be recorded. In the study, the use of spirometry and shoulder exercises will be carried out by taking into account the implementation steps of the care protocol.</description>

The PFT section will be re-evaluated on the 1st, 5th day and on the day of discharge after thoracotomy.&#xD;
Nursing interventions will be applied to the study group (n=40), starting from the 0th day (the first day spent in the intensive care unit) after the thoracotomy in line with the prepared care protocol application steps until discharge.
