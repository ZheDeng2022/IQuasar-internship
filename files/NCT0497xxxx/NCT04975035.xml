    <textblock>
      Through self-controlled studies on metabolic syndrome related indicators, efficacy and other&#xD;
      adverse reactions in patients with schizophrenia who developed metabolic syndrome after&#xD;
      treatment with other antipsychotics, switched to Zoladine capsules (ziprasidone hydrochloride&#xD;
      capsules). To evaluate the clinical application value of switching to Zolodine for&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome, and to explore the drug selection strategy&#xD;
      for long-term treatment of schizophrenia patients.&#xD;
