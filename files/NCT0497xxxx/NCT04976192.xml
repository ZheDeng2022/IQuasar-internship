  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of TEV-45779 compared to XOLAIR in patients with&#xD;
      Urticaria (CIU)/Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic on H1&#xD;
      antihistamine treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study to demonstrate similar efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of TEV-45779 compared to XOLAIR administered sc at doses of 300 mg or 150 mg every 4&#xD;
      weeks for 24 weeks (6 treatments) in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU)/Chronic&#xD;
      Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite antihistamine (H1) treatment. This&#xD;
      study will consist of a screening period (up to 2 weeks), a 24-week treatment period&#xD;
      consisting of a 12-week double-blind main treatment period and a 12-week double-blind&#xD;
      transition period, which is followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The total duration of the&#xD;
      study is up to 42 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive the first 3 treatments&#xD;
      of TEV-45779 300 mg, XOLAIR 300 mg, TEV-45779 150 mg or XOLAIR 150 mg (main treatment&#xD;
      period). At Week 12, prior to receiving their fourth dose of study medication, patients in&#xD;
      the XOLAIR 300 mg and the XOLAIR 150 mg treatment groups will be randomized 1:1 to receive 3&#xD;
      additional doses of XOLAIR (at the same dose level as prior to randomization, or switch to 3&#xD;
      doses of TEV-45779 (transition period) at the same dose level as prior to randomization. All&#xD;
      patients in the TEV-45779 groups will continue to receive TEV-45779 at the same dose levels.&#xD;
