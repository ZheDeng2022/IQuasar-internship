  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous hyperventilation is common in severe traumatic brain injury patients and&#xD;
      correlates closely with poor outcomes. How to treat this pathological condition remain&#xD;
      unsolved. Remifentanil is a frequently used short-acting opioid, has the potent side-effect&#xD;
      of dose-dependent respiratory inhibition. Specifically, it prolongs the expiratory time only&#xD;
      and does not influence the respiratory drive. Among the safety range, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine an ideal dose of remifentanil to maintain PaCO2 between 35 to 45 mmHg. The&#xD;
      investigators will monitor the cerebral blood flow of the middle cerebral artery and the&#xD;
      internal carotid artery to validate cerebral perfusion improvement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (sTBI) is a devastating disease with high hospital mortality&#xD;
      and disability worldwide. For neurocritical care physicians, avoiding secondary brain injury&#xD;
      remains the cornerstone of treatment in treating sTBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide is a potent cerebral vascular modulator. By decreasing the arterial partial&#xD;
      pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), hyperventilation could induce cerebral vasoconstriction&#xD;
      and decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF), which further reduces cerebral blood volume and&#xD;
      lowering intracranial pressure. Traditionally, intentional hyperventilation was used to&#xD;
      control intracranial hypertension in sTBI patients for decades. However, evidences have shown&#xD;
      that the decreased cerebral blood flow may aggravate brain ischemia and worse neural&#xD;
      function. The most recent guidelines do not recommend prophylactic use of induced&#xD;
      hyperventilation in sTBI patients anymore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the latest research revealed a high prevalence of spontaneous hyperventilation (SHV)&#xD;
      in sTBI patients, accompanied by prolonged sedation and analgesia, increased hospital&#xD;
      mortality, and long-term adverse clinical outcomes. Although many modalities are available,&#xD;
      there is still no consensus on the practical and feasible treatment for SHV in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As one of the most commonly used short-acting analgesic drugs, remifentanil has the&#xD;
      characteristic of dose-depended respiratory rate inhibition by prolonging expiratory time,&#xD;
      meanwhile preserve the respiratory drive. Among the effective dose range, the continuous&#xD;
      infusion of remifentanil does not interfere the cerebral hemodynamics. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that SHV could be corrected with remifentanil infusion and anticipate increasing&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow and improving the sTBI patients' outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory physiological study will titrate the respiratory rate with continuous&#xD;
      remifentanil infusion in the sTBI patient with SHV, aiming to maintain the ideal PaCO2 range&#xD;
      of 35-45 mmHg. Specifically, after the satisfactory analgesia and sedation achieved with&#xD;
      butorphanol and midazolam/propofol, escalating remifentanil doses (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08&#xD;
      ug/kg/min) will be tested in sequence from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters of vital signs, blood gas analysis, ventilator monitored variables such as&#xD;
      tidal volume, minute ventilation, end-tidal carbon dioxide will be collected at the stable&#xD;
      period after 30 minutes of drug infusion. Transcranial doppler also will be performed at the&#xD;
      same time to evaluate the change of velocity of the middle cerebral artery and internal&#xD;
      carotid artery. An efficient and safe dose range will be determined, meanwhile preserve the&#xD;
      stability of neural function and hemodynamic.&#xD;
