      Adenotonsillectomy surgery in paediatrics is commonly managed as an ambulatory surgery. This&#xD;
      may be attributed to the use of the electro-dissection surgical technique that decreases the&#xD;

      the use of the ultrasound guidance Primary: FLACC score in the two groups 0,2,4,6 h after&#xD;
      surgery at rest and with swallowing Secondary: need to analgesics, the difficulty of the&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Adenotonsillectomy surgery in paediatrics is commonly managed as an ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery. This may be attributed to the use of the electro-dissection surgical technique that&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of immediate postoperative haemorrhage. However, the use of the&#xD;
      electro-cautery technique increases postoperative inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory fibres of the glossopharyngeal nerve supply the tonsillar and peri-tonsillar areas.&#xD;
      Thus, a bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve block may alleviate post-tonsillectomy pain and&#xD;
      improve postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Prospective randomized controlled clinical study, to compare two different&#xD;
      technique used to block the glossopharyngeal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF WORK To improve post tonsillectomy pain control in children Anaesthesia, postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia Paediatrics 3-7 years Tonsillectomy NOT adenotonsillectomy Postoperative control of&#xD;
      pain OBJECTIVES This study aimed to compare the glossopharyngeal nerve block using the blind&#xD;
      technique with the use of the ultrasound guidance Primary: FLACC score in the two groups&#xD;
      0,2,4,6 h after surgery at rest and with swallowing Secondary: need to analgesics, the&#xD;
      difficulty of the technique, time consumption, recovery time, surgeon satisfaction, parents&#xD;
      satisfaction, staff nurse satisfaction, anaesthetist self-confidence METHODOLOGY 84 ASA I&#xD;
      children allocated randomly into two groups: Group BL: Blind percutaneous peristyloid&#xD;
      injection Group US: ultrasound-guided percutaneous peristyloid glossopharyngeal nerve block&#xD;
      84 children aged 3 to 7 years undergoing adenotonsillectomy without adenoidectomy were&#xD;
      randomized to receive either local blind percutaneous peistyloid glossopharyngeal nerve block&#xD;
      (n=18) or the use of ultrasound guidance for the same block (n=18). The pain was assessed by&#xD;
      the FLACC scale or Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale, need for analgesics, and&#xD;
      acceptance of diet during the postoperative period.&#xD;

    <description>FLACC is a behavioural pain assessment scale used for nonverbal or preverbal patients who cannot self-report their pain level. Pain is assessed through observation of 5 categories including the face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability. The scale ranges from 0 to 10 where 0 records for no pain and 10 records for the worst pain</description>
