  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affects 1.6 million Americans, and only 14% of young adults age 18-25&#xD;
      years achieve glycemic targets (glycosylated hemoglobin A1C &lt;7.0%). Achieving glycemic&#xD;
      targets is associated with reduced risk for both micro-and macrovascular complications,&#xD;
      better neurocognitive function, and better diabetes quality of life. In lab studies, sleep&#xD;
      deprivation led to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in adults without&#xD;
      chronic condition and in one study of adults with T1D. Extending sleep in natural&#xD;
      environments contributes to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose levels, neurocognition,&#xD;
      and psychological symptoms in young adults without chronic conditions. Modifiable dimensions&#xD;
      of sleep health (appropriate sleep duration, stability, and timing) are associated with&#xD;
      better glycemic control in adults with T1D. Therefore, improving sleep duration, stability,&#xD;
      and timing may be potential therapeutic targets to improve glucoregulation and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (diabetes self-management, neurocognitive function, and symptoms) in this high-risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to test and compare the effects of a cognitive-behavioral sleep&#xD;
      self-management intervention (sleep extension and consistency in sleep timing) compared to an&#xD;
      attention control condition (habitual sleep duration + diabetes self-management education) on&#xD;
      improving sleep duration, stability, and timing, and glycemia (glycemic control and glucose&#xD;
      variability) in short-sleeping young adults with T1D in a pilot randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial, with participants assigned to either the Sleep&#xD;
      Self-Management arm or the attention control arm (Diabetes Self-Management Education). The&#xD;
      Sleep Self-Management condition involves an initial 50-minute face-to-face consultation with&#xD;
      brief 5-10 minute weekly follow-ups in a format TBD by aim 1 (e.g., call, text, video&#xD;
      conference) with 3-week booster sessions in person. The Sleep Self-Management intervention&#xD;
      activities are provided in addition to &quot;usual care.&quot;&#xD;

    <description>The Sleep Self-Management Intervention involves an initial 50-minute face-to-face interactive session in a private location. Participants are asked to extend time in bed by 1 hour and consistently maintain the extension on both weekends and weekdays. Bedtimes and waketimes will be assessed to ascertain which time is most modifiable for the participant's lifestyle and routine. There will be weekly follow-ups and in-person 3-week booster sessions. Sleep reports generated by the actigraphy will be shared with participants with brief action planning and goal setting to address progress towards goal achievement. A need to revise plans for future weeks will be the booster sessions' major goal.</description>
