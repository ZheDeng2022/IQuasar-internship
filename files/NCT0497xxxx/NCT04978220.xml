      A cross-sectional questionnaire survey method was adopted to conduct investigations of&#xD;
      medical staff in the researched hospital within one week (baseline) and one year (follow-up)&#xD;
      after the discovery of COVID-19 infection cases. 360 subjects were included in the baseline.&#xD;
      Then, after one year, 199 subjects who participated in the survey at baseline were included&#xD;
      as follow-up. The HADS, ASDS and ISI scales were used to assess the anxiety and depression&#xD;
      level, acute stress disorder symptoms, and the severity of insomnia of hospital medical&#xD;
      staff; self-made questionnaires was to collect demographic information and descriptive&#xD;
      content. Comparing the follow-up medical staff with the baseline, the total scores of ASDS,&#xD;
      HADS and ISI, each item scores on the ASDS, HADS and ISI. All of above scales are compared&#xD;
      between the quarantined and non-quarantined groups, different quarantined groups (home,&#xD;
      hotel, hospital) and non-quarantined groups.&#xD;
