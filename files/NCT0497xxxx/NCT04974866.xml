  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no clinical study on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors has&#xD;
      been systematically conducted in adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II study EGFR TKIs in adenoid cystic carcinoma to evaluate its efficacy in&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The histologic appearance of adenoid cystic carcinoma is low grade, management of this&#xD;
      malignancy is a challenge because of its insidious local growth pattern and lack of effency&#xD;
      with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other performed clinical trials, objective responses to any cytotoxic agent or regimen are&#xD;
      infrequent, whereas stabilization of disease was observed more commonly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adenoid cystic carcinoma, the study focusing on EGFR pathway is rare. According to&#xD;
      previous study, adenoid cystic carcinoma cell lines have increased pAkt activity when&#xD;
      EGF-stimulation is added. And when treated with EGFR/VEGFR TK dual inhibitor, the&#xD;
      phosphorylated form of Akt decreased despite of total level of Akt is remained unchanged.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Local, locally-advanced or metastatic disease documented as having shown progression&#xD;
             on a scan (CT, MRI, MIBI scan) taken 2 to 12 months prior to baseline compared to a&#xD;
             previous scan taken at any time in the past. Progression must be documented according&#xD;
             to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disease that is not amenable to surgery, radiation or combined modality therapy with&#xD;
             curative intent and who is previously treated with chemotherapy or local treatment&#xD;
             (e,g transarterial chemoembolization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of at least one measurable target lesion for further evaluation according to&#xD;
             RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2, 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, loco-regional therapy (e.g chemoembolization)&#xD;
             are permitted providing that toxicity has resolved to ≤grade 1 at study entry and that&#xD;
             last treatment was at least 4 weeks prior to baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A patient with the willingness to comply with the study protocol during the study&#xD;
             period and capable of complying with it&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A patient who signed the informed consent prior to the participation of the study and&#xD;
             who understands that he/she has a right to withdrawal from participation in the study&#xD;
             at any time without any disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. A patient with no measurable disease, or allergy to the EGFR TKIs 2. Prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry except&#xD;
             palliative radiotherapy to non-target lesions (within 2 weeks prior to study entry) 4.&#xD;

             psychiatric disorders that are considered clinically significant by the investigator&#xD;
             that would prohibit the understanding of informed consent or that may be considered to&#xD;
             interfere with the compliance of the administration of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. A patient with clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, symptomatic coronary artery diseases, cardiac arrhythmia, etc) or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
