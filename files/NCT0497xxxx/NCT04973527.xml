  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase I clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of LCAR-T2C cell agents targeting CD4 in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      CD4-positive T lymphocytic tumors. Thirty-three subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be&#xD;
      pretreated with chemotherapy prior to infusion of CAR T cells: about 5 days before cells&#xD;
      transfusion, the patients who planned to reinfuse CAR T cells were treated with&#xD;
      fluorodarabine 30 mg/m2( body surface area) and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2( body surface&#xD;
      area) for 3 days. hen this study will be using a 3+3 dose escalation approach from dose 1&#xD;
      (DL-1): 5×105 to dose 2 (dl-2): 1.5×106 , to dose 3 (dl-3): 5×106 to dose 4 (dl-4): 10.0×106.&#xD;
      Below the lowest dose was reinfused at the PI's discretion.&#xD;

      This is an open, dose escalation/dose extension study of LCAR-T2C CAR-T cells administered to&#xD;
      patients with T lymphocyte tumor. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-T2C CAR-T cells. The auto-CAR-T cells will be infused in&#xD;
      single-dose.&#xD;
