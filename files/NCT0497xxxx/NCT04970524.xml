  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the conventional SDG method applied to increase the adherent gingival band and&#xD;
      partial de-epithelialized SDG methods were evaluated in terms of aesthetics and color&#xD;
      compatibility of the recipient area with adjacent tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a controlled double-blind clinical trial randomized by split-mouth, envelope&#xD;
      method.Clinical parameters and aesthetic harmony were compared at postoperative 1st, 3rd and&#xD;
      6th months after surgical procedures.Color harmony evaluation was made in 2 different ways,&#xD;
      both by photo analysis of a blind researcher using computer software and by visual evaluation&#xD;
      of the same blind researcher.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial is to compare the&#xD;
      partial de-epithelialized free gingival grafting technique with the conventional free&#xD;
      gingival grafting technique from an aesthetic point of view. The secondary aim of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate both techniques in terms of periodontal clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a controlled double-blind clinical trial randomized by split-mouth, envelope&#xD;
      method. Fifteen patients with attached gingiva width ≤2 mm in the lower jaw bilateral canine&#xD;
      and premolar regions were included in the study. De-epithelialized free gingival grafts were&#xD;
      applied to the region determined by envelope randomization, and conventional free gingival&#xD;
      grafts were applied to the other region. The areas of the patients with insufficient attached&#xD;
      gingiva were photographed before the operation, post-op 1st, 3rd, and 6th months, and visual&#xD;
      aesthetic evaluations were made with photo analyzes. Clinical parameters such as keratinized&#xD;
      gingival width, probing pocket depth, and recession depths were recorded at baseline and at 6&#xD;
      months. Results were represented as mean ± standard deviation and median, and a p value of&#xD;
      &lt;0,05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
