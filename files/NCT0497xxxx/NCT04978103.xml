  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gum Arabic ingestion has been proved to decrease some of the inflammatory markers in some&#xD;
      metabolic diseases that have an inflammatory background. Nevertheless, the mechanism/s by&#xD;
      which it does so is uncertain. This study is targeting one of the postulated molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms at genetic level that may help to understand how Gum Arabic exerts its effect .The&#xD;
      effects of GA on Nuclear Factor Kappa Beta, P38 Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase&#xD;
      levels, and on the expression of inflammatory cytokines genes are going to be assessed in&#xD;
      postmenopausal females with Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of several interconnected biochemical,&#xD;
      clinical, and metabolic factors that directly increase the risk of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance, proinflammatory&#xD;
      and prothrombotic states are the cornerstone features defining the syndrome. Glycerol, free&#xD;
      fatty acids (FFA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin&#xD;
      1(IL-1) and Interferon Gamma (INFγ) are some of the inflammatory substances (cytokines) that&#xD;
      are released from different cells (monocytes and adipocytes) in MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gum Arabic is found as a mixture of sodium, calcium and potassium salts of branched&#xD;
      polysaccharides. In the colon, GA is fermented by colonic bacteria into short chain fatty&#xD;
      acids such as butyrate, which are partially absorbed into blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Butyrate treatment was found to inhibit expression of cytokine mRNAs in peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytes (PBMC) that are stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In unstimulated (PBMC), a transcription factor (Nuclear Factor kappa β (NF-κB)) controls gene&#xD;
      expression of some inflammatory cytokines; Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF- α), IL-1 and&#xD;
      IL-6. NF-κB was detected mainly in the cytoplasm tightly bound to an Inhibitory protein&#xD;
      (IκB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When those cells are stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by adipokines, NFκB&#xD;
      is activated and translocates to the nucleus to start gene expression of the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. Moreover; stimulation causes degradation of IκB which releases NFκB and allows its&#xD;
      translocation to the nucleus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This nuclear translocation of NFκB was found to be inhibited by butyrate (a byproduct of Gum&#xD;
      Arabic fermentation ) providing evidence that butyrate mediated reduction of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines was achieved by reducing NFκB activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently; the postulated mechanisms by which butyrate may regulate gene expression are&#xD;
      through inhibition of NFκB activation and IκBα degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NFκB and the inflammatory cytokines: Target for therapy in inflammatory diseases, are they?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As NFκB is involved in transcriptional regulation of many cytokines genes that contributes to&#xD;
      immune and inflammatory responses, it may be a good target for therapy also. At present,&#xD;
      treatment of inflammatory diseases depends greatly on aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and&#xD;
      immune-suppressants that decrease cytokines level especially TNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties of gum Arabic, through butyrate,&#xD;
      described previously may offer an interesting alternative therapeutic approach for&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
