  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Northera (Droxidopa) is safe and effective&#xD;
      in young adults with Menkes disease who survived the most severe complications of their&#xD;
      illness or adults with occipital horn syndrome (OHS), who have trouble with intermittent low&#xD;
      blood pressure and other symptoms of dysautonomia. The outcomes and information from this&#xD;
      study may help adult survivors of Menkes disease and individuals with OHS lead more normal&#xD;
      day-to-day lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dosing, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Northera (Droxidopa) treatment in young adults who survived the major&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and neurocognitive effects of Menkes disease through early Copper&#xD;
      Histidinate treatment. We hypothesize that Northera (Droxidopa) in Menkes disease survivors&#xD;
      with symptoms of dysautonomia (e.g., syncope, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, abnormal&#xD;
      sinoatrial conduction, nocturnal bradycardia, and bowel or bladder dysfunction) from&#xD;
      persistent deficiency of the copper-dependent enzyme, dopamine-β-hydroxylase, will be safe,&#xD;
      and correct or improve blood neurochemical levels, raise systolic blood pressure, and produce&#xD;
      symptomatic improvement and better overall quality of life. We will test this hypothesis in&#xD;
      six to ten Menkes disease survivors or OHS patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      randomized crossover clinical trial.&#xD;
