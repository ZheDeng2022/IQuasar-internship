    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study using game intervention as an adjuvant treatment, to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the video game on anhedonia and associated functional change of brain in patients&#xD;
      with depression. Participants will be randomized to Experimental group receiving a 8-week&#xD;
      treatment of antidepressant drugs and game intervention, or Control group receiving a 8-week&#xD;
      treatment of antidepressant drugs. Magnetic resonance imaging scanning and assessment of&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and cognitive function were conducted before and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Depression is a serious mental health problem that affects millions of people globally.&#xD;
      Anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, is the loss of pleasure or interest in enjoyable&#xD;
      activities. The presence of anhedonia is a risk factor of poor outcome of depression.&#xD;
      Although some patients reach remission after treatment, anhedonia still persists as a&#xD;
      residual symptom. It is generally believed that the frontal-striatal pathway plays an&#xD;
      important role in the reward system of brain in patients with depression. The mechanism of&#xD;
      anhedonia is closely related to the function of the brain's reward system dopamine. There&#xD;
      have been some research showed benefits of playing video games on brain. Video games can&#xD;
      modulate negative emotions and increase positive feelings. Previous studies have confirmed&#xD;
      that playing games will activate the release of dopamine in striatum. &quot;Dancing Line&quot; is a&#xD;
      commercial music game. Participants need to change the direction of target according to the&#xD;
      music by tapping the screen and manage to finish the routes and get the gems along the route&#xD;
      as much as possible. Sometimes the view of participants would change during the game. The&#xD;
      game is simple for participants to pick up and there is no need for prior gaming experience.&#xD;
      The main purpose of the study is to explore the effect of game as an adjuvant treatment on&#xD;
      anhedonia, depressive symptoms, cognitive function and associated functional change of brain&#xD;
      in patients with depression.&#xD;
