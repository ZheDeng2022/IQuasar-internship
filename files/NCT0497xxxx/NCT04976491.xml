  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project plans to develop a new diet therapy suitable for China -- CD-C-food, which is&#xD;
      more in line with the common diet of Chinese patients' eating habits and economic conditions,&#xD;
      and its expected therapeutic effect and influence on intestinal microorganism are similar to&#xD;
      that of EEN. In order to explore the influence of intestinal microorganisms and their&#xD;
      metabolites on the clinical remission effect and inflammatory response of patients with&#xD;
      CD-C-FoodCD, and to reveal the possible internal mechanism， a randomized control of adult&#xD;
      subjects with a healthy CD-Chinese-food diet, treatment group of CD patients and animal model&#xD;
      will be conducted by using intestinal microbiome, bacterial metabolite analysis, inflammatory&#xD;
      factors detection and other technical means.&#xD;

      Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is the only established dietary treatment for children with&#xD;
      CD.Changes in diet affect the amount of short-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty&#xD;
      acids produced by changing the composition of intestinal flora, leading to changes in&#xD;
      intestinal state.Through the long-term clinical observation of our team, most patients with&#xD;
      CD can achieve stable remission by removing the processed food and screening the&#xD;
      corresponding food by combining the characteristics of Chinese diet with the food intolerance&#xD;
      detection method. So, what kind of diet is suitable for the treatment of CD patients in&#xD;
      China? The CD-Treat program, replacing the Western diet with Chinese diet, so as to design an&#xD;
      individualized program CD-Chinese-food (CD-C-food) that is consistent with the eating habits&#xD;
      of Chinese patients with CD. By comparing the effects of this individualized diet with EEN on&#xD;
      inducing and maintaining remission in CD patients.&#xD;
