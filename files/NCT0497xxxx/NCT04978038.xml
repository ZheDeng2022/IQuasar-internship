    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled trial. LTCF residents ≥65 years&#xD;
      who have had two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine will be randomized to vaccination with a third&#xD;
      dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine or to vaccination with a control (Prevnar-13 vaccine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test whether vaccinating LTCF residents ≥65 years&#xD;
      with a third dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19) vaccine as compared to control (Prevnar-13)&#xD;
      lead to increase in detectable neutralizing antibody. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or the Pnemoccocal Prevnar-13 vaccine at baseline&#xD;
      after bloodwork is drawn. Another blood sample will be taken 28 days later. After completion&#xD;
      of the study, participants in the control group (pneumococcal Prevnar-13 vaccine) will be&#xD;
      offered a third dose of mRNA-1273 if our data show that a third dose is effective in boosting&#xD;
      the immune response.&#xD;
