    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of nipocalimab on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of etanercept (Part 1); and to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (HCQ) on total serum immunoglobin G (IgG) reduction by nipocalimab (Part 2) in healthy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy based on physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. If there are any abnormalities, they&#xD;
             must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population or considered&#xD;
             not clinically relevant and this determination must be recorded in the participant's&#xD;
             source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening (including&#xD;
             immunoglobulin [Ig]G) and at admission to the study site. If the results of the serum&#xD;
             chemistry panel, liver panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal&#xD;
             reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be&#xD;
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be&#xD;
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good venous access in both arms&#xD;

             received locally-approved (and including emergency use-authorized) coronavirus disease&#xD;
             2019 (COVID-19) vaccines recently prior to study entry, applicable local vaccine&#xD;
             labeling, guidelines, and standards of care for participants receiving immune-targeted&#xD;
             therapy should be followed when determining an appropriate interval between&#xD;
