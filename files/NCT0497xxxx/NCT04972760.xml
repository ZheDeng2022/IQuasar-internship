  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare and disabling condition with an important impairment of&#xD;
      quality of life and possible life-threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is based on high doses of corticosteroids but this exposes patients to adverse&#xD;
      events (cardiovascular mortality, glucocorticoids-induced muscle and skin damages).&#xD;
      Corticosteroids taper is associated with disease relapses. Although there is no evidence from&#xD;
      the literature, clinical practice guidelines recommends the use of DMARDs such as&#xD;
      methotrexate. However, response is not complete and these DMARDS take time to act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interferon type I (IFN-I) pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of DM. Janus kinase&#xD;
      1 and 2 transduces IFN-I signals. In addition, JAK2 inhibition enhances muscle repair and&#xD;
      force generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JAK 1/2 inhibitors permitted to dramatically and rapidly improve relapsing DM patients (n=4,&#xD;
      case series).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/2) inhibitors (baricitinib) will permit to&#xD;
      obtain dermatomyositis (DM) improvement with a steroid sparing effect as compared to usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) to obtain&#xD;
      prednisone-free moderate improvement (ACR/EULAR ≥ 40) of DM as compared to placebo in&#xD;
      addition to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIRD is a multicenter phase III double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with two&#xD;
      parallel arms (1:1). This is an add-on trial to usual care with rapid corticoid taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter trial in different medical departments in hospitals across France in&#xD;
      different regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out- and in patients will be recruited in hospital departments involved in management and&#xD;
      diagnosis of DM: departments of dermatology, rheumatology and internal medicine.&#xD;

&#xD;
      BIRD is a multicenter phase III double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with two&#xD;
      parallel arms (1:1). This is an add-on trial to usual care with rapid corticoid taper. Both&#xD;
      groups (experimental and control groups) will receive corticosteroids and the conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug (either azathioprine or methotrexate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) to obtain&#xD;
      prednisone-free DM moderate improvement as compared to placebo, in addition to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: moderate improvement (defined as a total improvement score superior or&#xD;
      equal to 40 following ACR/EULAR definition) without corticosteroids at week 24&#xD;
      (prednisone-free moderate improvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter trial involves different medical departments in hospitals across France in&#xD;
      different regions. Out- and in patients will be recruited in hospital departments involved in&#xD;
      management and diagnosis of DM: departments of dermatology, rheumatology and internal&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will sign a written informed consent after full oral and written&#xD;
      information about the trial. They will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive baricitinib plus&#xD;
      prednisone taper plus one immunosuppressive drug (either methotrexate or azathioprine)&#xD;
      (experimental group) or placebo plus prednisone taper plus one immunosuppressive drug (either&#xD;
      methotrexate or azathioprine) (control group) for a duration of 24 weeks. In both groups,&#xD;
      corticosteroids are tapered following a predefined protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 visits are planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screening visit (W-4 to D-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline visit (W0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow-up visit 1 (W5 +/-5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow-up visit 2 (W12 +/-5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  end of study visit 3 (W24+/-5 days) Data will be collected by investigator and clinical&#xD;
           research associate on an electronic case report form (eCRF) via a web browser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be the comparison between experimental and control groups of the&#xD;
      rate of prednisone-free moderate improvement at 24 weeks in the intent to treat population.&#xD;
      In order to demonstrate a difference in the rate of primary outcome at 24 weeks from 30% in&#xD;
      the control group to 70% in the experimental group, with a power of 80%, a bilateral alpha&#xD;
      risk of 5%, and a 15% rate of loss of follow-up, 62 patients are necessary.&#xD;
