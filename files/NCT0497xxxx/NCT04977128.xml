  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the safety and biodistribution of 89Zr-labeled KN035&#xD;
      (89Zr-KN035) PET Imaging in patients with PD-L1 positive solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be evaluated to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients will&#xD;
      receive an injection of 89Zr-KN035 and will undergo PET/CT scanning to determine uptake of&#xD;
      89Zr-KN035 in tumor lesions.&#xD;
