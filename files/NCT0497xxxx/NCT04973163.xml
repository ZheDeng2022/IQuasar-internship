  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with different types of advanced or metastatic cancer (including&#xD;
      lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bile duct cancer). This study is for&#xD;
      people for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have a tumour with a KRAS mutation can participate in the study. A KRAS mutation&#xD;
      makes tumours grow faster. BI 1823911 and BI 1701963 are medicines that may turn off KRAS,&#xD;
      each in a different way. In this study, BI 1823911 is given to people for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of BI 1823911 that people can tolerate&#xD;
      when taken alone and together with BI 1701963. The most suitable dose is used to find out&#xD;
      whether BI 1823911 alone and in combination with BI 1701963 can make tumours shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this time, participants take tablets of BI 1823911 alone or in combination with BI&#xD;
      1701963 once a day. The doctors regularly monitor the size of the tumour. Doctors also&#xD;
      regularly record any unwanted effects and check participant's health.&#xD;
