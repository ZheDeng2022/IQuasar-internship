  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a vaccine called SurVaxM on this study. While vaccines are usually&#xD;
      thought of as ways to prevent diseases, vaccines can also be used to treat cancer. SurVaxM is&#xD;
      designed to tell the body's immune system to look for tumor cells that express a protein&#xD;
      called survivin and destroy them. The survivin protein can be found on up to 95% of&#xD;
      glioblastomas and other types of cancer but is not found in normal cells. If the body's&#xD;
      immune system knows to destroy cells that express survivin, it may help to control tumor&#xD;
      growth and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SurVaxM will be mixed with Montanide ISA 51 before it is given. Montanide ISA 51 is an&#xD;
      ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in people, which helps the vaccine&#xD;
      work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two phases: Priming and Maintenance. During the Priming Phase, patients will&#xD;
      get one dose of SurVaxM combined with Montanide ISA 51 through a subcutaneous injection (a&#xD;
      shot under the skin) at the start of the study and every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (for a total of&#xD;
      4 doses). At the same time that patients get the SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 injection, they&#xD;
      will also get a second subcutaneous injection of a medicine called sargramostim. Sargramostim&#xD;
      is given close to the SurVaxM//Montanide ISA 51 injection and works to stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system to help the SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 work more effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient completes the Priming Phase without severe side effects and his or her disease&#xD;
      stays the same or improves, he or she can continue to the Maintenance Phase. During the&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase, the patient will get a SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51 dose along with a&#xD;
      sargramostim dose about every 8 weeks for up to two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a patient finishes the study treatment, the doctor and study team will continue to&#xD;
      follow his/her condition and watch for side effects up to 3 years following the last dose of&#xD;
      SurVaxM/Montanide ISA 51. Patients will be seen in clinic every 3 months during the follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter pilot study of SurVaxM (SVN53-67/M57-KLH) for children and young adults&#xD;
      with progressive or relapsed medulloblastoma, high grade glioma, ependymoma and newly&#xD;
      diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivin (BIRC5) is an inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein that is highly expressed in many&#xD;
      cancers. Survivin's high level of expression in certain pediatric malignancies makes it an&#xD;
      attractive molecular target for new therapies, including active specific vaccination-based&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the SurVaxM vaccine employs several strategies to create an effective antitumor&#xD;
      immunogen, including: 1) incorporation of multiple MHC class I epitopes, 2) peptide&#xD;
      modification to enhance binding to certain MHC class I molecules, 3) cytokine helper support,&#xD;
      and 4) antibody-mediated tumor cell killing. All of these effects would not be expected with&#xD;
      the unmodified class-I restricted short survivin peptides employed in previously studied&#xD;
      glioma vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no prior clinical trials of SurVaxM in pediatric patients; however, SurVaxM has&#xD;
      been studied in several adult trials, including a phase I study conducted at Roswell Park&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Center. Following the single-institution phase I trial, a multicenter&#xD;
      phase IIa trial (NCT024455557) was conducted in 63 patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma. All patients in this study underwent surgical resection of their tumors.&#xD;
      Patients then underwent chemoradiation with temozolomide according to the Stupp protocol.&#xD;
      This was followed by a one-month hiatus from chemotherapy, during which priming doses of&#xD;
      SurVaxM were initiated. The priming phase of vaccination was then followed by initiation of&#xD;
      standard adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide and maintenance doses of SurVaxM as an&#xD;
      add-on to standard chemotherapy. There have been no regimen-limiting toxicities (RLT) or&#xD;
      grade ≥ 3 SAE attributable to SurVaxM, with most toxicities being related to temozolomide.&#xD;
      The most common AE was grade 1-2 injection site reaction with 2 patients experiencing&#xD;
      Montanide-related granulomatous panniculitis with local skin ulceration at vaccine injection&#xD;
      sites, both of which resolved. Humoral and survivin-specific CD8+ T cell responses were&#xD;
      observed in almost all patients. Twelve-month overall survival (OS12) was 86% from first&#xD;
      immunization and 93.4% from diagnosis. OS12 for meMGMT was 93.1% and unMGMT was 78% from&#xD;
      first immunization. Median time to tumor progression (mPFS) was 13.9 months from diagnosis.&#xD;
      Although not a randomized trial, these results are superior to overall survival reported in&#xD;
      various studies in which patients received standard of care treatment for this disease. A&#xD;
      randomized phase IIb clinical trial of standard therapy plus SurVaxM is currently being&#xD;
      developed with intent for drug registration, if successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the toxicity profile of SurVaxM in emulsion&#xD;
      with Montanide plus sargramostim in children with relapsed or progressive medulloblastoma and&#xD;
      high-grade glioma, ependymoma and non-recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&#xD;
      post-radiation therapy. Patients will be enrolled into three separate strata based on age and&#xD;
      diagnosis. Enrollment will be staged to allow for safety evaluations between strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive 500 micrograms SurVaxM as a 1:1 mixture with Montanide ISA 51 in a&#xD;
      water-in-oil emulsion. The SurVaxM-Montanide emulsion injection will be followed immediately&#xD;
      by sargramostim (or biosimilar) given via a second separate subcutaneous injection in close&#xD;
      proximity to the vaccine injection site. Patients will receive four injections administered&#xD;
      over a 6-week period, followed by 14 days of follow-up, called the Priming Phase (8 weeks&#xD;
      total). Beginning 8 weeks after the fourth priming dose, a maintenance dose of SurVaxM with&#xD;
      Montanide ISA 51 may be given every 8 weeks (± 2 weeks) for two years or until an&#xD;
      off-treatment criterion is met.&#xD;

             expected to meet the criteria for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrollment Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • DIAGNOSIS: Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor that&#xD;
        is progressive or recurrent defined as progression in any known residual tumor, or the&#xD;
        appearance of one or more new lesions, or new cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positivity for&#xD;
        malignant cells, after having failed standard therapy. At the time of diagnosis or&#xD;
        recurrence, all tumors must have histologic verification of one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medulloblastoma&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients with newly diagnosed DIPG: Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs)&#xD;
        will be eligible 14 to 56 days post-completion of radiation therapy if they do not have any&#xD;
        evidence of progression. Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), defined&#xD;
        as tumors with a pontine epicenter and diffuse involvement of 2/3 or more of the pons, are&#xD;
        eligible without histologic confirmation. Patients with brainstem tumors that do not meet&#xD;
        these criteria or not considered to be typical intrinsic pontine gliomas will only be&#xD;
        eligible if the tumors have been biopsied and are proven to be a glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
        (GBM), or astrocytoma (Grade II or Grade III). DIPG patients with disseminated disease are&#xD;
        not eligible, and MRI of spine must be performed if disseminated disease is suspected by&#xD;
        the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DEMONSTRATION OF SURVIVIN EXPRESSION: For patients with relapsed or progressive&#xD;
             medulloblastoma, HGG, or ependymoma, demonstration of survivin expression as assessed&#xD;
             after screening consent/assent of at least 1% on tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
             (ICH) is required and must have been performed in the central laboratory at Roswell&#xD;
             Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) to confirm eligibility. For patients with&#xD;
             DIPG, diagnostic biopsy for histologic confirmation is not required, and tumor&#xD;
             expression of survivin is therefore not required for eligibility for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DISEASE STATUS: Patients must have either measurable or evaluable disease. Patients&#xD;
             with recurrent or progressive GBM, anaplastic astrocytoma, high grade astrocytoma&#xD;
             (NOS), anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III) or&#xD;
             ependymoma (WHO Grade II) with metastatic disease or leptomeningeal disease are&#xD;
             eligible so long as there is clear MRI evidence of evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AGE:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stratum 1 (progressive or recurrent) patients must be ≥10 years of age and ≤ 21&#xD;
                  years of age at the time of study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Stratum 2 (progressive or recurrent) patients must be ≥1 year of age and &lt; 10&#xD;
                  years of age at the time of study screening.&#xD;

                  of age at the time of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PRIOR THERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with recurrent or progressive disease must have received prior&#xD;
                  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or any other treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have recovered from the acute treatment related toxicities (defined&#xD;
                  as ≤ Grade 1 if not defined in eligibility criteria; excludes alopecia) prior to&#xD;
                  entering this study.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) ensures that high dimensional molecular data generated from PBTC samples will be submitted to the NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) or other NIH-designated data repository. PBTC is required to make data available to other investigators for use in research projects. An investigator requesting data from published PBTC studies will submit a proposal describing the studies from which data are requested, the requested data, and a list of investigators in the project and their affiliated institutions, along with the investigator's CV to the PBTC Steering Committee for review. Once approved, the requesting investigator will be asked to complete a Data Transfer Agreement before the release of deidentified data. Requests for data are typically only considered once the primary study manuscript has been published though exceptions may be made in the event of long delays in the primary study data publication.</ipd_description>
