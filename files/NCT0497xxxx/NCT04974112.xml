  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      we use the tools of SGA and NRS2002 to understand the nutritional status of Chinese Han&#xD;
      inpatients during hospitalization and discharge, and to dynamically analyze the changes in&#xD;
      the process of internal medicine and surgery in many general hospitals across Zhejiang&#xD;
      Province.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      his study was conducted in parallel in a number of Grade-A hospitals across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers used SGA and NRS2002 and other data measurement tools to collect patient&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General survey: initials, age, height, weight, gender, birthday, nationality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Admission and discharge diagnosis: primary diagnosis and secondary diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Laboratory indicators at admission and discharge: white blood cell, lymphocyte count,&#xD;
           hemoglobin, platelet; Liver function (ALT and TBIL); kidney function (BUN and CR);&#xD;
           protein (total protein, albumin and Prealbumin); blood lipids (cholesterol and&#xD;
           triglycerides), etc.: The above results are subject to laboratory examinations within 3&#xD;
           days of hospitalization and discharge, and collect as complete as possible;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anthropometric indicators at admission and discharge: hand grip, calf circumference or&#xD;
           upper arm circumference, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comprehensive evaluation tools at admission and discharge: subjective comprehensive&#xD;
           nutritional assessment (SGA) and nutritional risk screening (NRS2002);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Description of nutritional support during hospitalization: no nutritional support, pure&#xD;
           enteral nutrition support, pure parenteral nutrition support, enteral + parenteral&#xD;
           nutrition support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Clinical outcome indicators at discharge: 30-day hospitalization mortality, total&#xD;
           complications, infection complications, length of stay, total medical expenses, etc.&#xD;
