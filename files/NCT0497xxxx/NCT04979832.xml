  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the application of GM-CSF, fosfomycin and metronidazole&#xD;
      locally in the pouch is safe and effective in the treatment of pouchitis for patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis, and whether treatment changes the microbiome of the pouch.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A definitive cure for patients with treatment-refractory ulcerative colitis is&#xD;
      proctocolectomy with IPAA (restorative ileal pouch anal anastomosis). Up to 50% of all&#xD;
      patients develop &quot;pouchitis&quot; within the first five years after surgery, an inflammatory&#xD;
      condition that is as yet poorly understood and without official consensus on treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment modalities include oral antibiotics as well as immunomodulators, steroids,&#xD;
      probiotics and biological agents, but up to 20% of these patients develop chronic,&#xD;
      treatment-resistant pouchitis, which can result in pouch failure and the need for reoperation&#xD;
      with the possible creation of an ileostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of pouchitis is thought to be similar to other inflammatory bowel diseases, in&#xD;
      that genetic and bacterial factors, a compromised gastrointestinal barrier and immunological&#xD;
      components seem to play a role. Its pathogenetic mechanisms seem to mimic Crohn's disease, in&#xD;
      which smaller studies have shown some effect of systemically administered GM-CSF&#xD;
      (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) on the gut macrophage function in clearing&#xD;
      microorganisms and maintaining the mucosal barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that GM-CSF will have an effect in the treatment of pouchitis&#xD;
      because of its similarity to that of Crohn's disease. In order to maximize effect on the&#xD;
      inflamed mucosa and minimize systemic side effects, the study drug will be administered&#xD;
      locally in the pouch. In a safety and proof-of-concept intervention study, 50 µg GM-CSF will&#xD;
      be combined with 400 mg Fosfomycin and 100 mg Metronidazole, to target both the suspected&#xD;
      immunological as well as the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect on the pouch will be assessed endoscopically and histologically by taking biopsies&#xD;
      that will also be examined for changes in the microbiome. Trial participants will be&#xD;
      clinically examined and have blood samples taken to monitor for adverse reactions. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure will be an assessment of adverse reactions and tolerability of the&#xD;
      drug. Secondary outcome measures will be a change in the pouchitis disease activity index&#xD;
      (PDAI), a change in the microbial diversity, and a change in inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on a non-randomized trial design with an open-label single group&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I The tolerability of treatment will be tested on 6 trial participants with pouchitis&#xD;
      with a single dose of the combined medication applied endoscopically in the pouch. Endoscopy&#xD;
      with the taking of biopsies will be performed before and one week after administration of the&#xD;
      medication, as well as blood samples before and after the medication. After the follow-up&#xD;
      endoscopy, the trial participant will receive standard oral metronidazole or ciprofloxacin&#xD;
      treatment for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Depending on effect of the first study, the second study plans for the treatment of&#xD;
      12 trial participants. Endoscopy with biopsies will be conducted with the first application&#xD;
      of the study drug combination in the pouch, and afterward a daily dosage for another 6 days.&#xD;
      Clinical and endoscopic control after 14 days with blood samples and biopsies will be done.&#xD;
      After the follow-up endoscopy, the trial participant will receive standard oral metronidazole&#xD;
      or ciprofloxacin treatment for 10 days.&#xD;
