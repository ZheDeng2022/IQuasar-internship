      pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

      Upgraded curcumin capsules(CuminUP60®) is made from curcumin with a natural extraction&#xD;
      content of 95% and excipients through physical process microprocessing, with a curcumin&#xD;
      content of more than 60%. CuminUP60® capsules are 400 mg/ capsules and ordinary curcumin&#xD;
      capsules are 400 mg/ capsules. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioavailability by comparing the pharmacokinetics of CuminUP60® capsule with that of curcumin&#xD;
      capsule before the prescription improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 cases are planned to be enrolled.According to the random table, each subject will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups (group 1: A/B, group 2: B/A). The cleaning period&#xD;
      between the two doses is 7 days. Subjects were given the test preparation (A) or the control&#xD;
      preparation (B) on the first day of the first cycle of the trial, and were temporarily&#xD;
      allowed to leave the phase I clinical research center after 72 hours of blood sample&#xD;
      collection and vital signs examination after the completion of the medication. After a 7-day&#xD;
      wash period, on the 8th day of the second cycle, the subject will be cross-administered with&#xD;
      the control formulation (B) or the test formulation (A), all procedures are the same as in&#xD;
      the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 11th day (the second cycle), subjects will undergo physical examination, ECG&#xD;
      examination, assessment of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature), laboratory&#xD;
      examinations (blood biochemistry, blood routine, urine routine, detailed examination items&#xD;
      are shown in the appendix 1) Female subjects must undergo a blood pregnancy test and then be&#xD;
      allowed to leave the research center.&#xD;
