      The purpose of this research is to see if Heart Health Yoga (HHY) Program when added on to&#xD;
      standard cardiac rehabilitation (CR) will improve overall wellbeing and quality of life for&#xD;
      patients experiencing ischemic heart disease, heart problems caused by narrowed heart&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;

      The overarching aim of this project is to evaluate the impact of adding a novel&#xD;
      digitally-delivered wellbeing intervention, namely the Heart Health Yoga (HHY) program, on&#xD;
      overall wellbeing and quality of life (QoL), cardiovascular risk markers, adherence to&#xD;
      therapy, sleep quality, and recurrent hospitalizations amongst ischemic heart disease (IHD)&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This aim will be addressed through the&#xD;
      following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Assess the clinical efficacy of the added digitally delivered HHY program&#xD;
      compared to standard psychosocial intervention alone on overall wellbeing and QoL amongst IHD&#xD;
      patients undergoing CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Primary): To evaluate and compare the impact of the added digitally delivered HHY&#xD;
      program versus standard psychosocial intervention alone on wellbeing and QoL, as assessed&#xD;
      using the MacNew heart disease questionnaire, amongst IHD patients undergoing CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Assess the benefit of the added digitally delivered HHY program compared to&#xD;
      standard psychosocial intervention alone on cardio-metabolic risk, therapy adherence, sleep&#xD;
      quality, and recurrent hospitalization amongst IHD patients undergoing CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Secondary): Assess and compare the impact of the added digitally delivered HHY program&#xD;
      versus standard psychosocial intervention alone on cardio-metabolic risk (i.e. hs-CRP, AM&#xD;
      cortisol, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate and blood pressure), therapy adherence&#xD;
      (via weekly compliance questionnaire for HHY group, Medication Adherence Report Scale&#xD;
      [MARS-5], Fitbit activity tracker), exercise capacity (6 minute walk test) and muscular&#xD;
      strength (hand grip testing), sleep quality (measured using Fitbit), and recurrent&#xD;
      hospitalizations (determined by 1 year hospital re-admission rates) amongst IHD patients&#xD;
      undergoing CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Amongst IHD patients undergoing CR, compared to current standard psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions addition of a digitally delivered wellbeing technology will result in: 1)&#xD;
      greater improvements in overall wellbeing and quality of life; 2) a more profound reduction&#xD;
      in cardio-metabolic risk; 3) greater therapy adherence and improved sleep quality; 4) greater&#xD;
      increase in physical activity and/or exercise capacity; and 5) reduced incidence of recurrent&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: There is sparse evidence available on digitally delivered psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions for CR patients. A recent meta-analysis highlighted the feasibility and&#xD;
      benefits of web and mobile-based delivery of cardiac rehabilitation interventions on healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, quality of life and re-hospitalizations; however, the evidence was of&#xD;
      low-moderate quality. The authors also highlighted the limited evidence pertaining to&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing and overall cardiovascular risk markers [23]. Yet another&#xD;
      meta-analysis concluded that while eHealth is a feasible option for secondary prevention&#xD;
      amongst patients with coronary artery disease, much heterogeneity remains regarding modes of&#xD;
      delivery and outcome assessment. Only 6 out of 24 studies in this meta-analysis looked at&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes in addition to other traditional cardiovascular outcomes [24]. Based on&#xD;
      the aforementioned considerations, it is clear that despite the potential clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of well delivered psychosocial interventions on overall wellbeing, QoL, CV risk and outcomes,&#xD;
      the direct impact of such interventions are chronically understudied. This will be the first&#xD;
      study to assess the impact of individually delivered digital wellbeing technology namely&#xD;
      &quot;Heart Health Yoga (HHY)&quot;, on wellbeing and QoL improvement amongst IHD patients undergoing&#xD;
      CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: The Mayo Clinic CP Rehab program graduates ~200 cardiovascular disease patients per&#xD;
      year, ~35% being post-PCI. We will recruit a convenience sample of these patients' over 12&#xD;
      months. Patients who consent to take part in this research will be allocated at random (1:1)&#xD;
      to one of two groups: 1) cardiac rehabilitation plus &quot;Heart Health Yoga (HHY)&quot; or 2) cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation with standard psychosocial education component. We will exclude those with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or those on antipsychotic medications. In addition to routine CR&#xD;
      baseline assessments, baseline wellbeing and QoL will be assessed using the MacNew heart&#xD;
      disease questionnaire. Outcome measures upon completion of CR will include changes in 1)&#xD;
      Wellbeing/QoL scores, 2) Cardio-metabolic markers (hs-CRP, cortisol, body weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, BP, HR); 3) Therapy adherence (via weekly compliance questionnaire for HHY&#xD;
      group, Medication Adherence Report Scale [MARS-5], Fitbit step tracker), exercise capacity&#xD;
      (measured by 6 min walk distance) and muscular strength (measured by hand grip testing), 4)&#xD;
      Sleep quality (measured using Fitbit) &amp; 4) Recurrent hospitalizations at 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single blind randomized pilot study comparing the effects of digitally&#xD;
      delivered HHY program vs. standard psychosocial intervention on wellbeing/QoL,&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk markers, therapy adherence and recurrent hospitalizations amongst IHD&#xD;
      patients undergoing CP rehab. Eligible participants will be recruited at their first CR visit&#xD;
      with prospective enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited for the study at the time of their first visit to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation staff will offer patients the option to participate in&#xD;
      the study and obtain consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will need to consent to blood draws before and after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be scheduled for an initial appointment to confirm eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, obtain consent, randomization and baseline testing Visit 1. Randomization will be&#xD;
      done stratified on Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) categories (mild = CCI 1-2; moderate =&#xD;
      CCI 3-4; severe = CCI 5 or more). To ensure near balance in the number of patients in each&#xD;
      study arm throughout the trial, we will used blocked randomization within each CCI category&#xD;
      randomization patients to either HHY or standard of care in a 1:1 fashion with random block&#xD;
      sizes of 2 or 4 patients. Investigators and statistician will be blinded to participant&#xD;
      groups until after study completion and analysis of the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Participants must sign the informed consent form prior to being enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment: Participants will be assigned to one of the two CR groups (online HHY&#xD;
      intervention + Standard psychosocial intervention or standard psychosocial intervention only&#xD;
      control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The HHY + Standard psychosocial care group participants will complete 6 online modules&#xD;
           (12-25 minutes in length) sequentially on their own time between weeks 3-5. The length&#xD;
           of time to perform all the recommended Hatha Yoga practices daily will be less than 30&#xD;
           minutes. For the 12-week duration of the study, Hatha Yoga Practices will be completed&#xD;
           at least once daily. It is recommended for the participants to perform guided meditation&#xD;
           sessions at least twice weekly. There will be 2 online group sessions available to&#xD;
           participants for guided practice sessions. These will be timed between weeks 6-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group is the standard psychosocial care group who will receive standard&#xD;
           brief education/advice on psychosocial wellbeing and stress reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing Visit 1: Once consented, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing will be performed ~1-2 weeks prior to the start of digital HHY training.&#xD;
      Baseline data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, 6 minute&#xD;
      walk test distance, overnight fasting blood draw (cardio-metabolic biomarkers), resting blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, hand grip testing and questionnaires (Table 1). Most of the study&#xD;
      activities will occur in CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline questionnaires will include- MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication&#xD;
      adherence Report Scale [MARS-5], Brief Resilience Scale and Adverse Childhood Experience&#xD;
      questionaire. Questionnaires will be completed electronically (i.e. REDCap) or on paper.&#xD;
      Paper data will be securely stored with locked access only accessible by relevant study&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize a commercially available wearable device (i.e. Fitbit Inspire 2)&#xD;
      along with the research platform Fitabase to obtain sleep and activity data for 2 months on&#xD;
      the participants. Fitbit will be mailed to participants and they will be asked to wear device&#xD;
      as often as they can during the observation period. The participants will be able to control&#xD;
      the Fibit.com user account (uses their own email/password) associated with the Fitbit device.&#xD;
      They will be asked to authorize the Fitabase system via an email to access their Fitbit data&#xD;
      and make it available for download for analysis. As appreciation for their participation,&#xD;
      participants may keep the Fitbit device for personal use after the study period. Data will be&#xD;
      collected via Fitabase research platform which is secure&#xD;
      (https://www.fitabase.com/resources/knowledge-base/working-with-the-irb/). Data will be&#xD;
      examined for objective sleep and activity parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly compliance questionnaires will be sent to the HHY intervention group starting week 3,&#xD;
      to assess compliance with practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 at 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, resting blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate, hand grip testing, and 6-minute walk test distance and parameters.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence&#xD;
      Report Scale [MARS-5],).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 at 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post CR testing will be performed within 1 week following the final CR session. Visit 3 data&#xD;
      collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, 6-minute walk test&#xD;
      distance and parameters, resting blood pressure and heart rate and hand grip testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence&#xD;
      Report Scale [MARS-5]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 at 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference,&#xD;
      temperature, 6-minute walk test distance and parameters, overnight fasting blood draw&#xD;
      (cardio-metabolic markers), resting blood pressure and heart rate and hand grip testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence&#xD;
      Report Scale [MARS-5]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Follow-up If subjects are not able to complete the questionnaires at the visit, we can&#xD;
      send them postage paid return envelope, follow-up by e-mail or be telephone in attempt to&#xD;
      receive missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be contacted by telephone to remind them of their follow-up appointments, or to&#xD;
      troubleshoot the devices, or to remind them to follow the HHY program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remuneration Subjects will not receive any remuneration for participation in the study.&#xD;
