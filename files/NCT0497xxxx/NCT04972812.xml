  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After stroke, blood vessels in the brain can become damaged, and the brain's ability to&#xD;
      control blood flow can be impaired. The brain therefore may be less able to maintain a&#xD;
      healthy level of blood flow during challenges such as changes in posture. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that sitting upright early after stroke can cause brain blood flow to reduce. However, no&#xD;
      studies have investigated how standing up affects blood flow to the brain. In this study,&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler ultrasound will be used to assess how cerebral blood flow velocity&#xD;
      changes when acute stroke patients stand up.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical guidelines recommend that some stroke survivors should engage in out-of-bed sitting,&#xD;
      standing and walking activities early after stroke. Studies have found that compared to lying&#xD;
      flat, sitting upright reduces brain blood flow early after stroke. However, no research has&#xD;
      been done to find out how standing affects brain blood flow early after stroke. The&#xD;
      transition from sitting to standing causes blood to move away from the head toward the legs,&#xD;
      which can lower blood pressure and brain blood flow. In healthy individuals, blood vessels in&#xD;
      the brain respond to reduced blood flow and blood pressure by dilating (widening), diverting&#xD;
      more blood to the brain. After a stroke, the blood vessels in the brain can become damaged&#xD;
      and their ability to control blood flow can be impaired. This raises the concern that&#xD;
      standing early after a stroke could cause brain blood flow to drop too low which may worsen&#xD;
      the brain injury. A recent large-scale trial reported that starting rehabilitation activities&#xD;
      (including standing) earlier (18.5 hours vs 22.4 hours after stroke) resulted in poorer&#xD;
      recovery of physical function measured three months after stroke. Lowered brain blood flow,&#xD;
      caused by standing, may have contributed to this negative outcome. However, the effects of&#xD;
      standing on brain blood flow early after stroke have not yet been investigated. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of standing on cerebral blood flow velocity, measured using&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler ultrasound, within 1-7 days of stroke onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with acute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke admitted to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital&#xD;
      (Sheffield, England) will be recruited to this study after providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilisation Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to rest in a semi-recumbent position in their hospital bed, with&#xD;
      their head resting on a pillow. A transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) device (Viasys&#xD;
      Sonara, Viasys Healthcare Inc., USA) will then be fixed to the head using a lightweight,&#xD;
      comfortable headset. A heart rate monitor (Polar H10, Polar Electro, UK) will then be fitted&#xD;
      around the upper torso, directly below the sternum, using an elasticated strap containing&#xD;
      built-in electrodes. A blood pressure cuff (Dinamap, GE Heathcare Systems Inc., USA) will&#xD;
      then be fitted on the left arm, over the brachial artery. Participants will then be lowered&#xD;
      to a supine position (0˚), and baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity, heart rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) measures will be recorded after five minutes of rest. CBF velocity, heart&#xD;
      rate and BP will be then be assessed in the following positions: semi-recumbent (30˚),&#xD;
      sitting upright (90˚) and standing. Participants will spend three minutes in each position. A&#xD;
      bedside remote control will be used to increase the bed angle from 0˚ to 30˚ over a period of&#xD;
      10 seconds (~3˚ per second); the participant will not be required to lift their head away&#xD;
      from the pillow during the first transition (0˚ to 30˚). After three minutes spent at 30˚,&#xD;
      the participant will be asked to move to an upright sitting position (90˚) with their legs&#xD;
      hanging over the edge of the hospital bed (feet in contact with the floor), with assistance&#xD;
      provided by a healthcare professional. After three minutes of sitting upright, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to move into a standing position, with assistance provided by a&#xD;
      healthcare professional. Participants will be given as much time as they need to move into&#xD;
      sitting and standing positions. After three minutes of standing, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to sit in a chair which has a backrest while the TCD headset, heart rate strap and BP cuff&#xD;
      are removed. This will be the end of the study visit, and usual care rehabilitation&#xD;
      activities will continue as normal thereafter. During the mobilisation protocol, CBF velocity&#xD;
      and heart rate will be recorded continuously whereas BP will be measured at the first and&#xD;
      third minute in each position in accordance with the timeframes used to measure transient and&#xD;
      delayed orthostatic hypotension, respectively. Signs or symptoms of light-headedness and&#xD;
      deterioration of motor, cognitive or sensory function will be recorded. As this is a&#xD;
      pragmatic, observational study, the study visit time of day will not be standardised.&#xD;
