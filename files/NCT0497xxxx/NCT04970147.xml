      The concept of care bundle; It was developed by the American Institute for Healthcare&#xD;
      Improvement (IHI) in 2001 to provide the best care safely in order to achieve desired results&#xD;
      in patient care, increase compliance with standard procedures, improve patient safety and&#xD;
      quality of care. Ensuring that nurses perform gastrostomy care correctly and according to the&#xD;
      guidelines published in international standards will minimize the development of problems&#xD;
      that may arise in gastrostomy care. The aim of this study was to development and&#xD;
      implementation the gastrostomy care bundle for gastrostomy care.&#xD;

      The concept of care bundle; It was developed by the American Institute for Healthcare&#xD;
      Improvement (IHI) in 2001 to provide the best care safely in order to achieve desired results&#xD;
      in patient care, increase compliance with standard procedures, improve patient safety and&#xD;
      quality of care. Ensuring that nurses perform gastrostomy care correctly and according to the&#xD;
      guidelines published in international standards will minimize the development of problems&#xD;
      that may arise in gastrostomy care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The research was planned as a mixed type research design in order to development and&#xD;
      implementation the gastrostomy care bundle for gastrostomy care. The study was planned to be&#xD;
      carried out in Hacettepe University Adult Hospital Brain and neurosurgery intensive care unit&#xD;
      between September 2021 and September 2022. In the quantitative phase of the research; The&#xD;
      development of the gastrostomy care bundle will be carried out using the care bundle&#xD;
      development approach in line with the recommendations of the Institute for Healthcare&#xD;
      Improvement (IHI) and expert opinions will be taken. Nurses working in the brain and&#xD;
      neurosurgery intensive care unit will be trained on the gastrostomy care bundle and will be&#xD;
      expected to practice care bundle. Before the training, nurses will be asked to fill in the&#xD;
      &quot;Nurse Introductory Information Form&quot;, &quot;Evidence-Based Attitude Scale towards Nursing&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Gastrostomy Care Questionnaire (pre-test)&quot;. The nurse population of the research will&#xD;
      consist of 14 nurses working in the brain and neurosurgery intensive care unit. At this&#xD;
      stage, the sample selection will not be made, and it will be tried to reach all of the&#xD;
      working nurses. The &quot;Gastrostomy Care bundle&quot; form will be used by the nurses in the&#xD;
      gastrostomy care in the brain and Neurosurgery intensive care unit between September 2021 and&#xD;
      September 2022 , which is determined for the patient sample. Nurses' compliance with the care&#xD;
      bundle will be evaluated by the researcher with the &quot;Gastrostomy Care Bundle Compliance&#xD;
      Evaluation Control Form&quot; by making daily visits to the intensive care unit. At the end of the&#xD;
      period determined for the use of the care bundle in the intensive care unit, the nurses will&#xD;
      be asked to fill in the &quot;Evidence-Based Attitude Scale towards Nursing&quot; and &quot;Gastrostomy Care&#xD;
      Questionnaire (post-test)&quot;. In the qualitative phase of the research, nurses working in the&#xD;
      brain and neurosurgery intensive care unit will be interviewed about their experiences with&#xD;
      the use of gastrostomy care bundle. At the end of the study, nurses' compliance with the use&#xD;
      of care bundle, the effect of gastrostomy care bundle use/gastrostomy education on nurses'&#xD;
      knowledge levels and attitudes towards evidence-based nursing, and nurses' views on&#xD;
      gastrostomy care bundle will be evaluated.&#xD;
