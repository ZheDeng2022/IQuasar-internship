      The CAMUS Delphi Study: A Consensus on Reporting of Complications After Urological Surgeries&#xD;
      is a multi-staged, international Delphi study that aims to establish criteria for&#xD;
      standardised complication reporting in Urology. The initial survey consists of a 12-part&#xD;
      questionnaire that will aim to reach consensus on a wide range of contentious issues in&#xD;
      Urological surgery using the frameworks of both the established Clavien-Dindo Classification&#xD;
      (CDC) and the new CAMUS Classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure comprehensive and comparable complication reporting across centres worldwide, a&#xD;
      conclusive uniform language for reporting complications must be created and subsequently&#xD;
      integrated. Accurate reporting will allow for more precise allocation of resources, improve&#xD;
      unit efficiency, and reduce healthcare burden, while providing clinicians with a better&#xD;
      understanding of intra- and post-operative morbidity. If a comprehensive, homogenous&#xD;
      reporting construct is integrated worldwide, the potential to build and develop a universal&#xD;
      database with complications from all centres around the world will surely provide invaluable&#xD;
      data to create new guidelines and recommendations, ultimately improving patient counselling&#xD;
      and surgical quality of care.&#xD;
