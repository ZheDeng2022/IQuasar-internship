  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a survey (The Family Supports and Beliefs Survey), which will&#xD;
      measure their existing beliefs about the role of societal resources in supporting families&#xD;
      and young children. Participants will randomly see one of four fictional scenarios and then&#xD;
      be asked questions related to that scenario as well as items related to stress and&#xD;
      self-efficacy. We hypothesize that the type of scenario a participant is presented with&#xD;
      before taking a survey may affect how they answer subsequent questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This survey is being administered as part of a broader project designed to test items that&#xD;
      are being developed for a new measure, the Survey of Parent/Provider Expectations and&#xD;
      Knowledge Computer Adaptive Test (SPEAK CAT).&#xD;
