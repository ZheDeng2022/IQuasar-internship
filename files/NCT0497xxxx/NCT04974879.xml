  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no muture method to treat EGFR 20 insertion mutation non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). the he purpose of this study is to study osimertinib combined with bevacizumab in&#xD;
      the management of it.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is the most common cause of death&#xD;
      from cancer (almost 20 percent [%] of cancer deaths); NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung&#xD;
      cancers. The hypothesis is that osimertinib combined bevacizumab in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC characterized by EGFR Exon 20ins activating mutations. Efficacy&#xD;
      assessments will include disease assessment, symptomatic progression and patient-reported&#xD;
      outcome. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and&#xD;
      clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and&#xD;
      urinalysis).&#xD;
