  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) is a complex condition that involves chest wall&#xD;
      deformities that can affect normal breathing and lung growth. In most cases, children with&#xD;
      TIS are also born with spine disorders such as scoliosis. The inability of the thorax to&#xD;
      support normal respiration or lung growth can cause respiratory distress and even mortality.&#xD;
      Investigators aim to validate MRI imaging sequences to use as an assessment tool for&#xD;
      pulmonary function.&#xD;

    <measure>Analyze volume of lungs at end-inspiration and end-expiration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will analyze lung volume at end-inspiration and end-expiration will be assessed by performing a thoracic dynamic magnetic resonance imaging scan; measured in total volume units (mL)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Xenon-129 MRI Ventilation Maps</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Xenon-129 MRI will be completed to reveal unventilated regions of the lungs where the gas cannot reach after being inhaled due to restrictions of the airways.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) maps</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) maps will be extracted from 129Xe MRI maps in a single breath-hold. Regions of the lungs that show abnormal PAO2 values are susceptible of improper ventilation or gas exchange.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity will be extracted from the computer-automated dynamic lung MRI software.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced expiratory volume (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume data will be extracted from the computer-automated dynamic lung MRI software to assess the volume of air forced from the lungs</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Xenon-129 MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are extracted from the Xenon-129 MRI from a single breath-hold pulse sequence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>total lung capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>functional residual capacity (FRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>functional residual capacity data will be extracted from the computer-automated dynamic lung MRI software to measure the volume in the lungs at the end of passive expiration</description>
