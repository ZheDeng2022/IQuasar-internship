  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to a recent consumer poll, over 20 million Americans regularly use cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD). Moreover, 64 million Americans (over 25% of the population) report trying CBD at least&#xD;
      once within the previous 2 years. Since the passing of the 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act,&#xD;
      the use of hemp-derived products, such as CBD, is highly prevalent across North America. The&#xD;
      acceleration of the use of CBD has outpaced our understanding of the associated potential&#xD;
      risks and benefits, and the way it is processed within the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current proposed project, investigators wish to continue our ongoing collaboration&#xD;
      with Caliper Foods, a Colorado-based manufacturer of CBD products. The focus of this project&#xD;
      is three-fold: (1) investigators will compare the pharmacokinetics of different formulations&#xD;
      of ingestible CBD; (2) investigators will examine the potential two-way interaction between a&#xD;
      meal and one formulation of ingestible CBD; and, (3) investigators will examine the influence&#xD;
      of different formulations of CBD on markers of liver function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetics describes the speed in which something that is ingested is made available&#xD;
      within the body (i.e. bioavailability).There are many different preparations/formulations of&#xD;
      CBD and they may differ from one another with regards to their pharmacokinetics. One&#xD;
      important consideration when evaluating CBD formulations is the pharmacokinetic goal and&#xD;
      intended use. For example, if the indication for the CBD is to treat acute pain, then a&#xD;
      faster time to peak concentration (Tmax) and higher maximal concentration (Cmax) may be&#xD;
      desirable, and also may help to decrease the risk of overdose due to premature repeat self&#xD;
      administration. Alternatively, as a chronic treatment for anxiety, a larger area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) may be preferable if a user follows a regular dosing schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One purpose of the proposed project is to compare the pharmacokinetics of different&#xD;
      formulations of CBD. The formulations will be standardized for CBD dose (30 mg) but will&#xD;
      differ in their preparation (e.g. water vs. fat-soluble).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies have demonstrated an influence of eating on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ingested CBD. The general consensus appears to be that prior ingestion of a high-fat meal&#xD;
      increases the maximal concentration of circulating CBD (Cmax) and lowers the time to attain&#xD;
      peak circulating concentration (Tmax).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One purpose of the proposed project is to study the influence of a standardized meal on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a CBD formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the influence of ingested CBD on postprandial metabolism. The thermic&#xD;
      effect of feeding (i.e. the increase in metabolic rate above resting metabolism) is&#xD;
      considered an important physiological determinant of energy balance, and therefore also of&#xD;
      weight gain or loss. Further, the dynamics of circulating glucose and triglycerides following&#xD;
      a meal are reflective of metabolic health and predictive of future cardiometabolic disease&#xD;
      risk. CBD has been purported to have a variety of beneficial physiological properties,&#xD;
      including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. Either of these individual properties&#xD;
      alone could favorably modify postprandial metabolism, given that CBD potentially does both,&#xD;
      it appears likely that CBD might improve the physiological regulation of postprandial&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One purpose of the proposed project is to determine the influence of CBD on postprandial&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver plays a critical regulatory role in postprandial metabolism, and also with the&#xD;
      physiological processing of cannabinoids. The relationship between the use of cannabinoids&#xD;
      and liver health is unclear. While early studies implied that exposure of the liver to very&#xD;
      high daily dosing of cannabinoids may be detrimental, more recent studies are suggesting that&#xD;
      some cannabinoids, including CBD, may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The acute effects of low dose CBD (e.g. 30 mg) on liver&#xD;
      function in healthy adults have not been well described, and may be influenced by the&#xD;
      formulation of the CBD product (i.e. whether it is water or lipid soluble).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One purpose of the proposed project is to determine the acute influence of different&#xD;
      formulations of CBD on circulating markers of liver function.&#xD;
