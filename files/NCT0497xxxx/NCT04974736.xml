  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to develop an innovative and disseminable electronic health record&#xD;
      (iEHR)-based approach that supports optimal primary care workflows to routinely screen&#xD;
      families for tobacco and e-cigarette use, address household smoking behavior and promote&#xD;
      smoke-free and e-cigarette free home and car rules in a routine and effective manner in the&#xD;
      pediatric setting. Additionally, parents enrolled in the study will be offered assistance by&#xD;
      a community health navigator (CHN). This study aims to examine how effective the iEHR +&#xD;
      Navigator strategy is compared to usual care control.&#xD;

    <description>The iEHR + Navigator intervention consists of an iEHR part of the intervention in the pediatric primary care setting which will include routine screening of families for tobacco use and treatment delivery to parents who smoke and will be linked to the child's electronic health record.&#xD;
The enrolled parents will also be offered support from Community Health Navigators, who will work with offices to provide customized cessation support to tobacco users, ensuring access to medications and services.</description>
