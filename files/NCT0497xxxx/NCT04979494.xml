  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) is related to poor outcomes of critically ill patients&#xD;
      [1] through many underlying mechanisms [2]. It is also a part of the process of multiple&#xD;
      organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, the morbidity of acute gastrointestinal&#xD;
      dysfunction in critically ill patients is highly underestimated due to the scarcity of&#xD;
      accurate measurement and thus the causes are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators are going to apply the technique of point-of-care ultrasound&#xD;
      (POCUS) evaluation on the bowel diameters, wall thickness and movement combined with&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure to determine the occurrence of AGI. The superior mesenteric artery&#xD;
      (SMA) blood flow is also evaluated by POCUS to find out the association between SMA blood&#xD;
      flow and AGI.&#xD;

      1. Patients are recruited within 24 hours of our surgical ICU admission. The patients are&#xD;
           mostly admitted for post-surgery monitor in case of complications due to their baseline&#xD;
           health conditions. In some cases, patients are admitted from the emergency room because&#xD;
           of severe sickness. Those who are with deep sedation and mechanical ventilation during&#xD;
           the first ultrasound evaluation are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or next of kin before the&#xD;
           recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information will be collected at enrollment, including demographic characteristics,&#xD;
           diagnosis, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be two phases of ultrasound evaluation. In Phase One, investigators perform&#xD;
           ultrasound evaluation within 24 hours after ICU admission to investigate the SMA blood&#xD;
           flow in supine position using POCUS. In Phase Two, starting after the enteral feeding&#xD;
           has been initiated, usually within 3 days after the enrollment, ultrasound evaluation on&#xD;
           GI function will be performed according to gastrointestinal and urinary tract sonography&#xD;
           ultrasound (GUTS) protocol using POCUS. GUTS protocol includes the ultrasound&#xD;
           measurement for bowel diameter, bowel wall thickness, peristalsis combined with&#xD;
           intra-abdominal pressure(IAP) measured through ureteral catheterization. All&#xD;
           measurements would be used to calculate GUTS score to grade the AGI [4].&#xD;

    <description>Gastrointestinal and urinary tract sonography ultrasound (GUTS) score will be calculate using a combination bowel diameter in centimeters, bowel wall thickness in centimeters, peristalsis (with or without) using ultrasound, and intra-abdominal pressure in millimeters of mercury measured through urethral tubes[3]. GUTS score is ranging from 0 to 4, and a higher GUTS score means worse gastrointestinal function. A GUTS score more than or equal to 2 is considered as acute gastrointestinal injury(AGI)in this study.</description>
