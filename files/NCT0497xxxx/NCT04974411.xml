  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, although the clinical treatment of sepsis has been greatly improved, it is&#xD;
      still an important cause of death in ICU patients, and seriously threatens human health. Its&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers have become one of the bottlenecks in the field of disease diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment and development of effective drugs to reduce incidence rate and mortality. This&#xD;
      will eventually become the key point of treatment for patients with sepsis. In the early&#xD;
      stage, the investigators have established a single center sepsis database and sepsis animal&#xD;
      model, and made a preliminary exploration on the mechanism and treatment of sepsis. Based on&#xD;
      the previous results, this study intends to create a national multi center sepsis apparent&#xD;
      database and sample bank, collect the data of sepsis patients' injury characteristics,&#xD;
      clinical characteristics, biochemical indicators, micro multidimensional and omics results,&#xD;
      etiological characteristics, etc., and integrate them. Using big data combined with machine&#xD;
      learning method, the early warning and real-time course monitoring model of traumatic sepsis&#xD;
      is established. The completion of this project can achieve early warning of sepsis, real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of the progress of the disease, early rational allocation of medical care, and&#xD;
      reduce the mortality of sepsis patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is one of the most fatal diseases worldwide, characterized by high incidence rate&#xD;
      (18.6/1 000 hospitalization) and high mortality (50%). The patients often need to be treated&#xD;
      in ICU, and the medical cost accounts for a large proportion. The ideal state, that is,&#xD;
      accurate and early identification, must be the key point to influence the clinical&#xD;
      decision-making of sepsis and guide more accurate treatment and intervention. With the&#xD;
      development and improvement of pre hospital emergency technology, surgical technology and&#xD;
      intensive care technology, the early mortality of patients with sepsis decreased&#xD;
      significantly, but the mortality caused by multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) increased&#xD;
      significantly. However, there are few reports on early sepsis warning and real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of sepsis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing research on early warning and course monitoring of sepsis can be roughly divided&#xD;
      into demographic data, trauma severity score system, physiological and biochemical&#xD;
      indicators, genetic background and so on. However, most studies only focus on the&#xD;
      significance of a single index in the early warning and diagnosis of sepsis, which can only&#xD;
      reflect one aspect of the body, and the diagnostic sensitivity is not high. Although there&#xD;
      are a few multi marker related studies, such as the haplotype (- 1082-819-592ata) of three&#xD;
      gene polymorphisms in IL-10 promoter region can affect the risk of sepsis in a small&#xD;
      population (114 cases). The combination of plasma and cell biomarkers in critically ill&#xD;
      patients suggests that the combination of plasma PCT, sTREM-1 and neutrophil CD64 index is&#xD;
      better than single index in the early warning diagnosis of sepsis risk. However, this kind of&#xD;
      research is still limited to a certain kind of indicators, and its clinical guidance value is&#xD;
      limited. In addition, metabonomics and proteomics also have great potential to help identify&#xD;
      specific sepsis phenotypes, and to find much-needed predictive and prognostic biomarkers, so&#xD;
      as to guide more personalized management and treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to&#xD;
      integrate the injury characteristics, clinical characteristics, biochemical indicators, micro&#xD;
      multidimensional and omics results, etiological characteristics and other data to make&#xD;
      accurate and efficient early warning and course monitoring of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project team has established a single center sepsis database in the early stage, and how&#xD;
      to expand the scale of the database in the future, and use the samples in the sample library&#xD;
      for multidimensional and omics methods to screen 100 biological molecular targets. Further&#xD;
      research will integrate sepsis patients' injury characteristics, clinical characteristics,&#xD;
      biochemical indicators, micro multidimensional and omics results, etiological characteristics&#xD;
      and other relatively independent parts, and use big data combined with machine learning&#xD;
      method to establish early warning and real-time course monitoring model of traumatic sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out from the following three levels: 1) to establish a multi&#xD;
      center database of patients with sepsis; ② 100 biological molecular targets were screened by&#xD;
      micro multidimensional and omics, and the data of injury characteristics, clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, biochemical indexes, micro multidimensional and omics results, etiological&#xD;
      characteristics and other aspects of sepsis patients were integrated to establish an early&#xD;
      accurate early warning and real-time disease monitoring model of sepsis; ③ The application of&#xD;
      the prediction model in sepsis patients was further verified by a cross regional multicenter&#xD;
      prospective cohort study.&#xD;
