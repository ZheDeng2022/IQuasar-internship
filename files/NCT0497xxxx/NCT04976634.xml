      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of belzutifan in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in multiple solid tumors including&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (PDAC), and biliary tract cancer (BTC). There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study.&#xD;
