  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pSS seen in the Division of Rheumatology, the second affiliated hospital of&#xD;
      Zhejiang University, School of Medicine (SAHZU) during January 2016 to July 2018, were&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed. Characteristics were analyzed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pSS were retrospectively reviewed, and pSS-ILD and pSS non-ILD were identified.&#xD;
      Clinical data, laboratory parameters, pulmonary high-resolution CT (HRCT), and pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests (PFTs) were collected. pSS-ILD patients were further categorized into&#xD;
      subgroups according to HRCT patterns or PFTs.&#xD;

        Eighty-five patients with pSS-ILD were identified, and 85 patients with pSS non-ILD were&#xD;
        used for comparison. The average age at disease onset and median disease duration in&#xD;
        patients with pSS-ILD were greater when compared with pSS non-ILD patients. There was no&#xD;
        difference regarding presenting symptoms at disease onset between pSS-ILD and pSS non-ILD&#xD;
        patients.&#xD;
