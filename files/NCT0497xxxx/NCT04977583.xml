  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impacts of unmet social needs, such as homelessness, inconsistent access to food, and&#xD;
      exposure to violence on health are well-established, especially for cardiovascular disease. A&#xD;
      limited but growing body of evidence suggests that screening for and addressing these needs -&#xD;
      also referred as social determinants of health -- in clinic settings helps to connect&#xD;
      patients to resources to address unmet needs and has the potential to improve health&#xD;
      outcomes. Veterans carry a high burden of unmet needs. At present, VA systematically screens&#xD;
      for only two unmet needs; homelessness and food insecurity. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of systematically screening Veterans for nine unmet needs (i.e., housing,&#xD;
      food insecurity, utility insecurity, transportation, legal problems, employment, safety,&#xD;
      stress, and social isolation), and compare the effect of referral mechanisms of varying&#xD;
      intensity on Veterans' connection to resources, reduction of unmet needs, treatment&#xD;
      adherence, reduced preventable hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Despite medical advances, up to 70% of health outcomes are due to social&#xD;
      determinants of health (SDoH) - the conditions in which people live and work that shape&#xD;
      whether basic needs (e.g., housing, food) are met. These associations are especially well&#xD;
      documented for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In response, health policy leaders recommend&#xD;
      screening and referral (S&amp;R) for unmet needs in clinical settings, and the American Heart&#xD;
      Association recently concluded that the most significant opportunities for reducing CVD death&#xD;
      and disability lie with addressing the social determinants of cardiovascular outcomes. A&#xD;
      limited but promising evidence base supports these recommendations but more rigorous research&#xD;
      is needed to guide how best to intervene on unmet needs that affect health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Impact: This project addresses the Office of Social Work's priority to link&#xD;
      Veterans with resources and services in support of treatment goals, the Office of Patient&#xD;
      Centered Care and Cultural Transformation's priority to enhance the physical, emotional, and&#xD;
      social well-being of the whole person, the Office of Health Equity's priority to reduce&#xD;
      disparities, and the HSR&amp;D priorities of health equity and population health. Our study will&#xD;
      provide much-needed evidence to document the burden of Veterans' unmet needs, inform how best&#xD;
      to address unmet needs, and assess how such a process can affect adherence (to medications&#xD;
      and appointments), utilization, and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: VA currently systematically screens for only two unmet needs (homelessness and&#xD;
      food insecurity). Identification of other unmet needs (and referral to address them) occurs&#xD;
      on an ad hoc basis, with varying approaches among clinics/ clinicians. The investigators will&#xD;
      implement comprehensive screening of eight unmet needs and systematic referral, developing&#xD;
      tools and processes that, if efficacious, can be implemented within VA (and other) clinical&#xD;
      systems. VA is currently funding several studies related to SDoH, but none test interventions&#xD;
      that systematically identify a wide range of unmet social needs among Veterans and connect&#xD;
      Veterans with identified needs to social service resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) Describe the burden and distribution of nine unmet needs (i.e., housing;&#xD;
      food insecurity; utility insecurity; transportation; legal guidance; employment; safety; and&#xD;
      social isolation) among Veterans with or at-risk for CVD, and identify their associations&#xD;
      with sociodemographic characteristics, and baseline health-related behaviors and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes; 2) Compare the effects of three S&amp;R study intervention conditions of varying&#xD;
      intensity on Veterans' connection to new SDoH resources (primary outcome), reduction of unmet&#xD;
      needs, adherence, and clinical outcomes, and 3) Identify barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      Veterans' connecting with social services and having needs met, and explanatory factors for&#xD;
      observed RCT outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The investigators propose a 3-year, two-phased mixed methods study. In Phase One&#xD;
      (Aims 1 and 2), the investigators will implement a three-armed randomized controlled trial at&#xD;
      three VA sites to compare outcomes among Veterans randomized within each site to one of three&#xD;
      study conditions: screening only; screening plus provision of tailored resource sheets; or&#xD;
      screening plus resource sheets plus social work support. For each Veteran, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine associations of unmet needs with baseline outcomes (Aim 1), and longitudinally&#xD;
      examine the impact of each approach on connection to new SDoH resources and follow-up&#xD;
      outcomes over a 12-month period (Aim 2). In Phase Two (Aim 3), the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      interviews with Veterans and representatives of the VA- and community-based programs to which&#xD;
      Veterans are referred because of the trial to identify facilitators and barriers and&#xD;
      potential explanatory factors related to the relative success of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation/Next Steps: If the intervention yields positive results, findings will be used&#xD;
      by partners to support more widespread implementation of it throughout VA.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators are implementing a three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) at three VA sites to compare outcomes among Veterans with one or more unmet social needs randomized within each site to one of three intervention arms. The investigators have the following study arms/conditions: unmet needs screening only by Research Assistant (&quot;Screening&quot; arm&quot;; Screening plus provision of a tailored Resource Sheet listing available resources to address identified needs (&quot;Awareness&quot; arm); Screening plus provision of tailored Resource Sheet plus research team social worker-supported referral to assist with connection to resources to address unmet needs (&quot;Assistance&quot; arm).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Connection to New Resources</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as participant connecting to one or more resources since the index unmet need screen and assessed via a participant survey administered 8 weeks following the index unmet need screen. The survey will ask: &quot;Since you completed the unmet social need screen on (insert date), were you able to connect with any of the programs or resources for help with (insert need(s) identified)&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unmet Need Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the results from the index screen for unmet needs to those from the unmet needs screen administered six months after the index screen. The investigators will define unmet need reduction in two ways: 1) one or more of baseline unmet needs no longer identified as an unmet need at the 6-month rescreen, and; 2) percentage of baseline needs not reported as unmet needs at 6-month rescreen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preventable Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Also know as Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs). This indicator has been adopted by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) under the label &quot;Prevention Quality Indicators&quot; (PQI). The investigators will examine effects on all 13 admission conditions identified using AHRQ criteria. The investigators will assess this measure using VA Corporate Warehouse Data (CDW).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urgent Care Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Emergency Department and urgent care visits. The investigators will assess this measure using CDW.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess adherence to CVD and CVD risk factor medications, including all possible drug class codes (CV000-CV900, encompassing Antilipemic agents and antihypertensives for the subsets of patients prescribed these medications) and, among the subset of patients with DM, diabetes medications (HS501-509). The investigators will measure this outcome using pharmacy dispensing data from CDW to specify the proportion of days covered (PDC) of each medication, using well-established methods from prior studies. To calculate this, the investigators will count the number of days dispensed in relation to the dispensing period. The numerator will be based on the prescription fill dates and number of days dispensed to determine the number of outpatient days for which each medication was supplied. Patients will be considered adherent if they achieved a PDC &gt; 80%, a commonly used threshold of adherence which is positively associated with clinical outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinic Visit Appointment Attendance (&quot;no-show&quot;)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each patient, the investigators will calculate a no-show rate, or the proportion of primary care and cardiology appointments that are classified as no-show, relative to the total number of appointments scheduled in both, following the approach taken by other VA investigators using CDW data to assess this metric. The numerator (&quot;no-shows&quot;) consists of appointments marked as a no-show and appointments canceled by the patient or clinic after the appointment time. The denominator (&quot;total appointments&quot;) consists of no-shows and completed appointments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure (BP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>BP is measured at every PC visit, and the investigators will obtain these measurements from CDW. In the rare case of missing BP data, the investigators will exclude such Veterans from the analysis. Because BP outcomes are also affected by clinicians' adjustment or titration of antihypertensive medications, the investigators will assess the effects of controlling for treatment intensification (TI), using methods similar to the published approaches used in prior work. The investigators will use the following formula to measure TI: (visits with medication changes-visits with elevated BP) / (number of clinic visits).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is available from CDW. The investigators anticipate approximately 40% of our RCT sample to have DM, based on a preparatory-to-research analysis of CDW data. To ensure the values reflect health status around the time of the index screen and the 6 and 12-month follow-up window, the investigators will only include Veterans with DM who have an Hba1c in the 6 months prior to each time point. Approximately 17% of patients with DM do not have an HbA1c test within VA in the prior year.</description>
