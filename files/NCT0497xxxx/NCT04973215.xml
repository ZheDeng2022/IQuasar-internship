  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health problems seem one major reason for why not all refugees, especially women, fulfill the&#xD;
      introduction program (IP) and enter the labour market after the end of the program. This&#xD;
      challenges integration, and can lead to increased inequalities in society. The HealthIntro&#xD;
      pilot-project and existing knowledge point towards a mismatch between the IP's goal to&#xD;
      integrate as many refugees as possible into the labour market as soon as possible, and the&#xD;
      demanding situation refugees with complex (health) challenges face after resettlement in the&#xD;
      host country. Particular barriers seem related to the little flexibility of the introduction&#xD;
      law, difficulties with collaboration between public services and with involving refugees in&#xD;
      decision-making regarding program adjustments. It is known that refugees have more health&#xD;
      problems than the rest of the population. Additionally, current trends in integration policy&#xD;
      result in increasing numbers of refugees with complex challenges in municipalities, often&#xD;
      families in which one or several members have health problems. It is therefore of high&#xD;
      importance to develop strategies that enable municipalities to work more effectively with&#xD;
      these most vulnerable group of refugees in the early phase of resettlement and during the IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with three North Norwegian municipalities and refugees, the investigators&#xD;
      will explore how health problems interconnect with program participation on the national&#xD;
      level, the municipal level and in a family context. Moreover, the investigators will use this&#xD;
      knowledge to collaboratively generate ideas on how to improve the strategic work in&#xD;
      municipalities with refugees with health problems. More specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      link registerdata on a national level, conduct explorative qualitative studies addressing the&#xD;
      system level in municipalities, and the family and everday life context of refugee families,&#xD;
      and conduct an action research inspired study to initiating change in municipalities.&#xD;
