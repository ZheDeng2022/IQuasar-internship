  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial sought to: 1) evaluate implementation of&#xD;
      a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy treatment for chronic pain delivered by an&#xD;
      integrated behavioral health consultant in primary care; and to 2) explore treatment outcomes&#xD;
      and their associated mechanisms of change.&#xD;

      Background: Most patients with chronic pain obtain their treatment in primary care settings,&#xD;
      where evidence-based behavioral interventions are not typically provided, despite robust&#xD;
      evidence for treatments like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial sought to: 1) evaluate&#xD;
      implementation of a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy treatment for chronic pain&#xD;
      delivered by an integrated behavioral health consultant in primary care; and to 2) explore&#xD;
      treatment outcomes and their associated mechanisms of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Mixed-methods pilot randomized controlled trial. Active participants completed one&#xD;
      30-minute individual Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (FACT) visit followed by 3&#xD;
      weekly 60-minute group visits and a booster visit 2 months later. An enhanced treatment as&#xD;
      usual (ETAU) control group received 4 handouts about pain management based on cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral science. Follow-up research visits occurred during and after treatment, at 12&#xD;
      weeks (booster visit), and at 6 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted after the&#xD;
      last research visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: A small integrated primary care clinic in southwestern U.S. affiliated with an&#xD;
      academic medical center&#xD;

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a 10-item self-report scale that assesses perceived disability and functional impairment across a range of daily activities, with higher scores indicating greater perceived disability. Although originally developed as a measure of back pain, we used an established modified version that asked about &quot;pain&quot; rather than &quot;back pain.&quot; The ODI uses a 6-point Likert scale for each item, which is summed to create a total score (maximum 50) that is then divided by highest possible score based on items skipped, and doubled to provide a percentage of patient perceived disability. The ODI and has been validated across a wide range of populations as a reliable and useful indicator of overall disability. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of intervention and study (attrition and satisfaction ratings)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility was evaluated using a priori established benchmarks: (a) &lt; 25% participant attrition; (b) at least 80% of participants rating the FACT program as satisfactory as measured by response of at least 5 on a 7-point Likert-scale (1= Not Satisfied at All, 7 = Very Satisfied). The satisfaction question was asked in the context of an &quot;exit interview&quot;: all participants who completed the 6-month follow-up assessment were contacted by the PI to provide feedback on their experiences in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the FACT intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the FACT intervention from the participants' perspective was measured via 3 Likert-scale questions gathered during the semi-structured interview focused on: perceived benefit, ease of learning about pain management, and whether the participant would recommend the FACT treatment to a friend or family member</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Pain Acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>Booster (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) assesses the degree to which activities are done in the presence of chronic pain and pain-related experiences (Activities Engagement), and the degree of effort put in to controlling pain (Willingness). Each of the 20 items uses a 6-point numerical rating scale. The CPAQ has acceptable psychometrics in many studies and each item uses a 6-point numerical rating scale. There are no established cut-points, although higher scores on the CPAQ indicate greater acceptance of chronic pain. Scores range from 0 - 120.</description>

    <measure>Engagement in Valued Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Booster (12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Pain Values Inventory (CPVI) identifies which values are important to a person with chronic pain, and assesses the degree of success they are having in following their values. The valued domains are family, intimate relations, friends, work, health, and growth or learning. The 12-item CPVI uses 6-point Likert scale questions to measure the discrepancy between ratings of importance of valued life areas and success in engaging in those life areas; lower scores reflect greater alignment (i.e., less discrepancy) between values and actions in one's life. Scores range from 0-6.</description>

    <description>Focused Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (FACT): FACT is a brief type of cognitive behavioral therapy that helps patients reduce disability through increased acceptance, reconnection with values, and reduced unhelpful control/coping strategies. Patients randomized to the intervention group received FACT per the study manual, delivered by an integrated Behavioral Health Consultant (BHC). Patients had one individual visit (30 minutes) and three consecutive weekly group visits (one hour) followed by a booster visit two months later. These classes (group visits) were rolling, not cohort-driven, meaning new and returning patients will be attending together. After the individual BHC visit and each class, patients had behavioral &quot;homework&quot; to complete.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the Enhanced-Treatment As Usual (ETAU) group received &quot;enhancement&quot; of usual primary care via 1-page (2-sided) educational handouts on four topic areas: Sleep, Pacing, Relaxation and Goal Setting. All topics have an evidence base in standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy treatment of pain. One handout per assessment visit was given to each patient. Patients will continue to see their primary care clinicians and have access to all routine clinical services throughout the study.</description>
