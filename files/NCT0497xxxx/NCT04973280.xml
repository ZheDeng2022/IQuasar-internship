  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional post-authorization safety study (PASS) employing a cross&#xD;
      sectional design to evaluate the effectiveness of the additional risk minimization measures&#xD;
      (aRMMs) for REBLOZYL. A survey will be used to measure the knowledge and comprehension of the&#xD;
      REBLOZYL aRMMs among European Economic Area (EEA) based healthcare professionals (HCPs). The&#xD;
      PASS will be conducted among HCPs in a representative sample of EEA countries where REBLOZYL&#xD;
      is commercially available, potentially including Austria, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the&#xD;
      Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. Additional EEA countries may be included, as needed, based on&#xD;
      commercial availability and reimbursement status.&#xD;

    <description>The PASS will be conducted among HCPs in a representative sample of EEA countries where REBLOZYL is commercially available. A sample of HCPs from EEA countries who manage care for patients with certain haematologic conditions and who may/do prescribe REBLOZYL will be recruited from the target population of HCPs who were sent the REBLOZYL aRMMs in these countries. The final list of countries to be included may include 1) only countries where reimbursement has been sought and gained, 2) a geographically representative sample (e.g., northern, southern, eastern, and western EU Members States to the degree possible based on the first criteria), 3) a mixture of countries with higher and lower REBLOZYL usage, and 4) other feasibility considerations such as the ability to conduct direct-to-HCP non-market research studies.</description>
