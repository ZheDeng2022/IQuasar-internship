    <textblock>
      We conducted a 3-month, randomized, single-blind study in 102 Egyptian NASH patients who were&#xD;
      divided into three groups; group 1 included 34 patients received Vit. E 400 mg twice a day,&#xD;
      group 2 included 34 patients received UDCA 250 mg twice a day and group 3 included 34&#xD;
      patients received PTX 400 mg twice daily for 3 months. The following parameters were measured&#xD;
      both before and after intervention intake; liver aminotransferases (AST, ALT), cytokine and&#xD;
      chemokine (IL6 and CCL2/MPC-1), albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, HDL.&#xD;

      This was a 3-month, prospective, randomized, and single blind study. Participants were&#xD;
      recruited from the outpatient clinic and hepatology, gastroenterology and infectious diseases&#xD;
      department at Kafrelsheikh University Hospital between February 2020 and January 2021.&#xD;
      Two-hundred and five Egyptian patients diagnosed with NAFLD with potential clinical inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were invited for a screening session to determine their eligibility for the study.&#xD;
      Patients were enrolled in the study if they are &gt; 18 years old, had evidence for NASH;&#xD;
      persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal),&#xD;
      imaging (ultrasound) showing fatty infiltration, and histological evidence of NASH after&#xD;
      biopsy (macrovascular steatosis, ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, scattered lobular&#xD;
      inflammation and apoptotic bodies).One hundred and forty-six patients were excluded from the&#xD;
      study either because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (n = 135) or refused to enroll&#xD;
      in the study (n =11). Qualifying participants (n = 102) were randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      three treatment groups using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Group I (n = 34)&#xD;
      received 400 IU Vitamin E (Vitamin E 400 IU®, MEPACO Pharmaceutical Company, Sharqia, Egypt)&#xD;
      twice daily for 3 months. Group II (n =34) received 250 mg Ursodeoxycholic acid (Ursofalk 250&#xD;
      mg®, MINAPHARM Pharmaceutical Company, Cairo, Egypt) twice daily for 3 months. Group III (n =&#xD;
      34) received 400 mg sustained release (SR) Film-Coated Tablets of pentoxifylline (Trental 400&#xD;
      mg®, SANOFI Pharmaceutical Company, Cairo, Egypt) twice daily for 3 months. Patients were&#xD;
      followed up every week to ensure compliance, drug adherence and to report side effects or&#xD;
      drop out from the study.The following parameters were measured both before and after&#xD;
      intervention intake; liver aminotransferases (AST, ALT), cytokine and chemokine (IL6 and&#xD;
      CCL2/MPC-1), albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglyceride,&#xD;
      LDL, HDL.&#xD;
