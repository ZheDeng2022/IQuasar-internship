      This Phase 1/2a clinical trial involves patients diagnosed with refractory polymyositis or&#xD;
      dermatomyositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial safety assessment is conducted, including development of DLT in subjects up to&#xD;
      Week 2 after the investigational product administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [DLT assessment criteria and method]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low dose or intermediate dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. No DLT developing in the initially enrolled 3 subjects (0/3): Increase the dose to&#xD;
                the next dose group&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. DLT developing 1 of 3 subjects (1/3): Enroll 3 additional subjects at the same dose&#xD;
                group and then assess DLT, and ① DLT developing in 1 out of total 6 subjects&#xD;
                (1/3+0/3; 1/6): Increase the dose to the next dose group ② DLT developing in ≥ 2&#xD;
                out of total 6 subjects (≥ 2/6): In case of the low dose level, the trial is&#xD;
                discontinued without MTD determination. In case of the intermediate dose level, MTD&#xD;
                is assessed at the low dose which is a one lower dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. No DLT developing in the initially enrolled 3 subjects (0/3): Declare as the MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. DLT developing 1 of 3 subjects (1/3): Enroll 3 additional subjects at the same dose&#xD;
                group and then assess DLT, and ① DLT developing in 1 out of total 6 subjects&#xD;
                (1/3+0/3; 1/6): Declare as the MTD ② DLT developing in ≥ 2 out of total 6 subjects&#xD;
                (≥ 2/6): Assess MTD at the intermediate dose which is the one lower dose level&#xD;
