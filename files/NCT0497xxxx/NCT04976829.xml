  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing health threats that mankind faces now and&#xD;
      in the coming decades. Antibiotic resistance leads to longer hospital stays, higher medical&#xD;
      costs and increased mortality. In order to tackle antibiotic resistance, a&#xD;
      computerized-decision support system (CDSS) facilitating antibiotic stewardship and an&#xD;
      electronic surveillance software (ESS) facilitating infection prevention and control&#xD;
      activities will implement in our tertiary care university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conduct a pragmatic, prospective, single-centre, before-after uncontrolled&#xD;
      study with an interrupted time-series analysis 12 months before and 12 months after the&#xD;
      introduction of the CDSS for antibiotic stewardship (APSS) and ESS for infection surveillance&#xD;
      (ZINC). APSS and ZINC will assist respectively the antibiotic stewardship and the infection&#xD;
      prevention and control teams of Nancy University Hospital (France). The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the CDSS/ESS on the antibiotic use in adult (≥ 18 years) inpatients&#xD;
      (hospitalised ≥ 48h). The primary outcome is the prescription rate by all healthcare&#xD;
      professionals from the hospital of all systemic antibiotics expressed in defined daily&#xD;
      doses/1 000 patients/month. Concurrently, the investigators will assess the safety of the&#xD;
      intervention, its impact on the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions and on additional&#xD;
      precautions (isolation precautions) as recommended in guidelines, and on bacterial&#xD;
      epidemiology (multidrug-resistant bacteria and Clostridioides difficile infections) in the&#xD;
      hospital. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the users' satisfaction and the cost of&#xD;
      this intervention from the hospital perspective.&#xD;

        Nancy University Hospital (France) is a 1 497-bed tertiary-care hospital including two main&#xD;
        geographical sites. In 2017, the point prevalence on one single day of patients treated&#xD;
        with antibiotics was 24.4% and the prevalence of HCAI was 7.8% in this University Hospital.&#xD;
        And the total antibiotic consumption was 591 DDD/1 000 hospital days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study includes the inpatients of hospital departments of medicine (intensive care,&#xD;
        cardiology, hepato-gastro-enterology, haematology, pneumology, infectious diseases,&#xD;
        neurology, …), surgery, long-term care, and rehabilitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All inpatients ≥ 18 years and hospitalised ≥ 48h in Nancy University Hospital will be&#xD;
        considered in the study.&#xD;
