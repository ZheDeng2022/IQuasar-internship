  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who&#xD;
      engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of&#xD;
      melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical&#xD;
      activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has&#xD;
      become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site&#xD;
      for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava&#xD;
      users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by&#xD;
      utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of&#xD;
      keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of&#xD;
      melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to&#xD;
      Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages&#xD;
      on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations&#xD;
      that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every&#xD;
      form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively&#xD;
      correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the&#xD;
      most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social&#xD;
      feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the&#xD;
      feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm&#xD;
      that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in&#xD;
      the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the&#xD;
      time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept&#xD;
      focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the&#xD;
      feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that&#xD;
      predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on&#xD;
      activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to&#xD;
      deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications&#xD;
      Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety&#xD;
      advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice&#xD;
      algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message&#xD;
      library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested&#xD;
      for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish&#xD;
      feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and&#xD;
      innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who&#xD;
      engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them&#xD;
      practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning&#xD;
      algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to&#xD;
      provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established&#xD;
      and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users.&#xD;
