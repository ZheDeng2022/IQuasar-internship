  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) very often suffer from&#xD;
      recurrent nosebleeds called epistaxis. There is no treatment currently available to reduce&#xD;
      the frequency or severity of epistaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will examine the effect of nintedanib, a capsule to be taken twice a&#xD;
      day, on the frequency and severity of epistaxis in HHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Respiratory medicine department of the Lausanne University&#xD;
      Hospital (Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois, CHUV). The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      about 48 participants with HHT, who will be divided in 2 groups. Each group will perform the&#xD;
      same examinations and follow-up visits. The study will begin with 2 months of observation&#xD;
      during which subjects will be asked to fill a diary to record the number and duration of&#xD;
      epistaxis episodes. The diary will be filled daily for the entire duration of the study, i.e.&#xD;
      8 months. After 2 months of observation, the treatment phase will begin. Participants will&#xD;
      take a capsule (nintedanib 150 mg or placebo) once a day for 2 weeks, then twice a day for 14&#xD;
      weeks. In case of intolerance at the dose of 2 capsules per day, the treatment may be reduced&#xD;
      to 1 capsule per day. Subjects will also have to mention on the diary any blood transfusion,&#xD;
      iron perfusion, and any symptoms they may be experiencing. Following the 16 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, an 8-week follow-up period will allow to observe the effects of nintedanib after&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period, and to monitor any unexpected adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease, is a rare genetic&#xD;
      disease with autosomal dominant transmission and a prevalence in the general population of&#xD;
      1/5'000 to 1/10'000. Genetic mutations in HHT affect the intracellular angiogenic signalling&#xD;
      pathways (for example through the Vascular Endothelial Grow Factor [VEGF]) in endothelial&#xD;
      cells. Clinically, HHT leads to arteriovenous malformations in various organs including the&#xD;
      lung, brain, liver, digestive tract, skin, and nasal mucosa. More than 90% of HHT patients&#xD;
      suffer from chronic nosebleeds called epistaxis, which may lead to severe iron deficiency,&#xD;
      anemia requiring recurrent blood transfusions in 10-30%, emergency hospital admissions for&#xD;
      acute and sometimes life-threatening bleeding, and moderate to severe reduction in quality of&#xD;
      life in about 70%. Nintedanib, an antifibrotic drug approved for the treatment of idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also targets the VEGF receptor. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      nintedanib, acting by inhibition of the VEGF receptor, may reduce the duration and frequency&#xD;
      of epistaxis in HHT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be studies in a phase II randomized controlled trial. The study design&#xD;
      will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-therapeutic observation period of 8 weeks followed by a 16-week interventional phase&#xD;
      (nintedanib 150 mg once a day for 2 weeks, then twice a day for 14 weeks compared to a&#xD;
      placebo at same regimen), and by an 8-week follow-up period to assess post-treatment effects&#xD;
      and possible adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of randomized patients: 20 in each arm, with 4 drop-out in each arm awaited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete an epistaxis self-administered assessment grid daily since the&#xD;
      screening visit, and an epistaxis severity score and a quality of life assessment at the end&#xD;
      of weeks 8, 16, 20, 24 and 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be sampled at screening (= week 1), and at weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 32 to&#xD;
      assess hemoglobin and ferritin levels, and to monitor hepatic or renal functions for safety&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microphotography (dermoscopy) of selected cutaneous telangiectasia will be performed at&#xD;
      visits 1, 6 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study initiation, the study protocol, the patient information form and consent form,&#xD;
      as well as other study-specific documents will be submitted to the local ethics committee&#xD;
      (CER-VD) and the Swiss national drug regulatory authority (Swissmedic) for approval. Any&#xD;
      amendment to the protocol must be approved (if legally required) by these institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored for adverse events at each visit. Each participant&#xD;
      will hold of an emergency card indicating his/her randomization number, the name and number&#xD;
      of the study, the name of the PI, the possible Investigated Medical Product (IMP) i.e.&#xD;
      nintedanib or placebo, and the emergency phone number. In case of serious adverse event&#xD;
      (SAE), participants may call the emergency number. The call will be answered directly by the&#xD;
      PI or a co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual medical information obtained during the course of this study will be confidential&#xD;
      and disclosure to third parties will be prohibited. Confidentiality will also be warranted by&#xD;
      using coded subject identification in the computer files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only authorized staff of the research team, i.e. the sponsor-PI, investigators, and study&#xD;
      nurse will be authorized to access participants data in a password-protected database. After&#xD;
      database lock, the Sponsor-PI, investigators and statistician will be able to access the&#xD;
      database for analysis. The database will be archived for ten years after study completion.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with at least 30% change of monthly epistaxis duration in minutes after 16 weeks of study treatment (at V6, week 24) compared to baseline (V1, week 8) assessed in nintedanib arm and in placebo arm.&#xD;
The monthly epistaxis duration after 16 weeks of study treatment is defined as the average of epistaxis duration during the last 12 weeks of study treatment (minutes/4-weeks period averaged for weeks 12 to 24, i.e. V3 to V6)&#xD;
The monthly epistaxis duration at baseline is defined as the average of epistaxis duration during the observation period (minutes/4-weeks period averaged for weeks 1 to 8, i.e. V0 to V1).</description>
