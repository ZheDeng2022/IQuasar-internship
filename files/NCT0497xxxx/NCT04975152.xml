        assessments due to hypersensitivity to contrast agents) are not excluded. People taking&#xD;
        steroids for physiologic replacement (ie, adrenal insufficiency) are NOT excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Has received treatment with an approved anticancer systemic therapy within 4 weeks of the&#xD;
        registration date or has not yet recovered (ie, ≤ grade 1 or baseline) from any acute&#xD;
        toxicities except for laboratory changes as described in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;

             hepatitis C virus (HBV or HCV) infection; or diagnosis of immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTES:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV infection who have controlled infection (undetectable viral&#xD;
             load (HIV RNA PCR) and CD4 count above 350, either spontaneously or on a stable&#xD;
             antiviral regimen) are permitted. For patients with controlled HIV infection,&#xD;
             monitoring will be performed per local standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HBV (hepatitis B surface antigen positive; HepBsAg+) who have controlled&#xD;
             infection (serum HBV DNA PCR that is below the limit of detection AND receiving anti-&#xD;
             viral therapy for HBV) are permitted. Patients with controlled infections must undergo&#xD;
             periodic monitoring of HBV DNA. Patients must remain on anti-viral therapy for at&#xD;
             least 6 months beyond the last dose of investigational study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are HCV antibody positive (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection&#xD;
        (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR, either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior&#xD;
        course of anti-HCV therapy) are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immune related pneumonitis within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive doses&#xD;
             of glucocorticoids to assist with management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in&#xD;
             the radiation field is permitted as long as pneumonitis resolved ≥6 months prior to&#xD;
             the registration date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed&#xD;
             to antibody treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the excipients in the cemiplimab drug&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;

             corneal transplant are not excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical co-morbidity, physical examination finding, or metabolic dysfunction, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the&#xD;
             patient unsuitable for participation in a clinical trial due to high safety risks&#xD;
             and/or potential to affect interpretation of results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with participation&#xD;
             with the requirements of the study.&#xD;
