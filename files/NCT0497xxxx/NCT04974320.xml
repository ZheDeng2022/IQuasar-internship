    <textblock>
      Among the patients diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction by coronary angiography, 5%-25%&#xD;
      of the patients did not find coronary artery obstructive lesions. These patients do not need&#xD;
      PCI. The discovery and verification of clinical protocols for accurate identification of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease（MINOCA）is a major&#xD;
      issue that needs to be addressed.Novel biomarkers like grow stimulation expressed gene&#xD;
      2（ST2）can indicate the degree of coronary artery obstruction, copeptin is a biomarker of&#xD;
      cardiac emergency state. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      novel biomarkers combination regimen can diagnose or exclude MINOCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research aims to establish and validate a model for the recognition of MINOCA based on&#xD;
      novel biomarkers (ST2, copeptin) and to evaluate the prognostic value of novel biomarkers&#xD;
      among patients with acute chest pain.&#xD;

      A cross-sectional study design will be used to evaluate the correlation between baseline&#xD;
      novel biomarkers（ST2 and copeptin）and MINOCA, and to establish a discriminant model for the&#xD;
      identification of MINOCA, and to verify its discriminant efficacy. A cohort study design will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the prognostic role of novel biomarkers in patients with acute chest&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of precision cohort (BIPASS), the project team will adopt the method of&#xD;
      cross-sectional diagnostic experimental study design. ①Blood samples of MINOCA and AMI were&#xD;
      extracted. According to the new biomarkers（ST2 and copeptin）reported in literature, the team&#xD;
      will detect and combine them with troponin, and correct the covariate. And then establish the&#xD;
      multivariate joint discriminant model. ②At the same time, according to the propensity score,&#xD;
      patients will be selected from UA in a 1:1 matching ratio for modeling. The discriminant&#xD;
      model for rapid recognition of MINOCA will be verified by internal cross validation and&#xD;
      external validation. Based on this discriminant model, whether the combined application of&#xD;
      three biomarkers in MINOCA diagnosis is superior to that of a single biomarker will also be&#xD;
      evaluated. Patients with acute chest pain from multi-center will be selected to verify the&#xD;
      accuracy of the rapid discriminant model of MINOCA applied to patients with acute chest pain.&#xD;
