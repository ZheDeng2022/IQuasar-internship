    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the SOLIDARITY Finland Long-COVID trial is to assess the long-term effects&#xD;
      of remdesivir use during hospitalisation on long-COVID symptoms and quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      using questionnaires at one and two years post-discharge. The primary research questions are&#xD;
      whether remdesivir lowers the risk of long-COVID symptoms and leads to better QoL in the long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Long-COVID symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of remdesivir (vs. usual care only) on the occurrence of&#xD;
           symptoms that have been associated with the long-COVID syndrome. The questionnaires will&#xD;
           take place one and two years after the hospital admission. The questionnaire was&#xD;
           developed by our multidisciplinary team of physicians, including the representation of&#xD;
           multiple specialties such as general practice, lung diseases, neurology, internal&#xD;
           medicine, rheumatology, genetics, and clinical epidemiology, and two patient partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The symptom questionnaire - that will be completed by patients at one and two years -&#xD;
           measures basic patient information (age, height, weight, smoking status, major&#xD;
           comorbidity, and working status) and a wide variety of potential long-COVID-symptoms and&#xD;
           their bother (1. Fatigue; 2. Attention deficits; 3. Memory problems; 4. Sleeping&#xD;
           difficulties; 5. Depressive mood; 6. Anxiety; 7. Dizziness; 8. Headache; 9. Tinnitus;&#xD;
           10. Paresthesias; 11. Changes in taste/smell perceptions; 12. Postexertional malaise;&#xD;
           13. Palpitations; 14. Chest discomfort; 15. Nausea; 16. Skin rash; 17. Joint aches; 18.&#xD;
           Muscle pains; 19. Continuous cough; 20. Respiratory tract mucous discharges) in&#xD;
           remdesivir and usual care arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to compare patients' quality of life in&#xD;
           remdesivir and usual care arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses the following domains: 1. Mobility; 2. Self-care; 3.&#xD;
           Usual activities; 4. Pain and discomfort; 5. Anxiety and depression; 6. The visual&#xD;
           analog scale of subjective perception of overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally (at 1 or 2 years; depending on future funding and ethical approval decisions;&#xD;
      currently the study has ethical approval for long-COVID and quality of life assessments&#xD;
      only):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Finnish healthcare registries (Statistics Finland Mortality Database and the HILMO&#xD;
           Care Register for Health Care) will be used to estimate long-term mortality and&#xD;
           incidence of major comorbidity in remdesivir and usual care arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function will be assessed using spirometry and diffusing capacity, as well as the&#xD;
           six-minute walk test (6 mwt) in remdesivir and usual care arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole-genome genotyping will be performed for a genome-wide association study to&#xD;
           investigate genetic correlates of long-COVID-19 -symptoms in remdesivir and usual care&#xD;
           arms&#xD;

      The SOLIDARITY Finland Long-COVID is the long-term follow-up of the remdesivir sub-study of&#xD;
      the SOLIDARITY Finland. (Following the WHO core protocol with local adjustments, the&#xD;
      SOLIDARITY Finland is an adaptive, randomized, open-label clinical trial evaluating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of possible therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Adult patients with confirmed SARS-2-CoV-2 admitted to the hospital ward or&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Adult hospital patients, with definite COVID-19&#xD;
      and, as per the responsible doctor, no contraindication to the study drugs were entered into&#xD;
      the online electronic data collection system and randomly allocated between the local&#xD;
      standard of care alone or local standard of care plus remdesivir (daily infusion until&#xD;
      discharge or up to ten days). Between July 2020 and January 2021, 208 patients were recruited&#xD;
      from 13 hospitals, of which 114 were randomized to receive remdesivir plus usual care and 94&#xD;
      to receive usual care only. (These patients (if alive; n=202 or less) will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the SOLIDARITY Finland Long-COVID.) During patient recruitment at the hospital&#xD;
      phase of the study, the following data was collected: 1) hospital and randomizing doctor; 2)&#xD;
      confirmation that patient has provided consent, 3) patient identifiers, age, and sex, 4)&#xD;
      major comorbidities, 5) COVID severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have already consented to SOLIDARITY Finland (in-hospital study). In the&#xD;
      SOLIDARITY Finland Long-COVID, patients will receive, by mail, an information letter, consent&#xD;
      form, and questionnaires. The mail will be sent three days before the anniversary of the&#xD;
      randomization day during hospitalisation. They may reply by i) sending back the completed&#xD;
      documents, ii) scheduling a phone call with an investigator for an interview, or iii)&#xD;
      declining participation. If the patient does not reply in 14 days (from the day the&#xD;
      investigators sent the questionnaire to the patient), the investigators will send one&#xD;
      reminder by mail and, if there will not be a reply, then the investigators will approach the&#xD;
      patient via telephone at around 10 days from the reminder mail. The phone call will be&#xD;
      attempted twice: during and after office hours. If the patient will not answer the phone, the&#xD;
      investigators will also send a text message to inform them about the reason for our attempted&#xD;
      phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire (symptoms and characteristics):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, methodologists, and patient partners developed a&#xD;
      questionnaire that records basic patient information. This will include i) date of completing&#xD;
      the questionnaire, ii) age, iii) height and weight, iv) smoking status (never, ex-smoker,&#xD;
      current smoker), v) possible comorbidities, and whether diagnosed before or after&#xD;
      COVID-19-infection (obstructive sleep apnea, stroke, coronary artery disease, diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, cancer, and any psychiatric disease), vi) employment (student, unemployed,&#xD;
      employed, sickness allowance, retired), vii) working capability in comparison to the&#xD;
      pre-COVID-19 state, viii) physician visits due to symptoms associated with COVID-19, ix)&#xD;
      physician-diagnosed long-COVID-19 syndrome. Questionnaires will also document long-term&#xD;
      symptoms. Relevant long-COVID-19 -symptoms (in total 20) were identified from recent&#xD;
      publications and review articles. This same questionnaire will be used at one and two years.&#xD;
      Exertional and cardiopulmonary symptoms potentially related to COVID include fatigue,&#xD;
      postexertional malaise, dyspnea during exercise, chest discomfort, palpitations, cough, and&#xD;
      respiratory mucous discharges. Main neuropsychiatric symptoms potentially related to COVID&#xD;
      include generalized fatigue, attention and memory deficits, sleeping difficulties, depression&#xD;
      and anxiety, dizziness, and even sensory disturbances such as paresthesias and changes in&#xD;
      taste or smell perceptions. Other commonly encountered symptoms potentially related to COVID&#xD;
      include widespread pains (muscle and joint pains, headache), skin rash, nausea, and fever.&#xD;
      The burden from each individual symptom is an ordinal variable and will be graded from 0 to&#xD;
      3, where 0 represents no symptom, 1 represents mild bother, 2 moderate bother, and 3 severe&#xD;
      bother due to the symptom. Dyspnea is assessed in accordance with the Modified Medical&#xD;
      research council dyspnea scale (mMRC) from 0 to 4, where 0 represents dyspnea only with&#xD;
      strenuous exercise, and 4 the presence of dyspnea even with mild physical activity, e.g.,&#xD;
      dressing clothes. To capture the dimensions of recovery, the investigators will use the Core&#xD;
      Outcome Measure for Recovery, which has been recommended for use in COVID-19 research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have obtained permission from EuroQol to use the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire to&#xD;
      record the patient's QoL. EQ-5D-5L assesses the domains of mobility, self-care, usual daily&#xD;
      activities, general pain/discomfort, anxiety/depressions, and an overall impression of&#xD;
      health. The first five domains are graded from 1 to 5, while the last uses the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale from 0 to 100. Due to our multiethnic patient population, the questionnaires&#xD;
      have been translated in the following languages: Albanian, Arabic, English, Estonian, Farsi,&#xD;
      Finnish, Russian, Somali, and Swedish. The above-mentioned questionnaire (Finnish language&#xD;
      version as the original) has also been translated into these languages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security and future use of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information will be encrypted and held securely by the Sponsor. Those analyzing it&#xD;
      will use only pseudonymized data, and no identifiable patient details will appear in&#xD;
      publications. Data from questionnaires will also be analyzed using pseudonymized data. The&#xD;
      investigators have taken care to limit the questions to necessary and clinically relevant&#xD;
      aspects related to long-COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Symptoms: Each 20 symptoms between the two treatment arms will be compared. These are&#xD;
      measured as follows; each range from 0 to 3 (0 = No symptom. 1 = Symptom exists and causes&#xD;
      small bother. 2 = Symptom exists and causes moderate bother. 3 = Symptom exists and causes&#xD;
      severe bother.) ii) QoL: Using the EQ-5D-5L to compare domain-specific scores between the two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional variables (at 1 or 2 years; depending on future funding and ethical approval&#xD;
      decisions; currently the study has ethical approval for long-COVID and quality of life&#xD;
      assessments only):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registry data: Underlying causes of death will be obtained from Statistics Finland and&#xD;
           classified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and&#xD;
           Related Health Problems, 10th revision). In line with the Finnish regulations, any&#xD;
           consent will not be required from the study patients to acquire information on their&#xD;
           census data, vital status, and causes of death for registry research purposes.&#xD;
           Comorbidity will be obtained from Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare THL. These&#xD;
           will be performed through linkage the patient national identification number to registry&#xD;
           records. This study is unlikely well-powered to measure changes in mortality; however,&#xD;
           being aware of the vital status is important for the overall follow-up of study&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry parameters are continuous variables as absolute values (liters = L; liters&#xD;
           per second = L/s), percentage of reference values, and z-values. These include VC, FVC,&#xD;
           FEV1, FEV1/VC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), the maximal expiratory flow at 50 % (MEF50),&#xD;
           and the forced expiratory time (FET). Spirometry will be performed with a bronchodilator&#xD;
           test to assess the changes between baseline and after bronchodilation. Diffusing&#xD;
           capacity parameter DLCO is a continuous variable with ml/min/mmHg as the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entire genomes will be sequenced to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms that would&#xD;
           associate with long-COVID symptoms and the effect of remdesivir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcomes, a priori planned subgroup analysis will be performed for whether&#xD;
      the patient needed oxygenation at hospital admission (the investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      treatment effect is larger for those without extra oxygen than those with extra oxygen at&#xD;
      hospital admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between the two treatment arms will be performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics will be presented with numbers and&#xD;
           percentages for categorical variables and means, standard deviation, and range for&#xD;
           continuous variables. In the case of clearly skewed continuous variables, they will be&#xD;
           presented with median, interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles), and range.&#xD;
           Demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented with descriptive statistics&#xD;
           without any hypothesis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous variables will be subject to repeated measures mixed models or appropriate&#xD;
           non-parametric alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary response variables will be analyzed using logistic regression (possibly adjusting&#xD;
           for within-subject dependencies by generalized estimating equations or mixed models) or&#xD;
           chi-square/Mantel-Haenszel tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If missing data is regarded as having a significant effect on the conclusions of the&#xD;
           trial, sensitivity analyses with different methods for handling missing data will be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
