  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease associated with an imbalance&#xD;
      between pro- and anti-inflammatory markers (cytokines) resulting in a demyelinating and&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease. There is early evidence that spinal manipulation (chiropractic&#xD;
      care) is better than control in influencing immune (cytokine) activity in asymptomatic&#xD;
      participants, but few studies have been completed in participants with chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions, such as MS. The purpose of this project is to examine the immediate (after a&#xD;
      single thoracic spinal manipulation treatment) and summative impact (after 8 thoracic spinal&#xD;
      manipulation treatments occurring over 4 weeks) on pro-inflammatory (interleukin (IL) IL-1ß,&#xD;
      IL-2, IL-6, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) plasma cytokines&#xD;
      20 minutes and 2 hours after thoracic spinal manipulation in participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      neuroinflammatory relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). Spinal manipulation treatment will be&#xD;
      limited to the thoracic spine. Secondary outcomes will include determining the impact of 8&#xD;
      thoracic spinal manipulations on fatigue, cognitive processing speed, pain, depression,&#xD;
      sleep, and motor function through questionnaires and performance of various in assessments&#xD;
      such as the timed 25 foot walk test.&#xD;

      Study Design. The investigators plan to conduct a pilot parallel-group randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with appropriate SM and Sham SM treatment groups. Randomization will occur with the&#xD;
      sequence being completed prior to enrolling the first participant and with concealed&#xD;
      allocation by a member of the team not involved with the outcomes or treatments. The&#xD;
      investigators designed the Sham SM treatments to ensure all participants have similar amounts&#xD;
      of physical contact and clinician interaction (i.e. contextual environment for&#xD;
      placebo-related improvement). The primary and secondary outcomes of the study will be&#xD;
      assessed and processed by blinded assessors who are not part of the intervention delivery to&#xD;
      reduce any potential bias in collected outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SM Delivery. Diversified (i.e. crossed bilateral hypothenar contact) chiropractic technique&#xD;
      will be administered at levels of identified spinal joint restriction/dysfunction (derived&#xD;
      from thoracic spine x-rays, static and motion palpation, and confirmed or provoked localized&#xD;
      tenderness in paraspinal soft tissues). Participants in the SM and Sham SM group will be&#xD;
      scheduled for 8 office visits (2x/wk) over a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sham-SM will be delivered by setting the expansion control knob on an Activator II&#xD;
      (Activator Methods®, Phoenix AZ) device to the zero position (off; no thrust) and placed onto&#xD;
      the dorsal thumb surface of the clinician (no actual instrument contact with study&#xD;
      participant). At a setting of zero, no excursion of the Activator II stylus occurs, despite&#xD;
      the device delivering an audible clicking sound, with no biomechanical force being imparted&#xD;
      to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Variable. To examine the immediate (1x) and summative impact of SM (8x/4wk)&#xD;
      on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory plasma cytokine levels at 20 minutes and 2 hours&#xD;
      post-SM (after the first and 8th treatment) and compared to baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Variables. To examine the summative and secondary impact of 8 chiropractic&#xD;
      treatments over 4 weeks on RR-MS-related fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, Modified Fatigue&#xD;
      Impact Scale), cognitive processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), pain (short-form&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire), depression (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), subjective sleep&#xD;
      (Insomnia Severity Index) and upper/lower body motor function (Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25&#xD;
      foot Walk Test). These secondary outcomes will be measured before onset of treatment&#xD;
      (baseline) and upon completion of 8 spinal manipulation treatments over the period of 4&#xD;
      weeks) (2 visits per week).&#xD;
