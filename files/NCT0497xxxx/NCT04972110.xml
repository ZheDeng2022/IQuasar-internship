    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Niraparib or&#xD;
      Olaparib in combination with RP-3500, in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors,&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RP-3500 in combination with Niraparib or&#xD;
      Olaparib, examine pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

      This is a first-in-human Phase 1b/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion&#xD;
      study to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-3500 when administered orally in combination&#xD;
           with Niraparib or Olaparib to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the PK profile of RP-3500 in combination with Niraparib or Olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess anti-tumor activity associated with RP-3500 in combination with Niraparib or&#xD;
           Olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine biomarker responses and establish a correlation with RP-3500 treatment in&#xD;
           combination with Niraparib or Olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the RP2D and schedule is determined, expansion cohort(s) for RP-3500 in combination&#xD;
      with Niraparib or Olaparib will be enrolled to study the anti-tumor effect, and further&#xD;
      examine the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD).&#xD;
