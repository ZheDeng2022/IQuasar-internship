  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several factors are considered as the key indicators of quality colonoscopy, including&#xD;
      endoscopist experience, withdrawal time, and quality of bowel preparation (BP). A number of&#xD;
      laxatives are currently used as BP, and these are mainly based on PEG agents that differ for&#xD;
      the volume and the addition of adjuvants. Several trials have demonstrated the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of low volume 2L-PEG based regimens compared with high volume PEG regimens and non-PEG&#xD;
      agents. However, for low-volume 1L-PEG plus ascorbate (1L-PEG-Asc) only the data from&#xD;
      registration trials are available, and none of these have been performed in an &quot;open access&quot;&#xD;
      colonoscopy booking system. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of 1L-PEG-Asc compared to 2L-PEG plus ascorbate (2L-PEG-Asc) in an &quot;open access&quot; booking&#xD;
      system.&#xD;

      All patients who underwent &quot;open access&quot; colonoscopy in our Unit from January 2019 to&#xD;
      September 2020 were evaluated as part of a quality improvement project. Only patients taking&#xD;
      2L-PEG-Asc and 1L-PEG-Asc were enrolled in this study. Safety of BP was assessed by reviewing&#xD;
      the number of admissions to the Emergency Department of our Hospitals and the main&#xD;
      presentation symptom/diagnosis in the 7 days following the colonoscopy. Tolerability was&#xD;
      evaluated as the compliance to full BP intake&#xD;
