  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this recall study is to evaluate outcomes of surgical regenerative treatment of&#xD;
      periodontal defects in a cohort of patient previously treated for gum disease at the Royal&#xD;
      London Hospital as part of their periodontal care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be divided in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: a retrospective analysis of short-term outcomes of periodontal regenerative&#xD;
      procedures undertaken at the Barts Royal London Dental Hospital (RLDH); Part 2: a single&#xD;
      recall visit study in which patients identified through part 1 and willing to consent for the&#xD;
      study will be reassessed for medium-term outcomes of the regenerative procedures previously&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part 1 historic data will be collected from available dental records at RLDH and divided&#xD;
      in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 0: the latest available full mouth periodontal assessment before surgery and&#xD;
           x-ray of site/s needing surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 1: the latest available full mouth periodontal assessment after surgery and&#xD;
           x-ray of same site/s at Timepoint 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      For part 2 data will be collected from patients identified through part 1 and willing to give&#xD;
      consent for a single study recall visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Timepoint 2: single study outcome recall visit (full mouth periodontal assessment and x-ray&#xD;
      of same site/s at Timepoint 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of the study, the time elapsed between Timepoint 0 and Timepoint 2 can vary&#xD;
      between 1 and 4 years.&#xD;
