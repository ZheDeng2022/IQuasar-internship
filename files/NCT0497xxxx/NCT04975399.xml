  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), clinical study of CC-92328 will explore the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and preliminary biological and clinical activity of CC-92328 as a single-agent&#xD;
      in the setting of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two parts: monotherapy dose escalation (Part A) and monotherapy dose expansion&#xD;
      (Part B).&#xD;
