  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent depression is a prevalent and impairing condition that can be effectively treated&#xD;
      with Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). However, a majority of adolescents do not have access&#xD;
      to CBT. Internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) has been suggested as a way to increase availability to&#xD;
      effective psychological treatments. Yet, the research on ICBT for adolescents has been&#xD;
      lagging behind significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this research project is to increase the availability of evidence-based&#xD;
      psychological treatments for adolescents with depression by developing and evaluating&#xD;
      internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) for this target group. The main&#xD;
      objectives are to establish the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and long-term effects of the&#xD;
      guided and self-guided ICBT for adolescents with mild to moderate depression in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) with three-arms; guided ICBT (with therapist-support) and self-guided&#xD;
      ICBT (without therapist-support) vs treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;

      Primary and secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the clinical efficacy of Guided and Self-guided ICBT for depression for&#xD;
      reducing depressive symptom severity (as measured by the CDRS-R (27) in adolescents with mild&#xD;
      and moderate major depressive disorder (MDD), compared with an active control intervention&#xD;
      (treatment as usual within primary or secondary child and adolescent mental health care). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is the follow-up 3 months post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the 12-month durability of the treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a health-economic evaluation of guided ICBT for depression and self-guided&#xD;
           ICBT for depression, compared with TAU, from multiple perspectives, both in the short&#xD;
           term (primary endpoint) and the long term (12-month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is guided and self-guided ICBT more efficacious than TAU in regard to the reduction of&#xD;
           depressive symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is guided and self-guided ICBT more cost-effective than TAU?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is self-guided ICBT more cost-effective than guided ICBT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are the therapeutic gains of ICBT maintained long term (i.e., 1 year after the&#xD;
           intervention)?&#xD;

    <masking_description>Assessors conducting post- and follow-up assessments will be blind to treatment allocation, for the full duration of the trial. The outcome measures are identical for both groups, ensuring that the assessors remain blind. At each follow-up assessment, participants will be reminded by their assessor to not reveal their arm allocation. To measure blinding integrity, all assessors will record whether the participating families inadvertently reveal their group allocation, and subsequently guess each participant's treatment allocation at each assessment point and motivate their choice. The blinding will be broken after the trial's final participant has finished his/her 3-month follow-up assessment (primary endpoint). The trial will end when the trial's final participant has finished his/her 3-month follow-up assessment.</masking_description>

The iiPAS has demonstrated excellent internal consistency and good construct validity as well as a strong association with objective measures of patient activity in ICBT(38). For participants in the self-guided group, we will use an adapted version excluding item 3 since communication with therapist is not applicable, and a research assistant will make the rating at post-treatment.</description>

A total score of 6-10 indicates mild depression, 11-15 moderate, 16-20 severe and 21 and above very severe. Response is defined as a reduction by half of the initial score on QIDS-17. Remission is defined as below 6 points on QIDS-17. The QIDS-17 is a very reliable measure and most discriminating at moderate levels of depression.</description>

    <measure>Trimbos Questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P)</measure>

    <description>The TiC-P assess healthcare and societal resource use, including for example items on healthcare resource use, medications, school absenteeism, and parental productivity loss. In the present study no health economic evaluations will be conducted. Rather this instrument is included to gain feasibility data in preparation of a planned larger randomized controlled study. Therefore, no data on TiC-P will be reported in this trial.&#xD;
The TiC-P assess healthcare and societal resource use, including for example items on healthcare resource use, medications, school absenteeism, and parental productivity loss.</description>

    <time_frame>week 3</time_frame>
    <description>Four qualitative questions about treatment credibility will be administered at week 3, asking how well the treatment suits adolescents with depression, how much they believe this treatment will help him/her, if and to what extent they would recommend this treatment to a friend with depression and how much improvement they expect from the treatment. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 to 5. The scale ranges from 4 to 20 points, where a higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Guided ICBT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in guided ICBT will receive internet-delivered CBT with therapist support. The treatment consists of 8 online modules with interactive features such as videos and illustrations, delivered over a maximum of 10 weeks. The main treatment focus is behavioral activation. The adolescent and the caregiver are provided with their own separate programs and login to the treatment platform. The caregiver's program also consists of 8 chapters, including psychoeducation about depression and how to support their adolescent in treatment. The adolescents and caregivers have regular contact with a personal assigned therapist via written text messages in the platform. Participants are typically in contact with their therapist several times a week. The adolescent and caregiver can continue to access all treatment modules for the whole follow-up period (3 months), but without therapist-support.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The self-guided arm is identical to the guided arm, however without the therapist support. To ensure patient safety, there will be clear instructions to the patients and primary caregivers on how to get in contact with the study team in case of acute problems, and there will be clinical routines to detect and manage deterioration or suicidal tendencies.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to TAU, will be referred to the local CAMH's or primary care unit for children and youths and will be free to receive any treatment, either psychosocial, medical, or a combination of both.

The adolescent will learn about depression, how behavioral activations works, monitor their own activities, plan and do more values-based activities and deal with obstacles to getting in touch with positive reinforcement, such as avoidance behaviors.</description>
