      Neuromuscular exercise and taping are widely used in the rehabilitation of Patellofemoral&#xD;
      Pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of corrective kinesio taping&#xD;
      applied on patellofemoral joint and foot in addition to a progressive neuromuscular exercise&#xD;
      program in women with Patellofemoral Pain on knee pain and muscle strength.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is characterized by pain localized in the peripatellar or&#xD;
      retropatellar regions in young and physically active individuals . In patients with PFP,&#xD;
      during single-leg squatting, an increase in the valgus of the knee joint due to hip abductor&#xD;
      muscle weakness and in the internal rotation of the femur due to weakness of the hip external&#xD;
      rotators and abductor muscles are observed. Theoretically it has been shown that faulty hip&#xD;
      kinematics can increase lateral loading in the patellofemoral joint. Therefore, conducting&#xD;
      exercises to strengthen the extensor, external rotator, and abductor muscles of the hip and&#xD;
      lateral flexor muscles of the trunk are an important treatment approaches. Strengthening the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle is a widely used method of treating PFP. Previous studies suggest that hip&#xD;
      and trunk exercises prescribed in combination with traditional quadriceps strengthening&#xD;
      exercises are effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients with PFP .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, kinesiotape is one of the widely used methods in the treatment of PFP. The&#xD;
      correction of the abnormal patellar displacement, the reduction of the patellofemoral joint&#xD;
      reaction forces, and the regulation of the activation of the vastus medialis muscle is&#xD;
      provided with patellar taping. Patellar taping is recommended as part of evidence-based&#xD;
      combined physiotherapy programs in the treatment of PFP . Increased pronation of the subtalar&#xD;
      joint and the decrease / flattening of the medial arch height are associated with PFP.&#xD;
      Prolonged pronation time is observed in subtalar and midtarsal joints during gait. To correct&#xD;
      increased pronation, foot orthoses, low-dye taping and kinesio taping are applied . The&#xD;
      effect of kinesiotaping on foot pronation, however, is unclear due to the lack of published&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, although patellar taping is applied in patients with PFP no studies have&#xD;
      examined the effects of kinesiotaping supporting the medial arch and allowing forefoot and&#xD;
      hind foot to move within the normal range. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of corrective kinesio taping applied on patellofemoral joint and foot in addition to&#xD;
      a progressive neuromuscular exercise program in women with Patellofemoral Pain on knee pain&#xD;
      and muscle strength.&#xD;

    <description>The knee pain of the patients during stair descending and ascending were evaluated with the Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS). The scale is horizontal in the form of a line 10 cm long, starting with &quot;no pain&quot; and ending with &quot;excruciating pain&quot;. The pain was measured and recorded as &quot;cm&quot; between the point marked with no onset .</description>

    <description>Isokinetic dynamometer (Isomed 2000. D&amp;R. Ferstl GmbH, Germany) was used to evaluate the isokinetic muscle strength of the hamstring and quadriceps femoris muscles. Patients were fixed to the chair with trunk, pelvis, and thigh straps with the back of the seat 70° upright. Concentric peak torque / weight (Nm / kg) at 180° / sec (10 repetitions) after 4 repetitive warm-ups at 180° / sec, in the range of 45 °-90° flexion values were measured, respectively .</description>

    <description>&quot;I&quot; taping for accurate positioning of the tissue was applied to the patients to neutralize the patellofemoral joint. During the knee flexion in the supine position, the tape was adhered to the skin with a moderate-to-extreme stretch (50%-75%) . Clinical therapeutic applications of the Kinesio taping methods (Tokyo, Japan: Ken Ikai Co Ltd.). In addition to the patellar taping, correction taping to neutralize the subtalar joint by elevating the midtarsal joint and medial arch was applied. The patients were positioned in prone lying and knee flexion position, the taping was started at the 5th metatarsal level on the dorsal side of the finger and finished extending towards the medial of the tibia . Tapings were renewed at the beginning of each week for 6 weeks.</description>
