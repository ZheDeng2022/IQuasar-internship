  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among biomarkers, CTCs are a convenient, sensitive and biologically informative option. CTC&#xD;
      detection could be considered a real-time &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; approach and contains several&#xD;
      advantages such as minimally invasive, easy and safe to perform, and multiple samples can be&#xD;
      taken over time, better prognosis to indicate an elevated risk of metastases, improved&#xD;
      therapy monitoring, providing live disease status information., However, the number of CTCs&#xD;
      is very low, so the establishment of cell culture from CTCs becomes the most challenging over&#xD;
      the past year. In this study, we develop a short-term CTC expansion protocol combined with a&#xD;
      new surface coating technique. Expanded circulating tumor cells will provide genetic&#xD;
      information and develop oncology drug screening platform, which provides an opportunity to&#xD;
      monitor response to therapy noninvasively.&#xD;

    <measure>To correlate drug sensitivity profiles of the expanded circulating tumor cells with the clinical treatment response.</measure>
    <time_frame>CTC was expanded in vitro and drug sensitivity profile to disease-specific panels was obtained. The patient continued with the planned treatment by the treating physician and follow up information was obtained 3 months after blood sampling.</time_frame>
    <description>CTC was expanded in vitro culture system and drug sensitivity profile to disease-specific panels was obtained. Clinical treatment response and drug sensitivity profile were analysed with 2 by 2 contingency tables. The evaluation of clinical response rate used by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1. Briefly, C+ refers to patients with clinical disease control (complete response, partial response, and stable disease), and C- refers to patients were found with worsening diseases (PD). Patients that did not fit into either category were listed as non-evaluable. The drug sensitivity profiles were categorized into E+ and E-. In class E+, at least one chemical in the evaluable treatment regimen was found to kill more than 30% of the cells in the CTC culture system. In class E-, all chemicals in the evaluable treatment regimen were found to kill less than 30% of the cells in the CTC culture system.</description>
