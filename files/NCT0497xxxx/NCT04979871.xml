      This study is an observational study with subsequent use of coded biological material. Sera&#xD;
      of Universitiy Hospital of Zurich (USZ) personnel vaccinated with BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer)&#xD;
      was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and virus neutralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum was analysed for virus-specific IgG and IgA using ELISA kits from Euroimmun (Kriens,&#xD;
      Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instruction. IgG was determined with the&#xD;
      quantitative Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Quantivac kit and IgA was determined with the semi-quantitative&#xD;
      Anti-SARS-CoV-2 kit The kits determine antibodies against the spike-1 protein. The sera were&#xD;
      not diluted and not heat-inactivated prior to testing. The developed 96-well plates were&#xD;
      analysed by reading absorbance at 450 nm using an ELx808 ELISA reader from BioTek Instr. Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was developed at the department. In this&#xD;
      Tissue Culture Infection Dose (TCID) assay, Vero cells were infected with live SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      and sera were added at various dilutions to test the potential to neutralize viral infection.&#xD;
      The assay was conducted in a biosafety level 3 lab. Briefly, VERO-E6 cells were grown&#xD;
      overnight to ca. 80-90% adherence in flat-bottom 96-well cell culture plates. The SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      was then mixed in round-bottom 96 well titre plates with 2-fold serial dilutions of serum and&#xD;
      incubated. The virus-serum mixture was then added to the VERO-E6 cell, and the cultures were&#xD;
      incubated again. After three days, the cultures were fixed by addition of paraformaldehyde&#xD;
      and stained with crystal violet for visualisation of cytotoxicity. The highest serum dilution&#xD;
      preventing infections of the cells was defined as the neutralization titre.&#xD;

        Approximately 250 blood samples from 50 vaccinated persons working in the USZ Department of&#xD;
        Dermatology were collected in 2020 and 2021. All individuals recieveid either one or two&#xD;
        doses of BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) vaccine between January 2021 and June 2021. The persons&#xD;
        providing blood samples (study subjects) were recruited by a general email (in English) to&#xD;
        all members of the research unit of the Department of Dermatology (cf. Appendix). The sera&#xD;
        were frozen and kept at the Dermatology biobank. The samples are labelled with subjects&#xD;
        initials and date of sampling.&#xD;
