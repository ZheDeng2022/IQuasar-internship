    <textblock>
      An open label,single-center, non-interventional prospective study with the aim on&#xD;
      investigating the effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in restoring iron status and&#xD;
      reducing the risk of severe arrhythmic events in participants with iron deficiency and a&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HFrEF already scheduled to receive IV FCM to treat iron deficiency will be&#xD;
      included in this registry trial. These patients undergo clinical examination,&#xD;
      echocardiography, blood testing, 6-minute walking testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing,&#xD;
      cardiac implantable device interrogation, 24-hour Holter monitoring and quality of life&#xD;
      quantification as part of standard clinical practice. This database will be extracted from&#xD;
      clinical databases and stored on a separate, registry database. The study will examine the&#xD;
      effect of IV FCM on patients' iron stores, arrhythmic burden, hospitalizations and clinical,&#xD;
      echocardiographic, exercise-testing-derived and biological markers of disease severity such&#xD;
      as 6-minute walking distance, peak VO2 consumption, LVEF and LV global longitudinal strain&#xD;
      and NT-proBNP.&#xD;
