    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of a custom fitted device designed to isolate&#xD;
      enteroatmospheric fistulas effluent independent of negative pressure wound therapy and to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects on the device related to dressing changes, time required for dressing&#xD;
      changes, management costs, and the ease of use.&#xD;
