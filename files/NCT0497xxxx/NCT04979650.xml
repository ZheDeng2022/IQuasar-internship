      to determine the rate of asymptomatic gadolinium-enhancing lesions conversion to the&#xD;
      non-enhancing black hole (neBHs) with or without corticosteroid pulse therapy in patients&#xD;
      with RRMS, and to analyze if treatment of asymptomatic gadolinium enhancement lesions has any&#xD;
      effect on the expanded disability status scale. The study is performed in the MS clinic of Bu&#xD;
      Ali Sina Hospital in Sari and Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. 104 recurrent MS&#xD;
      patients are admitted based on the admission criteria. They are divided into two groups of&#xD;
      intervention and control based on a simple randomization block. The intervention group&#xD;
      received 1 gram of methylprednisolone in 500 ccs of normal saline for 5 days and the control&#xD;
      group received only 500 ccs of serum. After 6 months, a new MRI is taken from the patients&#xD;
      and the possibility of asymptomatic active plaque conversion with or without intervention is&#xD;
      compared in the two groups, as well as the amount of EDSS in the two groups. They do not know&#xD;
      whether the patient is in the control group or the intervention.&#xD;

      Investigators perform a study on 104 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of RR-MS.&#xD;
      Participants will be selected for the study if they meet all of the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: (1) a baseline MRI scan with at least one CEL on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted&#xD;
      images (performed either at the time of the diagnosis or during the routine MRI monitoring of&#xD;
      the disease) and (2) a follow-up MRI scan performed at least 6 months later in the same&#xD;
      hospital site. Participants were then divided into two groups by block randomization (the&#xD;
      Block size will be 4): (1) participants with asymptomatic CELs, treated with a single cycle&#xD;
      of high-dose IVMP after baseline MRI (group A) and (2) participants with asymptomatic CELs&#xD;
      for clinical relapse and, therefore, not exposed to IVMP after baseline MRI (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Microsoft Excel software will be used for block randomization with a group of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number the participants from 1 to 102.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In a group of 2, the possible combinations of blocks are:(A=Group1 and B=Group2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. ABBA 2. ABAB 3. BBAA 4. ABAB 5. BAAB 6. BABA&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the sample size for this study we used the result of Maria Di Gregorio and et&#xD;
      al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be double-blind patients and radiologist clinicians unaware of types of&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI examinations were performed with a 1.5 T magnet (General Electric Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a standard head coil. The MRI protocol used in our Neuroradiology&#xD;
      Section included the following sequences: (1) a T2-weighted-fluid-attenuated inversion&#xD;
      recovery (FLAIR) sequence with an inversion time (TI) of 2400 ms, an echo time (TE) of 120&#xD;
      ms, and a repetition time (TR) of 8000 ms; (2) a T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence&#xD;
      with a TE of 90 ms and a TR of 6600 ms; and (3) a spin-echo (SE) sequence for T1-weighted&#xD;
      images with a TR of 500 ms and a TE of 20 ms Post-contrast images were obtained with a scan&#xD;
      delay of 5 min after the injection of gadoterate (Dotarem, Guerbet group, Roissy, France) at&#xD;
      0.2 mmol/kg. 3-mm thick contiguous slices were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the baseline MRI, the following characteristics of CELs were recorded: (1) number; (2)&#xD;
      maximum diameter (â‰¤ or &gt; 5 mm); (3) pattern of enhancement (homogeneous or ring enhancement);&#xD;
      (4) hypointensity as compared to normal-appearing surrounding white matter in baseline&#xD;
      T1-weighted images acute black hole (aBH); and (5) the fact of being symptomatic, as&#xD;
      established by an experienced neurologist (MDG) on the basis of CELs' localization and&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of the concomitant relapse. The follow-up MRI was performed with the&#xD;
      same 1.5 T magnet and using the same MRI protocol. At the follow-up MRI, the presence of&#xD;
      persistent black holes (pBHs) was recorded. Specifically, pBHs were defined as non-enhancing&#xD;
      T1 lesions hypointense with respect to the surrounding normal-appearing white matter and&#xD;
      concordant with hyperintense T2 lesions [10]. Three investigators (MDG, AP, and GR) in&#xD;
      agreement with a senior experienced neuro-radiologist (PF) revised baseline CELs and&#xD;
      follow-up pBHs' characteristics. The three investigators and the neuroradiologist were&#xD;
      blinded to the exposure of the patients to IVMP treatment&#xD;

    <description>The EDSS quantifies disability in eight functional systems: pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other. It ranges from 1.0 to 4.5 for people affected with MS who are fully ambulatory, and from 5.0 to 9.5 for people with MS with impaired ambulation. The maximum grade, 10.0, represents death due to MS</description>
