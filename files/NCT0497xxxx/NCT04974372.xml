      The aims of this study are to 1. Assess the preoperative and postoperative atrial and&#xD;
      ventricular structure and function comprehensively in heart transplantation; 2. Explore the&#xD;
      early, accurately and non-invasively indicators for evaluating myocardial fibrosis in&#xD;
      end-stage heart failure, as well detecting acute rejection (AR),coronary allograft&#xD;
      vasculopathy(CAV) and adverse clinical events in heart transplant patients by using&#xD;
      conventional and the advanced echocardiography.&#xD;

      This study will enrolled 1000 HT patients and 500 healthy controls, and the cardiac structure&#xD;
      and function will be evaluated by ultrasound multimodal imaging. And the study aimed to 1.&#xD;
      Assess the preoperative and postoperative atrial and ventricular structure and function&#xD;
      comprehensively in heart transplantation; 2. Explore the early, accurately and non-invasively&#xD;
      indicators for evaluating myocardial fibrosis in end-stage heart failure, as well detecting&#xD;
      acute rejection(AR),coronary allograft vasculopathy(CAV) and adverse clinical events in heart&#xD;
