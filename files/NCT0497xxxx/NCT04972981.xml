Group 1: An indication for which ADCT-901 showed in Part 1 to have preliminary activity.&#xD;
Group 2: A group of participants with Part 1 indications, except for the one selected in Group 1 of Part 2. No more than 30% of participants with the same indication are allowed in this basket group.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologic diagnosis of selected solid tumor malignancy that is locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic at time of Screening: cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian/fallopian tube cancers,&#xD;
             prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Histologic variants of prostate cancer, including neuroendocrine features and&#xD;
             small cell carcinoma of the prostate are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants who are refractory to or intolerant to existing therapy(ies) known to&#xD;
             provide clinical benefit for their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants with measurable disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria In&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 1: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue&#xD;
        components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as computed&#xD;
        tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered as measurable lesions&#xD;
        only if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability per RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note 2: Prostate cancer participants without measurable lesions will be accepted, with&#xD;
        evidence of bone metastatic disease on radiographic examination, whether from bone scan or&#xD;
        other imaging modality, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) â‰¥2.0 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of recent infection (within 4 weeks of cycle 1, day 1 [C1D1]) considered to be&#xD;
             caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A pathogen-directed SARS-CoV-2 test (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) is&#xD;
             mandatory and must be negative before initiating study treatment (tests to be&#xD;
             performed 3 days or less prior to dosing on C1D1; an additional 2 days are allowed in&#xD;
             the event of logistical issues for receiving the results on time).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or evidence of leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease (brain MRI or previously documented cerebrospinal fluid cytology). Previously&#xD;
             treated asymptomatic CNS metastases are permitted provided that the last treatment&#xD;
             (systemic anticancer therapy and/or local radiotherapy) was completed â‰¥4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to C1D1 except usage of low dose of steroids on a taper (i.e., up to 10 mg prednisone&#xD;
             or equivalent on Day 1 and consecutive days is permissible if being tapered down).&#xD;
             Participants with discrete dural metastases are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant third space fluid accumulation (i.e., ascites requiring&#xD;
             drainage or pleural effusion that is either requiring drainage or associated with&#xD;
             shortness of breath).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active diarrhea â‰¥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2 or a&#xD;
             medical condition associated with chronic diarrhea (such as irritable bowel syndrome,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active or clinically significant ocular disease including ocular surface disease at&#xD;
             baseline. An ocular evaluation is to be confirmed by an ophthalmologist at screening.&#xD;
             Participants with any prior episode of cicatricial conjunctivitis (as evaluated by the&#xD;
             ophthalmologist) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note 1: Cataract is not considered active ocular surface disease for this protocol.&#xD;
             Mild dry eye syndrome or blepharitis managed with artificial tear drops, without&#xD;
             injection or epithelial changes, is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of any other experimental medication within 14 days prior to start of study drug&#xD;
             (C1D1).&#xD;
