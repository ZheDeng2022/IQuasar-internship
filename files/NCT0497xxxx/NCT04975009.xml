  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to&#xD;
      investigate how the brain forms associations between neutral and negative stimuli. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to understand the neural systems involved in regulating negative emotional&#xD;
      responses to fearful stimuli.&#xD;

      This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the brain&#xD;
      forms associations between neutral stimuli and a mildly uncomfortable electrical stimulation&#xD;
      to the wrist. Referred to as Pavlovian fear conditioning. The goal is to compare brain&#xD;
      activity between individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects without PTSD. PTSD is characterized by excessive fear and anxiety, including in&#xD;
      harmless situations. The data here will help us better understand dysregulation in neural&#xD;
      circuitry involved in fear recovery, which has implications for improving treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be screened and diagnosed using typical screening procedures and diagnostic criteria (e.g., the clinically administered PTSD scale). Participants also screened for contraindications for MRI. The learning paradigm inside the MRI scanner occurs over 3 days. The first two days are consecutive (back-to-back) and the third MRI visit is 1 month later. Participants are asked to look at a screen and listen to simple tones over headphones, while the experimenter measures brain activity and physiological measures of arousal (e.g., sweating from sensors on the hand). These visits will be scheduled within two weeks from the baseline and assessment visit.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (All study populations):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Volunteers with a major medical illness or a neurological disorder (e.g., Parkinson's&#xD;
             Disease), or neurological abnormality including significant head trauma (loss of&#xD;
             consciousness &gt; 5 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A positive pregnancy test in female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Benzodiazepines, tested using urine tox screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For the healthy subjects, exclusion is meeting criteria for either PTSD, or any other&#xD;
             psychiatric disorder, or any prior psychiatric hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For the healthy subjects, exclusion is prior use of a psychotropic medication for&#xD;
             longer than 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of moderate to severe cannabis use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exclusions: Claustrophobia; tattoos above the&#xD;
             shoulders; permanent eyeliner or permanent; artificial eyebrows; cardiac pacemaker;&#xD;
             metal fragments in eye, skin, or body, including shrapnel; heart valve replacement;&#xD;
             brain clips; venous umbrella; being a sheet-metal worker or welder; lifetime history&#xD;
             of aneurysm surgery; intracranial bypass, renal, or aortic clips; prosthetic devices&#xD;
             such as middle ear, eye, joint, or penile implants; joint replacements; non-removable&#xD;
             hearing aid, neurostimulator, or insulin pump; shunts/stents; metal mesh/coil&#xD;
             implants; metal plate/pin/screws/wires; or any other metal implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (PTSD populations):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, as assessed by standard diagnostic instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants with PTSD are eligible if they meet diagnostic criteria for current PTSD.&#xD;
             This is determined by the presence of a Criterion A event in addition to a severity&#xD;
             score of 2 or greater on 1 symptom in clusters B and C and on 2 symptoms in clusters D&#xD;
             and E, in addition to meeting criteria F and G. The specific form of trauma is not&#xD;
             considered for inclusion/exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Volunteers in the patient group, but not healthy control group, may also meet criteria&#xD;
             for a mood disorder (except for bipolar affective disorder, see exclusions below), as&#xD;
             well as other anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia,&#xD;
             generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder). Including these&#xD;
             comorbidities is essential because of the high frequency of co-occurring mood and&#xD;
             anxiety disorders with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
