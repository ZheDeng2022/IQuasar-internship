      This study is a single-arm, open, multi-center phase II clinical trial, the main purpose of&#xD;
      which is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of YY-20394 in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory thymic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research adopts the Simon two-stage design method, which is carried out in two stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, a single-arm, open, multi-center study was adopted, and YY-20394&#xD;
      monotherapy was given to patients who met the enrollment conditions. The trial enrolled 18&#xD;
      subjects. If ≥2 subjects had ORR (clinical benefit), then enter the second phase, otherwise&#xD;
      the trial will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refer to the efficacy data of the first phase to decide whether to conduct the second phase&#xD;
      of clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, a single-arm, open, multi-center study was adopted. Patients who met the&#xD;
      enrollment conditions were given YY-20394 monotherapy. In the second phase, 40 subjects will&#xD;
      continue to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 58 subjects were included in the two stages. During the study period, the&#xD;
      investigator judged the best curative effect of all subjects according to the response&#xD;
      evaluation criteria in solid tumours (Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours, RECIST&#xD;
      1.1). IRC will use the same standards to evaluate the efficacy of the imaging results of all&#xD;
      subjects, and the entire review process will be conducted in accordance with an independent&#xD;
      review procedure. The Research Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will continue to review the&#xD;
      safety of study drugs. SMC will be responsible for monitoring safety data and making&#xD;
      decisions on research-related issues, such as study enrollment, dose selection, whether to&#xD;
      continue the study, etc.&#xD;
