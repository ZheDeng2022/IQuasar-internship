  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorder is one of the most burdensome non-motor symptoms in Parkinsonian patients.&#xD;
      Typical manifestations include RBD, decreased sleep efficiency, decreased slow wave sleep,&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness, increased sleep latency and wakefulness during sleep. Subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been reported to improve sleep dysfunction in several&#xD;
      studies, mostly due to its improvement in motor dysfunction. However, there are limited&#xD;
      research about specific STN-DBS stimulation pattern for sleep architecture regulation, and&#xD;
      whether suboptimal parameter combinations for motor has potential benefits for sleep&#xD;
      improvement has not been studied. Here we use different parameter combination in STN-DBS,&#xD;
      especially by changing stimulation contact and frequency, to explore the specific stimulation&#xD;
      pattern for normalizing sleep architecture and increasing slow wave sleep.&#xD;

      Investigators will enroll at least 5 subjects for this study. First, subjects will be&#xD;
      clinically evaluated by motor, cognitive and sleep scales; Subsequently, the treatment window&#xD;
      of each contact using unipolar stimulation will be tested both in high frequency (such as&#xD;
      130Hz) and low frequency (such as 80Hz), and the parameters of stimulation were determined&#xD;
      under the premise of no obvious discomfort and optimal motor control. Different stimulation&#xD;
      pattern (such as ventral contact stimulation) will be performed during the N2 phase combined&#xD;
      with PSG and LFP recording during the patients' sleep, and switch to baseline stimulation&#xD;
      pattern at the N3/N1/REM phase. Repeat these steps until the patient wake up naturally.&#xD;
      Finally, the patients will be evaluated for motor function. Pre-surgery and post-surgery&#xD;
      images will be used for reconstructing VTA of specific parameter combination. Functional MRI&#xD;
      (fMRI) will be carried out to verify the connectivity change under optimal parameter&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;
