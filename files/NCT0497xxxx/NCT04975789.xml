      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a pain assessment information visualization&#xD;
      (InfoViz) tool to facilitate communication about pain severity, location, and quality to&#xD;
      increase mutual understanding between patients with limited English proficiency (LEP),&#xD;
      interpreters, and providers during pain assessment. 40 participants will be enrolled and can&#xD;
      expect to be on study for up to 4 weeks.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a pain assessment information visualization&#xD;
      (InfoViz) tool to facilitate communication about pain severity, location, and quality to&#xD;
      increase mutual understanding between patients with limited English proficiency (LEP),&#xD;
      interpreters, and providers during pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators focus on the LEP Hmong because pain is particularly problematic for this&#xD;
      group. The Hmong describe pain using visual metaphors that are inconsistent with providers'&#xD;
      knowledge and interpreters struggle to translate metaphors accurately between patients and&#xD;
      providers. The goals of the study are (1) to examine the feasibility of implementing the pain&#xD;
      InfoViz tool, (2) to explore congruency of patient-interpreter-provider triads' mutual&#xD;
      understanding (MU) of pain severity, location, and quality, and (3) to evaluate outcome&#xD;
      measures selected to capture satisfaction with communication, pain relief, and pain&#xD;
      interference with life and explore variables identified in the InfoViz tool conceptual&#xD;
      framework (MU of pain assessment information, satisfaction with communication, pain diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first collect data from 20 participants under the usual care control&#xD;
      condition (i.e., interpreters verbally interpreting and communicating pain descriptions),&#xD;
      followed by data collection from another 20 participants under the intervention condition&#xD;
      (i.e., interpreters using verbal descriptions and the InfoViz tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the pain assessment InfoViz tool will increase mutual&#xD;
      understanding of pain severity, location, and quality between patients, interpreters, and&#xD;
      providers, and consequently lead to increased satisfaction with communication, greater pain&#xD;
      relief and reduced pain interference with daily life through better-informed diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>One question item from the 6-item Mutual Understanding Scale (MUS) asks participants about their main symptom (i.e., &quot;What was the most important health complaint for which the physician was visited?&quot;) and providers to report participants' main symptom (e.g., &quot;What was the most important health complaint for which the patient consulted with you?&quot;). The percentage of participants for which their physician reports the same health complaint as they do will be reported.</description>

    <description>The pain InfoViz tool is a two-page paper tool that consists of an explanation of how to use the tool in both Hmong and English, a culturally-appropriate Faces pain severity scale, pain body diagram, and 13 pain qualities in the form of icons representing each pain quality metaphor. The interpreter explains the instructions in Hmong, then marks the body areas corresponding to the location of pain reported by the participant, and marks the pain qualities expressed by the metaphors selected by the Hmong patient. In the clinic appointment, the interpreter communicates to the physician, in English, the pain location and qualities identified by the participant, using the medical terms identified on the InfoViz tool.</description>
