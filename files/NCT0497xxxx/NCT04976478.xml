    <description>IMRT/VMAT are adopted. A total dose of 45-50.4 Gy, 1.8~2.0Gy/f, 25~ 28F in pelvic and/or extension filed. For patients with metastasis in pelvic lymph node and abdominal para-aortic lymph node, the dose of radiation in local lesion will be increased to 60~66Gy. For patients at stage IIIB, concurrent radiation will be given in parametrial extension or in the late course the dose will be increased to 60Gy.&#xD;
Brachytherapy: Three dimensional high dose rate brachytherapy is used with HR-CTV D90 cumulative dose of 80~85Gy (EQD2); If the tumor diameter is ≥4cm, HR-CTV D90 cumulative dose is ≥87Gy (EQD2). Brachytherapy combined with external beam radiotherapy will be completed within 8 weeks.</description>
