      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of Auricular Percutaneous Electrical Nerve&#xD;
      Field Stimulation (a Neurostim device) on children with pain and Post Concussion symptoms.&#xD;
      Patient will be offered a Neurostim device. This device is placed on the outer ear through&#xD;
      tiny needles. Since this is a randomized trial, patients may receive an active (experiment)&#xD;
      or nonactive (control) Neurostim device. However, the nonactive control Neurostim device&#xD;
      group will be given the option to receive an active device after the initial study&#xD;
      procedures. The experiment group may be in this study up to 8 weeks and the control group may&#xD;
      be in this study up to 12 weeks. The control group will have 4 additional weeks due to the&#xD;
      transition to an active device following the first 8 weeks. The device is worn weekly for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Each device is worn for 5 consecutive days for the full 24 hours. The participant will&#xD;
      be able to easily take the device off on the 6th day. Study procedures include: Neurological&#xD;
      testing- a balance test and computerized neurological standard testing, Cardiology testing-&#xD;
      electrocardiogram for heart rate variability (heart electrical pulse test), a pupilometer&#xD;
      (eye) test, and parent/child questionnaires. You may benefit from this research, but there is&#xD;
      no guarantee that being in this study will help you.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>With the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment, percentiles indicate functioning assessment after a concussion. Having a higher score on this assessment implies having a worse outcome assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Concussion Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Post Concussion Symptom Scale- a 22 item questionnaire, rated on a 0-6 scale. Having a higher score indicates having worse symptom assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Error Scoring Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Balance Error Scoring Symptom- a balance test conducted in person. Patient is asked to do a 3 poses on the floor and 3 poses standing on a foam and asked to stand still. The amount of errors will be counted for the times the patient moves. The higher the errors, means patient does not have a well-balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal Pain Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>4 item to rate abdominal pain. Higher score indicates having worse outcome.</description>
