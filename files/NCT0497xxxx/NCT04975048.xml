  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous analysis showed that sterol regulatory element binding protein gene (SREBF1)&#xD;
      rs2236513/rs2297508/rs4925119 polymorphism modulated the relation between dietary cholesterol&#xD;
      and serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol /serum total cholesterol. This study aims to&#xD;
      confirm and extend this finding by characterizing the effects of cholesterol from egg yolks&#xD;
      on lipid profiles in healthy young adults with different SREBF1 genetic makeup. 32 SREBF1&#xD;
      C/G/G minor allele carriers at rs2236513/rs2297508/rs4925119 and 32 SREBF1 AA/CC/AA major&#xD;
      homozygotes at rs2236513/rs2297508/rs4925119 were enrolled to test their response to egg&#xD;
      yolks.&#xD;

    <description>Group A was consisted of 16 rs2236513/rs2297508/rs4925119 C/G/G carriers and 16 AA/CC/AA homozygotes. And it was first assigned egg yolk intervention during intervention period 1, and then macronutrient equivalent control during intervention period 2</description>

    <description>Group B was also consisted of 16 rs2236513/rs2297508/rs4925119 C/G/G carriers and 16 AA/CC/AA homozygotes. It was first assigned macronutrient equivalent control during intervention period 1, and then egg yolk during intervention period 2</description>

    <intervention_name>Egg yolks</intervention_name>
    <description>Two egg yolks/day was designed for the study. However, uneven egg sizes during period 1 made the intervention unable to achieve the protocol's recommended cholesterol intake level, and the intervention was modified in period 2 to be 0.8 g egg yolk/day/kg body weight. This dosage was calculated by dividing the 35 g egg yolk with the lightest weight among the volunteers, which was 45 kg. This provides a more consistent cholesterol intake between persons as the egg yolk dosage is standardized for persons with different weights.</description>

    <intervention_name>Macronutrients equivalent control</intervention_name>
    <description>The macronutrients equivalent control group was served 42 g egg white cooked with 10 g olive oil, designed to best imitate the energy and macronutrients of 35 g egg yolk (energy 119 kcal, protein 5 g, fat 10 g, carbohydrate 1 g) since the average weight of two large egg yolk was presumed to be 35 g. As an egg yolk dose of 0.8 g egg yolk per kg body weight per day was served during the intervention period 2, the macronutrients equivalent control was likewise adjusted as follow: subjects who weighed less than 55 kg were served 51 g egg white cooked with 12 g olive oil, which is equivalent to 40 g egg yolk; those who weighed from 55 kg to 65 kg were served 61 g egg white cooked with 14 g olive oil, which is equivalent to 48 g egg yolk; and those who weighed more than 65 kg were served 71 g egg white cooked with 17 g olive oil, which is equivalent to 56 g egg yolk.</description>
