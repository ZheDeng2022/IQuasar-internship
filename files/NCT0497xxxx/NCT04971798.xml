      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intraarticular injection&#xD;
      of Cell-free Stem Cell-derived Extract Formulation for treatment of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis and other orthopaedic acute and degenerative conditions affect millions of&#xD;
      people each year, resulting in significant pain and disability. Conservative modalities are&#xD;
      limited, as they may not reverse the underlying pathology and may only provide minimal&#xD;
      relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the limitations of traditional conservative modalities, there has been substantial&#xD;
      interest in biologics for musculoskeletal regenerative medicine applications. The efficacy of&#xD;
      these biologics is attributed to the presence of stem cells, growth factors (GFs), cytokines&#xD;
      (CKs), and extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, first generation biologics, specifically whole stem cell products, are not without&#xD;
      their own inherent limitations, including establishing a reliable source with a stable&#xD;
      phenotype, genetic instability and chromosomal aberrations, intravenous administration&#xD;
      related toxicities caused by the physical trapping of the cells in the lung microvasculature,&#xD;
      rejection by the host, formation of ectopic tissue, and tumorigenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering how to harness the value of current biologics into a next generation product&#xD;
      that can address existing limitations, it is important to consider current foundational&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the mechanism of action of stem cell products. Recent literature&#xD;
      regarding the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) postulates that the&#xD;
      mechanism of action is not due to their ability to grow and differentiate. Rather, it is&#xD;
      secondary to their secretion of bioactive molecules such as growth factors, cytokines, and&#xD;
      exosomes. GFs, secreted from stem cells, induce signal transduction pathways that initiate&#xD;
      cell migration, proliferation, growth, and differentiation. CKs, similarly, can regulate&#xD;
      inflammation, immune response, cellular differentiation, and tissue remodeling. Exosomes also&#xD;
      are secreted by mesenchymal stem cells and act as a paracrine mediator to target cells,&#xD;
      providing a regenerative microenvironment for damaged tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As existing literature establishes that these aforementioned components of stem cells lead to&#xD;
      regenerative responses, we have accordingly sought to establish if a sub-cellular approach to&#xD;
      biologics can provide similar benefits while avoiding the risk profile, including&#xD;
      immunogenicity, infection, and the potential for tumorgenicity, associated with whole stem&#xD;
      cell products. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      MSCs-derived exosomes can act as a cell-free therapeutic alternative to whole cell therapy&#xD;
      with great regenerative potential. In addition, to the benefits by means of risk elimination,&#xD;
      there may be further therapeutic benefits of a cellular derived therapeutic approach. For&#xD;
      example, exosomes due to their smaller size, have the potential to migrate to target organs&#xD;
      efficiently after, without getting trapped in the lung microvasculature. Additionally, a&#xD;
      higher concentration of &quot;active ingredients&quot; can be administered directly to the patient,&#xD;
      which may induce a larger healing response than is possible with whole stem cell therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet these goals of improving the risk profile and therapeutic benefit of regenerative&#xD;
      medicine, we have formulated a novel cell-free stem cell-derived extract, CCM, from human&#xD;
      progenitor endothelial stem cells (hPESCs). Our preliminary results demonstrated presence of&#xD;
      several GFs, anti-inflammatory CKs and EVs including exosomes in this formulation.&#xD;
      Functionally, this formulation also significantly enhanced cell proliferation and induced&#xD;
      stem cell migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this proposed study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraarticular&#xD;
      injection of this cell-free stem cell-derived extract formulation for treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis symptoms. We hypothesize that intraarticular administration of this cell-free&#xD;
      stem cell-derived extract formulation is safe. We also hypothesize that patients receiving&#xD;
      intraarticular injection of this formulation will show an improvement in their overall&#xD;
      satisfaction, Numeric Pain rating Scale (NPRS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS Jr.)&#xD;
      over a period of 2-years compared to the baseline visit. Our null hypothesis is that there is&#xD;
      no difference between baseline and follow-up visits for any outcome measures.&#xD;
