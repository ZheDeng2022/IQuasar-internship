  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if use of Moses 2.0 results in improved ablation efficiency during holmium laser&#xD;
      vaporization of the prostate. To determine if use of Moses 2.0 results in less char, improved&#xD;
      visibility, and improved hemostasis in prostate vaporization.&#xD;

      Patients will be evaluated preoperatively per standard of care in urology clinic. We will&#xD;
      obtain American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUA-SS) and Quality of Life (QoL)&#xD;
      assessment as well as post-void residual bladder scan (PVR), and prostate specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA). All of these assessments will be part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the changing health landscape with&#xD;
      increased emphasis on telehealth, patient may be offered virtual appointments for aspects of&#xD;
      the trial that do not require in-person evaluation or testing. These include but are not&#xD;
      limited to inclusion/exclusion criteria evaluation, consent for trial participation, or&#xD;
      survey completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be taken to the operating room per standard of care. They will be randomized to&#xD;
      either Holmium Laser Vaporization of Prostate (HoLVP) with or without the use of Moses 2.0&#xD;
      technology. The surgeon and patient will both be blinded to the laser mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HoLVP will occur in standard fashion thereafter utilizing at 550-micron holmium Xpeeda side&#xD;
      fire laser fiber at settings of 2 Joules, 50 Hertz. Moses 2.0 will be activated or not by&#xD;
      operating room personnel based on patient's randomization status. Again, the surgeon and&#xD;
      assistant will not be informed of the Moses status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative parameters will be recorded including total procedure time, total vaporization&#xD;
      time, vaporization efficiency (g/min), and total energy used. Surgeons will evaluate tissue&#xD;
      char, visibility, hemostasis, as well as select if they think Moses 2.0 was activated or not&#xD;
      for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline for catheter removal will be per surgeon discretion with a general plan for removal&#xD;
      in the post-anesthesia care unit with trial of void before discharge on day of surgery. If&#xD;
      patient is discharged with a catheter in place, removal date will be determined per surgeon's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen in urology clinic for follow up per standard of care at 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, and 12 months post operatively at which time we will obtain symptom questionnaires. A&#xD;
      PVR will be obtained at 6 weeks. PSA will be measured at 3 months post operatively, to act as&#xD;
      a surrogate marker for percentage of tissue vaporized since it can be compared to&#xD;
      pre-operative PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes from surgery will be assessed including changing in AUA-SS and QoL, and PVR. We will&#xD;
      also evaluate for complications such as urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, and&#xD;
      need for re-operation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is vaporization efficiency, measured in g/min. For the purposes of this study, we defined improvement as at least a 50% improvement in ablation efficiency, based on improvements in enucleation efficiency observed in a recent study . Furthermore, based on a previous study we made of Moses 1.0, the ablation efficiency of Moses 1.0 is 1.77 g/min with a standard deviation of 1.41 g/min.7 Differences in ablation efficiency will be tested via Welch's t-test.10 Therefore, we calculated the sample size based on an anticipated improvement of efficiency to at least 2.66 g/min. We further allowed for a somewhat higher standard deviation for Moses 2.0 at 2 g/min, as the variance tends to increase as the efficiency increases. This resulted in an anticipated standardized effect size of approximately 0.51 standard deviations (moderate effect). At a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power, this means we will need 62 subjects per arm in the study.</description>

    <description>Tissue char, visibility, and hemostasis will be evaluated by the surgeon performing the procedure and ranked on a 10-point scale. For these outcomes, we do not have as much preliminary data, however, it is reasonable to assume a moderate effect size, as was observed in a study of Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate (HoLEP) We will test for differences in the secondary outcomes using a multivariate ANOVA. The sample size for the primary outcome will provide greater than 80% power for this test, using the O'Brien and Shieh algorithm.</description>
