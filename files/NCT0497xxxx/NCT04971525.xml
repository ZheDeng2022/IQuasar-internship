  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to learn about the risk of cancer after treatment with darvadstrocel compared&#xD;
      to other standards of care in people with Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the study doctors will review each participant's past medical records. This&#xD;
      study is about collecting existing information only; participants will not receive treatment&#xD;
      or need to visit a study doctor during this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with CD and CPAF. This&#xD;
      study will assess tumorigenicity risk and all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in&#xD;
      participants with darvadstrocel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 13,080 participants. Data will be collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from European secondary data sources. Participants will be assigned to two&#xD;
      cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Darvadstrocel cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matched control cohort: Alternate SoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France, Germany, Netherlands, and Spain. The&#xD;
      overall duration of the study will be approximately 96 months, including index period (the&#xD;
      time in which eligible participants are included in the study) and 12 months follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Darvadstrocel cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be included in the darvadstrocel cohort if they have at least one&#xD;
        record of prescription/dispensation/administration of darvadstrocel at some point during&#xD;
        the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Comparator cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A comparator cohort of controls (matched control cohort) will be composed of&#xD;
             participants with CD and PAF randomly selected from a pool of eligible participants&#xD;
             with no history of administration of darvadstrocel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has any other management of CPAF different to darvadstrocel, from no treatment to any&#xD;
             other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has less than 12 months of uninterrupted data within country-specific data source&#xD;
             prior to index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has not meet quality indicators for country-specific data source (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has diagnosis of cancer prior to index date. This will minimise the misclassification&#xD;
             of prevalent or metastatic cancer as incident cases for the analysis of the study&#xD;
             objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has diagnosis of ulcerative colitis at any point during the study period and medical&#xD;
             history period. This will avoid potential ascertainment bias as there is currently no&#xD;
             gold standard for differential diagnosis in IBD. Approximately 5 percent (%) to 15% of&#xD;
             cases do not meet strict criteria for either ulcerative colitis (UC) or CD and in up&#xD;
             to 14% of participants classified as UC and CD, the diagnosis changes over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has record of proctectomy or colectomy prior to index date. Proctectomy and colectomy&#xD;
             are considered &quot;last chance&quot; surgery options for anal fistulas or other complications&#xD;
             of CD. These participants are not the target population for darvadstrocel. They would&#xD;
             not be eligible for darvadstrocel administration and loss of their gastrointestinal&#xD;
             tract would affect the risk of colorectal cancer; the most common cancer associated&#xD;
             with CD.&#xD;
