  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is to&#xD;
      assess the short-term cognitive effects of two beverages containing 100 and 300 mg&#xD;
      coffeeberry extract (obtained from the fruit of the coffee plant (Coffea arabica) compared to&#xD;
      a placebo beverage. The trial will utilise the COMPASS cognitive assessment system and&#xD;
      cognitive demand battery (CDB) and mood visual analogue scales (VAS) with assessments taking&#xD;
      place at baseline, 60- and 120-minutes post treatment, on four separate testing days&#xD;
      separated by 7 days. A treatment containing 75 mg caffeine will be used as a positive control&#xD;
      to document participants' responsiveness to an established psychostimulant.&#xD;
