  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mutual goal setting and action planning in patients with long-term conditions in outpatient&#xD;
      settings is associated with favorable effects on measures of physical health, psychological&#xD;
      health, subjective health status, self-management self-efficacy levels, activation levels,&#xD;
      and perceived empowerment. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an&#xD;
      educational intervention delivered to the staff nurses of two surgical units on how to engage&#xD;
      patients in mutual goal-setting in the acute care setting. Staff nurses from two 32-bed&#xD;
      surgical units will be scheduled to attend an hour-long educational intervention. A total of&#xD;
      630 chart audits will be conducted one month prior and one and three months following the&#xD;
      intervention per unit, to examine the number of patients with a daily goal recorded in the&#xD;
      prior 24 hours and the quality of the recorded goal using the SMART-GEM. The self-efficacy of&#xD;
      engaging in mutual goal-setting with patients will be examined by asking nurses to complete&#xD;
      the Appraisal Inventory Tool (AIT) prior to and immediately following the intervention. The&#xD;
      patient experience of engaging in mutual goal-setting will be examined by having a total of&#xD;
      165 patients complete the Patient Experience of Mutual Goal-Setting Tool (PEMGST) one month&#xD;
      prior to the intervention and one and three months following the intervention on each of the&#xD;
      two units.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of charted individualized goals using talhe SMART-GEM tool. The SMART-GEM (Bowman, Mogensen, Marsland, &amp; Lannin, 2015) is an objective tool that can be used to score the quality of a SMART goal. The interrater agreement on total scores was very good (ICC=.0895, 95% CI = .743 to .986, p=.001) with excellent internal consistency (alpha = .995).</description>

    <description>Patient experience with mutual goal setting using the Patient Experience of Mutual Goal-Setting Tool, a 5-item survey created by PI to measure the patient experience of mutual goal-setting (involvement, satisfaction, knowledge, feeling heard, achievement of goals). Questions are on a 6-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating a more favorable experience.</description>

    <measure>Change in nurse self-efficacy participating in mutual goal-setting with patients pre and post-intervention using the Appraisal Inventory Tool.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before starting the educational intervention and immediately following the conclusion of the educational intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Nurse self-efficacy participating in mutual goal-setting with patients. The Appraisal Inventory Tool is a 5-item survey created by PI to measure nurse self-efficacy for mutual goal-setting using Bandura's (2006) guidelines. The items use an 11-point Likert scale, and higher scores indicate a higher self-efficacy score</description>
