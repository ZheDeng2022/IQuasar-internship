      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLN3 involves vision loss observed around the preschool years, with eventual progression to&#xD;
      blindness within 1-3 years. Researchers want to test an assistive device that may help&#xD;
      children with CLN3 or blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if it is safe, easy, and useful for children with CLN3 or blindness to use the&#xD;
      OrCam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 6-18 years who have either CLN3-related disease or blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam and vision tests. They will get eyedrops to dilate their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological and neurocognitive tests. They will be asked questions and observed for how&#xD;
      they do various tasks, such as talking, playing, writing, drawing, and solving problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing tests. They may wear headphones or earplugs. Electrodes may be taped to their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cheek cell, saliva, or urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OrCam is the size of and weighs about half as much as a pack of gum. It is attached to&#xD;
      eyeglass frames by magnets. Participants will do tasks before and after they have been&#xD;
      trained on the OrCam. They will do these tasks without or with using the OrCam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given an OrCam to use for 1 week or 1 month. They will have check-in&#xD;
      sessions with the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and/or their caregivers will be asked about abilities, behaviors, social skills,&#xD;
      learning methods, intelligence, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants samples may be used for genetic testing and/or to make a type of stem cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 1-5 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLN3 is a fatal, lysosomal disease that results in progressive neurodegeneration. The initial&#xD;
      clinical presentation is vision loss, resulting in legal blindness by 7-8 years of age in&#xD;
      most individuals with classic CLN3. The early and relatively rapid visual changes&#xD;
      significantly impact the quality of life of individuals with CLN3. Current standard&#xD;
      accommodative approaches for the progressive blindness, i.e. enlarged fonts, Braille, sign&#xD;
      language, have limited applicability given the multiple disabilities associated with the&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. Though treatment trials are in development, none specifically targets low&#xD;
      vision. We propose a pilot study of an augmentative visual device, OrCam MyEye 2 (OrCam), in&#xD;
      pediatric individuals with CLN3-related conditions. Information on the use of the OrCam MyEye&#xD;
      2 device in the pediatric population with low vision is not available. Thus, to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and effectiveness of this device in children with low vision, and no concomitant&#xD;
      neurodegenerative process, we will also include a cohort of pediatric individuals with low&#xD;
      vision but without a CLN3-related disorder. We hypothesize that, given the relatively simple&#xD;
      design and operating procedure of the device, the use of the OrCam by study participants will&#xD;
      be safe and feasible. We also hypothesize that the device will enhance their ability to&#xD;
      obtain visually based information. The study objectives are to assess the safety,&#xD;
      feasibility, and effectiveness of OrCam use by pediatric individuals with CLN3 or low vision.&#xD;

    <description>The study uses the OrCam MyEye 2, a 22.5-g portable, eyeglass-mounted device that converts camera-captured inputs to auditory outputs. Its advertised functions include text reading, facial recognition, and product identification. The study participants and parents/guardians will be trained on how to use the device. Evaluations for primary and secondary endpoints will be done following 1 week and 1 month of device use.</description>
