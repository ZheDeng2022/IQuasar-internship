      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      loncastuximab tesirine in combination with gemcitabine, lenalidomide, polazutumab vedotin, or&#xD;
      umbralisib, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for&#xD;
      expansion (RDE) for the combinations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, open-label, multi-arm study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      anti-cancer activity of loncastuximab tesirine in combination with gemcitabine, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      polatuzumab vedotin, or umbralisib in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade&#xD;
      B cell lymphoma (HGBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone&#xD;
      lymphoma (MZL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL). The study will enroll approximately 200 participants.&#xD;
      Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT-402; Zynlonta) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), composed of&#xD;
      a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)&#xD;
      conjugated through a cathepsin-cleavable linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer&#xD;
      cytotoxin. Loncastuximab tesirine has been granted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as&#xD;
      accelerated approval for adult participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, DLBCL&#xD;
      arising from low grade lymphoma, and HGBCL. The study includes multiple arms in two parts,&#xD;
      Dose Escalation part (Part 1) and Dose Expansion part (Part 2). Part 2 may include DLBCL,&#xD;
      HGBCL, FL, MCL, MZL, and BL cohorts. A Dose-Escalating Steering Committee (DESC) is&#xD;
      responsible for safety monitoring and overall supervision of the study. Part 1 will use a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 dose escalation design and Part 2 subpopulations of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas&#xD;
      with specific combination/dose levels will be determined from data collected in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a&#xD;
      Treatment Period (cycles of 21 days), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week&#xD;
      visits for up to two years). Participants may continue treatment for up to one year or until&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
