      BIPGEN is a cross-sectional study on the genetics of bipolar disorder. As a subproject of&#xD;
      BIPGEN, BIP-COVID is a cross-sectional genetics study about risks &amp; resilience in the&#xD;
      COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) pandemic in bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy controls at the&#xD;
      Medical University of Graz. Study participants with BD and controls from the well-established&#xD;
      BIPLONG and BIPGEN studies will undergo a special BIP-COVID visit, which will include a&#xD;
      COVID-19 specific online Lime survey about the psychological burden in the COVID-19 crisis, a&#xD;
      COVID-19 antibody test (IgM and IgG), inflammation markers and isolation of DNA from fasting&#xD;
      blood. Genotyping of DNA will be done with the GSA V.3 array. Genetic analyses (Polygenic&#xD;
      Risk Scores of I. Stress or Major Depression and II. COVID-19 infection established with the&#xD;
      programs PLINK, PRSice and R) will be used to analyze the genetic mechanisms of COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic associated psychological symptoms and COVID-19 infection risk. Systems biology&#xD;
      methods will be used to depict protective pathways against COVID-19 infection (e.g. Lithium&#xD;
      pathways) and against COVID-19 associated psychiatric symptoms.&#xD;

      Methods: BIPGEN is a cross-sectional study on the genetics of bipolar disorder (BD). BIPGEN&#xD;
      includes a personality questionnaire (TEMPS-A). DNA is isolated in the BIPGEN study from&#xD;
      fasting blood with the QUIASYMPHONY robot from study participants with Bipolar Disorder&#xD;
      (diagnosis according to DSM-IV) and healthy controls. The DNA is then genotyped with classic&#xD;
      genotyping arrays (GWAS array). The aim of BIPGEN is to associate genetic variants&#xD;
      (single-nucleotide-polymorphisms/ SNPs or copy-number-variations/CNVs) with bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subproject of BIPGEN is the BIP-COVID project, which is a cross-sectional genetics study&#xD;
      about risks &amp; resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic in BD and healthy controls at the Medical&#xD;
      University of Graz. Study participants with BD and controls from the well-established BIPLONG&#xD;
      and BIPGEN studies will undergo a special BIP-COVID visit, which will include a COVID-19&#xD;
      specific online Lime survey about the psychological burden in the COVID-19 crisis, a COVID-19&#xD;
      antibody test (IgM and IgG), inflammation markers and isolation of DNA from fasting blood.&#xD;
      Genotyping of DNA will be done with the GSA V.3 array. Genetic analyses (Polygenic Risk&#xD;
      Scores of I. Stress or Major Depression and II. COVID-19 infection established with the&#xD;
      programs PLINK, PRSice and R) will be used to analyze the genetic mechanisms of COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic associated psychological symptoms and COVID-19 infection risk. Systems biology&#xD;
      methods will be used to depict protective pathways against COVID-19 infection (e.g. Lithium&#xD;
      pathways) and against COVID-19 associated psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We aim at analyzing the neuropsychological and genetic underpinning of COVID-19&#xD;
           associatedreactive psychiatric symptoms in BD and in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We aim at analyzing genetic predictors of COVID-19 infection in BD and in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We aim at analyzing the protective effects of the GSK-3β inhibitor lithium against&#xD;
           COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Cross-sectional genetics study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria are written consent after previous&#xD;
      written and verbal information, diagnosis of BD according to DSM-IV and age between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years. Exclusion criteria include acute suicidality, lack of consent, severe active drug&#xD;
      dependence (i.e., alcohol, benzodiazepines, morphine), other currently active severe mental /&#xD;
      cerebral organic disease (e.g. epilepsy, brain tumor), severe skull-brain trauma / brain&#xD;
      surgery in the past, known florid tumor disease, congenital / infantile mental retardation,&#xD;
      dementia (from Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 20), severe florid autoimmune diseases or&#xD;
      current immunosuppression (e.g., lupus erythematosus, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus),&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis), cardiac, renal and pulmonary disorders or PTSD (post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder) or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls do not have a history of mental disorder and do not have first- or&#xD;
      second-degree relatives with psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoint(s) of the BIPCOVID project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is PRS of stress, the secondary endpoint is PRS of COVID-19 risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size, statistical analyses, power calculation: The program G*Power (Version 3.1) was&#xD;
      used for the calculation of the number of cases. Linear bivariate regression analyses for two&#xD;
      groups (BD and control cohort) will be calculated with the results from&#xD;
      psychological/psychiatric inventories as predictors (e.g. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,&#xD;
      Mediterranean Diet Score, Resilience Scale) and the three PRS as criterion. G*Power&#xD;
      calculates for a linear bivariate regression, with a Δ slope of 0.03, α = .05 and a power of&#xD;
      95 % a total sample size of 364 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial duration of BIPCOVID: 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centers: The BIP-COVID sample will be recruited as monocentric study at the&#xD;
      special outpatient department for Bipolar Disorders (managed by Univ.Prof. Eva Reininghaus)&#xD;
      at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapeutic Medicine at the Medical University of&#xD;
      Graz, Austria. Psychiatric genetics and bioinformatics experts from the University of Basel,&#xD;
      the University of Marburg, the University of Bonn, the Karolinska Institutet &amp; Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna &amp; CAMH Toronto will supervise the KLIF-funded doctoral student and will&#xD;
      support the state-of-the-art bioinformatics analyses.&#xD;
