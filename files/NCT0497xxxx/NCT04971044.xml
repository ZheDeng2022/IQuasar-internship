  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-size-fits-all approaches have failed to demonstrate sustained effects on childhood&#xD;
      obesity, especially among low-income minority families, who experience constantly changing&#xD;
      barriers to engaging in health behavior. Addressing obesity in these populations requires&#xD;
      intervening in early childhood and situating interventions in the context of families and&#xD;
      communities. Developing personalized childhood obesity prevention interventions with&#xD;
      sustained effectiveness that support families in health behaviors despite dynamic barriers&#xD;
      could address chronic disease risk and health disparities in low-income and minority&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recognition of health disparities in obesity, behavioral interventions among&#xD;
      low-income and minority populations have consistently met with limited success. This is&#xD;
      partially explained by social determinants of health. Constantly changing barriers at the&#xD;
      household and community levels impede consistent engagement in healthy behaviors. The current&#xD;
      proposal tests a novel, culturally-tailored and multi-level intervention designed to teach&#xD;
      families to overcome dynamic barriers as the logical next step to address obesity among&#xD;
      low-income Latino families. It is based on the premise that by implementing a personalized&#xD;
      multi-level intervention that simultaneously addresses healthy weight for parents and&#xD;
      children, we will improve body mass index (BMI) among Latino parent-child pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COACH (COmpetency-Based Approaches to Community Health) implements a personally tailored&#xD;
      approach, equipping families to engage in health behaviors despite dynamic barriers. COACH is&#xD;
      a multi-level intervention targeting 1) the individual child through developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate health behavior curriculum, 2) the family by addressing parent weight loss&#xD;
      directly and engaging parents as agents of change for their children, and 3) the community by&#xD;
      building capacity of Parks and Rec centers to offer parent-child programming. Using novel&#xD;
      multi-component assessments throughout the study, the intervention identifies individual,&#xD;
      family, and community barriers to healthy behaviors and delivers structured yet personalized&#xD;
      intervention content in 7 domains: fruits/vegetables, snacks, sugary drinks, physical&#xD;
      activity, sleep, media use, and parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on a successful pilot, this proposal will implement a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of COACH compared to an attention-matched school-readiness control&#xD;
      group. We will enroll 300 parent-child pairs from Latino communities in Nashville, TN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of COACH are to 1) implement a novel personalized behavioral intervention, 2) test&#xD;
      a two-generation solution to obesity, 3) address health disparities by reducing obesity among&#xD;
      Latino families, and 4) develop a scalable and widely accessible approach to behavioral&#xD;
      obesity interventions by delivering them in Parks and Rec centers.&#xD;

    <description>COACH is a multi-level intervention, consisting of 1) developmentally appropriate health curriculum for 4-6 year old children; 2) family-based content that both targets parent weight loss and leverages a shared parent-child experience to improve family health behaviors; 3) community-level intervention to improve access and quality of family-based programming at local Parks and Rec centers.</description>

    <description>The control arm will consist of a school readiness intervention developed by education and literacy experts on our team and implemented at local libraries. It will include 1) child lessons from Puente de Cuentos, a systematic, language-based curriculum focused on dual language storytelling (narrative language), and 2) parent sessions designed to improve parents' knowledge and skills related to improving children's language production and storytelling skills, to ultimately support school readiness.</description>
