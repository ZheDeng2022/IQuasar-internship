  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spectrum of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) ranges from exhibiting no&#xD;
      symptoms to limb threatening gangrene. The number of patients living with it is rising&#xD;
      steadily owing to increased life expectancy, obesity, diabetes, and tobacco consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the terminal and the most serious stage of PAD in which blood&#xD;
      flow to the lower extremity does not meet metabolic demands of the tissues at rest. The&#xD;
      diagnosis is mainly clinical and patients are presented with rest pain, minimal tissue loss&#xD;
      or frank gangrene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revascularization strategies include endovascular procedures and surgical bypass.Endovascular&#xD;
      therapy has evolved as an attractive, minimally invasive method of revascularization&#xD;
      especially in the more frequently encountered patients with medical and anatomical&#xD;
      contraindications to surgical revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antegrade approach is the standard approach in infrainguinal arterial occlusive&#xD;
      disease,however, failure occurs in about 20% of infrainguinal attempts.Retrograde approach is&#xD;
      used as a backup technique in failed cases.&#xD;

    <description>safety of retrograde approach after failed antegrade approach for recanalization of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease, in the light of complications which are classified into major or minor according to the reporting standards of society of vascular surgery.this complications will be looked for and data will be collected</description>

    <measure>feasibility of retrograde approach as regard successful retrograde puncture and technical success after failed antegrade approach for recanalization of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>within one year of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>it means that this approach can be used successfuly in clinical practice and this will be assessd by measuring successful retrograde puncture and technical success.&#xD;
successful retrograde puncture means successful performance of retrograde puncture at any of the retrograde distal puncture sites with intraluminal placement of the retrograde guidewire confirmed by contrast angiography without causing procedure specific complications namely local dissection, rupture, or an arteriovenous fistula at puncture site.&#xD;
technical success is defined as successful puncture followed by successful crossing of the occlusion and regain of inline flow to the foot with less than 30%residual stenosis after treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clinical success of the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>within one year of follow up</time_frame>
    <description>immediate clinical success is defined as regain of distal pulses, revascularization warmness and edema, and/or disappearance of rest pain.</description>
