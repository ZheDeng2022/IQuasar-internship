  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants (preschool children), because their cognitive ability and anti pressure ability&#xD;
      are obviously weaker than adults, most of the children who have this kind of operation and&#xD;
      anesthesia stressors will have perioperative anxiety. After eye surgery, they need to bandage&#xD;
      their eyes with gauze (single or double), so that the participants are in a state of complete&#xD;
      or partial darkness for a certain period of time, which is easy to produce dark phobia. In&#xD;
      clinical practice, investigators found that more than 80% of children with advanced&#xD;
      ophthalmology were prone to leprosy, resistance, crying and other symptoms after general&#xD;
      anesthesia, which brought greater difficulties to nursing. How to improve the cognitive&#xD;
      ability of preschool children, reduce the anxiety level of children during the perioperative&#xD;
      period, the incidence of postoperative detention and the difficulty of nursing are new topics&#xD;
      worthy of exploration.&#xD;

    <description>The modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale (m-ypas) was used to evaluate the preoperative anxiety. The scale has high reliability and validity (Cronbach's) Î± The reliability coefficient was 0.936; 91). The scale is often used to evaluate the preoperative anxiety level of children aged 2-12 in the waiting room, going to the operating room, entering the operating room and anesthesia induction period. The questionnaire consists of 5 parts and 22 items, which are language (4 items), vocalization (6 items), emotional expression (4 items), obvious alertness (4 items), and the role of parents (4 items). In addition to the vocal part of 1-6 points, the rest are 1-4 points, the minimum is 0 points, the maximum is 100 points, the higher the score, the higher the anxiety level of the subjects. The scale was evaluated by the anesthesiologist when the child entered the operating room, and the evaluation time was about 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>To explore whether pretreatment with eye covering can reduce the incidence of acute delirium and the score of delirium after general anesthesia in ophthalmology pre-age children. Methods A total of 300 preschool-age children who underwent general anesthesia of selective ophthalmic surgery in a 3A grade hospital from August 2019 to July 2020 were selected as the research object, who were divided into experimental group and control group with 150 cases each by random number table. Children in the control group received regular education on cartoon animation videos before surgery; children in the experimental group received eye-covering pretreatment on the basis of cartoon animation videos. The differences in preoperative anxiety degree score, postoperative acute delirium incidence, delirium degree score, and postoperative nursing care difficulty score were compared between the two groups.</description>
