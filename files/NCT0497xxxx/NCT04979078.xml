  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a side effect of chemotherapy. HFS is characterized by redness,&#xD;
      swelling, and pain on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, which can progress to&#xD;
      blistering. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) refers to symptoms affecting the hands and/or feet&#xD;
      associated with multikinase inhibitors (TKIs). HFS and HFSR are painful complications that&#xD;
      can lead to compromised daily activities, sleep-wake disturbance and impaired mobility,&#xD;
      eventually decreasing Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive therapy based on the application of&#xD;
      visible and/or near-infrared light produced by a laser diode or a light-emitting diode. The&#xD;
      scientifically proven biologic effects of PBM are improved wound healing, and a reduction in&#xD;
      pain, inflammation, and oedema. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PBMT in the management of HFS and HFSR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PBMT in the management of HFS and HFSR&#xD;
      in patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy or TKIs up to 2 weeks post-PBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The study seeks primarily to determine the effectiveness of PBMT in&#xD;
      reducing the severity of HFS and HFSR in patients with cancer of different etiology&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy or TKIs, diagnosed with HFS or HFSR (grade 1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 1 : HFS/HFSR-related symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT and can reduce the HFS/HSFR-related&#xD;
      symptoms during PBM treatment and up to 2 weeks post-PBMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if PBMT can improve the patients' QoL during PBM&#xD;
      treatment and up to 2 weeks post-PBMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 3: Patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if patients are satisfied with PBMT as a&#xD;
      treatment for HFS and HFSR during the treatment sessions and up to 2 weeks post-PBMT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 4: PBM safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of PBM in oncologic patients up to 5&#xD;
      years post-PBMT.&#xD;
