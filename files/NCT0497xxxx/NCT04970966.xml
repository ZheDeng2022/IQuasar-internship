  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative care of patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is important both to&#xD;
      minimize discomfort for the patients and to obtain the optimal long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      Postoperative sinonasal cavity debridement has been advocated to prevent potential synechiae&#xD;
      and sinus ostial stenosis, as well as to improve patient symptoms. Removal of old blood,&#xD;
      nasal secretions, crusting, and unabsorbed packing are thought to reduce the inflammatory&#xD;
      load, minimize potential for scarring, and allow for improved access of topical medications.&#xD;
      However, the debridement procedure can cause bleeding, pain, and discomfort which may&#xD;
      interfere with the effective execution of postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PuraSinus is a novel topical haemostatic agent based on nanotechnologies in the form of a&#xD;
      transparent hydrogel suitable for endoscopic use and for which the use in sinonasal surgery&#xD;
      could achieve these various goals. The potential of PuraSinus to enhance endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      wound healing may play a role in optimizing patient comfort during postoperative debridements&#xD;
      after ESS. However, clinical evidence on its effectiveness in ESS is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to perform a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      PuraSinus in improving patient comfort during postoperative debridements among patients who&#xD;
      underwent ESS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative formation of adhesions, scarring, synechiae, ostial stenosis and edema are&#xD;
      major concerns often addressed by the placement of bioresorbable packing intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Bioresorbable packing has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of adhesions and&#xD;
      bleeding while improving patient comfort compared to no packing at all. However,&#xD;
      bioresorbable nasal dressings oftentimes have not dissolved by the time of the first&#xD;
      postoperative debridement 1-2 weeks after the surgery and therefore need to be removed. The&#xD;
      removal of bioresorbable packing during postoperative debridements is usually an&#xD;
      uncomfortable experience for the patient. An ideal nasal dressing would optimize both patient&#xD;
      comfort as well as wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized controlled multicenter study at the University of Southern&#xD;
      California and Northwestern University that will enroll at least 30 participants who satisfy&#xD;
      criteria to compare the efficacy of PuraSinus versus standard of care in patients undergoing&#xD;
      endoscopic sinus surgery. The study will utilize an intra-patient control design to assess&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of PuraSinus compared to bioresorbable packing on the contralateral&#xD;
      side. The study patients will undergo PuraSinus placement in one nasal cavity following&#xD;
      traditional endoscopic sinus surgery. The study is blinded, meaning that patients will be&#xD;
      blinded throughout the study duration to which side received PuraSinus placement. The&#xD;
      independent surgeon performing review of the video-endoscopies will also be blinded to which&#xD;
      side received PuraSinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo follow-up assessments including endoscopic examination at three (3)&#xD;
      post-operative visits at week 1, week 4, and week 12. A postoperative endoscopic debridement&#xD;
      of the ethmoid cavities will be performed bilaterally at week 1. Primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed during the postoperative visits.&#xD;
