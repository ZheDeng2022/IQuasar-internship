  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, monocenter and randomized study, which evaluates the effectiveness of&#xD;
      peritoneal gas drainage on postoperative pain in laparoscopic or robotic laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynaecological surgery. This study aim is to assess the efficacy of active gas extraction&#xD;
      with a drain (arm A) in comparison to manual evacuation (arm B,) in terms of pain incidence&#xD;
      reduction linked to laparoscopic or robotic laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of active gas aspiration compared to simple&#xD;
      manual gas evacuation to reduce the incidence of specific laparoscopic surgery pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study include :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the evolution of specific pains after laparoscopic surgery, between study&#xD;
           groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of postoperative antalgics consumption in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the safety of the evaluated procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the impact of the evaluated procedure on hospitalisation duration ( for&#xD;
           patients with ambulatory surgery initially planned)&#xD;
