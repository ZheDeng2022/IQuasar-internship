    <textblock>
      To date, some of the most promising drugs used in the treatment of COVID pneumonia are&#xD;
      systemic corticosteroids, remdesivir and baricitinib. Dexamethasone has been found&#xD;
      efficacious in reducing mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. There is a trend towards reduced mortality in patients who receive remdesivir&#xD;
      and dexamethasone combination, supporting the hypothesis that an antiviral drug combined with&#xD;
      an anti-inflammatory agent improve outcomes in COVID-19. Baricitinib plus remdesivir is&#xD;
      superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in&#xD;
      clinical status among patients with COVID-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk for COVID-19 morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Patients with diabetes have coexisting morbidities and already immune-compromised.&#xD;
      Steroids cause further immunosuppression and may contribute to uncontrolled blood glucose in&#xD;
      this group of patients, resulting in worse outcomes. Baricitinib can be an alternative to&#xD;
      corticosteroids in diabetic patients. This open-label multi-centre non-inferiority randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted in seven hospitals in Bangladesh. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib plus remdesivir compared to dexamethasone&#xD;
      plus remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus, as assessed by the&#xD;
      proportion of patients, need &quot;rescue treatment&quot; between two groups by day 29. Hospitalized&#xD;
      adult (≥18 years) diabetic patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have ordinal scale&#xD;
      category 5 will be included in the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 (by tossing a&#xD;
      coin) ratio in two groups. The total sample size is 362. Group 1 subjects will receive 200 mg&#xD;
      of remdesivir administered intravenously on Day 1, followed by a 100 mg once-daily dose of&#xD;
      remdesivir while hospitalized for up to 5 days and 4 mg of baricitinib administered as 2&#xD;
      tablets taken orally daily while hospitalized for up to 14 days. Group 2 will receive the&#xD;
      same dose of remdesivir plus 6 mg of dexamethasone administered as an intravenous injection&#xD;
      daily while hospitalized for up to 10 days. Subjects will be assessed daily while&#xD;
      hospitalized. Discharged subjects will be evaluated on days 15, 22 and 29 (in person; if not&#xD;
      possible, over the telephone). Assessment will be done clinically using an 8-point Ordinal&#xD;
      Scale and National Early Warning Score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified during an outbreak of a respiratory&#xD;
      illness in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. On March 11, WHO declared&#xD;
      COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 situation is sprouting rapidly with increasing case&#xD;
      counts and deaths. So far (June 29, 2021), 182.2 million cases have been detected, with 3.95&#xD;
      million deaths worldwide. . High infection and case fatality rates warrant ongoing research&#xD;
      to find safe and effective treatment protocols for hospitalized patients. To date, some of&#xD;
      the most promising drugs used in treating COVID pneumonia are systemic corticosteroids,&#xD;
      remdesivir and baricitinib. The first randomized clinical trial of remdesivir did not show an&#xD;
      absolute decrease in mortality. Subsequently, the ATCC-1 trial conclusively demonstrated a&#xD;
      benefit. A third open-label trial involvingCOVID-19 with moderate severity had a low overall&#xD;
      mortality (&lt;2%) and did not provide further insight. Finally, data from the SOLIDARITY trial,&#xD;
      the largest remdesivir trial to date with 5451 patients (WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium,&#xD;
      2021), did not show a significant decrease in mortality for remdesivir alone (rate ratio&#xD;
      0.95, 95% CI 0.81-1.11) or their embedded meta-analysis of all available trials (rate ratio&#xD;
      0.91, 95% CI 0.79-1.05).Though remdesivir showed promising clinical benefit, the high&#xD;
      mortality in the ATCC-1 trial underscored using an immunomodulator combined with remdesivir&#xD;
      to achieve the desired outcome . There was a trend towards reduced mortality in patients who&#xD;
      received remdesivir and dexamethasone combination. This observation supports the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the combination of antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents could improve the outcomes of&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baricitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAKs) 1 and 3, with partial selectivity to JAK&#xD;
      2. Baricitinib suppresses pro-inflammatory signals that may be pathogenetically important in&#xD;
      the progression to more severe lung disease and ARDS in patients with COVID-19. So far,&#xD;
      dexamethasone and baricitinib are the only two anti-inflammatory treatment options; those&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective in large randomized clinical trials in treating adults with&#xD;
      COVID-19 in hospitals. However, differences in study populations, mortality rates, and&#xD;
      endpoint data collected in the ACTT-2 and RECOVERY studies make it difficult to draw firm&#xD;
      conclusions about the value of interventions in different patient populations. A comparison&#xD;
      between baricitinib and dexamethasone for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who&#xD;
      require supplemental oxygen is now a fascinating topic for clinical research, mentioned in an&#xD;
      editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACTT-2showed that baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing&#xD;
      recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with COVID-19,&#xD;
      notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. The combination&#xD;
      was associated with fewer serious adverse events like serious infections.Baricitinib was most&#xD;
      effective in patients with an ordinal scale of 5 and 6, allowing expansion of therapeutic&#xD;
      armament against COVID-19 pneumonia, mainly in patients receiving oxygen support without&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation.Evidence in favour of baricitinib is emerging; a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis and systematic review of five studies with a total of 1190 patients showed that&#xD;
      the use of JAK inhibitors was significantly associated with a reduced risk of mortality&#xD;
      (OR=0.51; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.93; P = 0.02; I2: 7.8%, P = 0.354) and clinical improvement&#xD;
      (OR=1.76; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.95; P = 0.032; I2: 26.4%, P = 0.253) . Another systematic review&#xD;
      of 6 cohort studies and 5 clinical trials involving 2367 subjects treated with ruxolitinib (N&#xD;
      = 3) or baricitinib (N = 8) found a potential role for JAK-inhibitors in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      death in persons with COVID-19. Use of JAK-inhibitors decreased use of invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (RR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; P = 0.002) and had borderline impact on rates&#xD;
      of ICU admission (RR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.02; P = 0.05) and ARDS (RR = 0.50; 95% CI,&#xD;
      0.19 to1.33; P = 0.16). Relative risks of death for both drugs were 0.42; 95% CI, 0.30 to&#xD;
      0.59; P &lt; 0.001, for ruxolitinib, RR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.88; P = 0.03) and for&#xD;
      baricitinib RR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.63; P &lt; 0.001). A recent Brazilian study found that&#xD;
      tofacitinib resulted in a lower risk of death or respiratory failure than placebo in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone has been established as life-saving by reducing mortality in patients needing&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation . Dexamethasone was evaluated at the&#xD;
      University of Oxford-sponsored Global Study on the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy&#xD;
      (RECOVERY). The study results showed that patients receiving dexamethasone had a lower death&#xD;
      rate than patients receiving usual treatment. However, in this study, no ordinal&#xD;
      stratification was used. The mortality benefit of dexamethasone was greater in patients&#xD;
      receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. (assumed ordinal scale of 7). Nevertheless, no&#xD;
      indication of the level of oxygen support was given; therefore, it is unknown whether&#xD;
      dexamethasone was effective in patients who received low flow oxygen (ordinal scale 5) or in&#xD;
      patients who received high flow oxygen (ordinal scale 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, ACTT-4 is the only head to head study comparing these two drugs in a similar&#xD;
      population. The preliminary report of this study is equivocal. No differences in efficacy or&#xD;
      adverse reactions were found between the two groups; no drugs were found to be superior or&#xD;
      inferior to one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is associated with high blood glucose levels, especially in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes, and often gets out of hand. Recent retrospective analyses of hospitalized patients&#xD;
      have strongly suggested that &quot;diabetes&quot; increases the risk for COVID-19 morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Another study found that patients with COVID-19 who have elevated blood glucose&#xD;
      levels without a previous diagnosis of diabetes may be at a high risk of death and an&#xD;
      increased risk of severe complications. The recent surge of mucormycosis in diabetic COVID-19&#xD;
      is supposed to be a consequence of using high dose steroids in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients often have other concomitant comorbidities and are already&#xD;
      immunosuppressed. High dose steroids lead to additional immunosuppression with uncontrolled&#xD;
      blood glucose in this group of patients, leading to a worse outcome. Baricitinib may be a&#xD;
      reasonable alternative to dexamethasone in diabetic patients. This drug has already been&#xD;
      recommended for COVID-19 patients with grossly uncontrolled diabetes. The present study aims&#xD;
      to compare the outcome between patients treated with dexamethasone plus remdesivir and&#xD;
      baricitinib plus remdesivir in the diabetic population. This study will help clinicians&#xD;
      contextualize the evidence and practice sane medicine when selecting drugs to treat COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with coexisting diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is baricitinib plus remdesivir as effective as dexamethasone plus remdesivir in hospitalized&#xD;
      diabetic patients with COVID-19?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baricitinib plus remdesivir is not less effective than dexamethasone plus remdesivir in&#xD;
      hospitalized diabetic patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
