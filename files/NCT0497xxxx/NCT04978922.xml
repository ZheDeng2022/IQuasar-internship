    <textblock>
      Given the current situation concerning healthcare, population demographics and economy, it&#xD;
      seems required to look for new approaches in the health system. The use of new technologies&#xD;
      must be the main factor for this change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact that the application of an artificial intelligence system (Machine&#xD;
      Learning) could have on an active telemonitoring programme of readmitted COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular objectives: to determine the changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of healthcare resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients´ quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Load of work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the telEPOC programme and Machine Learning developement in this project,&#xD;
      non-randomized intervention study, with two branches: intervention (Galdakao hospital) and&#xD;
      control (Cruces and Basurto hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size of at least 115 patients per hospital (115 in the intervention branch and 230 in&#xD;
      the control branch). A 2-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uni and multivariate statistics will be applied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Telemonitoring programmes are an alternative to the traditional systems of patients' control,&#xD;
      specially in chronic diseases. This kind of tools are also important because of the aging of&#xD;
      the population, the increase in chronic diseases and the consequent increase in costs of&#xD;
      maintenance of the health systems. On the other hand, nowadays these chronic patients are&#xD;
      especially attended because of exacerbations, fundamentally in emergencies and&#xD;
      hospitalization, and also in in-person scheduled consultations when patients are stable.&#xD;
      Then, a closer attention is more desirable by the point of view of clinic, management, and&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a highly prevalent disease. Moreover, it has&#xD;
      a high consumption of sanitary resources and costs, 50% of whom are due to hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, exacerbations in COPD and specially the severe ones, have important consequences&#xD;
      for patients (decrease of pulmonary function, worsening of quality of life and increase in&#xD;
      mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of that, telemonitoring appears to be a solution to improve the control of these&#xD;
      patients and improve the consumption of resources. In Galdakao Hospital in Spain, it was&#xD;
      initiated a telemonitoring programme in COPD patients who re-admit to hospital. Its primary&#xD;
      objective was tos reduce readmissions because of COPD exacerbations and it could demonstrate&#xD;
      a significant decrease in the use of sanitary resources (hospitalizations, visit to&#xD;
      emergences department, readmissions and average stay days). It also demonstrated a less&#xD;
      worsening in clinical symptoms and quality of life in more severe patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are three factors that are very important in chronic diseases: the increase in&#xD;
      aging people, the increase of people with chronic diseases and the fast evolution of&#xD;
      technology, specially the recollection and information processing systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML) is the most important part of de Artificial Intelligence, and its&#xD;
      objective is the learning of a computer. The computer writes its own programmes to solve&#xD;
      problems that we do not know how to solve. When works are difficult, like doing predictions&#xD;
      in medical scenarios, ML algorithms need a high quantity of dates to get the learning. Most&#xD;
      medical data bases have inconveniences that come from human intervention, like missing data,&#xD;
      wrong values, etc. Because of that, programmes based on telemedicine appears to be an ideal&#xD;
      platform for ML algorithms. This is because telemedicine systems normally produce a periodic&#xD;
      flow of collected data by electronic ways and they are directly saved in a data base. This&#xD;
      constant flow of dates and the low participation of people in the recollection and storage of&#xD;
      them, give high quality to data bases, which ML algorithms can use to do the best&#xD;
      predictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of that, TelEPOC (the Telemonitoring program in a COPD cohort, in Galdakao Hospital)&#xD;
      shows to be the best option to use in its data the ML algorithms, due to the quality and the&#xD;
      quantity of generated data, and also because of the utility of those predictions in the&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this situation, the question is if investigators could anticipate to an exacerbation or&#xD;
      how much they could anticipate a manifestation of an exacerbation. To test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      it is presented here a project that uses Artificial Intelligence (ML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators previously did a test of this system, that gave promising results. That&#xD;
      prototype was trained with retrospective data that TelEPOC programme had recollected before&#xD;
      and it was based on an ML algorithm called Random Forests. With this probe they got a ROC&#xD;
      curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0,8 in prediction of suffering an&#xD;
      exacerbation in following three days. Currently in Galdakao Hospital there is developing a ML&#xD;
      system in the TelEPOC programme. Its objective is to anticipate to an alarm (exacerbation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whit this purpose investigators consider a lot of additional questions that can be&#xD;
      investigated, like for example: how can affect the arrival of this technology in the diary&#xD;
      clinical practice? In this project the use of ML can change the way of focus the clinical&#xD;
      assistance. There are tools than can predict de evolution of the patients. Another question&#xD;
      is that if investigators anticipate an exacerbation, they could change pathogenic basis&#xD;
      (inflammatory mediators) that round a COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators considerate this initiative like pioneer in this field of COPD and chronic&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

This educational program was carried-out by a respiratory nurse in two 30-minute speeches to the patient and career, once at their inclusion in the program and again 1 year later. 2) Training in using the device (smart phone) that supported the telemonitoring. 3) Daily phone calls to make self-confident the patient during the first week. Afterwards the phone calls were established according to the capacity of the patient to manage on their own.</description>
