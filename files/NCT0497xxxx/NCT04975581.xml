  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators are planning to conduct a Pilot study of 40 patients of Pragmatic&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial comparing rotator cuff tendons repair (small tendons around the&#xD;
      shoulder ) with or without augmentative patch. It includes patients between age groups 50 to&#xD;
      75 years with large (≥ 3cm and &lt; 5 cm ) rotator cuff tear that can be fully repaired using&#xD;
      open or mini open repair with or without an augmentation with a human dermal matrix allograft&#xD;
      (processed skin graft from a human donor ). The main aim is to examine whether the addition&#xD;
      of the patch helps to reduce the rate of re-tear of the rotator cuff tendons at one year&#xD;
      following surgery. Patients are randomized to receive either a repair with addition of an&#xD;
      augmentative patch or a repair without a patch and have an identical follow-up after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients are followed up in outpatient at 6 weeks , 3 months and 12 months after&#xD;
      randomization and receive an Magnetic Resonant Imaging (MRI) scan 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is to assess the Re-tear rate of rotator cuff at 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery. The secondary outcome measure is to assess functional scores of the shoulder at 12&#xD;
      months . The tertiary outcome measures are to check the cost effectiveness of each procedure.&#xD;
