  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to develop personalized decision rules for selecting the frequency, timing, and&#xD;
      content of messages to promote physical activity. The objective of this project is to&#xD;
      evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of two strategies for calibrating decision rules&#xD;
      used to send those messages. Participants will wear an activity monitor for the collection of&#xD;
      PA data and be randomly assigned to one of two adaptive intervention strategies. The decision&#xD;
      rule for each participant will be refined on a monthly basis throughout the 6-month study&#xD;
      based upon the accumulating data on how each participant is responding to different messages&#xD;
      under different conditions. Our hypothesis is that more intensive intervention strategies&#xD;
      will offer a better user experience because the resulting treatments will be experienced as&#xD;
      more personalized.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive up to 6 messages/day to support achievement of their behavior change goal. Messages are only delivered outside of a participant-specific Do Not Disturb window (e.g., 11pm-8am). Messages with coordinating images are selected from three content domains: Move More, Sit Less, and Inspirational Quotes Unrelated to Movement within the first month. The decision rule for each participant will be refined on a monthly basis throughout the 6-month study based upon the accumulating data on how each participant is responding to different messages under different conditions.</description>
