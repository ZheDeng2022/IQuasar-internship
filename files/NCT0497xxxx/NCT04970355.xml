      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of erenumab in participants with&#xD;
      chronic cluster headache.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of erenumab in a loading dose of 280mg&#xD;
      followed by 140mg after 4 weeks compared to placebo as a prophylactic treatment in patients&#xD;
      with chronic cluster headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a 10-week 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, parallel- group, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      design. Data from this study will provide important information if the blockade of the CGRP&#xD;
      receptor with erenumab is an efficacious principle for the treatment of chronic cluster&#xD;
      headache&#xD;
