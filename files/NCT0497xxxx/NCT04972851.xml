  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AIRB research team will compare the use and effectiveness of each intervention (Mind the&#xD;
      Gap, Remaking Recess and Self Determined Learning Model of Instruction) with and without the&#xD;
      addition of our implementation strategy, UNITED. In all groups, the research team will train&#xD;
      community practitioners using remote delivery of professional development modules specific to&#xD;
      the intervention and active coaching as dictated by the intervention procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will pair UNITED with three interventions that cover the ages of early&#xD;
      childhood, childhood, and adolescence. These include Mind the Gap (MTG), a family navigation&#xD;
      intervention for children newly diagnosed under age 8, Remaking Recess (RR), a school-based&#xD;
      social/peer engagement intervention for children ages 5-12, and Self-Determination Learning&#xD;
      Model of Instruction (SDMLI), a self-advocacy intervention for adolescents (13-22 years; 22&#xD;
      is the upper age limit of high school for individuals with disabilities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the SDLMI, school personnel will be trained to work with adolescents with ASD using the&#xD;
      SDLMI model. This model will help students with ASD set their own goals and help attain them.&#xD;
      The total time commitment for the school personnel is 1 school year (2 semesters) for about&#xD;
      47 hours. The total time commitment for the parent of the student with ASD is about 1 hour&#xD;
      (sign consent/fill out demographic survey). The total time commitment for the student with&#xD;
      ASD is 1 school year (2 semesters) for about 25.25 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SDLMI targets school-based providers across grade levels (i.e., 6th - 12th grade) and&#xD;
      disciplines (e.g., special education, general education). They will receive 7.5 hours of&#xD;
      remote professional development in SDLMI. Coaching will take placed based on the SDLMI&#xD;
      Facilitator Objectives that provide a road map for the facilitator. In school contexts, SDLMI&#xD;
      instruction is implemented over the course of a school year or 2 semesters (approximately 24&#xD;
      weeks). Practitioners will receive 12 hours of remote coaching during sessions with students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 assessment time points. At entry, the teachers/school staff will fill out&#xD;
      Demographic, Implementation Climate, Knowledge, Skills, and Use, and Acceptability of&#xD;
      Intervention Measure (AIM). At 12 weeks of the study and at 24 weeks of the study (exit),&#xD;
      they will fill out Implementation Climate, Knowledge, Skills, and Use, and Acceptability of&#xD;
      Intervention Measure (AIM). Teachers/school staff will also fill out SDLMI fidelity&#xD;
      questionnaire 6 times over the course of the school year. The parents will fill out a&#xD;
      Demographic form at entry. Students will complete the following questionnaires at entry,&#xD;
      mid-study (12 weeks) and end of study (24 weeks): the Self Determination Inventory: Student&#xD;
      Report and Goal Attainment Scaling as a part of the SDLMI intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in SDLMI will be randomized to receive UNITED, exploratory implementation&#xD;
      strategy, or implementation as usual (IAU). UNITED is premised on the idea that successful&#xD;
      implementation in organizations like schools and early intervention systems requires a&#xD;
      team-based approach, in which the team is thoughtfully assembled, develops a plan for&#xD;
      implementation, assigns roles and responsibilities, and carefully tracks and supports&#xD;
      implementation and sustainment in all its stages. To address these requirements, the research&#xD;
      team combined two well-tested strategies. The first is social network analysis (SNA) through&#xD;
      which the research team will systematically identify members of the team who will implement&#xD;
      each intervention. The second is TeamSTEPPS (Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance&#xD;
      and Patient Safety), an evidence-based set of teamwork tools that optimizes target population&#xD;
      outcomes by improving communication and teamwork skills. The research staff will approach the&#xD;
      school leaders (2 at maximum) and explain SDLMI. After the school leaders agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study, they will complete a site agreement to participate and then fill&#xD;
      out the Social Network Assessment (SNA) to provide names, roles, and emails of school&#xD;
      personnel at the school that have significant roles in the school that relate to SDLMI. The&#xD;
      research staff will then email these school personnel the SNA as well. After receiving the&#xD;
      completed SNA assessments, the research staff will randomize each organization to UNITED vs&#xD;
      Implementation as Usual (IAU). The research team will use the data from these assessments to&#xD;
      assess both arms of the study. Additionally, for those randomized to UNITED, Dr. Elizabeth&#xD;
      McGhee Hassrick at Drexel University and her team, will provide the research sites the top&#xD;
      2-5 school personnel identified by the SNA as key for intervention implementation support.&#xD;
      This team will be invited to participate in the UNITED implementation team.&#xD;
