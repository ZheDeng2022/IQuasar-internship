    <textblock>
      According to chewing gum can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, it is used as&#xD;
      an intervention measure for patients after lumbar surgery to evaluate the effect of chewing&#xD;
      gum on improving abdominal distension of patients after lumbar surgery, so as to provide&#xD;
      basis for the application and promotion of chewing gum in lumbar postoperative nursing&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the patients after lumbar surgery were given chewing gum after anesthesia. The&#xD;
      exhaust time, defecation time and the incidence of abdominal distension of the two groups&#xD;
      were compared, and the significance of chewing gum in improving abdominal distension after&#xD;
      lumbar surgery was discussed&#xD;
