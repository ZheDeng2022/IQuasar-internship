    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine non-inferiority in safety and efficacy when Quanta&#xD;
      SC+ is used in the self-care home environment compared to a hemodialysis facility.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the Quanta SC+ hemodialysis System for&#xD;
      home use by patients with established kidney failure. A dialysis prescription of 3 sessions&#xD;
      per week, 4 hours per session, or facility standard will be provided during the in-clinic&#xD;
      training period, followed by the home period with a dialysis prescription of 4 sessions per&#xD;
      week, 3.5 hours per session.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Following enrollment participants will begin hemodialysis treatments on the SC+ machine on a prescription of four-hour treatments, three times per week or per facility standard for training within a hemodialysis facility for a minimum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
During this time, both patients and caregivers will undergo extensive training and competency sign off on all aspects of safely administering hemodialysis treatment in the home. This 4 week period can be extended week by week to a maximum of 8 weeks until competency sign off is achieved.&#xD;
Upon completion of training, a 1 week transition period will occur followed by the home hemodialysis phase (test phase) which consists of 8 weeks of treatments performed 4 times per week, 3.5 hours each treatment in the participant's home setting by the participant or their care partner.</intervention_model_description>
