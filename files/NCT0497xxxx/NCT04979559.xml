    <textblock>
      Background: Preventing type-2 diabetes mellitus begins with early screening and intervention&#xD;
      of prediabetic participants. Until now, prediabetes screening and early intervention have not&#xD;
      been optimal. The rapid advancement of technology, as well as its increased use, may provide&#xD;
      an opportunity to improve the quality and cost of healthcare services. It is quite&#xD;
      practicable to investigate and implement a valid, practical and easy-to-use mobile health&#xD;
      application for participants and health staffs in screening and early intervention of&#xD;
      prediabetes participants at primary health cares setting. This protocol aimed to identify and&#xD;
      develop a valid, practical, and easy-to-use mobile health application for screening and early&#xD;
      intervention of prediabetes participants at primary health cares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This protocol was prepared in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items:&#xD;
      Recommendations for Interventional Trials 2013 statement. This is a mixed-methods study with&#xD;
      sequential exploratory approach. This project will begin with in-depth interview to gather&#xD;
      qualitative information regarding mobile health application necessity for prediabetes&#xD;
      participants at the primary health cares. The impact of the usage will be studied&#xD;
      quantitatively using randomized controlled trial. Prediabetic participants and primary health&#xD;
      cares staffs at Yogyakarta province will be the research subjects. The collected findings&#xD;
      will be examined based on the type of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The proposed research aimed to obtain information and trial results regarding&#xD;
      mobile health application usage for prediabetes participants screening and early intervention&#xD;
      at primary health cares setting.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to create a mobile health application for prediabetes patients that&#xD;
      included screening and early intervention in Primary Health Cares (PHCs) setting. More&#xD;
      specifically, the objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To portray regular prediabetes screening and early intervention practice in PHCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess prediabetes screening and early intervention data necessity for mobile health&#xD;
           application model at PHCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the feasibility of mobile health application usage for screening and early&#xD;
           intervention of prediabetes patients at PHCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess internal and external factors that influence the intention-to-use, easiness,&#xD;
           and usefulness of mobile health applications for prediabetes patients and health staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the impact of early intervention using mobile health applications on&#xD;
           prediabetes patients.&#xD;
