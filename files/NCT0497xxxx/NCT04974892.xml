  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exact mechanisms by which aspirin prevents the development of preeclampsia in high-risk&#xD;
      patients are currently not fully known. Furthermore, a small proportion of high-risk patients&#xD;
      who are on low-dose aspirin (LDA) still go on to develop preeclampsia (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This longitudinal observational study will assess the immune profile in participants who are&#xD;
      taking low dose aspirin (LDA) in pregnancy. As part of routine care, patients at high risk of&#xD;
      developing preeclampsia are treated with LDA from 16 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Barts Health National Health Service (NHS) Trust. The study&#xD;
      population will comprise of 2 groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Those who respond to LDA and do not develop preeclampsia (responders)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who do not respond to LDA and develop preeclampsia (non responders)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consented at their booking appointment. Participants will be eligible if&#xD;
      they have a singleton pregnancy and are aged over 18 years. They will have an additional&#xD;
      blood sample taken at 12, 20, 28 and 36 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be tested to assess immune cell function, metabolism and genetics.&#xD;
      This will identify cumulative changes in immunobiology at key time points in pregnancy.&#xD;

      The exact mechanisms by which aspirin prevents the development of PE in high-risk patients&#xD;
      are currently not fully known. Furthermore, a small proportion of high-risk patients who are&#xD;
      on low-dose aspirin still go on to develop PE. This is a big unmet need because although it&#xD;
      is known that this treatment is working for some patients, it is not known how it's working&#xD;
      in these patients and also why a proportion of patients don't respond to this treatment. If&#xD;
      the key mechanisms by which aspirin treatment is beneficial in patients at high risk of PE&#xD;
      can be identifies, this will lead to better information for clinicians of why this treatment&#xD;
      works and this could then be conveyed to the patient. Moreover, if key differences can be&#xD;
      identified between aspirin responders and non-responders, novel therapeutic targets could be&#xD;
      developed that could work for all patients at high risk of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main anti-inflammatory actions of aspirin is the release of aspirin-triggered&#xD;
      lipoxin (ATL). The receptor for ATL (FPR2/ALX) is highly expressed on neutrophils, suggesting&#xD;
      that the anti-inflammatory action of this drug is mediated via neutrophils. The investigators&#xD;
      have previously shown that neutrophils are important in mediating anti-inflammatory responses&#xD;
      in PE. Thus, taken together, the hypothesis is that neutrophils are key to understanding the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the use of low-dose aspirin (LDA) treatment in patients at high risk&#xD;
      of developing PE and key to understanding why this treatment does not work in some high-risk&#xD;
      patients. This hypothesis will be addressed by two objectives both of which will entail&#xD;
      in-depth profiling of neutrophils.&#xD;

    <description>To address the first objective, to assess the neutrophil profile in high-risk patients given LDA at ≤16 weeks, a longitudinal analyses will be undertaken of neutrophils taken from participants at high-risk of PE (as identified at their pregnancy booking appointment). The first blood test will occur prior to aspirin commencement and be repeated at 3 other time points in pregnancy. These longitudinal analyses will identify cumulative changes in neutrophils following the commencement of aspirin treatment and pinpoint key timepoints of aspirin on neutrophil biology.</description>
