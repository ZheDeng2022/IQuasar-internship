  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis. It most often affects the skin and mucous&#xD;
      membranes. Sometimes lesions may appear in the area of nails (estimated at 10% of patients)&#xD;
      or genital organs and anus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most dangerous form of lichen planus is lichen that develops on the oral mucosa. It is&#xD;
      believed to be the cause of the development of oral cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of people suffering from lichen planus - 90%, experience spontaneous&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms within a maximum of two years from the moment of their onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In about half of the patients, the changes disappear within about 6 months. People who have a&#xD;
      problem that their ailments do not want to go away on their own must take into account the&#xD;
      fact that treating lichen is not the easiest one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of lichen is mainly based on alleviating its symptoms and accelerating the&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms. Topical ointments containing strong glucocorticosteroids are usually&#xD;
      applied to skin lesions or we can use Photodynamic Therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus is most often characterized by lesions resembling a painless white mesh,&#xD;
      which is usually located on the inside of the cheeks and the sides of the tongue. Lumps,&#xD;
      erosions or erythematous changes are less often noticeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms in oral lichen planus are often:&#xD;
&#xD;
      reddening, dry mouth baking, swelling and minor bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometimes the gum mucosa exfoliates. When erosions occur, patients complain of pain and&#xD;
      problems with drinking and swallowing food. Oral lesions necessarily require treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since lichen planus comes in many forms, some of them require histopathological examination&#xD;
      to identify some of them. These tests involve taking a slice of the affected skin and&#xD;
      examining it under a microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some causes of lichen planus are thought to involve several components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications: lichen planus can occur as a reaction to certain medications, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      beta-blockers, which are common drugs used to treat cardiovascular problems;&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs; injections to treat arthritis; antimalarial drugs; thiazide&#xD;
      diuretics; phenothiazines, a group of tranquilizers with antipsychotic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, single-blind 12-week clinical trial of full contralateral&#xD;
      split-mouth in patients with bilateral erythematous or erosive lichen planus in the mouth.On&#xD;
      one side, the OLP lesion eligible for treatment was subjected to photodynamic therapy using&#xD;
      toluidine blue in four sessions every 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      olp on the other side was treated with the administration of the steroid triamcinolone for 8&#xD;
      days&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of the evolution of OLP eruptions was performed within 12 weeks of&#xD;
      qualifying for treatment: at baseline, at the end of both treatments (day 8) and after the&#xD;
      next 11 weeks&#xD;
