    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and possible benefits of AL101 before surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with notch activated adenoid cystic cancer. AL101 may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving AL101 before&#xD;
      surgery may help to control adenoid cystic cancer that has a NOTCH pathway activation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of AL101 administered weekly for 6 to 8 weeks in&#xD;
      the preoperative setting using National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the differences between NICD1 levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the&#xD;
      post-treatment surgical specimens as compared to baseline in patients treated with AL101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to AL101 by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 6 to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess percentage of patients undergoing the initially proposed surgery. III. To&#xD;
      assess percentage of viable tumor cells in the surgical specimen (pathologic response)&#xD;
      following AL101 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pre- and post- treatment tumor and blood biomarkers and correlate with&#xD;
      clinical and pathologic response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive AL101 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once weekly (QW) for 6-8 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24-72 hours after the&#xD;
      last infusion of AL101, patients undergo surgery per standard of care. Patients may continue&#xD;
      AL101 after surgery at the discretion of the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 6 weeks after surgery or within 30&#xD;
      days after last dose of AL101, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
