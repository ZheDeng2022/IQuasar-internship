    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators hypothesize, that Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) will&#xD;
      reduce migraine disability and severity scores when compared to standard of care including&#xD;
      prophylactic pharmacological agents with treatment over 12 week time frame. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to decrease severity and disability of migraine by utilizing Osteopathic Manipulative&#xD;
      Therapy. This would ultimately reduce the utilization of office or emergency department&#xD;
      visits, decrease the large economic burden the United States faces for migraine patients as&#xD;
      well as improve quality of life for the 3 million chronic migraine patients.&#xD;

      According to the American Headache Society, Migraine headaches affect one billion people&#xD;
      worldwide. In the United States, one in five women and one in sixteen men suffer from&#xD;
      migraine headaches. Migraine is the sixth most disabling illness in the world. More than four&#xD;
      million people have chronic daily migraines with at least 15 migraines per month. More than&#xD;
      90% of sufferers are unable to work or function normally during their migraine attacks.&#xD;
      Unlike many other chronic diseases, migraine affects otherwise healthy, young and middle aged&#xD;
      people. Headache accounts for the fourth or fifth most common reason for emergency department&#xD;
      visits and the economic burden of migraine reaches $78 billion dollars per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a non-pharmacological, non-invasive form of manual&#xD;
      medicine. Headache has been shown to be associated with impairment of autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system including autonomic nuclei responsible for pain perception. It has also been shown&#xD;
      through research that persons with a migraine episode are known to release high levels of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory agents, prostaglandins, dopamine and serotonin. The effect of OMT on&#xD;
      headache can be two fold: First, by increasing parasympathetic tone, and second, by&#xD;
      inhibiting pro-inflammatory substances. Therefore, OMT could theoretically counter balance&#xD;
      both the release of pro-inflammatory markers as well as the autonomic nervous system leading&#xD;
      to improved clinical outcomes. These outcomes include: decreasing patients' severity and&#xD;
      frequency of their migraine headache, which, ultimately could improve subjects' productivity&#xD;
      to society and decrease the economic burden of migraine sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, OMT was believed to worsen migraine headaches, this study is being conducted to&#xD;
      learn about how Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy can help migraine patients. Subjects&#xD;
      receiving OMT could benefit from improved quality of life by reducing subject's severity and&#xD;
      frequency of their migraine headache, which could improve their productivity to society and&#xD;
      decrease the economic burden of migraine headaches. This could provide information to make&#xD;
      Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy an acknowledged alternative therapy to improve quality of&#xD;
      life for 3 million chronic migraine sufferers.&#xD;

    <description>Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT) is a non-pharmacological, noninvasive form of manual medicine. Osteopathic physicians receive special training in the musculoskeletal system to detect somatic dysfunction. Osteopathic physicians then move a patient's muscles and joints using techniques that include stretching, gentle pressure and resistance to improve muscle tonicity, treat structural abnormalities, relieve joint restriction, and decrease activation of the pain proprioception pathway.&#xD;
OMT Standardized Protocol A:&#xD;
Occipital- Alanto release&#xD;
Muscle energy and soft tissue to mid trapezius muscle&#xD;
Muscle energy to cervical spine in all three planes of flexion/extension, rotation and side bending&#xD;
Screening for tender points of C2-C6 at transverse and spinous processes and treatment with counterstain if tender point identified&#xD;
Soft tissue to cervical paraspinal muscles&#xD;
Myo-fascial release of frontal forehead&#xD;
