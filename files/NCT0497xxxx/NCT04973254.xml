      I-TRAINS aims to integrate an injectable treatment that is approved for HIV to individuals&#xD;
      outside of the standard doctors office or clinic. The treatment, a once a month injection,&#xD;
      will be administered to participants in community partner spaces, reducing the barriers that&#xD;
      having to present to a traditional clinic for treatment creates. Individuals who will receive&#xD;
      the injection may have a history of being unable to take their HIV oral medication, as well&#xD;
      as other barriers to care that make it difficult to engage in a traditional clinic setting.&#xD;
      These barriers may include, but are not limited to, homelessness, substance use, mental&#xD;
      illness, and stigma around their diagnosis. Data will be collected on whether it was easier&#xD;
      for the participants to receive care in a non-traditional setting, as well as whether the&#xD;
      injection made it easier for them to remain adherent to their HIV medication in comparison to&#xD;
      standard oral HIV medication.&#xD;

      This study design is a mixed methods effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. It will test&#xD;
      an implementation strategy, changing the service delivery site to a community-based clinical&#xD;
      intervention, while observing and gathering information on the intervention's impact on&#xD;
      relevant outcomes. The analytic approach will include mixed methods data collection and&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 is formative, pre-implementation work, which will use qualitative research&#xD;
      methods to assess intervention acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness from the&#xD;
      patient perspective and will help define the final implementation blueprint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 will be addressed with this pilot, randomized trial comparing CAB-RPV LA&#xD;
      delivered in community settings to standard of care (HIV treatment delivered in the HIV&#xD;
      clinic), survey data, and electronic health record (EHR) data. The preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      of the implementation strategy on adherence and retention will be assessed addressing the&#xD;
      following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Implementation Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will community-based delivery of CAB-RPV LA be an acceptable and feasible delivery&#xD;
           method to high-risk People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH from the patient, provider and&#xD;
           community organization perspectives? (acceptability/feasibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can a community-based delivery strategy reach at least 80% of individuals encountered&#xD;
           for an initial visit in an outreach setting? (patient-centeredness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the characteristics of patients who are most likely to have an initial&#xD;
           injection? (reach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will consistent delivery of CAB-RPV LA be possible in community-based (non- HIV clinic)&#xD;
           settings? (feasibility)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Will the providers at a drop-in center or community-based organization be more likely to&#xD;
           implement CAB-RPV LA in their non-traditional setting versus a clinic setting?&#xD;
           (adoption) B. Clinical Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Can a community-based delivery strategy ensure adherence to monthly CABRPV LA visits among&#xD;
      at least 80% of participants? (effectiveness) 2. Is a community-based delivery strategy using&#xD;
      CAB-RPV LA superior to the current standard of care in ensuring treatment adherence, as&#xD;
      measured by having the injection? (effectiveness).&#xD;

    <description>Adherence to treatment regimen will be assessed as the proportion of individuals in the community-based intervention arm who complete all injections; for the standard of care arm, adherence will be assessed via self-report.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants that receive the initial injection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to starting the injection, participants will need to complete 4 weeks of oral Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). The proportion of participants that receive the initial injection will be calculated by dividing the total number of participants who complete the 4 week oral ART lead in by the number of participants who start the oral lead in ART.</description>
