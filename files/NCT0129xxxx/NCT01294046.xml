    <textblock>
      This investigation will gather information about a procedure called sphenopalatine ganglion&#xD;
      (SPG) stimulation, and its appropriateness, safety, and efficacy as a treatment for those who&#xD;
      suffer migraine headaches which may result in chronic severe disability. The SPG is a small&#xD;
      collection of nerve cells in the head, and is located near the base of the nose on either&#xD;
      side. Participation involves the surgical implantation of an electrode (small electrical&#xD;
      conductor) over the sphenopalatine ganglion. The electrode is connected to a stimulator which&#xD;
      will enable treatment for migraine headaches. Tiny electrical current is delivered to the&#xD;
      stimulator device by an internal pulse generator implanted in the area at the top of the&#xD;
      chest, to stop the migraine headaches. The implant system will be controlled with a wireless&#xD;
      remote provided after the implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will record headache diaries throughout the study, which will last&#xD;
      approximately 8½ months, and a yearly visit annually for five years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This application proposes a clinical study of electrical stimulation of the sphenopalatine&#xD;
      ganglia (SPG) as a treatment for up to three individuals with episodic migraine headache. The&#xD;
      present study is aimed at obtaining pilot data to guide a future controlled trial of this&#xD;
      treatment modality. The study population will include individuals suffering from episodic&#xD;
      migraine headaches with chronic severe disability, as demonstrated by the Migraine Disability&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (Lipton, 2000) and Headache Impact Test short form (HIT-6™)&#xD;
      (Kosinski, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment involves implantation of an electrode into the SPG. The electrode is connected&#xD;
      subcutaneously to an infraclavicular stimulator (PrimeAdvanced™ 37702 Multi-program&#xD;
      Neurostimulator System, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis MN). Proper electrode placement will be&#xD;
      verified using anatomic and physiologic techniques. Participants will receive the Medtronic&#xD;
      Model 3389 or 3387 lead, or Medtronic subcompact lead Model 3776-45, 3776-60, or 3776-75.&#xD;
      Stimulation will be delivered in a range of frequencies from 20 to 130 Hz, and pulse width&#xD;
      from 60 to 450 μsec, and a titrated voltage. The voltages used for chronic stimulation may&#xD;
      range up to the pulse generator maximum of 10.5 volts but are anticipated to generally be&#xD;
      below 3 volts, keeping below the 30 µcoulomb/cm² charge density safety limit, and below the&#xD;
      threshold for adverse stimulation-related effects. The minimum number of contacts on the&#xD;
      quadripolar leads will be activated as necessary to produce a response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prime Advanced neurostimulator to be used in this study allows the clinician to set all&#xD;
      stimulation parameters including the maximum allowable amplitude. It is our responsibility to&#xD;
      assure that appropriate stimulation parameters are used to result in appropriate electrical&#xD;
      exposure charge density) below a 30 µC/cm2/phase limit. As is done with commercially&#xD;
      available neurostimulators, during this study, we will utilize the charts presented in&#xD;
      Figures 1 and 2 below to assist in selection of programming parameters, and this programming&#xD;
      will be maintained by software controls within the neurostimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this exploratory study of 3 patients, the maximum electrical stimulating parameters,&#xD;
      resulting electrical exposure (e.g., charge density), will be determined using the methods&#xD;
      described above. It is our responsibility to assure that safe stimulation parameters are used&#xD;
      at all times and that the maximum settings do not exceed the safety limits. Our plan is to&#xD;
      begin with lead 3776 if possible, because it does not require an extra extension, but we&#xD;
      would use 3387 or 3389 if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a physician-sponsored research investigation of three patients, and the&#xD;
      attention to stimulation parameters will be much greater than can be expected for a&#xD;
      commercially released product. It is our responsibility within this investigational study to&#xD;
      insure the selected stimulation parameters do not exceed the safety limit of 30μC/cm2/phase.&#xD;
      Patients participating in the study will only be able to lower stimulation amplitudes,&#xD;
      thereby keeping stimulation parameters BELOW any clinician set maximum. The only programs&#xD;
      available to or accessible by the patients will maintain the previously described parameter&#xD;
      set limitations. Thus, the programming of the Implantable Programmable Generator (IPG) will&#xD;
      keep the three patients from stimulating outside or above the set and safe parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for assessing the efficacy of migraine treatment will be a&#xD;
      subject reported daily diary noting frequency and intensity of headaches. During this&#xD;
      investigation we will obtain preliminary controlled data on the safety and efficacy of SPG&#xD;
      stimulation for migraine treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Migraine Relief at 2 Hours Post Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>8.5 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is rated at stimulation and 2 hours after stimulation initiated based on four point categorical scale, FDA-approved, where 0 = no headache pain, 1= mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = severe pain. This scale has been used since 1991 for all regulatory submission migraine protocols. Each migraine is categorized in a binary fashion as meeting the endpoint at 2 hours. Migraine relief or Pain relief is defined as moving from pain levels of 3 to 2 down to 1 or 0.</description>
