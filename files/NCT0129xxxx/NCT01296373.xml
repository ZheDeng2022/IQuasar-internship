      RESTORE study:Thailand is a prospective observational study of HIV-1-infected patients who&#xD;
      are either treatment naïve or who have been off anti-retroviral therapy for a ≥12 months, who&#xD;
      have a CD4+ T cell count less than or equal to 350 cells/µL and who have been deemed by their&#xD;
      treating physician that commencement of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), which is&#xD;
      expected to reduce plasma HIV RNA by ≥1log10 copies/mL, is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary intent of this protocol is to prospectively establish a cohort of patients from&#xD;
      whom clinical data and peripheral blood samples (serum, plasma and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells) can be stored for substudies examining reconstitution of the immune system&#xD;
      and its relationship to disease outcomes.&#xD;

      RESTORE study:Thailand is a prospective observational study of HIV-1-infected patients who&#xD;
      are either treatment naïve or who have been off anti-retroviral therapy for a ≥12 months, who&#xD;
      have a CD4+ T cell count less than or equal to 350 cells/µL and who have been deemed by their&#xD;
      treating physician that commencement of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) which is&#xD;
      expected to reduce plasma HIV RNA by ≥1log10 copies/mL is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary intent of this protocol is to prospectively establish a cohort of patients from&#xD;
      whom clinical data and peripheral blood samples (serum, plasma and peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells) can be stored for substudies examining reconstitution of the immune system&#xD;
      and its relationship to disease outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have recently had an opportunistic infection (OI) can also be enrolled.&#xD;
      Investigators should consider the results of the ACTG A5164 (1), SAPIT (2), and Makadzange&#xD;
      and colleagues (3) studies in regard to the timing of cART introduction following the acute&#xD;
      OI. This observational protocol does not stipulate the timing of cART introduction, but cART&#xD;
      should not normally be delayed beyond 2 months after the diagnosis of an acute OI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be commenced on cART regimens as determined by the treating physician. Patients&#xD;
      will be observed and pertinent clinical data will be recorded at visits that will coincide&#xD;
      with their standard of care visits. The visit schedule in year 1 is as follows:&#xD;
      screening/baseline (cART is commenced), week 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48. In year 2 and 3 visits are&#xD;
      every 6 months. In those who, in the opinion of the investigator, develop a major clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of immune restoration disease (IRD) an extra visit (IRD baseline) will be&#xD;
      conducted. If the patient is in the first 12 weeks of study follow-up, this is the only&#xD;
      additional visit required. If, however, the major IRD event occurs after the week 12 visit in&#xD;
      year 1 or in years 2 and 3, in addition to the IRD baseline visit a second additional visit&#xD;
      will be conducted 4 weeks later. It is likely that these extra visits would be required for&#xD;
      the management of their clinical disease. Details pertaining to the cause, course and&#xD;
      treatment of the IRD event will be recorded. These will include clinical data and pathology&#xD;
      results. Prior to starting cART and at each study visit, extra blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      for storage and subsequent analysis. It is envisaged that these storage samples will be used&#xD;
      for subsequent exploration of aspects of immunity (including but not limited to pathogen&#xD;
      specific immune responses including pathogen load; anti-HIV immunity; pathogen specific (and&#xD;
      other) clinical syndromes associated with immune reconstitution; B-cell responses); immune&#xD;
      activation and HIV viral dynamics. A sample for genetic testing will be obtained at baseline.&#xD;
      The rationale for this is to determine host genetic polymorphisms that may predict immune&#xD;
      reconstitution with cART and/or predispose to the development of IRD. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 3 years.&#xD;
