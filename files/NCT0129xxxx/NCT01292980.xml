    <textblock>
      Patients with a suspected Deep Tissue Injury (or a purple reddened area over a bony&#xD;
      prominence of their body, which is expected to break down into a pressure ulcer) will be&#xD;
      place on the Clinitron® Rite HiteTM bed to see if the air fluidized mattress decreases the&#xD;
      amount of tissue breakdown from their bruise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up to 15 centers will participate in this case series in acute care and long term acute care&#xD;
      facilities. Patients who present with sDTI and consent for study will have the Clinitron®&#xD;
      Rite HiteTM bed ordered and delivered within a 12 hour window to be able to participate. They&#xD;
      will have their sDTI photographed, and an assessment of expected breakdown will be noted by&#xD;
      the clinical team. The patient will be followed during the course of hospitalization and&#xD;
      additional photographs and documentation will be performed by the clinical team to&#xD;
      demonstrate the actual breakdown that occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information including the pertinent history of current illness, co-morbid conditions, and&#xD;
      demographic information will be shared with the sponsor in order to demonstrate each case.&#xD;
