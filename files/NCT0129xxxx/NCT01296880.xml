  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of lacosamide on mood and quality of&#xD;
      life in people with epilepsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lacosamide (LCM) was found in phase 3 studies to have good efficacy and tolerability as&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment in adult patients with uncontrolled partial onset seizures, with or&#xD;
      without secondary generalization. Dose-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included&#xD;
      dizziness, headache and nausea, but the incidence of reported mood symptoms was similar to&#xD;
      placebo. The very low incidence of such events, combined with LCM's unique mechanism of&#xD;
      action, suggest that LCM has the potential to be among the few anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)&#xD;
      without clinically significant mood ADRs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of LCM on mood states (i.e., worsening or improvement) have not been examined&#xD;
      with standardized measures. In addition, its effects on quality of life (QOL) have not been&#xD;
      explored, although QOL is known to be affected by other AEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to examine the effects of LCM on mood and QOL in a real-world&#xD;
      population of adult patients with partial-onset seizures. To the knowledge of the&#xD;
      investigators, the proposed study will be the first to examine these domains in a&#xD;
      scientifically rigorous fashion in patients treated with LCM. Thus, study results will fill a&#xD;
      current knowledge gap, and will provide important information to clinicians and patients when&#xD;
      considering LCM treatment.&#xD;
