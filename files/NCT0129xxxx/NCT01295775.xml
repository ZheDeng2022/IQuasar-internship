      The aim of this phase 2 controlled placebo study is to assess the effectiveness of Sulodexide&#xD;
      in the treatment of non proliferative (background) retinopathy in patients with Type 1 and&#xD;
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised study involving patients affected by non&#xD;
      proliferative (background) diabetic mild to moderate retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 130 patients (65 for each group). At baseline visit (T0), the&#xD;
      Investigator will grade the ocular lesions due to diabetic retinopathy according to color&#xD;
      fundus photographs and the fluorescein angiography examination. He will subsequently send the&#xD;
      negatives of photographs and the images -or negatives when available- of fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography to an off-site Assessor -unaware of the Investigator assessment- nominated to&#xD;
      confirm the quality of the images and the grade of the lesions. After positive assessment of&#xD;
      the Investigator, at T0 the eligible patient will be blindly allocated to one of the 2&#xD;
      treatment groups according to a computer-generated randomisation list provided by the&#xD;
      Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following treatments will be administered for 360 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A (SULODEXIDE GROUP): 50 mg a day by oral route;&#xD;
&#xD;
      B (PLACEBO GROUP): Sulodexide placebo at the same schedule and for the same lengths of time&#xD;
      as group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before breaking the randomisation code at the end of the study, an independent off site&#xD;
      assessor will evaluate the photographs according to the Airlie House Classification and&#xD;
      following modification by Early treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography according to ETDRS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in adults (20 to 74 years old) in the&#xD;
      industrialised countries, affecting from 2 to 5% of entire population. All the complications&#xD;
      of diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy, are caused by the chronic hyperglycaemia. Although&#xD;
      a good metabolic control with therapy lowers the blood glucose levels enough to preserve&#xD;
      life, this does not permit complete euglycemia nor prevent the long-term complications of&#xD;
      chronic supernormal levels of blood glucose. The excess glucose causes flux through the&#xD;
      polyol pathway, which results in structural tissue modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy is mainly a vascular disease, primarily affecting the capillaries. The&#xD;
      first ultrastructural and microscopic changes reported are retinal capillary basement&#xD;
      membrane thickening and pericyte degeneration, both of which compromise the integrity of the&#xD;
      capillary wall, followed by pericyte loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the basal membrane are progressively substituted by&#xD;
      collagen, leading to a modification in vascular permeability due to the altered anionic&#xD;
      charge. These changes lead to the clinical appearance of vascular leakage from retinal&#xD;
      capillaries followed by microaneurysms. The lack of integrity of the vessel wall leads to&#xD;
      haemorrhages, and to microthrombosis, which are responsible for the first ischemic lesions.&#xD;
      If the vascular leakage lasts for a long time, the lipidic fraction of leaked plasma deposits&#xD;
      in the retina forming hard exudates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The substitution of GAGs by collagen leads to a basal membrane thickening also in the kidney.&#xD;
      As in the retina, the modification of permeability occurs in the renal glomeruli and induces&#xD;
      the selective loss of proteins (albuminuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent papers show a specific modification in GAGs metabolism occurring in diabetic patients&#xD;
      that could be the common pathogenetic mechanism of vascular diabetic failure. Therefore,&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy may be regarded as the result of the alteration&#xD;
      of a common underlying molecular mechanism whose expression is the depletion of GAGs from the&#xD;
      basement membrane in both retinal and glomerular capillaries. In agreement with the previous&#xD;
      statement, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy concluded that&#xD;
      microalbuminuria is associated cross-sectionally with the presence of retinopathy in diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of the clinical symptoms of the disease despite glycaemic therapy points to&#xD;
      address the research towards new drugs able to slow or reverse the vessel micro-abnormalities&#xD;
      responsible for the microangiopathy typical of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      similarities of the vessel lesions between diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      suggest that new molecules effective in one of the two conditions should be effective in the&#xD;
      other pathology as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulodexide (fast moving heparin fraction 80% and dermatan sulfate 20%) is a GAG with a high&#xD;
      trophism for vessel wall. Clinical studies showed its efficacy in decreasing both&#xD;
      microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in diabetic patients, suggesting that it could be able&#xD;
      to slowdown the nephropathy progression, actually by partially restoring the glomerular GAGs&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary observations regarding the use of Sulodexide in patients suffering from diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy show significant reduction in hard exudates, thus indirectly pointing out a&#xD;
      benefit of this GAG at the retinal capillary level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above mentioned physiopathological considerations and experimental findings, the&#xD;
      investigators deem appropriate to evaluate the effects of Sulodexide on the diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy by the present multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
