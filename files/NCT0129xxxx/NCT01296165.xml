      It is not clear why multi-resistant E. coli (also known as ESBL-producing) have recently&#xD;
      became such important causes of infections in patients living and residing in the community.&#xD;
      A risk factor analysis study performed during 2004 and 2005 in Calgary had shown that the&#xD;
      consumption of the same types of food or well water sources were not significant risk factors&#xD;
      for community-associated infections due to these E. coli. However, a significant and&#xD;
      unexpected risk factor among these Calgary patients was recent visits to certain high-risk&#xD;
      areas such as the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan), Africa and the Middle East.&#xD;
      Therefore it is possible that international travel to certain high-risk destinations might&#xD;
      play, in part, a role in the spread of multi-resistant E. coli across different continents.&#xD;
      This would happen via the acquisition of these bacteria in the rectums of returning travelers&#xD;
      and the same organism would later cause an infection. However, the evidence that the spread&#xD;
      and infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli are associated with international travel is&#xD;
      circumstantial at best and the investigators would like to prove that this is indeed true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic idea of the study is to culture the stool of travelers for ESBL-producing E. coli&#xD;
      before they leave for India, within seven days after their return to Canada and again after&#xD;
      six months. The investigators can then establish which travelers are rectally colonized when&#xD;
      visiting India and if these bacteria are still present six months after their return. A&#xD;
      detailed questionnaire regarding the traveler's itinerary and behaviours in India will be&#xD;
      completed on their return to Canada. The investigators will then compare the itinerary and&#xD;
      behaviours of colonized travelers with those of non-colonized travelers and identify certain&#xD;
      high-risk behaviours and places for acquiring ESBL-producing E. coli in India. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine if colonized travelers will later develop infections with&#xD;
      the same ESBL-producing E. coli they acquired while visiting India.&#xD;

      Title The importance of international travel in the spread of extended-spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator Johann DD Pitout, Professor, University of Calgary, Department of&#xD;
      Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, no 9, 3535 Research Road NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2L&#xD;
      2K8. Tel: (403) 770 3338. Fax: (403) 770 3347. johann.pitout@cls.ab.ca&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale: The changing epidemiology of infections caused by extended-spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamases-producing bacteria Since 2000 Escherichia coli producing CTX-M enzymes have&#xD;
      emerged worldwide as important causes of community-onset urinary tract (UTIs) and blood&#xD;
      stream infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. Studies&#xD;
      from different continents suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of CTX-M-producing E.&#xD;
      coli is often due to the emergence of a clone named ST131. It also seems that foreign travel&#xD;
      to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan) might play, in part, a&#xD;
      role in the spread of CTX-M-producing E. coli across different continents. However, the&#xD;
      evidence that infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli are associated with international&#xD;
      travel is circumstantial and the investigators would like to prove that this is indeed true.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that when travelers visit India, they have a risk of acquiring&#xD;
      CTX-M-producing E. coli in their rectums (i.e. there is high risk of rectal colonization with&#xD;
      these bacteria). The reason for selecting India is that a previous study from Calgary had&#xD;
      shown that the risk for post-travel infections is the highest for travelers returning from&#xD;
      this country. The investigators also believe the acquisition of these bacteria is associated&#xD;
      with certain high-risk behaviors during travel in India such as drinking water from wells,&#xD;
      consuming certain food products or taking antibiotics. Our secondary hypothesis is that some&#xD;
      travelers that are colonized with CTX-M-producing E. coli on their return from India, will&#xD;
      later develop infections (most likely UITs) with the same bacteria that were first present in&#xD;
      their rectums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of rectal acquisition of ESBL-producing E. coli in travelers to India&#xD;
      (i.e. risk of becoming colonized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show that same ESBL-producing E. coli persists for up to six months in the rectum of&#xD;
      travelers after their return to Canada (i.e. assess the degree of persistence). The&#xD;
      investigators suspect that clone ST131 is more likely to be present for longer periods of&#xD;
      time than other ESBL-producing E. coli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the different behaviors of travelers in the India that put them at a high risk&#xD;
      for acquiring ESBL-producing E. coli (i.e. risk factors of becoming colonized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine what proportion of colonized travelers will later develop infections with the&#xD;
      same ESBL-producing E. coli they acquired while visiting India (i.e. risk of infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the ESBL-producing E. coli and identify clone ST131 among these bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at two travel clinics in Calgary and London, Canada,&#xD;
      respectively. These clinics provide comprehensive travel medicine services including&#xD;
      preventative vaccinations and prescriptions for anti-malaria drugs. People older than 18&#xD;
      years that are planning to visit India for a period of at least 5 days, will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrolling subjects.&#xD;
      Travelers who agree to participate will have a detailed travel itinerary and a stool specimen&#xD;
      collected prior to travel. Study participants will be requested to return to the travel&#xD;
      clinics within 7 days after their return to Canada and complete a detailed questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding their behaviors during the visit. The completed questionnaire and stool specimens&#xD;
      will be obtained at the second visit. Travelers will be asked to contact the clinics if they&#xD;
      develop infections during the next six months. Another stool specimen will be collected&#xD;
      six-months after their return to Canada. All stool specimens will be submitted to Calgary&#xD;
      Laboratory Services and frozen at -20°C for further analyses. Specimens will be batched and&#xD;
      cultured using chromID-ESBL selection media. All ESBL-producing E. coli isolated will undergo&#xD;
      phenotypic and genotypic characterization including the identification of clone ST131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During July 2009, 107 stools of patients in Calgary with diarrhea (without a history of&#xD;
      recent travel) and 107 of returning travelers with diarrhea, were investigated for the&#xD;
      presence of ESBL-producing E. coli; 5/107 (5%) of patients without a history of recent travel&#xD;
      had a CTX-M-producing E. coli in their stools while 26/107 (24%) with recent travel were&#xD;
      positive for CTX-M-producing E. coli. (p&lt;0.0001). The majority of CTX-Ms were identified as&#xD;
      CTX-M-15; 2/5 of the E. coli from the non-travelers belonged to clone ST131 while 6/26 from&#xD;
      the travelers belonged to clone ST131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed using Stata version 9.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). The&#xD;
      proportion of patients who become positive will be determined. For further analyses&#xD;
      surrounding the risks for acquisition (or subsequent infection), comparisons between those&#xD;
      who acquire ESBLs (or get infected) and those who do not, will be made. Differences in&#xD;
      proportions among categorical data will be assessed using Fisher's exact test for pair-wise&#xD;
      comparisons. Student T-test or Mann-Whitney U tests will be used for comparing means and&#xD;
      medians. For all statistical comparisons a p-value &lt;0.05 will be deemed to represent&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall budget:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to perform the study for a 1-year period and hope to enroll 250&#xD;
      - 300 travelers. The estimated cost is US$250/patient; the overall study cost is US$75000.&#xD;
