  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of Haemophilus influenzae and other&#xD;
      bacteria in causing chronic cough, through a direct comparison of chronic cough cases and&#xD;
      healthy controls recruited from paediatric respiratory clinics in the United Kingdom.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    • Long delay due to challenges with sample analysis at local labs; • Low recruitment of case&#xD;
    and control subjects; • Constant staff turn-over in the sites.&#xD;

        Controls will be children who are undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal&#xD;
        intubation for elective surgery or endoscopy for non-respiratory-related conditions and had&#xD;
        no acute or chronic respiratory symptoms during the four weeks prior to the visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study&#xD;
             procedures, or planned use during the study period.&#xD;
