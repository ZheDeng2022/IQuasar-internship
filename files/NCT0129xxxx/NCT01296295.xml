      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of regular reporting of&#xD;
      spirometric results combined with smoking cessation advice on smoking quit rate in adult&#xD;
      smokers in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In adult smokers, regular reporting of spirometric test results in addition with&#xD;
      smoking cessation advice will increase smoking quit rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: increase of smoking cessation rate .&#xD;

      Design: Intervention study with two randomized arms in 5 primary care centers of two health&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 466 smokers over the age of 18 consulting their primary care physician for&#xD;
      any reason and who do not fulfil the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and interventions: The study data will be collected using a structured&#xD;
      questionnaire and data collection sheets specifically designed for the study The structured&#xD;
      questionnaire will include the following data: sociodemographics, clinical history, smoking&#xD;
      habit, respiratory symptomatology, smoking dependence test and smoking cessation motivation&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection sheets will include information related to the spirometric results, peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow rate and the carbon monoxide test when performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On visit 0, the primary care physician will give a brief structured smoking cessation advice&#xD;
      to all patients combined with a detailed and structured discussion of the spirometric&#xD;
      results. After this visit the patients will be randomised in two arms (control and&#xD;
      intervention groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed using a computer programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be carried out by the Coordinating Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed up by telephone at three (visit 1) and six months (visit 2) and&#xD;
      at one-year (visit 3) and two-year(visit 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow up visits brief structured smoking cessation advice will be reinforced in&#xD;
      the control group but the spirometric results will not be discussed. In the intervention&#xD;
      group brief structured smoking cessation advice will be reinforced with a detailed structured&#xD;
      reminder discussion of the results obtained from the spyrometry of visit 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits 1 and 2 will be undertaken by telephone and the patients will be asked about&#xD;
      their smoking habit and will be given a brief questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month before visits 3 and 4 both groups will undergo the same series of tests performed&#xD;
      prior to visit 0 with the exception of the peak expiratory flow rate. Spirometry will be done&#xD;
      only in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On visits 3 and 4, the same intervention will be done. On both visits 3 and 4 all the&#xD;
      participants who report smoking withdrawal will undergo the carbon monoxide test.&#xD;
