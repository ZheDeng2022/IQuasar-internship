    <textblock>
      The yellow fever vaccine is a live, attenuated virus that results in a robust immune&#xD;
      response, especially in the T cell compartment. We have been studying immune responses to&#xD;
      live viral infections using the yellow fever vaccine as a model for a live viral infection.&#xD;
      In this study, we are interested in looking at the processing and lifespan of yellow fever&#xD;
      specific CD8 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to accomplish this by measuring DNA replication and cell proliferation in humans&#xD;
      using a naturally occurring stable isotope called deuterium (D20). This technique has been&#xD;
      used to track the turnover of a number of human cell types in vivo. We plan to use D20&#xD;
      labeling to track YFV specific CD8+ T cells in human vaccinees who are positive for a&#xD;
      specific HLA type, HLA A202.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deuterium labeled water (D2O), also known as heavy water is physically and chemically very&#xD;
      similar to ordinary drinking water. In water, two hydrogen atoms bond to an oxygen and create&#xD;
      H20. However in deuterated water, deuterium atoms replace the hydrogen atoms. Deuterium is a&#xD;
      form of hydrogen that has an extra neutron. This neutron gives the atom extra weight, hence&#xD;
      the name &quot;heavy water.&quot; This extra weight can be detected in the lab with very sensitive&#xD;
      instruments. Scientists have been using heavy water as a tracer to gain a better&#xD;
      understanding of animal and human metabolic rates. Deuterium is in fact already in the water&#xD;
      we drink daily. It is not radioactive, and it occurs naturally at a concentration of about 1&#xD;
      part per 5,000. Researchers have used heavy water since 1934 as a safe and effective tool in&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In general, T cell responses to viral infections occur in three distinct stages: expansion,&#xD;
      contraction and memory. During expansion, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells proliferate to&#xD;
      increase in numbers as well as acquire the ability to kill virus infected cells, i.e become&#xD;
      'effectors'. Once the virus is cleared, 90-95% of the effectors die. The small pool of&#xD;
      remaining cells differentiates gradually to become memory cells and provide life-long&#xD;
      protection. The rate of cell division is distinct in the generation of effectors and memory&#xD;
      cell maintenance. These concepts have been primarily derived from mouse studies. Human CD8+ T&#xD;
      cell turnover is not completely understood because of the lack of appropriate tools and&#xD;
      techniques suitable for human studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, the researchers want to understand the lifespan and decay curve of effector&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells and the rate of homeostatic turnover of memory CD8+ (CD28+/- subsets) T cells&#xD;
      after 17D YFV immunization using an innovative method developed by Dr. Marc Hellerstein's&#xD;
      group (at the University of California, Berkeley) for measuring DNA replication and cell&#xD;
      proliferation in humans using a naturally occurring stable isotope called deuterium (2H).&#xD;
      This technique has been used to track the turnover of a number of human cell types in vivo.&#xD;
      The researchers of this study plan to use 2H labeling to track YFV specific CD8+ T cells in&#xD;
      human vaccinees (HLA-A2 positive participants only). The availability of a T cell epitope&#xD;
      (A2-NS4B214), a major component of the human YFV specific CD8+ T cell response, allows for&#xD;
      the longitudinal analysis of virus specific CD8+ T cells. The unique feature of this study is&#xD;
      that it allows for tracking of differentiation of YFV specific CD8+ T cells in humans. Thus,&#xD;
      the researchers can overcome the inherent limitations due to heterogeneity in cross-sectional&#xD;
      studies that involve bulk CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 50 healthy, adult volunteers (18-45 of age) for Projects 1 and 2 to study&#xD;
      memory CD8 T cell responses. All subjects will receive the FDA approved YFV-17D vaccine (at&#xD;
      the FDA approved dose and route of administration). CD28 expression will be determined to see&#xD;
      if it is coupled to the generation and/or maintenance of YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells.&#xD;
      Phenotypic differences between CD28+ and CD28-_YFV-specific CD8 T cells will be studied to&#xD;
      determine differences in longevity. Gene expression profiles of CD28+ and CD28 YFV-specific&#xD;
      CD8 T cells will be determined. The influence of IL-7 and IL-15 on survival of YFV-specific&#xD;
      CD8 T cells will be studied. This information will be gained from YFV specific cells isolated&#xD;
      at Day 0, 14, 28 and 3 to 6 months, 1-2 years and &gt;5 years after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Hope Clinic of Emory Vaccine Center. Individuals who are&#xD;
      planning to travel to yellow fever endemic areas and who require the vaccine for travel&#xD;
      purposes as well as non-travelers will be recruited into the study. Potential participants&#xD;
      may be recruited from the Emory Travel Well Clinic or the CDC employee health or the Emory&#xD;
      University campus or the general population of metro Atlanta using radio and print&#xD;
      advertisements, electronic mailings, Internet postings, flyers, and posters. IRB approval&#xD;
      from Emory University will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a screening visit to determine the eligibility for the study. Signed informed&#xD;
      consent forms will be obtained prior to the initiation of study procedures. The inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and a brief history and physical examination will be performed. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will be asked to undergo phlebotomy to determine the HLA type.&#xD;
      Participants who are positive for the HLA A202 allele, will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      study. It is estimated that 25% of the Caucasian US population will be positive for this&#xD;
      allele. Participants who test negative for this allele will be offered other vaccine trials&#xD;
      that are being conducted at the Emory Hope clinic and their participation in this protocol&#xD;
      will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the administration of the yellow fever vaccine, the risk-benefit ratio of the&#xD;
      vaccine-related adverse events versus the risk of contracting yellow fever is determined.&#xD;
      Healthy individuals who have not been previously vaccinated with YFV vaccine will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Both female and male volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 50 healthy volunteers between 18 to 45 years of age. In order to meet these&#xD;
      enrollment goals, we may need to screen 200 subjects. All subjects will receive the FDA&#xD;
      approved YFV-17D vaccine (at the FDA approved dose and route of administration) once on day 0&#xD;
      of the study visit. Blood specimens will be obtained from the volunteers on Day 0, and on&#xD;
      scheduled time points post-vaccination. The total volume of blood drawn will not exceed the&#xD;
      Red Cross limit of 473mls in 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study volunteers will be maintained on a 100ml - 150ml daily intake of 2H2O, with a goal&#xD;
      of maintaining 1.5-2% body water enrichment (assuming total body water turnover of ~3.5&#xD;
      liters per day in healthy, ambulatory subjects). Plasma and saliva samples will be obtained&#xD;
      during the 2H2O administration protocol for measurement of body 2H2O enrichment.&#xD;
