      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to document ketorolac disposition (concentration/time profile, protein binding,&#xD;
           metabolism) and its covariates following intravenous (iv) administration of ketorolac&#xD;
           right after caesarean section and to compare those observations (n=32) with non-pregnant&#xD;
           state (n=8) (intra-subject PK comparison)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to document biochemical tolerance of ketorolac&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate if optimalisation of ketorolac dose regimen during pregnancy and labor are&#xD;
           appropriated and needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to quantify the neonatal exposure to ketorolac through excretion in the breast milk&#xD;

      Prospective, single-center, open label study on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (iv)&#xD;
      ketorolac administration in pregnant women right after caesarean section. Patients will be&#xD;
      included after signed informed consent. Ketorolac has been selected for this study as it is&#xD;
      routinely administered for postoperative pain relief. At this stage, we only have the&#xD;
      intention to document ketorolac pharmacokinetics and metabolism based on the dosing regimen&#xD;
      as currently used in the clinical setting, and therefore will not interfere with either&#xD;
      clinical indications, nor with dosing as prescribed by the attending physician. This drug is&#xD;
      routinely administered (30 mg q8h) after caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration and collection of samples will be obtained to the current clinical and&#xD;
      nursing standard procedures. After dilution in 50-100 ml bag of normal saline drug will be&#xD;
      administered after caesarean section by iv bolus, through a peripherally inserted venous&#xD;
      catheter, 30 mg, 3 times in one day. The intended duration of administration is 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected (in heparinised tubes) according to following schedule: 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after iv administration, through a second peripherally inserted venous&#xD;
      catheter dedicated for blood sampling only. Blood samples will be centrifuged immediately&#xD;
      after collection and subsequently stored at -20 Â°C until analysis. Urine samples will also be&#xD;
      collected, before drug administration in the first 8 hours after the first drug&#xD;
      administration, through a bladder catheter in patients in whom a bladder catheter is&#xD;
      available for clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subgroup of former patients (n=8), we plan to repeat this procedure 6-12 weeks after&#xD;
      delivery (for intra-subject PK comparison). However, only a single iv ketorolac dose will be&#xD;
      administered, and sampling will be limited to 6 samples up to 8 h following start of iv&#xD;
      administration. A population pharmacokinetics approach will be used, hereby comparing the&#xD;
      data on PK already reported in adults and the newly collected data following pregnancy.&#xD;
