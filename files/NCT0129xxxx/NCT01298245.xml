      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate allele frequencies of candidate genes in&#xD;
      Chinese diabetic patients with or without known diabetic retinopathy. Two hundred Chinese&#xD;
      diabetic patients, aged between 20 - 75 years old, who have received ophthalmic fundus&#xD;
      examination (either by an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera) within 6 months before the study&#xD;
      will be recruited for the study. Each subject will receive anthropometric and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. Then, fasting blood samples will be taken for the measurements of glucose,&#xD;
      HbA1c, lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      DNA extraction from buffy coat. Meanwhile, the participant will receive structural&#xD;
      questionnaires for demography, personal history, medical history and concomitant medication.&#xD;
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and in targeted chromosome regions&#xD;
      will be genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan assays. The differences in the distribution of&#xD;
      genotypes and alleles between the study groups will be analyzed using appropriate statistical&#xD;
      methods. Through the study, the investigators hope to build up a platform for future&#xD;
      large-scale genetic studies of diabetic retinopathy. The investigators also hope to set up&#xD;
      priority of candidate loci for future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most frequent microvascular complications of diabetes&#xD;
      (DM). Current guidelines recommend that patients with DM should receive ophthalmic fundus&#xD;
      examination annually. DR poses a serious threat to the health of millions patients who have&#xD;
      DM. Nowadays, DR has become the leading cause of new cases of visual impairment and blindness&#xD;
      among adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic factors are likely to account for the susceptibility to DR for the differences in DR&#xD;
      incidence between individuals with diabetes. Familial aggregation studies showed that&#xD;
      increased risk of severe DR was noted among family members with diabetes with moderate&#xD;
      heritability of DR risk. Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of DR may also&#xD;
      explain some parts of influence of genetic or environmental/cultural risk factors. There were&#xD;
      over 30 candidate genes involved in metabolic mechanisms and functional pathways associated&#xD;
      with DR. However, consistent associations between candidate genes and DR have yet been&#xD;
      identified. The current study is designed to build up a working platform for future&#xD;
      large-scale genetic studies of diabetic retinopathy. The investigators also hope to set up&#xD;
      priority of candidate loci for future researches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators plan to recruit 200 Chinese patients with DM who have&#xD;
      received ophthalmic fundus examination (either by an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera) within&#xD;
      6 months before the study. Each subject will receive anthropometric and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. Then, fasting blood samples will be taken for the measurements of glucose,&#xD;
      HbA1c, lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      DNA extraction from buffy coat. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and&#xD;
      in targeted chromosome regions will be genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan assays. The&#xD;
      differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles between the study groups will be&#xD;
      analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
