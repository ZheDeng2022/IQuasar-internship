    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) represents one of the most challenging chronic&#xD;
      diseases of the 21st century: it is expected to be the fourth leading cause of death by 2030.&#xD;
      COPD is characterized by pulmonary and extra-pulmonary systemic manifestations caused by&#xD;
      partly irreversible expiratory airflow obstruction. The cornerstone of COPD management is the&#xD;
      prescription of single or combined inhalation therapy, such as short- and long-acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids to possibly prevent disease progression, preserve&#xD;
      lung function, relieve respiratory symptoms and prevent or treat exacerbations. Given the&#xD;
      complex and lifelong treatment, one can expect that adherence to the prescribed inhalation&#xD;
      therapy is not self-evident. Adherence can be defined as the &quot;the extent to which a person's&#xD;
      behaviour (taking medications, following a recommended diet and/or executing life-style&#xD;
      changes) corresponds with the agreed recommendations of a health care provider&quot;. Inhaled&#xD;
      medications have an additional complexity in that patients who intend to be adherent may be&#xD;
      take the inhaled medication incorrectly, prohibiting proper therapeutic action. Taking less&#xD;
      than the prescribed amount of medication, missing doses or stopping treatment for brief or&#xD;
      extended periods will put the patient at risk for suboptimal disease control. Hence, the&#xD;
      effectiveness will largely depend on the patient's ability to manage their disease adequately&#xD;
      in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using electronic monitoring, 3 studies in COPD found a prevalence of medication non-adherence&#xD;
      of 51% which was worse than the average prevalence of 29% (range 3-66%) found across diseases&#xD;
      such as hypertension, cancer, epilepsia, infections and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing evidence on risk factors for nonadherence in COPD is mostly anecdotic and not&#xD;
      guided by behavioral models. According to the integrated model of behavioral prediction&#xD;
      (IMBP), barriers, skills and ability and intention are the most important drivers of&#xD;
      adherence (i.e. medication adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively investigate the impact of medication nonadherence on time to&#xD;
           exacerbation (primary end-point) and exacerbation rate, FEV1, hospitalization rate and&#xD;
           duration, and quality of life (secondary end-points) at 1 year follow-up using&#xD;
           electronic monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate risk factors for medication nonadherence, using the Integrated Model of&#xD;
           Behavioral Prediction as a theoretical framework&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of different measures of medication nonadherence&#xD;
           (i.e. pill count, self-report and physician rating) relative to electronic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the prevalence of nonadherence to other aspects of the therapeutic&#xD;
           regimen, i.e. the use of concomitant medications, smoking cessation, alcohol use,&#xD;
           physical activity, attendance to rehabilitation sessions and dietary adherence, their&#xD;
           interrelations, and impact (alone and in combination) on time to first exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the interrelations in adherence to the various components of the&#xD;
           therapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the impact of nonadherence to the other components of the therapeutic&#xD;
           regimen (alone and in combination) on clinical outcomes (i.e. time to exacerbation,&#xD;
           exacerbation rate/PPY, FEV1, hospitalization rate and duration, and quality of life at 1&#xD;
           year follow-up.&#xD;
