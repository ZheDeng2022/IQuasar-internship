  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to examine face and object perception processes in schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in visual processing that represent a key&#xD;
      feature in the disorder. Previous studies have shown that schizophrenics exhibit deficits in&#xD;
      a variety of facial-processing tasks (e.g., face recognition, recognition of facial&#xD;
      expressions), that may severely hinder the patients' interpersonal and social skills. Some&#xD;
      investigators have attributed these deficits to impairments in configural processing in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. That is, an impairment in the ability to process the spatial relations between&#xD;
      the constituent parts of a configuration (e.g., the spacing between the eyes of a given&#xD;
      face). To date, studies aimed to investigate this possibility (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2002;&#xD;
      Yong-Wook et al., 2008) yielded conflicting results. Additionally, it is not yet clear&#xD;
      whether the hypothesized impairment in configural processing is restricted to faces, or&#xD;
      whether it is more general in nature and applies to objects as well.&#xD;

      In the present study we investigate the relative contribution of component versus configural&#xD;
      properties to face and object perception in schizophrenic and control subjects. To this end,&#xD;
      we designed a series of experiments that are based on former work by Kimchi and Palmer&#xD;
      (1982), and on my Ph.D. dissertation conducted under the supervision of Prof. Ruth Kimchi at&#xD;
      the IIPDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1 investigates the relative roles of local parts versus global configuration in&#xD;
      object perception by applying a technique formalized by Kimchi and Palmer (1982).&#xD;
      Participants are presented with hierarchical figures, in which larger figures (e.g., a&#xD;
      &quot;global&quot; triangle) are constructed by smaller figures (e.g., &quot;local&quot; squares).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (schizophrenics and controls) perform a similarity-judgment task. In each&#xD;
      experimental trial, participants are presented with a triad of stimuli: a standard figure and&#xD;
      two comparison figures. Participants are asked to determine which of the two comparison&#xD;
      figures is more similar to the standard. Each figure consists of a global square or triangle&#xD;
      made of local squares or triangles. In the &quot;same configuration&quot; comparison figure different&#xD;
      elements are arranged in the same configuration as the standard figure. In the &quot;same element&quot;&#xD;
      comparison figure, the same elements as in the standard figure are used, but are arranged in&#xD;
      a different configuration. The number of elements used to construct the standard figure is&#xD;
      varied. Previous data with normal perceivers (Kimchi &amp; Palmer, 1982) showed that as the&#xD;
      number of elements increased (and their sizes decreased) perceivers tended to base their&#xD;
      similarity judgments on the global configuration, rather than on its local elements. If&#xD;
      schizophrenics are impaired in their ability to process configural information then their&#xD;
      similarity judgments should mainly rely on the local elements rather than on the global&#xD;
      configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2 examines the relative contribution of facial components (e.g., eyes, nose,&#xD;
      mouth) versus configural properties (e.g., spacing between the eyes) to face perception, by&#xD;
      applying Garner's speeded classification paradigm (Garner, 1974). We have previously applied&#xD;
      this paradigm in my Ph.D. dissertation to study face perception in normal perceivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulus set consists of four faces created by orthogonally combining components (eyes,&#xD;
      nose, and mouth) and configural information (inter-eyes distance and nose-mouth distance). On&#xD;
      each trial participants are asked to classify a face on either its components or its&#xD;
      configural information, in two conditions. In the control condition only one facial dimension&#xD;
      varies (e.g., components) while the other dimension (e.g., configural information) is held&#xD;
      constant. In the filtering condition the two dimensions are varied orthogonally. Equal&#xD;
      performance in the control and filtering conditions indicates that participants are able to&#xD;
      selectively attend to the relevant dimension - the dimensions are processed independently.&#xD;
      Poorer performance in the filtering condition than in the control condition - Garner&#xD;
      interference - indicates that it is not possible to selectively attend to one dimension while&#xD;
      ignoring another, irrelevant dimension - the dimensions are processed interactively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results with normal perceivers revealed a symmetric Garner interference with upright faces:&#xD;
      participants were unable to selectively attend to components and ignore irrelevant variation&#xD;
      in configural information, and vice versa. These results imply perceptual interdependence in&#xD;
      processing components and configural information. If schizophrenics are impaired in their&#xD;
      ability to process configural information then patients should be able to selectively attend&#xD;
      to components and ignore irrelevant variation in configural information, but not vice versa.&#xD;
      This pattern would indicate the relative dominance of components over configural properties&#xD;
      in upright face processing of schizophrenia patients.&#xD;
