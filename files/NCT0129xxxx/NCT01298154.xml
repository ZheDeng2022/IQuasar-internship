  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to study the effects of intact and hydrolyzed yellow pea&#xD;
      protein, compared to intact and hydrolyzed whey protein, on satiety, food intake, and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in healthy young men. The specific objective is to investigate the effects of 20 g&#xD;
      available protein for 4 different protein types (intact and hydrolyzed pea and whey proteins)&#xD;
      and water (control) on satiety, food intake and blood glucose before and after a meal. The&#xD;
      specified amount of protein was chosen based on our previous studies on intact pea protein&#xD;
      suggesting that 20 g may reduce food intake and pre-meal blood glucose 30 minutes before a&#xD;
      test meal. Whey protein has been chosen as a reference protein because it has been&#xD;
      extensively studied and its effects on blood glucose and food intake are being elucidated&#xD;
      within our laboratory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, nearly two-thirds of Canadians are&#xD;
      overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for the metabolic syndrome, which is&#xD;
      linked to conditions such as type II diabetes. Dietary interventions that increase satiety&#xD;
      (to promote weight loss) and maintain normal blood glucose levels are noninvasive and&#xD;
      inexpensive compared to pharmacological strategies. Thus, it is important to identify&#xD;
      types/sources of macronutrients that contribute to healthy body weight by increasing satiety&#xD;
      and thereby reducing food intake. For instance, diets including pulses (legumes) have been&#xD;
      linked with a lower risk of obesity/overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulses are the edible seeds of legumes or pod-bearing plants including dry beans, yellow&#xD;
      peas, lentils and chickpeas. They are inexpensive healthy foods high in protein and complex&#xD;
      carbohydrates. Recently within our laboratory, we found that including 5 cups of pulses into&#xD;
      the diet for 8 weeks was associated with decreased body weight, waist circumference and&#xD;
      improved glycemic control. However, the mechanisms driving weight loss and improved glycemic&#xD;
      control need further investigation. For instance, pulses may affect satiety, energy intake&#xD;
      and blood glucose because of their high amounts of protein. Protein is known to be more&#xD;
      satiating than carbohydrate and fat leading to a positive impact on long-term body weight&#xD;
      maintenance. Protein from various animal and plant sources has also been shown to stimulate&#xD;
      the release of satiety-related hormones like insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and ghrelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently investigated the independent dosage effects of pea protein (10 and&#xD;
      20 g) and pea fibre (10 and 20 g) on ad libitum food intake at 30 minutes and pre- (0-30&#xD;
      minutes) and post-meal (50-170 minutes) blood glucose response and subjective appetite in&#xD;
      young men. Preliminary results indicate that increasing protein amounts (10 g versus 20 g)&#xD;
      lead to decreased pre-meal blood glucose response and reduced food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food-grade proteins are also available intact and/or hydrolyzed (partially digested through a&#xD;
      controlled enzymatic process). Hydrolyzed proteins are more easily digested and absorbed,&#xD;
      eliciting a faster rise in plasma amino acids compared to intact proteins and different&#xD;
      hormonal and metabolic responses between the two forms. As for pea protein, no data are&#xD;
      available differentiating the effects of intact and hydrolyzed forms on these blood&#xD;
      parameters and appetite in humans. Moreover, the presence of bioactive polypeptides may be&#xD;
      affected by protein formulation (i.e. the polypeptides may be cleaved/inactivated in&#xD;
      hydrolyzed pea protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research is needed to determine whether the effect of pea protein differs on glycemic&#xD;
      response and appetite both pre- and post-meal based on its form (intact versus hydrolyzed)&#xD;
      and how it compares to other well-investigated proteins. This research is preliminary and may&#xD;
      lead to future research in other population groups, including young women and overweight&#xD;
      individuals. These results will encourage increased consumption of pulse fractions by&#xD;
      providing a basis for the potential use of pea protein in the development of new functional&#xD;
      foods aimed at preventing and managing obesity along with controlling blood glucose for&#xD;
      diabetes management. Furthermore, results will show if pea protein is a comparable&#xD;
      alternative to whey, which would be favorable for consumers shifting away from animal-derived&#xD;
      proteins for health and/or environmental reasons.&#xD;
