      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the feasibility of using microdose amounts of near-infrared (NIR)&#xD;
           fluorescent contrast agent to image tumor-draining and contralateral lymphatics in&#xD;
           melanoma patients prior to standard-of-care sentinel lymph node biopsy OR completion&#xD;
           lymph node dissection (axillary or inguinofemoral)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the feasibility of using nonradioactive optical imaging techniques with&#xD;
           indocyanine green (ICG) as a fluorescent contrast agent to characterize lymphatic&#xD;
           architecture and function by correlating the observed lymphatic structure and function&#xD;
           with tumor and nodal status as determined from standard-of-care immunohistochemical&#xD;
           evaluation.&#xD;

      Indocyanine Green Injections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC-Green Injections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive a total of 10-16&#xD;
      injections of IC-Green through a needle in your arms or legs, starting in your hands or feet&#xD;
      (5-8 on each arm/leg), depending on the location of the tumor. You may receive additional&#xD;
      injections in the torso, if there is a tumor in the torso area and the study doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is needed. The study doctor will discuss the number of injections that you will receive in&#xD;
      more detail. The injections will be given to you before surgery and all injections will be&#xD;
      given intradermally (into or between layers of the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IC-Green injections will allow researchers to see how fluid flows through your body&#xD;
      during imaging. This information may help future researchers more easily locate lymph nodes&#xD;
      in patients scheduled for lymph node surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all of the IC-Green injections have been given, the imaging procedure will begin. To&#xD;
      perform the imaging procedures, researchers will use an experimental camera that shines a&#xD;
      special red light onto your skin causing the IC-Green to glow when the images are taken. The&#xD;
      red light is like the red light in a grocery store scanner. The imaging procedure will take&#xD;
      about 1 hour to complete and will be performed before and during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the IC-Green injections and again during the imaging procedure, a member of the&#xD;
      research staff will monitor and record your vital signs (blood pressure, breathing rate,&#xD;
      heart rate, and temperature). Vital sign measurements will be taken every 15 minutes for 1&#xD;
      hour after the IC-Green injections, and every 30 minutes during the second hour. A study&#xD;
      staff member will also closely monitor the injection site at these times for possible side&#xD;
      effects. A study staff member will call you the next day and ask you to take your&#xD;
      temperature. This phone call should last about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all of the images have been taken, and the follow-up evaluation is complete, your&#xD;
      participation in this study will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you spend the night in the hospital after surgery, a study staff member will visit you in&#xD;
      person the day after surgery. At this visit, your temperature will be recorded, you will be&#xD;
      asked how you are feeling, and if you have experienced any side effects. The visit should&#xD;
      last about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not spend the night in the hospital after surgery, you will be contacted by phone&#xD;
      the day after the surgery and you will be asked what your current temperature is, how you are&#xD;
      feeling, and if you have experienced any side effects. The phone call should last about 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. IC-Green is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      assessment of cardiac output, hepatic function, liver blood flow, ophthalmic angiography, and&#xD;
      mapping heart, liver, and eye function. The use of IC-Green for mapping the lymph nodes in&#xD;
      melanoma patients is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC-Green is FDA approved to be injected into the vein. Giving IC-Green injections into or&#xD;
      between layers of the skin and the device that is used to give the injections are&#xD;
      investigational. The experimental camera, and the images taken with it, are being used for&#xD;
      research purposes only and will not be used to manage your treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 patients will take part in Part 1 of this study. All will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete Lymph Node Dissection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to participate in this part of the study, you will have additional imaging&#xD;
      performed before the surgery and again in your follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging will be performed at MD Anderson just before the surgery and during your&#xD;
      regularly scheduled standard of care follow-up visit about 4-6 months after surgery to learn&#xD;
      what the lymphatic channels look like after completely healing from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each imaging session, you will receive a total of 10-16 injections of IC-Green through&#xD;
      a needle in your arms and hands or legs and feet, (5-8 on each arm/leg), depending on the&#xD;
      location of the tumor. Researchers will use the experimental camera to perform the imaging&#xD;
      procedure. You may receive additional injections in the torso, if there is a tumor in the&#xD;
      torso area and the study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging procedures will take up to 2 hours to complete each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, before the IC-Green injections and again during the imaging procedure,&#xD;
      a member of the research staff will monitor and record your vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
      breathing rate, heart rate, and temperature). Vital sign measurements will be taken every 15&#xD;
      minutes for 1 hour after the IC-Green injections, and every 30 minutes during the second&#xD;
      hour. A study staff member will also closely monitor the injection site at these times for&#xD;
      possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will be over after all the images have been taken and the long-term&#xD;
      follow-up is complete.&#xD;
