  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with an experimental drug called&#xD;
      YF476 in patients with Barrett's esophagus reduces the expression of tissue markers that are&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The association between gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and cancer of the esophagus&#xD;
      is well-established. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a condition in which the lining of the part&#xD;
      of the esophagus changes to look like small intestine, and this change occurs in the setting&#xD;
      of GERD. Patients with BE are at increased risk for developing esophageal cancer. It is&#xD;
      recommended that all patients with BE take medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),&#xD;
      which greatly reduce the acid produced by the stomach, in the hopes of reducing the risk of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. However, by reducing the acid level in the stomach, levels of a hormone&#xD;
      called gastrin are increased. There is laboratory data to suggest that gastrin may have&#xD;
      effects that actually promote the development of cancer, including esophageal cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators previously showed that BE patients with very high gastrin levels are more&#xD;
      likely to have either advanced precancerous changes (also called high grade dysplasia) or&#xD;
      cancer of the esophagus. As such, the obvious question is raised: does gastrin promote the&#xD;
      development of cancer in BE? YF476 is a new drug that blocks the effects of gastrin. Trials&#xD;
      in healthy subjects have demonstrated that the drug is safe and well-tolerated. The&#xD;
      investigators therefore propose to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of YF476 in&#xD;
      patients with Barrett's esophagus. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with YF476 will&#xD;
      reduce the expression of tissue markers that are associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing esophageal cancer.&#xD;
