      Day 1 Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will&#xD;
      be performed on Day 1 (the same day you complete the screening tests and sign this consent&#xD;
      form):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a computer-based survey about your mood, diet, and physical activity.&#xD;
           The survey should take about 90 minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, and waistline will be measured. To measure your waistline&#xD;
           accurately, you may be asked to lift your shirt to expose your stomach area and to lower&#xD;
           your pants to expose your mid-hip area. Waistline measurements will only take about 10&#xD;
           minutes to complete and will be performed in a private area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your non-fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels will be measured (with 2 small&#xD;
           finger pricks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to provide a 7-day record of your physical activity using a small&#xD;
           device called an accelerometer. The accelerometer will be worn on your hip and measures&#xD;
           the amount of physical activity you do. You will be given a prepaid envelope to return&#xD;
           the accelerometer to the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups and Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Day 1 study visit, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) into 1 of&#xD;
      2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1 or 2, you will receive health education on Day 1, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months later. Health education includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A brief counseling session with a study staff member to talk about diet and your&#xD;
           physical activity levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referrals to available resources for help with your diet and physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-help materials that are designed to help you learn how to improve your diet and&#xD;
           physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Months 6 and 12, you will also:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the computer-based survey about your mood, diet, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have your height, weight, waistline and blood pressure measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your non-fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days.You will be given a prepaid envelope to&#xD;
           return the accelerometer to the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will also take part in the MAPS program. For the MAPS program, you&#xD;
      will have 12 counseling phone calls over 1 year. Each of these phone calls will be digitally&#xD;
      recorded and should last about 20-30 minutes. You may decline to have your counseling phone&#xD;
      call recorded if it makes you feel uncomfortable. The purpose of the phone calls are to&#xD;
      provide support to you on changes in your diet or physical activity and to answer any&#xD;
      questions you may have about your program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on the study for up to 1 year. Your participation on this study will be over&#xD;
      once you complete the study visit at Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Important Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted by phone, mail, and/or email at any time while you are taking part in&#xD;
      this study to be reminded about the study visits. You will be asked to give the names and&#xD;
      contact information for family members and/or friends for the study staff to contact in the&#xD;
      event there is trouble reaching you first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement cost,&#xD;
      but you should tell the study staff right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant's paper files will be stored in locked file cabinets and all data files will&#xD;
      be stored in a password-protected databases. The information discussed during the counseling&#xD;
      phone calls will be kept confidential. Only members of the research team will have access to&#xD;
      the recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 300 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
