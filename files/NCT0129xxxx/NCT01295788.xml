  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) will be&#xD;
      more effective if introduced in children and adolescents with established diabetes at the&#xD;
      same time as they are starting pump therapy. This randomized controlled trial will compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of simultaneous vs delayed introduction of RT-CGM in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes who are starting insulin pump therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REAL-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring (RT-CGM) improves diabetes control in adults with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. However, studies of RT-CGM in children and adolescents have been mostly&#xD;
      negative. The lack of effectiveness in the pediatric population appears directly related to&#xD;
      adherence to RT-CGM, i.e., the willingness of children and teens to wear and use this&#xD;
      technology. Most previous RT-CGM studies have focused on experienced pump users or children&#xD;
      with new-onset diabetes. At the time of pump initiation, children and adolescents who have&#xD;
      been living with diabetes (and their parents) are highly motivated to make changes in their&#xD;
      diabetes management and to take on additional responsibilities to improve their diabetes&#xD;
      control and lifestyle, the two primary reasons for initiating pump therapy in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. The investigators hypothesize that readiness for making changes in diabetes&#xD;
      management will be greater at the time of pump initiation than at six months after the pump&#xD;
      start. Further, the investigators hypothesize that readiness for change at the time of RT-CGM&#xD;
      initiation will predict future adherence to RT-CGM and its effectiveness.&#xD;
