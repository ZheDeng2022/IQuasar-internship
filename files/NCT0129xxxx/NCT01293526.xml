      The purpose of this study is to correlate the three lead placement (wires that go to the&#xD;
      heart) possibilities and the responses from the patient's heart. This will be done with the&#xD;
      help of an echocardiography and SonR signals, which is an external device that is capable of&#xD;
      detecting sounds created by the heart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) is a device designed to&#xD;
      automatically recognize and stop rapid, harmful heart beats and allow the heart to return to&#xD;
      a safe, regular heart rhythm. The CRT-D device may help the heart pump more efficiently by&#xD;
      improving the timing of different parts of the heart beat. A CRT-D device has three leads&#xD;
      (wires that go to the heart). One lead is placed in one of the top chambers of the heart&#xD;
      (right atrium), another lead is placed in the lower right chamber (right ventricle) and the&#xD;
      third lead is placed along the side of the left ventricle. The top chambers are stimulated&#xD;
      first, either by the natural heartbeat or by the CRT-D device if the heartbeat is too slow.&#xD;
      Shortly after that, the bottom chambers are stimulated. By pacing the heart in this way, the&#xD;
      doctor hopes to improve the timing of different components of the heart beat in order to&#xD;
      improve the efficiency of the heart and to improve the patient's heart failure symptoms. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to correlate the three lead placement possibilities and the&#xD;
      responses from the patient's heart. This will be done with the help of an echocardiography&#xD;
      and SonR signals, which is an external device that is capable of detecting sounds created by&#xD;
      the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the CRT implant, special measurements will be made to optimize the placements of the&#xD;
      device leads. Based on the success of those measurements and a patient's own response, the&#xD;
      patient will be placed into one of three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients with no response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a successful response will be randomized to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Lead placement based on study measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Standard lead placement&#xD;
