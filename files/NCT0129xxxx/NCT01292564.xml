  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to demonstrate the anatomical modulation of subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat across the waist and hips that occurs through application of the Erchonia® ML Scanner&#xD;
      (MLS) Laser manufactured for non-invasive body contouring of the waist and hips.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser therapy provides an alternative therapeutic regimen for the reduction of subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue volume. Although the biochemical mechanism is not yet fully understood, histological&#xD;
      studies clearly and effectively identify the formation of the transitory pore and subsequent&#xD;
      cell collapse immediately following laser irradiation. More importantly, a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical investigation using the Erchonia MLS&#xD;
      with 67 enrolled participants revealed a statistically significant reduction of overall&#xD;
      circumference measurements of the waist, hip, and thighs following two weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      resulting in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for the indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser therapy operates under the principle of photochemistry, activating and/or suppressing&#xD;
      natural biochemical processes. Because Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) does not induce&#xD;
      cellular apoptosis, there is no upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines nor is there a&#xD;
      large burden placed on the lymphatic system. The fatty material secreted from the adipocytes&#xD;
      following laser irradiation are absorbed by the lymphatic system, broken down by the liver,&#xD;
      and naturally secreted. Fatty acids released are bound to albumin, and are transported&#xD;
      through the circulatory system to the liver to undergo fatty acid oxidation. The&#xD;
      triglycerides released are bound as lipoproteins and transported to the liver to be&#xD;
      processed. Moreover, a lipase known as lipoprotein lipase, has been demonstrated to breakdown&#xD;
      emulsified triglycerides; therefore breaking the molecule down into three fatty acids and one&#xD;
      glycerol molecule. The most important aspect of laser therapy is that cellular apoptosis is&#xD;
      not induced. The fatty material being evacuated from the cell must be absorbed by the&#xD;
      lymphatic system, and because laser therapy does not destroy the cell, the complex organelles&#xD;
      and the entire cell structure will not be absorbed by the lymphatic system. It is not well&#xD;
      understood how much the lymphatic system can absorb; therefore, creating a mass amount of&#xD;
      cellular debris by destroying adipose tissue may result in serious long term effects.&#xD;
      Moreover, adipose tissue is not just composed of fat storing cells; there is also a&#xD;
      collection of immune cells, fibroblasts, vessels, and stromal stem cells. By creating the&#xD;
      transitory pore in the fat storing cell only, the viability of the surrounding, non-fat&#xD;
      storing cells is preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to demonstrate and document the anatomical modulation of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat across the waist and hips that occurs through application of the Erchonia®&#xD;
      ML Scanner (MLS) Laser manufactured for non-invasive body contouring of the waist and hips.&#xD;
