  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) is highly effective for allergic diseases in&#xD;
      children, the underlying immunological mechanisms are unclear. Regulatory T (Treg) cells may&#xD;
      be crucial in induction of tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim was to investigate the role of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and IL-10-secreting type I T&#xD;
      regulatory (Tr1) cells in the response to one year of cluster SIT to Dermatophagoides&#xD;
      pteronyssinus for allergic rhinitis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cells and IL-10-secreting type I T regulatory (Tr1) cells were&#xD;
      analyzed in children allergic to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus during one year cluster&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy (SIT) in a prospective and randomized study. Peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 25 children receiving SIT and 21 receiving&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. The frequencies of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells and allergen-specific&#xD;
      IL-10+IL-4-, IFN-γ+IL-4-, IL-4+IFN-γ-CD4+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry. Production&#xD;
      of IL-4, IFN-r, and IL-10 in supernatants from allergen-stimulated PBMC culture was measured&#xD;
      by ELISA. Finally, the suppressive effect of CD4+CD25highTreg cells from both groups was&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;

      Patients The design was a one-year, randomized open-label parallel group study in which&#xD;
      patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SIT with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus&#xD;
      extract (Alutard SQ, ALK-Abello', Hørsholm, Denmark) or to observe with standard&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants included 50 house dust mite (HDM)-allergic children aged 9-13, who&#xD;
      received SIT with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) extract for one year. These were&#xD;
      compared with 21 HDM-allergic children aged 9-14 who served as controls. All children were of&#xD;
      Han nationality and were recruited from the allergy clinic of Beijing TongRen Hospital. They&#xD;
      had a history of HDM-induced moderate or severe rhino-conjunctivitis of at least three years&#xD;
      duration. Each patient also had a positive skin prick test (SPT) result for Der p&#xD;
      (ALK-Abello', Hørsholm, Denmark) with a wheal diameter of at least 6 mm, and were positive&#xD;
      for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to Der p (Pharmacia CAP System, Pharmacia Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Uppsala, Sweden), with a RAST value of at least 0.7 kU/L. Children with a history of asthma&#xD;
      or atopic dermatitis were excluded. The children undergoing immunotherapy were matched to&#xD;
      atopic donors for age, sex, SPT response to Der p, total IgE and specific IgE to Der p levels&#xD;
      (Table 1). The study protocol was approved by our institutional review board for human&#xD;
      studies and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy protocol Children undergoing subcutaneous immunotherapy were given&#xD;
      Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract (Alutard SQ, ALK-Abello, Hørsholm, Denmark) according&#xD;
      to a cluster protocol which we have described previously[15]. In the first six weeks,&#xD;
      children underwent visits for up-dosing, receiving two injections one hour apart with an&#xD;
      increasing dose every week. The highest concentration, given in the sixth week, had an&#xD;
      allergenic activity of 100,000 SQ/ml and contained 9.8 μg/ml Der p1. After week six, the&#xD;
      dosing interval was increased to one month and maintained until the end of the first year.&#xD;
      For patients randomized to non-SIT group, persistent rhinitis was managed with&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy including intranasal steroids and oral antihistamines. Intranasal steroids&#xD;
      were kept at the same dose during the study and antihistamines were used as required. Blood&#xD;
      samples were taken at the baseline and after one year treatment in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation Symptoms of AR children were assessed by the Total 5 Symptom Score&#xD;
      (T5SS), which includes rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal and ocular pruritus.&#xD;
      Each symptom was scored on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none, 3 = severe). Medication use was scored&#xD;
      and recorded daily, as described previously [16]. Arbitrary scores were attributed to the&#xD;
      drugs used (0.75 points for 1 puff of nasal corticosteroids and 1 points for 1 tablet of&#xD;
      antihistamine). Patients were instructed to use local steroids only (plus antihistamines if&#xD;
      they did not improve symptoms) and to report each administration or variation of the initial&#xD;
      drug therapy in the diary. Patients were also instructed to stop drugs at least 7 days before&#xD;
      blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry Peripheral blood was obtained by venous puncture and collected into&#xD;
      preservative-free heparin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by means&#xD;
      of Ficoll-Plaque Plus density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA). For&#xD;
      intracellular detection of cytokine, PBMCs (2 × 106 cells/mL) were stimulated with 10 μg/mL&#xD;
      Der p1 (D. pteronyssinus major allergen 1, Indoor Biotechnologies, United Kingdom) for 24&#xD;
      hours. Twenty-five ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 1 μg/mL ionomycin and 1.7&#xD;
      μg/mL monensine were added at 37 °C for the final four hours of stimulation (all from Sigma,&#xD;
      Missouri, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For flow cytometry, PBMCs were surface stained at room temperature for 20 minutes with&#xD;
      anti-CD4-PerCP and anti-CD25-PE, or isotype control (mouse IgG1-PerCP or IgG1-PE) (all from&#xD;
      Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). For intracellular staining of Foxp3, cells were fixed and&#xD;
      permeabilized with Foxp3 fixation/permeabilization buffer, then stained with anti-human&#xD;
      Foxp3-FITC or isotype control (IgG1-FITC) (all from BioLegend, CA, USA). For the&#xD;
      intracellular cytokine analysis, Der p1-stimulated PBMCs were surface stained with&#xD;
      anti-CD3-APC and anti-CD8-PerCP, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. After being&#xD;
      permeabilized using FACS Permeabilizing Solution (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA), cells were&#xD;
      incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with anti-IL-4-PE plus anti-IFN-γ-FITC, or&#xD;
      anti-IL-10-PE plus anti-IL-4-FITC, and each antibody was matched with a respective isotype&#xD;
      IgG1 as a control (all from BD Pharmingen). Different T subsets were selected for detailed&#xD;
      phenotypic analysis as follows: (1) Th1 cells: IFN-γ+IL-4-CD3+CD8- T cells; (2) Th2 cells:&#xD;
      IL-4+IFN-γ-CD3+CD8- T cells; and (3) Tr1 cells: IL-10+IL-4-CD3+CD8- T cells. For each&#xD;
      analysis, at least 20,000 events were collected. Analysis was conducted using a FACSCalibur&#xD;
      flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA PBMCs were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium and stimulated with 10&#xD;
      μg/mL Der p1 (D. pteronyssinus major allergen 1, Indoor Biotechnologies, United Kingdom).&#xD;
      Cultures were incubated for 6 days at 37 ºC in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.&#xD;
      Supernatants from allergen-stimulated PBMCs cultures were assayed for the presence of IFN-γ,&#xD;
      IL-4, and IL-10 by means of ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolation of CD4+CD25high Treg cells Heparinized blood was obtained from each of eight&#xD;
      recruited SIT-treated children and eight AR controls for cell isolation and functional&#xD;
      analysis. After non-CD4+ cells in the PBMCs were removed by LD column with a biotin-antibody&#xD;
      cocktail and antibiotin microbeads, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the PBMCs by negative&#xD;
      selection, and CD4+CD25+ T cells were positively selected from the CD4+ T cells. Finally,&#xD;
      CD25- fractions were recovered using a MS-magnetic column using a human CD4+CD25+ regulatory&#xD;
      T cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany).&#xD;
      Cells with the highest CD25 expression (CD25high) were selected through incubation with a&#xD;
      limiting quantity of anti-CD25 antibody beads (2 μl of anti-CD25 beads/107 cells)[17]. The&#xD;
      mean purity of the isolated CD4+ was 95% (93-97%) and 76% (72-88%) for CD4+CD25high T cells&#xD;
      being Foxp3-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suppressive capacity of CD4+CD25high Treg cells To evaluate the suppressive capacity of&#xD;
      CD4+CD25high Treg cells, cell proliferation and cytokine were analyzed. CD4+CD25- T cells&#xD;
      (responders) alone or mixed CD4+CD25- T cells and CD4+CD25high T cells (suppressors) at a&#xD;
      ratio of 2:1 were cultured in a final volume of 200 µl RPMI-1640 medium with 10 µg/ml Der p1.&#xD;
      Cultures were incubated for 6 days at 37 ºC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Autologous&#xD;
      irradiated PBMCs (3000 rad) were added at 2 × 105 as antigen-presenting cells to CD4+CD25- T&#xD;
      cell cultures. In all cases, triplicate medium wells were included as negative controls. At&#xD;
      day six, 100 µl of supernatant was removed for Th1 and Th2 cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-4) analysis&#xD;
      with an ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). Cell proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells&#xD;
      was then assessed using a WST-8 (modified tetrazolium salt) cell proliferation kit (Cell&#xD;
      Counting Kit-8, Dojin, Japan) according to the manufacturers' protocols. The proliferation&#xD;
      result was expressed as absorbance at 450nm of the culture medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Statistical significance between groups was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
      The significance of intra-group pre- and post-therapy changes were determined using a&#xD;
      nonparametric Wilcoxon matched pairs test. The correlation coefficient r was generated using&#xD;
      the Pearson correlation. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 statistical&#xD;
      software. A 5% significance level was used (α = 0.05), power (1- β) equal to 90%. All tests&#xD;
      were 2-tailed, and P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
