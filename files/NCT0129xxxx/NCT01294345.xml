      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Congenital malformations, sometimes called birth defects, occur because of a difference in&#xD;
      early human development. There are many different types of congenital malformations, and some&#xD;
      of these can be caused by changes in genetic material. Researchers are interested in studying&#xD;
      individuals with these congenital malformations to better understand the causes and the&#xD;
      effects of certain congenital malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand more about what causes congenital malformations that arise in early human&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn if genetic causes can be found to explain why a person has a congenital&#xD;
           malformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who have been diagnosed with a congenital malformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be seen at the National Institutes of Health for a series of visits&#xD;
           over 3 to 4 days. Participants will be asked to provide copies of past medical records&#xD;
           and test results for review, and will be asked questions about pregnancy/prenatal&#xD;
           history, birth, newborn, medical, developmental, and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents or siblings of participants may also be asked to provide information for&#xD;
           research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have additional medical evaluations as part of this study, including&#xD;
           any of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other consultations as clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue biopsy for genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of affected areas, such as front and side views of the face and other body&#xD;
           parts that may be involved in a congenital malformation, like the hands and feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests as indicated by a specific malformation, such as organ ultrasounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No additional invasive testing, testing requiring sedation, or testing involving&#xD;
           radiation is planned for this protocol. These tests, if performed, would involve a&#xD;
           separate consent....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in genomic techniques are making possible a new wave of genetic discovery. We&#xD;
      hope to couple genomic techniques with more traditional methods involved in genetic discovery&#xD;
      in order to investigate a broad range of conditions for which there is strong evidence that&#xD;
      genetic factors are involved. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately five&#xD;
      families, in whom members have congenital malformations consistent with an error of early&#xD;
      human development, in our research protocol each year. Patients will be referred from outside&#xD;
      clinicians or may self-refer, and may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center or may send samples&#xD;
      for testing. Some participants, for whom we already have DNA or tissue stored, may be&#xD;
      reconsented for specific participation in this protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For affected individuals (individuals who are related to a person who meets criteria&#xD;
             (1) below may also be included in the research protocol), determination of clinical&#xD;
             criteria for inclusion will be determined by prior medical record review before&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a congenital malformation or related medical finding thought to be related&#xD;
             to errors in early human development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors, or on behalf of an adult who is unable to provide consent&#xD;
             for themselves) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear evidence for the presence of a condition for which diagnostic testing is already&#xD;
             available.&#xD;
