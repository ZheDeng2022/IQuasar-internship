  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding cidofovir to the standard of&#xD;
      care can improve symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis caused by the BK virus as compared to&#xD;
      standard of care alone. The safety of cidofovir will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cidofovir is an anti-viral drug that is designed to treat or prevent infections caused by&#xD;
      certain kinds of viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups and you will have an equal chance of being in&#xD;
      either group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard of care drugs and cidofovir. The doctor&#xD;
           will tell you more about the standard of care drugs that you will take and the risks for&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group 2, you will only receive standard of care drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you will receive cidofovir by vein over about 1 hour 3 times per week.&#xD;
      You will also receive standard of care, which may include oral pain drugs taken every 4 to 6&#xD;
      hours as needed, oral drugs for urinary urgency taken 2 times daily, and fluids given by vein&#xD;
      to increase your urination rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2, you will only receive the standard of care, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks, you will complete the questionnaire about urinary problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 1, you may continue taking the study drug for up to 4 weeks. Group 2 will&#xD;
      take the standard of care for 4 weeks. If the doctor thinks it is needed Groups 1 and 2 can&#xD;
      continue to receive standard of care after this study is over. If your symptoms get worse&#xD;
      during the study and you are not receiving cidofovir, you may be eligible for further&#xD;
      treatments, which may include cidofovir, after the study ends. You will no longer be able to&#xD;
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit and the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you finish treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected to test the level of BK virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about urinary problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) weeks after treatment ends:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected to test the level of BK virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cidofovir is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of several viral infections. Its use in patients with the BK virus after a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
