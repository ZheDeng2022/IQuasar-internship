      The purpose of this study is to pilot test an innovative program development project in an&#xD;
      open trial format an 8-session, individual, cognitive-behavioral therapy based, intervention&#xD;
      on ten (10) HIV-infected men who have sex with men who report very high levels (&gt;10 episodes)&#xD;
      of sexual transmission risk behavior (unprotected anal intercourse with serodiscordant&#xD;
      partners).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an innovative program development project that will, over the next year, pilot test,&#xD;
      in an open trial format an 8-session, individual, cognitive-behavioral therapy based,&#xD;
      intervention on ten (10) HIV-infected men who have sex with men who report very high levels&#xD;
      (&gt;10 episodes) of sexual transmission risk behavior (unprotected anal intercourse with&#xD;
      serodiscordant partners). That is, to pilot test a novel prevention intervention designed to&#xD;
      effect reductions in sexual transmission risk behavior among the riskiest men in the largest&#xD;
      HIV risk group in the US. Effecting even modest reductions in the mean number of risk acts in&#xD;
      this group will likely have substantial public health significance through the number of&#xD;
      averted new HIV infections. Traditional secondary HIV intervention strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      Information, Motivation, Behavior change (IMB)) models only have modest effects for&#xD;
      HIV-positive MSM and there is evidence to suggest that these effects tend to diminish over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
