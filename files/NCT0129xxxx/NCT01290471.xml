    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label study to assess the safety and tolerability of U3 1565,&#xD;
      determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or establish maximum administered dose (MAD) safety&#xD;
      and tolerability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a dose-escalation phase corresponding to Part 1 and&#xD;
      a dose-expansion phase articulated in 2 concomitant parts (i.e., Parts 2a and 2b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parts of this study are single arm and open label. In all parts, tumor assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at screening and every 3 cycles thereafter, while the subject remains on study.&#xD;
      U3-1565 clinical activity will be assessed measuring tumor response by physical examination&#xD;
      and imaging according to RECIST version 1.1, if applicable.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Dose escalation of U3 1565 will follow a modified 3+3 study design with a starting intravenous (IV) dose of 2 mg/kg. A maximum of 2 new subjects will receive their first dose of U3-1565 per 24-hour period during the dose-escalation phase. Subsequent escalating doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg are planned. Three to 6 subjects will be enrolled in 4 sequential dose level cohorts.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Part 2a Dose Expansion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For Part 2a, 6 or 12 subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors will be enrolled and treated at the MTD or MAD to further define the safety and tolerability of U3-1565. These additional subjects are expected to permit the detection of relatively rare toxicities that would not likely be observed during the dose escalation part of the study, whose 3+3 design implies a maximum of 6 subjects only will be treated at the MTD or MAD. Six subjects will be treated; however, if toxicities meeting the definition of DLT are observed during the first cycle of treatment, 6 more subjects will be treated for a total of 12 subjects.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Part 2b Dose Expansion and Anti-tumor Impact</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For Part 2b, up to 30 subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors, with a preference for those with advanced ovarian cancer, will be enrolled and treated at the MTD or MAD. This number of subjects should allow demonstrating U3-1565 has anti-tumor impact by showing treatment-induced changes in pharmacodynamic biomarkers and clinical activity. Ovarian cancer may be more likely to be impacted by U3 1565 than other tumors, considering that in this cancer, high levels of HB-EGF have been associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome. Six subjects will be initially treated; at which point, a safety analysis will be conducted after these initial subjects have completed the first cycle of treatment, to allow the reevaluation of the appropriateness of the dosing level.</description>

    <description>U3 1565 will be provided as a sterile, frozen solution. Each glass vial will contain 1.1 mL (1 mL extractable) of study medication with a concentration of 100 mg/mL. U3 1565 will be diluted in a final volume of 100 mL and administered by continuous IV infusion over 60 minutes. Infusion times can be extended to a maximum of 120 minutes for subjects unable to tolerate the 60 minute infusion.</description>
