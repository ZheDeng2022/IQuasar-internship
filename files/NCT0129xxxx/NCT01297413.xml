  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a major global healthcare problem. Recent data compiled by the American Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA) for 2008 show that the annual incidence of new or recurrent stroke in the&#xD;
      United States is about 780,000, with approximately 600,000 of these strokes being first&#xD;
      attacks. Among adults age 20 and older, the estimated prevalence of stroke in 2005 was 5.8&#xD;
      million in the United States, resulting in &gt;150,000 deaths annually, with 4.8 million stroke&#xD;
      survivors alive today. Stroke ranks as the country's third leading cause of death, behind&#xD;
      only cancer and heart disease. The only approved treatments of acute ischemic stroke involve&#xD;
      restoring blood flow to the affected region by using thrombolytics or mechanical devices that&#xD;
      physically remove clots. However, the use of thrombolytics is limited due to the therapeutic&#xD;
      window of &lt; 3-6 hours post onset of stroke symptoms such that only a small fraction of stroke&#xD;
      patients receive this therapy. Following the completion of a stroke, there is little therapy&#xD;
      to offer patients to promote recovery other than physical, occupational, and speech therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different&#xD;
      indications demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment. In&#xD;
      addition to their ability to differentiate into multiple different cell types that would be&#xD;
      contributory to the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing destroyed cells,&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells also secrete angiogenins, cytokines and trophic factors that can&#xD;
      support and stimulate multiple other cell types. The cascade of cellular events following the&#xD;
      release of these cytokines and trophic factors would also potentially lead to beneficial&#xD;
      effects by restoring blood supply, by rescuing cells at risk, and by stimulating the&#xD;
      remaining cell populations to repair and propagate new cells and synaptic connections.&#xD;
