    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized two-part study of MK-4827 given with temozolomide in participants&#xD;
      with advanced cancer. In Part A of the study, the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-4827 when combined with temozolomide will be found by&#xD;
      increasing the MK-4827 dose level in successive cohorts. In Part B of the study, participants&#xD;
      with advanced glioblastoma multiforme and advanced melanoma will be enrolled to further&#xD;
      evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the MK-4827 + temozolomide combination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with histologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors who have failed to&#xD;
             respond to standard therapy, or progressed on standard therapy, or for whom standard&#xD;
