  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk has been shown to increase with increasing blood pressure values. As a&#xD;
      consequence, it results mandatory to achieve lower blood pressure goals in all hypertensive&#xD;
      patients, taking into account that all drugs always have some side effects that can be very&#xD;
      dangerous and/or uncomfortable for the patients leading to a reduced compliance. Thus,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment should be delayed until it results really necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of natural substances with a therapeutic action has modified this scenario&#xD;
      because of their reduced potential to cause undesirable effects (compared with drugs). In&#xD;
      order to choose among various nutraceuticals (natural foods compounds with health benefits,&#xD;
      including the prevention and/or treatment of diseases), preference should be given to those&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  produced according to the same Good Manufacturing Practice used for drugs, to be sure&#xD;
           that the finished product has a standard, reproducible composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for which efficacy and safety in the recommended indications are supported by clinical&#xD;
           trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of a product with these characteristics is Armolipid Plus, a combination of&#xD;
      nutraceuticals with a demonstrated anti-dyslipidaemic effect. Recently, a large clinical&#xD;
      intervention study showed evidence that treatment with Armolipid Plus leads to a significant&#xD;
      decrease in the overall cardiovascular risk, measured using the Framingham Risk Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress in Research and Development in this field has led to a new patented and registered&#xD;
      combination of nutraceuticals: Armolipid Prev, containing orthosiphon and CoQ10, with&#xD;
      antihypertensive activity, berberine, red yeast, policosanol and orthosiphon with&#xD;
      antidyslipidaemic effect and folic acid, reducing plasma homocysteine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the established anti-dyslipidaemic activity of Armolipid plus, Armolipid Prev&#xD;
      has a significant antihypertensive effect, which is beneficial in all those patients with&#xD;
      high blood pressure values without a defined indication to begin a pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      according to the current guidelines. The antihypertensive effect of Armolipid Prev,&#xD;
      documented by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, in addition to the lowering effect on&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia and even on abdominal girth, represents a new opportunity for complete and&#xD;
      early, effective and safe cardiovascular disease prevention.&#xD;

      Study on the role of a combination of nutraceuticals (Armolipid Prev) with an effect on blood&#xD;
      pressure and lipids in the control of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APv - cpr - 0210&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study rationale The strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases always&#xD;
           involve correction of wrong lifestyle habits, whereas use of pharmacological treatments&#xD;
           is recommended only in patients with a high cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This approach obviously leaves off a wide proportion of the population at low-moderate&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk that could benefit from early BP-lowering treatment before&#xD;
           development of organ damage or before it become irreversible, because in high-risk&#xD;
           hypertensive patients, even intense cardiovascular therapy, through beneficial, is&#xD;
           nonetheless unable to lower total cardiovascular risk below the high risk threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the setting of cardiovascular prevention, presence of metabolic syndrome results&#xD;
           particularly relevant, since it affects a large percentage of population and it has been&#xD;
           demonstrated to increase the risk of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However the mere lifestyle recommendations, despite useful, cannot always reach the&#xD;
           established blood pressure and metabolic goals and reduce global cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moreover, cardiovascular risk has been shown to increase with increasing blood pressure&#xD;
           values, so it results mandatory to achieve lower blood pressure goals, taking into&#xD;
           account that all drugs always have some side effects that can be very dangerous and/or&#xD;
           uncomfortable for the patients leading to a reduced compliance. Thus, pharmacological&#xD;
           treatment should be started only if really necessary. The availability of natural&#xD;
           substances with a therapeutic action has altered this scenario because of their reduced&#xD;
           potential to cause undesirable effects (compared with drugs). In order to choose among&#xD;
           various nutraceuticals (natural foods compounds with health benefits, including the&#xD;
           prevention and/or treatment of diseases), preference should be given to those&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  produced according to the same Good Manufacturing Practice used for drugs, to be&#xD;
                sure that the finished product has a standard, reproducible composition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  for which efficacy and safety in the recommended indications are supported by&#xD;
                clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An example of a product that meets these criteria is Armolipid Plus, a combination of&#xD;
           nutraceuticals which allowed control of dyslipidaemia. Recently, a large clinical&#xD;
           intervention study showed evidence that treatment with Armolipid Plus leads to a&#xD;
           significant decrease in the overall cardiovascular risk, measured by the Framingham Risk&#xD;
           Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Progress in Research and Development in this field has led to a new patented and&#xD;
           registered combination of nutraceuticals: Armolipid Prev, containing orthosiphon and&#xD;
           CoQ10, with antihypertensive activity, berberine, red yeast, policosanol and orthosiphon&#xD;
           with antidyslipidaemic effect and folic acid, reducing plasma homocysteine levels. In&#xD;
           addition to the established anti-dyslipidaemic activity of Armolipid plus, Armolipid&#xD;
           Prev has a significant antihypertensive effect, which is beneficial in all those&#xD;
           patients with high blood pressure values without a defined indication to begin a&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment according to the current guidelines. The antihypertensive&#xD;
           effect of Armolipid Prev, documented by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, in&#xD;
           addition to the lowering effect on dyslipidaemia and even on abdominal girth, represents&#xD;
           a new opportunity for complete and early, effective and safe cardiovascular disease&#xD;
           prevention. In fact, in association with a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle,&#xD;
           Armolipid Prev can encourage subjects to improve their lifestyle, thereby delaying the&#xD;
           need for lipid-lowering drugs. Armolipid Prev is classified by the Ministry of Health as&#xD;
           a food supplement in the Notification of 29th January 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIM OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a nutraceutical such as Armolipid Prev&#xD;
           compared with simple advice on diet and a healthy lifestyle in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  achieving a greater reduction in the overall cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reducing the incidence of metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reducing the prevalence of microalbuminuria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reducing the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy evaluated on the ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  increasing compliance to adopt a healthy lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN Multicentre, randomized, controlled parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY POPULATION At least 150 doctors will take part in the study; each will treat at&#xD;
           least 10 subjects of both genders with diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and who require&#xD;
           blood pressure control but without a defined indication to start a pharmacological&#xD;
           treatment or in whom stable drug therapy did not achieve the established result.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           GPs are required: 1) to record a full medical history, including smoking and drinking&#xD;
           habits, based on a pre-defined clinical record; 2) to collect demographic and&#xD;
           anthropometric measures (height, weight, waist circumference at the iliac crest); 3) to&#xD;
           perform a complete physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the first visit and after 1, 3 and 12 months all eligible patients will perform a&#xD;
           complete physical exam that includes measure of office blood pressure and heart rate in&#xD;
           the sitting position and in triplicate, using a manual sphygmomanometer, according to&#xD;
           international guidelines. Measurements will be rounded to the closest 2 mmHg interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline visit and the others screening visits also include examination of cell&#xD;
           blood counts (CBCs), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, uric acid, total cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, glucose, GOT, GPT, CPK, urine analysis and&#xD;
           microalbuminuria. LDL will be calculated starting from the total cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the first visit and at the end of follow up all patients will be evaluated for the&#xD;
           presence of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy by Electrocardiogram (ECG) and for&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk assessment using Framingham cardiovascular risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Metabolic syndrome will be defined as the presence of at least 3 of the following 5&#xD;
           factors: increased blood pressure (≥ 130/85 and ≤ 140/90 mmHg); serum triglycerides ≥&#xD;
           150 mg/dL; serum HDL cholesterol ≤ 40 mg/dL (males), ≤ 50 mg/dL (females); abdominal&#xD;
           girth ≥ 104 cm (males), ≥ 88 cm (females); elevated fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypertension will be defined according to 2003 ESH/ESC guidelines Diagnosis of Left&#xD;
           Ventricular Hypertrophy will be assessed using the current ECG criteria (the&#xD;
           Sokolow-Lyon index: S in V1 + R in V5 or V6 ≥ 35 mm and R in aVL ≥ 11 mm; the Cornell&#xD;
           voltage criteria (S in V3 + R in aVL &gt; 28 mm in men and S in V3 + R in aVL &gt; 20 mm in&#xD;
           women) at baseline and at the end of the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardiovascular risk will be calculated according to the Framingham risk score at&#xD;
           baseline and at the end of the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following will be excluded from the treatment: diabetics or hypertensive subjects&#xD;
           with an indication for treatment, patients under lipid-lowering treatment and according&#xD;
           to the Package Leaflet, all pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients requiring cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, according to the international&#xD;
           guidelines, will not be included in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary endpoint is the improvement in the estimate of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           calculated by the FRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduction of incident metabolic syndrome Reduction in the prevalence of subjects with&#xD;
           microalbuminuria Reduction in the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to results from a previous study performed on the efficacy of Armolipid Plus&#xD;
           (-12% reduction in the FRS at 8 weeks compared with -6.5% with diet alone), an&#xD;
           approximate estimate was made of the number of observations necessary so that the two&#xD;
           percentages are significant at the 5% probability level: 600 cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TREATMENTS all subjects will receive dietary counseling determined by the general&#xD;
           practitioner depending on the subject's clinical condition, in accordance with the&#xD;
           instructions of the Coordinating Site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Centralized randomization will be used to assign subjects to one of the two study&#xD;
           treatments, placebo + diet or Armolipid Prev + diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           How Armolipid Prev will be taken 1 tablet daily of Armolipid Prev or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of treatment Subjects in both groups will take the assigned treatment for 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. EVALUATION CRITERIA At the first visit and after 1, 3, 12 months blood pressure values&#xD;
           and lipid profile will be assessed as well as the others clinical parameters necessary&#xD;
           to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and to evaluate diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to standardize the measurements, each doctor will be given a sphygmomanometer&#xD;
           and a tape measure to estimate abdominal girth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. STUDY PROCEDURES Each doctor will initially be given a login and password allowing&#xD;
           confidential and individual access to the website www.armolipid.net for data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The doctor will complete the appropriate form (also available on the armolipid.net site)&#xD;
           and will assign the subject to one of two regimens: placebo + diet or Armolipid Prev +&#xD;
           diet, based on what has been determined by centralised randomization under the&#xD;
           responsibility of Prof. Bruno Trimarco.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This procedure is undertaken by a telephone call to the Randomization Centre, which will&#xD;
           automatically inform the doctor about the treatment to which the subject is to be&#xD;
           assigned in order to keep a balanced ratio between the two groups. In order to avoid&#xD;
           sampling errors, the doctor will include in the study the first 10 consecutive subjects&#xD;
           who meet the admission criteria (see point 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical analysis of baseline homogeneity will be undertaken&#xD;
           using the chi-square test and analysis of variance, if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The statistical analysis to assess the clinical efficacy will be based on a comparison&#xD;
           between differences at the various time points versus the baseline obtained in the two&#xD;
           treatment groups and will be conducted using the chi-square test and analysis of&#xD;
           variance, where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The level of significance will be considered to be an Alfa = 0.05 (type I error) and the&#xD;
           power level a beta = 0.90 (type II error).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. INSURANCE COVER This protocol is covered by an insurance policy taken out with AXA&#xD;
           Assicurazioni e Investimenti, policy no.100720 (Milan Branch). The insurance will cover&#xD;
           any injury to health sustained by patients and the economic damage arising from this,&#xD;
           occurring during the period over which the policy is valid, which will be renewed on a&#xD;
           year to year basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. STUDY TIMELINES The study will start from the time the login and password have been&#xD;
           delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. AVAILABILITY OF DATA All participants will be informed of the results once the data have&#xD;
           been processed.&#xD;
