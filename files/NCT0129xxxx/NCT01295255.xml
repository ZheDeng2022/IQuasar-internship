  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are considered as &quot;one airway, one disease&quot;. Although there&#xD;
      is increasing evidence for an association between allergy and depression, it remains unknown&#xD;
      if the relationship between AR and asthma has extra influence on the psychological status of&#xD;
      the patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence pattern of asthma on the&#xD;
      psychological status in AR patients. The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was employed to&#xD;
      analyze the psychological status of 524 individuals with AR. Independent sample T-tests,&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA and multivariate ANOVA were used for data analyses.&#xD;

        524 affected individuals (311 males and 213 females) with AR were prospectively recruited&#xD;
        from the rhinology clinic of the Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Department of&#xD;
        Beijing Tongren Hospital from February 2009 to November 2009.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suffered from rhinitis symptoms such as nasal itching, sneezing, nasal&#xD;
             obstruction and running nose, all patients had not undergone any medicine therapy in&#xD;
             the past one week; nasal endoscopy showed a pale and edematous nasal mucosa, nasal&#xD;
             discharge and swollen inferior turbinates. Every nasal symptom was scored on Visual&#xD;
             analog scale (VAS, 0-3 score) respectively. A score of 0 indicated no nasal symptom, 1&#xD;
             indicated slight nasal symptoms, 2 indicated obvious nasal symptom, but which could&#xD;
             still be endured, and 3 indicated obvious nasal symptoms that could not be endured;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age between 16 to 60 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive skin prick test (SPT)to at least one allergen, the level of response equal&#xD;
             to or exceeding ++. The following inhalant allergens were tested: Der p; Der f; Animal&#xD;
             hair; Trees; Grasses; Cereals; Mugwort; Dandelion; Giant ragweed; Chenopodium album;&#xD;
             Humulus; Locust; Blatella germanica; Pine; Plantain; Curvularia lunata; Candida&#xD;
             albicans; Penicillium notatum; Alternaria tenuis and Aspergillus fumigatu. The&#xD;
             reactions were evaluated based on the mean wheal diameter at 15 minutes after&#xD;
             application of the extracts. The mean diameters of each allergen wheals were&#xD;
             calculated from the sum of the largest measurement across the wheal and the largest&#xD;
             wheal measurement perpendicular to this divided by two. In addition, we calculated the&#xD;
             skin index (SI) as the ratio of allergen weal diameter divided by the histamine weal&#xD;
             size. The SPT result for each allergen was defined in terms of the SI value as&#xD;
             follows: +: SI≤0.5; ++: 0.5&lt;SI≤1.0; +++: 1.0&lt;SI≤2.0; ++++: SI&gt;2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AR combined with hypertension, diabetes or other chronic diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AR combined with tumor in the nasal cavity;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AR combined with eczema;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute infection in the past one week;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to complete the questionnaires;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AR patients undergoing negative life events.&#xD;
