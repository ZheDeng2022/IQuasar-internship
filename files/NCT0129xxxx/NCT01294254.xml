  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the wound reepithelialization of that part of the skin graft donor site, which&#xD;
      is treated with Oleogel-S10 compared to that part of the wound, which is covered by moist&#xD;
      wound healing dressing alone will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a first step, an adequate size of the wound healing dressing (Mepilex) is taken and cut in&#xD;
      half. Then, half of the SSG (split skin graft) wound is covered conventionally by applying&#xD;
      one half of the Mepilex cut. Afterwards Oleogel-S10 is applied to the other half of the&#xD;
      Mepilex cut, which is used to cover the other half of the SSG wound. Both parts of the&#xD;
      Mepilex dressings are then covered by an additional conventional dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oleogel-S10 is always applied to the same part of the SSG wound for each patient,&#xD;
      respectively, depending on the randomization of the patient, either towards the periphery of&#xD;
      the body, i.e. the lower part of the leg, or towards the centre part of the body, i.e. the&#xD;
      upper part of the leg. In order to avoid a confusion about which part has to be treated with&#xD;
      Oleogel-S10, the healthy skin next to the SSG wound will be marked with ink for indication of&#xD;
      the Oleogel-treated part of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day during the treatment period, whenever the wound dressing is changed, a clinical&#xD;
      examination and assessment of the progress of epithelialization of the SSG wound will be&#xD;
      conducted, including evaluation of tolerance, and photos of the wound without dressing will&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded assessment of the efficacy is conducted by two independent investigators using the&#xD;
      macro-photos of every day, when wound dressings were changed, and a final examination is&#xD;
      done. In this assessment, the third part of the SSG wound that is in between the left and&#xD;
      right parts is neglected.&#xD;
