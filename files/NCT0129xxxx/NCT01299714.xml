  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at The Ohio State University and the University of Michigan are working together&#xD;
      to understand cancer of the cervix. One of the areas they are studying is how stress you may&#xD;
      experience in your life effects the way you respond to GARDASIL®. GARDASIL® is a vaccine&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent some types of Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (HPV) infection which can cause cancer of the cervix. Participants are being&#xD;
      recruited from the Appalachian region of Ohio.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quadrivalent HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 vaccine (GARDASIL®) has been approved for use among women&#xD;
      age 9-26 years to prevent cervical/vaginal/vulvar cancer and genital warts. The efficacy of&#xD;
      the vaccine has been demonstrated in clinical trial settings, but the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      vaccine has not been tested in clinical practice settings. Patients experiencing greater&#xD;
      stress have a reduced capacity to mount an immune response to other types of vaccine. The&#xD;
      same phenomenon is likely to exist for Gardasil, but there are no data. The impact of&#xD;
      psychological stress on the immune response to a vaccine is proposed to act via health&#xD;
      behaviors (multiple lifetime sexual partners, never using condoms, prior abnormal Pap smear,&#xD;
      smoking, and HPV infection) or by direct dysregulation of the immune system. We have found&#xD;
      higher rates of cervical HPV in Appalachian Ohio women, higher rates of abnormal cervical&#xD;
      cytology, and very high rates of psychological stress compared to urban and suburban women.&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine if, in women age 18-26 years given GARDASIL® vaccine,&#xD;
      serum HPV 6/11/16/18 antibody response is altered by stress. This will be accomplished by a&#xD;
      study of 432 women age 18-26 years who report full range of life stressors recruited from&#xD;
      Appalachian Ohio. All participants will receive the GARDASIL® vaccine at baseline, two&#xD;
      months, and six months. Prior to vaccination questionnaire data related to HPV exposure risk&#xD;
      behaviors and psychological stressors will be collected. Cervical samples will be collected&#xD;
      for cytology and HPV testing. Serum samples will be collected for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18&#xD;
      antibody assays at baseline and month 12. The questionnaire data and serum samples will be&#xD;
      repeated at 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the difference in serum antibodies to&#xD;
      HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 at baseline and month 12. The variables of interest are perceived&#xD;
      stress, sexual behaviors, socioeconomic status, access to health care (health insurance&#xD;
      yes/no), smoking, Appalachian self-identity, HPV cervical status at baseline, and past&#xD;
      history abnormal cervical cytology, as proposed in a psychoneuroimmunology model. In this&#xD;
      model, Appalachian Self-Identity, socioeconomic status, loneliness, health care access, and&#xD;
      coping are proposed to contribute to a woman's perceived stress. The impact of perceived&#xD;
      stress on immune response to Gardasil vaccination can be by health behaviors such as multiple&#xD;
      lifetime sexual partners (&gt;4), never using condoms, prior abnormal Pap smear, smoking, and&#xD;
      HPV status at the time of vaccination. Perceived stress can have a direct physiologic impact&#xD;
      on the immune response by creating immune dysregulation as measured by increased EBV VCA-IgG&#xD;
      titers. Depressive symptoms can mediate the impact of perceived stress on immune function. If&#xD;
      psychological stress is found to modulate the immune response to GARDASIL®, then we can&#xD;
      determine if the modulation reduces the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine and examine&#xD;
      methods to limit the impact of stress.&#xD;
