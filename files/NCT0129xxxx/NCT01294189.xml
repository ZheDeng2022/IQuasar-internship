      Most patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) die after an end-of-life decision (EOLD) has&#xD;
      been made (Sprung et al. 2003). On September 1st 2009 the &quot;advance-directives-law&quot; was inured&#xD;
      in Germany considering a written advance directive of an adult binding for physicians and the&#xD;
      patient´s surrogate decision makers if it fits into the medical context (BGBL 2009). There is&#xD;
      a lack of data describing the process and the factors associated with end-of-life-decisions&#xD;
      in ICUs in Germany in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational study is to describe the decision making process as well as&#xD;
      the practices of end of life care in an ICU of a German university hospital during a period&#xD;
      when changes of German legislation occurred.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study performed according to an observational post-ad-hoc design is to identify and analyse the decision makers of end-of-life decisions on an intensive care unit in Germany.&#xD;
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their death on the ICU. Usually in clinical routine end-of-life decisions are documented for decision makers in the patients´ records. The incidences of the different decision makers including members of different clinical specialities and also members with different levels of ICU experience are compared.</description>

    <description>The second objective is to investigate what kind of influence the new German law for advance directives had on end-of-life decision making on the ICU.&#xD;
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their death on the ICU. Usually in clinical routine end-of-life decisions are documented for decision makers and procedures in the patients´ records. The incidences of therapeutic procedures in end of life care comparing patients with advance directives at different time points and those patients without advance directives are reviewed for differences.</description>

    <description>Another objective of this study performed according to an observational post-ad-hoc design is to identify and analyse the process of end-of-life decisions on an intensive care unit in Germany.&#xD;
Approximately 200 patients will be followed up until their death on the ICU. The process of withholding and withdrawing of therapeutic approaches is documented in the patient´s records. The incidences of different therapeutic procedures like ventilation, organ replacement technology, surgery, blood transfusions, antiinfective therapy and nutrition in patients with an EOLD are compared.</description>
