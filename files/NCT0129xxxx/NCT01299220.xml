  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at if a low-dose regimen of acitretin is helpful in treating a skin rash&#xD;
      caused by the chemotherapy drug, erlotinib.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial with an initial target sample of 32 evaluable subjects. The study will&#xD;
      last up to 12 weeks per subject and up to 9 months for the entire study. Cancer patients&#xD;
      beginning antineoplastic therapy with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      trial. Patients beginning erlotinib therapy will simultaneously initiate a skin care regimen&#xD;
      consisting of twice daily application of Eucerin,TM Aveeno,TM or CeraveTM moisturizing cream&#xD;
      and daily application of SPF 15 or greater sunscreen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who develop rash of CTCAE Grade 2 or higher will be referred to us by their&#xD;
      primary oncologist. Upon onset of the cutaneous eruption, the oncologist will initiate&#xD;
      therapy with doxycycline (100 mg twice daily; those allergic to doxycycline will instead&#xD;
      receive cephalexin, 250 mg twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On evaluation by the Principal Investigator, patients with insufficient response to a two&#xD;
      week course of doxycycline (continued CTCAE Grade 2 or higher rash) will begin therapy with&#xD;
      low-dose acitretin (10 mg/day). Patients will continue to receive 10 mg/day acitretin and&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 weeks, after which they will be treated off-study according to an&#xD;
      individualized regimen agreed upon by the patient and treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who continue to have unacceptable skin eruptions and who require off-study dose&#xD;
      reduction or interruption of erlotinib despite acitretin treatment, as well as those patients&#xD;
      who develop CTCAE Grade 3 or higher toxicity presumptively due to acitretin, will be&#xD;
      considered non-responders for this study. These patients will be treated off-study.&#xD;
