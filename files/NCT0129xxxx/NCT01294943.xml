    <textblock>
      The concern with oral infection and its systemic repercussions is old, many studies have been&#xD;
      undertaken to establish this relationship more precisely. One of the areas mouth still little&#xD;
      studied in this regard is the colonization of language within this universe of the oral&#xD;
      microbiota colonization and how this may affect the general state of health care-dependent&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of a tongue cleaning device and its potential&#xD;
      impacts on infectious patients fully or partially dependent care hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to intensive care units and inpatient units will be evaluated, divided into&#xD;
      two groups: Study Group (SG) - Patients who receive oral hygiene using the tongue cleaning&#xD;
      device, and Control Group (CG) - Patients who are cared for according to the routine of&#xD;
      hospital nursing.&#xD;

      Patients admitted to intensive care units and inpatient units will be evaluated, divided into&#xD;
      two groups: Study Group (SG) - Patients who receive oral hygiene using the tongue cleaning&#xD;
      device, and Control Group (CG) - Patients who are cared for According to the routine of&#xD;
      hospital nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for inclusion of elements of the research will follow the criteria of dependence&#xD;
      of patients on mechanical ventilation, if they are or not. Patients fully or partially&#xD;
      dependent care are patients who can not make your oral hygiene alone and dependent on another&#xD;
      individual to do so, if a hospital staff member health. Exclusion criteria will be based on&#xD;
      condition of dependency of the patient, intubation period under 48 hours and if one refuses&#xD;
      to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will first be evaluated by a dentist, doctor and nursing, which together decide on&#xD;
      the inclusion of patients in the study based on the criterion of seriousness of the patient&#xD;
      by APACHE. The assessment will follow the clinical criterion of presence or absence of tongue&#xD;
      biofilm (Adachi 2005), and the collection swab with biofilm lingual to perform culture and&#xD;
      sensitivity. These assessments take place twice within five days, being held in the first and&#xD;
      fifth days. During this period the patients participating in the GE will hygienic tongue&#xD;
      using tongue cleaner (Tepe 速) and other standardized oral hygiene care by the nursing team&#xD;
      previously coached by dentist. CG patients receive the standard oral hygiene care with a&#xD;
      spatula and gauze soaked in mouthwash and tongue will not use the tongue cleaner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of plaque and tongue of sample qualitative material for culture and&#xD;
      sensitivity attend three calibrated dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study 25 patients will be assessed for EG and 25 for GC, a total of 50 patients&#xD;
      evaluated, and 100 samples of material collected.&#xD;
