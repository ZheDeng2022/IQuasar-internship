      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate liothyronine (Cytomel) as an accelerating agent (i.e. faster rate to&#xD;
           clinical remission) to electroconvulsive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether thyroid supplement acceleration can reduce the neurocognitive side&#xD;
           effect of ECT treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether thyroid status at the time of remission is associated with&#xD;
           subsequent relapse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate genetic polymorphisms in enzymes responsible for thyroid metabolism and the&#xD;
           serotonin transporter promoter gene in depression (5-HTTLRP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of concurrent triiodothyronine&#xD;
      (Cytomel® 25-50 mcg/d) to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with a major depressive&#xD;
      episode referred to ECT. Goals of this application are to: 1) evaluate whether thyroid status&#xD;
      at time of sustained clinical response is associated with subsequent relapse rate, 2)&#xD;
      evaluate triiodothyronine (Cytomel®) as an accelerating agent (i.e. faster rate to sustained&#xD;
      clinical response) to electroconvulsive ECT treatment, and 3) evaluate whether thyroid&#xD;
      acceleration can reduce the neurocognitive side effects of ECT. 4) To evaluate genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms in enzymes responsible for thyroid metabolism and the serotonin transporter&#xD;
      promoter gene in depression (5-HTTLRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for this study, time to relapse, is defined as a Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Score (HAMD-24) ≥16 and an increase of ≥10 points from sustained response&#xD;
      baseline. Secondary outcomes measures are time to sustained response, defined as a ≥60%&#xD;
      reduction in the HAMD-24 score, and neurocognitive side effect burden as rated by the&#xD;
      modified Mini Mental Status Examination at time of sustained clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Within a 6-month study period, mean serum free T3 at time of sustained clinical response&#xD;
           will correlate with time to subsequent relapse [defined as a HAMD-24 score ≥16 with an&#xD;
           increase of ≥10 points from baseline (sustained response)].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In comparison to placebo, triiodothyronine (Cytomel®, 25-50 mcg) will accelerate time to&#xD;
           sustained clinical response [defined as a ≥60% reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale&#xD;
           for Depression, 24-item, (HAMD-24) score and a HAMD-24 total score ≤10 for 2 consecutive&#xD;
           visits] in depressed patients referred to ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In comparison to placebo, at time of sustained clinical response, there will be less&#xD;
           ECT-related neurocognitive side effects, as rated by the modified Mini-Mental Status&#xD;
           Examination (mMMSE), associated with triiodothyronine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. a. The 5-HTTLPR long allele (l) and (l)/(l) genotype will be associated with a faster&#xD;
           treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. The DI-C785T allele will be associated with lower T3 levels at baseline and faster&#xD;
           treatment response.&#xD;

      Thyroid measures at time of sustained response will include free T3, free T4, and TSH. All&#xD;
      draws will be done before ECT treatment. An additional free T3 will be obtained at the second&#xD;
      visit that confirms sustained response. The mean free T3 will be used as the outcome measure.&#xD;
      If a suppressed TSH is found, a TSH be repeated 1 week later. At the beginning of the study&#xD;
      30 mL of blood will be drawn and a portion of the collected blood sample will undergo DNA&#xD;
      extraction. The extracted DNA will undergo genetic analysis. The remainder owill be&#xD;
      immortalized and stored for future study. Blood will be drawn into 1 10-mL EDTA tube and 2&#xD;
      10-mL Heparin tubes . Samples will be stored at Mayo Clinic BAP Lab for subsequent DNA&#xD;
      extraction, analysis, and storage.&#xD;

        Consultants at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology will evaluate patients with a&#xD;
        diagnosis of depression (unipolar) for ECT. When a patient matches the study's diagnostic&#xD;
        criteria, and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria, he/she will be asked to&#xD;
        participate in the study.&#xD;
