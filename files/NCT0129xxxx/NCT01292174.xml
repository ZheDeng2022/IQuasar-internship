    <textblock>
      The is a blinded safety study of ibalizumab given by subcutaneous injection in sequentially&#xD;
      increasing dose-groups of at-risk, HIV-negative, healthy volunteers. The study involves the&#xD;
      administration of four total injections of ibalizumab or matching placebo in each volunteer,&#xD;
      given once every week, at one of three dose levels. Drug administration begins at the lowest&#xD;
      dose. After 4 of 8 volunteers in the first group have received all study drug injections and&#xD;
      have completed 6 additional weeks of follow-up, an independent safety monitoring group will&#xD;
      review available data before approving initiation of the next higher dose-group. This process&#xD;
      will be repeated prior to initiation of the 3rd and highest dose-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will participate in 2 separate intensive blood sampling periods of 7 days each&#xD;
      to test drug levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, sequential&#xD;
      dose-escalation and safety study of ibalizumab in at-risk HIV-negative volunteers. The study&#xD;
      involves the administration of four total injections of ibalizumab or matching placebo in&#xD;
      each volunteer, given once every week, in one of three groups as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 120 mg sc weekly x 4 weeks, randomized 6:2 with placebo Group 2: 240 mg sc weekly x&#xD;
      4 weeks, randomized 6:2 with placebo Group 3: 480 mg sc weekly x 4 weeks, randomized 6:2 with&#xD;
      placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days prior to enrollment and first drug administration,&#xD;
      and will be followed for 26 weeks after the final injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be expected to participate in two (2) intense PK sampling periods with a&#xD;
      duration of 7 days for the first period and 14 days for the second period. During these&#xD;
      periods (following Day 0 and following Week 3) subjects will have daily serum concentration&#xD;
      and other investigational pharmacokinetic assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will be encouraged to participate in an optional collection of genital&#xD;
      secretions (semen or vaginal wash) at Week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review study data after four out of&#xD;
      eight at-risk HIV-negative volunteers in Group 1 (120 mg dose) have received all study drug&#xD;
      injections and completed 6 weeks of follow-up before approving escalation to Group 2 (240 mg&#xD;
      dose). The DSMB will also review all available study data from Groups 1, and 2 after four out&#xD;
      of eight volunteers in Group 2 have received all study drug injections and completed 6 weeks&#xD;
      of follow-up before approving escalation to Group 3 (480 mg dose).&#xD;
