      Background : Previous studies suggest that early recognition and treatment of pain among&#xD;
      children is important for their cognitive development and their future response to pain&#xD;
      throughout their life. Oral sweet solutions have been accepted as effective pain reducing&#xD;
      agents for procedures in the neonatal population. To date, there have been a limited number&#xD;
      of published clinical trials in an emergency setting studying this type of intervention among&#xD;
      infants and these studies have shown conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective : To compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose solution versus placebo in reducing&#xD;
      pain in children 1 to 3 months of age during venipuncture in the Emergency Department (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will&#xD;
      be conducted in an urban tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital ED. The study&#xD;
      population is all infants from 1 to 3 months of age requiring venipuncture as part of their&#xD;
      planned ED management. Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive 2 ml of a 88%&#xD;
      sucrose solution or 2 ml of a placebo solution. The primary outcome measure is the difference&#xD;
      in pain levels during the venipuncture in the study population as assessed by the Face, Legs,&#xD;
      Activity, Cry and Consolability Pain Scale (FLACC). Secondary outcome measures will evaluate&#xD;
      differences of pain levels using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS). Crying time and&#xD;
      changes in heart rate during the procedure will be recorded. Side effects and adverse events&#xD;
      will also be noted. The investigators will also measure the number of successful&#xD;
      venipunctures at the first attempt. Based on previously reported data, using an alpha value&#xD;
      of 0,05, a power of 90% and using a 2-point difference in mean FLACC scores as clinically&#xD;
      significant difference, approximately 41 patients per group will be needed considering a&#xD;
      drop-off value of 25%. Patients' characteristics and outcomes will be compared using the&#xD;
      Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student's T test for continuous&#xD;
      variables. A intention to treat analysis will be performed.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pain is one of the most common adverse stimuli experienced by children, occurring as a&#xD;
      result of injury, illness, and necessary medical procedures[1]. The American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Pain Society (APS) have jointly issued a statement&#xD;
      promoting the responsibility of paediatricians as leaders and advocates to ensure the humane&#xD;
      and competent treatment of pain and suffering in all infants, children, and adolescents[1].&#xD;
      In Emergency Departments (ED), children undergo many painful procedures, such as bladder&#xD;
      catheterization, capillary blood tests, venipuncture and lumbar puncture. All these&#xD;
      procedures are associated with increased anxiety, avoidance, somatic symptoms, and increased&#xD;
      parental distress[1]. Numerous myths, insufficient knowledge among caregivers, and inadequate&#xD;
      application of knowledge contribute to a lack of effective pain management among infants[1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term effects of unmanaged pain in human infants have been shown to include permanent&#xD;
      impairment of elements of cognitive development, such as learning, memory, and behaviour[2],&#xD;
      and increased somatisation in childhood[3]. The plasticity of the developing brain and the&#xD;
      changes that occur in response to painful stimuli[4] also contribute to altered perceptions&#xD;
      of pain later in life[5-6]. Early painful experiences affect children's future responses to&#xD;
      analgesia. Weisman et al[7] found that inadequate analgesia in young children during&#xD;
      procedures diminished the effects of adequate analgesia during subsequent procedures. Many&#xD;
      studies have suggested that the prompt and accurate recognition and treatment of pain in&#xD;
      young infants is important for their immediate comfort and for their best possible lifelong&#xD;
      development[8]. Despite the recent interest in paediatric pain assessment, prevention and&#xD;
      treatment, many children do not receive adequate management to alleviate pain[1, 8-9]. The&#xD;
      ideal pre-procedural analgesic for minor invasive procedures would be a cost-effective,&#xD;
      inexpensive, short-acting agent with few associated risks[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of sucrose has been well studied for certain procedures in the patients of the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit and in the newborn nursery settings, particularly for venous&#xD;
      blood draws, capillary blood tests and circumcision[11-13]. In these studies[11-13], infants&#xD;
      receiving oral sucrose solutions before procedures cried less and had overall decreased&#xD;
      behavioural pain responses when compared with those receiving placebo. Furthermore, sucrose&#xD;
      has been shown to be a safe intervention with no serious life-threatening adverse events and&#xD;
      only few reported side effects consisting of minimal coughing with administration[14].&#xD;
      Sucrose is inexpensive, short acting, non-sedating, easily administered and non-invasive.&#xD;
      Administration of sucrose does not require additional training and does not expose the infant&#xD;
      to risks greater than those associated with breast or bottle feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summaries of randomized controlled trials among hospitalized neonates of 32 to 40 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation suggest that a single dose of 0,5 to 2 mL of 12% to 50% sucrose delivered by&#xD;
      non-nutritive sucking via a pacifier for 2 minutes before a painful event is safe[15] and&#xD;
      effective in decreasing physiologic (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation)[16-17]. It is also effective in minimizing behavioural pain indicators (crying,&#xD;
      facial expression and motor activity)[16, 18] and in reducing overall composite pain scale&#xD;
      scores[16]. A Cochrane systematic review concluded that sucrose is safe and effective in&#xD;
      reducing procedural pain from single short procedural events in neonates, but an optimal dose&#xD;
      could not be identified due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies[19]. A&#xD;
      review of published studies reported that sucrose or glucose in healthy term or preterm&#xD;
      infants during single episodes of heel lancing, venipuncture or intramuscular injection is&#xD;
      effective[20]. However, uncertainties remain beyond the neonatal period, given the limited&#xD;
      number of published studies [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of studies looking at infants undergoing immunizations suggest that this&#xD;
      analgesic effect may extend past the neonatal period and into infancy[21-26]. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the upper limit of this effect is unknown in terms of age and appropriate sucrose dosage. Two&#xD;
      studies have examined the effectiveness of sweet solutions as an analgesic in the paediatric&#xD;
      ED. A randomized controlled trial in an emergency setting of sucrose and/or pacifier for&#xD;
      infants receiving venipuncture conducted by Curtis and al[27] among infants of 0 to 6 months&#xD;
      demonstrated a trend in reducing pain among the sub-group of infants of 0 to 3 months.&#xD;
      However, this study showed no difference in pain scales after 3 months of age. Also, in a&#xD;
      study examining the effect of sucrose during bladder catheterization, the subgroup of infants&#xD;
      1 to 30 days old who received a sweet solution showed smaller changes in pain scores, were&#xD;
      less likely to cry during catheterization and returned to baseline more quickly, in&#xD;
      comparison with the placebo group[14]. However, among children of 31 to 90 days, there was no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference.[14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, studies have used varieties of concentrations of sucrose (e.g. Rogers had used sucrose&#xD;
      24%[14], Curtis had used sucrose 44%[27] and Lewindon had used sucrose 75%[24]). Systematic&#xD;
      reviews of the current literature have been unable to demonstrate superiority of one&#xD;
      concentration of a sweet solution over another[28], but many studies suggest that higher&#xD;
      concentrations of sweet solutions seem more effective[25, 29-32]. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators chose to study the effect of a sweet solution named syrup B.P. (product by&#xD;
      Laboratoire Atlas inc.) which contains 88% of sucrose. This solution is already commonly used&#xD;
      in the population of infants up to 3 months of age and it is safe (e.g. prednisone syrup or&#xD;
      codeine syrup are made using this syrup). A 2 ml dose of 88% sucrose contains the same amount&#xD;
      of carbohydrates as 25 ml of infant milk formulas which contain approximately 7,5g/100&#xD;
      ml[33]. Also, 88% sucrose has the same concentration of sugar as many other medications which&#xD;
      are commonly used in infants, such as oral antibiotics, oral steroid solutions and other pain&#xD;
      medications (e.g. codeine syrup). This syrup is of particular interest as it is of low cost&#xD;
      ($9,58 for a bottle of 2000 ml), universally available, stable and viable for approximately&#xD;
      three months. Therefore, the procedure studied here would be easy to apply in most clinical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the painful procedure chosen for our study is venipuncture (indwelling catheter with&#xD;
      or without drawing of blood samples). Venipunctures are frequently performed in the ED in&#xD;
      this age group. In fact, in our study center, the CHU Ste-Justine, approximately 15 patients&#xD;
      of 1 to 3 months require venipuncture as a part of their investigation each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no pain scales which have been validated precisely for the age group&#xD;
      studied in our project. However, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC)&#xD;
      scale is recommended by the IMMPACT group (Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain&#xD;
      Assessment in Clinical Trials)[34]. FLACC is an easily applicable pain scale in which the&#xD;
      observer scores a patient for 5 categories, from 0 to 2 points, for a total score of maximum&#xD;
      10 points (Table 1). The validity and reliability of this pain scale has been established in&#xD;
      the past for children from 2 months to 7 years[35]. Validity was evaluated by comparing the&#xD;
      FLACC scale with the Objective Pain Scale and demonstrated that both tools showed similar&#xD;
      behaviours (r=0.80; p&lt;0.001)[35]. The interrater reliability between 2 observers was&#xD;
      considered good (r[87]=0.94; p&lt;0.001) with a kappa value greater than 0,50 for each&#xD;
      category[35]. Therefore, this pain scale was chosen as the measure of our primary outcome, in&#xD;
      our population of infants from 1 to 3 months old. Furthermore, the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale&#xD;
      (NIPS)[36] (Table 2) is a well validated pain scale for newborns up to 1 month of age[37].&#xD;
      This pain scale was chosen as a secondary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that using&#xD;
      one pain scale validated in infants up to 1 month of age and another validated in infants&#xD;
      older than 2 months of age will allow us to assess pain in infants from 1 to 3 months of age&#xD;
      best, given current available tools. Furthermore, several other patient parameters will be&#xD;
      used to corroborate findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators believe that providing an oral sucrose solution during&#xD;
      venipuncture will decrease pain levels in infants 1 to 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Our primary objective is to compare the efficacy an oral 88% sucrose solution to a&#xD;
      placebo solution in reducing pain as assessed by the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and&#xD;
      Consolability scale in children of 1 to 3 months during venipuncture in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED). Our secondary objectives are to asses changes in pain levels as per the NIPS&#xD;
      scores. The investigators will also measure variations of heart rate and crying time. Any&#xD;
      side effects will also be reported. The investigators will also measure the number of&#xD;
      successful venipunctures at the first attempt.&#xD;
