      Children who are overweight or obese can develop many health complications including&#xD;
      diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and they break their bones more often than&#xD;
      children who are of healthy body weights. Recent short-term studies in children suggest that&#xD;
      increasing milk intake for 16 weeks begins to improve body composition and also reduces risk&#xD;
      of developing diabetes. However, no study has been long enough to truly test for the benefits&#xD;
      of high milk consumption on these conditions including bone. Both dietary and activity&#xD;
      approaches to reducing obesity in children are suggested by health professionals and when&#xD;
      combined are called lifestyle interventions. Therefore, McGill University has designed a&#xD;
      1-year intervention study focused on lifestyle improvements to reduce obesity in children 6&#xD;
      to 12 years of age. A control group will be monitored for the year, while two other groups&#xD;
      will receive lifestyle interventions with standard recommended (2 servings a day) and high (4&#xD;
      servings a day) intakes of milk. The intervention will include 6 planning sessions to&#xD;
      increase intakes of vegetables, fruits and milks along with more activity and less time&#xD;
      watching television or using computerized games. Children will have muscle and fat measured&#xD;
      using an x-ray device that also measures bone at the beginning, middle and end of the study.&#xD;
      They will also have a small blood sample taken every 3 months to measure blood sugar,&#xD;
      cholesterol and some nutrients. Changes over the study will demonstrate the benefits of&#xD;
      lifestyle and milk interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Childhood obesity is an increasingly major health care problem in Canada. Not only&#xD;
      are approximately 30% of Canadian children overweight/obese, but they are developing&#xD;
      significant sequelae including insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia,&#xD;
      hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Additionally obese children have lower bone mass, lower&#xD;
      25(OH)D concentrations and fracture more frequently. Canadian children on average do not meet&#xD;
      the recommended intakes for vegetables and fruit and only half of those &lt; 8 years old meet&#xD;
      the recommended intakes for milk. Obese children are more likely to be inactive and spend&#xD;
      more screen-time during their free time. There is promising childhood evidence that diets&#xD;
      with 3 to 4 servings of milk support healthier body composition (lean mass and height) and&#xD;
      improved insulin sensitivity in the short term and bone mass in the longer term. Family based&#xD;
      interventions are effective in weight reduction in children. To date, a combined assessment&#xD;
      of the benefits of improved intakes of milk plus active lifestyles in obese children on body&#xD;
      composition, bone and blood biochemistry in a family intervention is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if a 1-year lifestyle intervention with planning sessions designed to&#xD;
           improve diet and activity within the context of the family environment will reduce&#xD;
           adiposity and elevate lean mass while supporting bone mass in obese children compared to&#xD;
           a control group and if augmented intake of milk to 4 daily servings will result in&#xD;
           superior changes. The primary outcome will be change in body mass index (BMI) Z-score&#xD;
           along with waist circumference for assessment of adiposity; selected for ease of use in&#xD;
           larger studies or clinics where body composition assessment is not feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: the lifestyle intervention will yield modest changes to adiposity and lean&#xD;
           mass accompanied by no reductions in bone mass, but that the augmented milk intervention&#xD;
           will yield superior reductions in adiposity and elevations in lean and bone mass and&#xD;
           height growth. It is hypothesized that bone mass will be low and that maintenance of&#xD;
           bone mass in the standard intervention will thereby be judged as inadequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explain the hypothesized benefits of these interventions on lean, adipose and bone&#xD;
           masses by measuring indicators of glucose metabolism, satiety and related gut hormones&#xD;
           along with novel biomarkers of skeletal metabolism including osteocalcin, adiponectin&#xD;
           and vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: high milk intake will associate with lower glucose, insulin, ghrelin and&#xD;
           1,25(OH)2D accompanied by higher 25(OH)D, osteocalcin, peptide YY and glucagon-like&#xD;
           peptide 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test if the intervention with higher milk servings is linked to changes in child eating&#xD;
           behavior and satiety using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire to reflect eating in&#xD;
           the child's normal environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: children randomized to the high milk intervention group will demonstrate improved&#xD;
      scores on the satiety responsiveness component of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS - Randomized Controlled Trial Ethics: This study was approved by the McGill&#xD;
      University Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine in October 2010 and will&#xD;
      also be conducted in compliance with the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2005 and in compliance&#xD;
      with local regulation and laws governing research involving human subjects. Otherwise healthy&#xD;
      obese children (6 to 12 years of age) will be recruited following informed consent. Upon&#xD;
      completion, the control group will be offered the counseling (5 visits) intervention adjusted&#xD;
      for age (i.e. counseling + basic anthropometric measurements only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Recruitment: Obese children (n=150) from West-Island Montreal and surrounding&#xD;
      off island areas within 50 km of the Macdonald Campus of McGill University. Our approach to&#xD;
      recruitment is to use mailings through Canada Post. This service is excellent and the result&#xD;
      is that for a particular area (predominantly West Island Montreal and off island areas&#xD;
      towards Ottawa) each household receives a brochure on the study inviting them to attend if&#xD;
      they have a child who has a body mass index (BMI) in our range. A graph will be provided to&#xD;
      guide the parents and they will be invited to call us for more information. Obesity will be&#xD;
      defined on the basis of body mass index &gt; 95th percentile for age according to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization. In total 150 children 6 to 12 years of age will be recruited over a&#xD;
      6-month window. Those meeting entrance criteria will be randomized into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a control group with information only (counseling after 12 months for 6-8 year olds and&#xD;
           after 6 months for 9-12 year olds);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a lifestyle intervention (planning/counseling to improve diet and activity)(6-8 year&#xD;
           olds only);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the same lifestyle intervention augmented with a total of 4 servings of milk/milk&#xD;
           products daily (6-12 year olds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: Participants will be screened for entrance criteria at a visit 2 weeks prior&#xD;
      to beginning the 1-year program. Upon confirmation of meeting inclusion criteria, families&#xD;
      will be telephoned to confirm participation and then 6-8 year olds will be randomized into&#xD;
      the 3 groups stratified for sex and the 9-12 year olds will be randomized into the 2 groups&#xD;
      stratified by sex. They (parents &amp; child) will be asked to complete a 3-day diary of food the&#xD;
      week prior to the baseline visit and at the visit complete questionnaires (activity, eating&#xD;
      behavior, demographics etc.). These will be used as baseline measures for all groups and for&#xD;
      the lifestyle intervention groups to guide interventions regarding food choices and activity&#xD;
      preferences. At the baseline visit, blood sampling, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      and anthropometric measurements will be completed. All groups will receive simple education&#xD;
      at the baseline visit regarding Canada's Food Guide and Canada's Activity Guide and given a&#xD;
      3-day diary to document their food. A registered dietitian will go through the content with&#xD;
      them to explain how to use the guides and food-diary. Then each group will be seen at 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months of study to obtain new diaries, and perform anthropometric measurements and&#xD;
      blood biochemistry. Surveys (activity, satiety) will be taken at these visits. Body&#xD;
      composition and bone mass will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The intervention&#xD;
      groups will have lifestyle counseling visits at the end of months 1 through 5 to enable&#xD;
      individualized family-child counseling (intensive phase) followed by every 3 months&#xD;
      (establishing phase 9 months plus all receive debriefing at 12 months by a study&#xD;
      coordinator). Intervention families will receive a monthly telephone call for any outstanding&#xD;
      issue or to reinforce lifestyle change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of Family-Child counseling at end of months 1 through 5 plus 9 mo (1.5 h visits):&#xD;
      Intervention groups will have planning/counseling sessions for a total of 9 hours based on 5&#xD;
      x 1.5 h visits at the end of months 1 through 5. An additional visit at 9 mo (1.5 h) will be&#xD;
      used to determine if new diet and activity intervention strategies are necessary over time as&#xD;
      the child grows/matures and due to season. Counseling visits at end of months 2, 5 and 9&#xD;
      overlap with regular study visits and will be conducted after study data is collected to&#xD;
      limit leading and bias (same day if need be to limit travel). All intervention planning&#xD;
      visits will be with a registered dietitian. Both intervention groups will be instructed in&#xD;
      detail how to use Canada's Food Guide and Activity Guide (which includes reducing screen&#xD;
      time) and asked to set goals under the family-based behavioral intervention model of Epstein;&#xD;
      while considering the environmental and developmental frameworks to arrive at suitable&#xD;
      planning in the family/near environment plus suitable for the child's developmental age. The&#xD;
      model of Epstein is grounded in the social learning theory in view of the choices, planning&#xD;
      and reinforcement, but adapted for children/families resources and environment with&#xD;
      reinforcement of positive behaviors. Children and families need to change together as a whole&#xD;
      but also in support of the child being able to make decisions while away from home. This has&#xD;
      been applied in an intervention to improve asthma control in children at and away from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canada's food guide servings for Milk and Alternatives (these include for example 250 ml&#xD;
      fluid milk, 250 ml soy beverage, 175 g yogurt, 175 kefir, 50 g cheese) is 2 per day for&#xD;
      children 4 to 8 years of age and servings of vegetables and fruits is 5 per day. The&#xD;
      augmented intervention group will be instructed to consume 4 servings of milk or milk&#xD;
      products daily (these include for example 250 ml fluid milk, 175 g yogurt, 50 g cheese). The&#xD;
      4 servings of milk aligns with the recommended servings for 9 to 14 year old children; the&#xD;
      age at the end of the study or soon thereafter. This intervention approach is both ethical&#xD;
      and forward-looking. It would be unethical to counsel children and parents to not achieve the&#xD;
      recommended 2 servings of milk and alternative products for an 8 year old. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the study the investigators will survey families regarding sustainability of intakes at 4&#xD;
      servings a day - for children turning 9 years old this is the recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention groups will also have counseling on other food groups to result in a healthy&#xD;
      diet overall. Meal planning at each visit for both interventions will use Canada's Food Guide&#xD;
      and include age appropriate serving sizes, approaches to combining foods to enhance satiety,&#xD;
      how to incorporate snacks and fun foods, cooking methods, hidden energy, and how to&#xD;
      specifically increase vegetables, fruit and milk intakes for the family. The examples of&#xD;
      servings listed previously are only a few. Within each family food preferences and&#xD;
      availability will be used to counsel towards achieving 2 or 4 servings of milk and milk&#xD;
      products a day. Similar family-based dietary interventions have been successfully used in&#xD;
      overweight and obese children 6 years of age and higher. The intervention groups will also&#xD;
      actively plan to increase activity according to the Activity Guide which includes increasing&#xD;
      activity to 90 minutes daily and decrease in non-active time by 90 minutes over 5 months&#xD;
      (hence the visits at end of months 1 through 5). The new My Food Guide on-line at Health&#xD;
      Canada offers a convenient tool for planning of both diet and activity that can be used over&#xD;
      the course of the study in conjunction with the full Health Canada educational tool for&#xD;
      planning the 5-month increase in activity and reduction in screen time. Planning with parents&#xD;
      and children together within the context of their environment, developmental stage and food&#xD;
      and activity preferences is anticipated to improve the program's success. A focus on fun yet&#xD;
      feasible activities will assist both children and parents in adhering to the program. Expert&#xD;
      researchers and health care professionals have designed both of these Health Canada tools. In&#xD;
      fact these tools are used in the Montreal Children's Hospital obesity clinics. The activity&#xD;
      guide has been successfully used in a 4 week family program to enhance activity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be between 6 and 12 years of age at onset of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consume &lt; 2 servings of milk and milk products but be receptive to the recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have body mass index (BMI) over the 97 percentile for age and sex according to the&#xD;
             World Health Organization. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)assessment of&#xD;
             obesity used the definition by the International Obesity Task Force. This yields&#xD;
             similar results as when using BMI percentile cut-offs proposed by the World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) for all ages of children. The WHO now has reference data available&#xD;
             to 19 years of age. The BMI values at the 97th percentile are lower compared to the&#xD;
             2000 Centres for Disease Control charts&#xD;
             (http://www.who.int/growthref/who2007_bmi_for_age/en/index.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known or suspected serious, chronic illness of childhood, such as cancer, Crohn's&#xD;
             disease, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatic conditions, and diabetes, etc., or those with&#xD;
             disturbances in bone, vitamin D or mineral ion metabolism including rickets,&#xD;
             osteomalacia, liver disease, renal disease, immobilization (complete or partial),&#xD;
             current fractures, and disorders of the parathyroid gland.&#xD;
