      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pre-existing impaired renal function are prone to develop acute contrast media&#xD;
      induced nephropathy (CIN). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL), a new biomarker&#xD;
      predictive for acute renal injury has been shown to be capable for earlier diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous volume load is a widely accepted prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized and controlled study, only patients with the need for an intra-arterial&#xD;
      contrast media (CM) application will be included and receive a standardized, weight-based,&#xD;
      intravenous hydration before investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the aim of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the magnitude of a risk for contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN)&#xD;
           following intra-arterial angiography in a well defined group of high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to use urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) as an early predictor&#xD;
           of contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) after contrast media (CM) application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the clinical benefit of an early post-procedural i.v. hydration as compared&#xD;
           to only pre-procedural volume expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with markedly increased urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL)&#xD;
      after investigation will be randomized into one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of Group A will undergo standard treatment consisting of unrestricted oral fluid&#xD;
      intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of Group B will additionally receive 3-4 ml/kg BW/h 0.9 % saline intravenously for 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) defined by an increase greater&#xD;
      than 25% of baseline serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: NGAL, Cystatin C, and creatinine values, need for renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy, death.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decades the growing demand for appropriate diagnosing and intervention in all&#xD;
      fields of modern medicine has increased the necessity for use of iodinated contrast media&#xD;
      (CM). Patients with pre-existing impaired renal function are prone to develop acute contrast&#xD;
      media induced nephropathy (CIN) and consecutively have a greater risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, a reliable laboratory value or test that recognizes acute renal damage before serum&#xD;
      creatinine increases is still sought for. It would be a most helpful tool to initiate proper&#xD;
      treatment on time. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL), a new biomarker&#xD;
      predictive for acute renal injury has been shown to be capable for earlier diagnosis of&#xD;
      contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, an intravenous volume load is the only fairly proven and widely accepted prophylaxis.&#xD;
      However, the optimal intravenous fluid regimen regarding the type, amount, route and duration&#xD;
      of volume application has remained controversial. Habits of giving pre- and post-procedural&#xD;
      volume have been widely differing throughout all randomized trials and, thus, are not&#xD;
      comparable in the available studies. Unfortunately, most studies were also lacking&#xD;
      statistical power, used different types of contrast media (CM) and definitions of contrast&#xD;
      media induced nephropathy (CIN) or allowed for additional prophylactic measures, such as&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine or sodium bicarbonate in a varying percentage of their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our randomized and controlled study, only patients with the need for an intra-arterial&#xD;
      contrast media (CM) application will be included. Patients scheduled for a diagnostic&#xD;
      angiography and/or endovascular intervention will receive a standardized, weight-based,&#xD;
      intravenous hydration before investigation. Only one type of contrast media (CM) and neither&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate, nor N-acetylcysteine is used throughout the study. The study will be&#xD;
      performed according to the Consort-Statement 2010 for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the aim of our study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the magnitude of a risk for contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN)&#xD;
           following intra-arterial angiography in a well defined group of high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to use urinary Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) as an early predictor&#xD;
           of contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) after contrast media (CM) application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the clinical benefit of an early post-procedural i.v. hydration as compared&#xD;
           to only pre-procedural volume expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with markedly increased Neutrophil gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) values&#xD;
      (criteria for randomization into one of two treatment groups see below) at 4 to 6 hours after&#xD;
      investigation will be randomized into one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of Group A will additionally receive 3-4 ml/kg BW/h 0.9 % saline intravenously for 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of Group B will undergo standard treatment consisting of unrestricted oral fluid&#xD;
      intake, at least 500 ml tea or water provided by the ward, but no intravenous fluid&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Randomization (after 2nd NGAL testing):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with NGAL levels &gt; 150 ng/ml, if baseline was below 75 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with doubling of NGAL values, if baseline was between 75 and 150 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: contrast media induced nephropathy (CIN) defined by an increase greater&#xD;
      than 25% of baseline serum creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint: NGAL, Cystatin C, and creatinine values, need for renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy, death.&#xD;
