      Prospective non-randomized phase II study assessing the activity of the&#xD;
      Capecitabine-Sorafenib combination by estimating overall survival of the study population at&#xD;
      a fixed time point (6 months) and, as an exploratory analysis the overall survival of&#xD;
      metabolic responders versus non-responders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment doses :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib 200mg in the morning,400mg in the evening; escalation to 400mg twice daily after 1&#xD;
      cycle Capecitabine 850mg/m2 twice daily Oral Days 1-14, weeks 1-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoro-Deoxy Glucose Positron Emitting Tomography (FDG-PET)imaging at baseline and after&#xD;
      17-21 days while on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification/statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been estimated in order to be able to test the null hypothesis that the&#xD;
      overall survival rate at 6 months is less than 30%. This hypothesis will be tested using a&#xD;
      binomial distribution. The study should be able to reject the null hypothesis, using a&#xD;
      1-sided test with α = 0.025, with a power of 90% in case of a true overall survival ≥ 50%&#xD;
      (rate at 6 months). The sample size required is 66 eligible patients (to be followed for 6&#xD;
      months minimum). Analysis will be done on all registered patients using an ITT approach on&#xD;
      all eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A co-primary endpoint is to compare the overall survival of patients assessed as early PET&#xD;
      responders and of patients assessed as early PET non responders (the clinicians will remain&#xD;
      blinded for PET response assessment). For this primary analysis, patients who will undergo&#xD;
      the second PET assessment will be eligible and time zero for measuring survival will be the&#xD;
      date of this second PET examination. It is anticipated that 95% of the patients will be&#xD;
      eligible for the analysis with a 50% expected rate of early PET non-responders (result&#xD;
      obtained from an unpublished study conducted at Jules-Bordet Institute). With 66 patients&#xD;
      registered, we anticipate then that 63 patients will be available for the co-primary&#xD;
      endpoint. With 63 patients and our assumption that the HR for the comparison between the&#xD;
      survival distributions will be around 0.385 (based on the previously mentioned unpublished&#xD;
      study), we will need using a two-sided logrank test at the 2.5% level (2.5% chosen because of&#xD;
      the existence of 2 co-primary endpoints), 54 events (power of 90%). With 63 patients and a&#xD;
      follow-up after accrual of 1 year, we should reach this number of 54 events. However, to&#xD;
      account for another possible 5% drop-out (patient's refusal for undergoing the second PET&#xD;
      examination for instance), sample size should be increased to 70 eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, our estimation of 50% expected rate of early PET responders is coming from a&#xD;
      prospective unicentric cohort of 38 patients undergoing chemotherapy for 1st line or 2nd line&#xD;
      treatment of advanced colorectal cancer with a few of them having received biological agents&#xD;
      together with chemotherapy. Our estimation may then not be reliable due to small sample size&#xD;
      and different patients population. If this rate of early PET responders proves to be higher,&#xD;
      we should be prepared to increase our sample size for targeting the same power of 90%. For&#xD;
      instance, if the rate is 67% instead of 50%, the required number of events would be 62&#xD;
      in-stead of 54. If the rate is 75%, the number of events should be increased to 73. The&#xD;
      number of patients would have then to be adapted according to the rate of evaluable patients&#xD;
      for this PET objective and the rate of patients lost to follow-up. For reassessing the&#xD;
      required numbers of events, we did not change our hypothesis of detecting, if true, a hazard&#xD;
      ratio of 0.385 in favor of early PET responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan, during the course of accrual, to assess the rate of patients evaluable for the PET&#xD;
      objective, of early PET responders and, if possible the rate of patients lost to follow-up in&#xD;
      order to check whether we need to review our planned sample size. However, no interim&#xD;
      analysis will be done on the primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are to estimate progression-free survival and objective response rate,&#xD;
      and to describe the adverse reactions associated with the study regimen in the study&#xD;
      population. Also, to determine the correlation of early metabolic response, as assessed by&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT immediately before the first and the second cycles of treatment with the study&#xD;
      regimen, with overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate, and to&#xD;
      determine the correlation of growth modulation index (GMI), defined as the time to&#xD;
      progression under the study regimen over the time to progression under the latest regimen&#xD;
      administered to the patient, with overall survival and progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a single-arm phase II study, with all patients accrued in one stage.&#xD;
      No early stopping rules will be used.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible&#xD;
        for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other experimental agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to sorafenib or capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding diathesis, history of cardiovascular ischemic disease or cerebrovascular&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sorafenib and capecitabine are&#xD;
             antitumor agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with sorafenib or capecitabine, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with sorafenib or capecitabine. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FDG PET/CT negative lesions or non metabolically assessable lesions (to small &lt;2cm) at&#xD;
             the base line FDG PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
