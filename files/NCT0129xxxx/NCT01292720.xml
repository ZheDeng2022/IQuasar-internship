  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies, vitamin D deficiency is associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality, cardiovascular events including sudden cardiac death and stroke,&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension and impaired function of the immune and musculoskeletal system. The&#xD;
      action of vitamin D on the cardiovascular system regulates cardiac function, endothelial and&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle, and, the renin-angiotensin system. Treatment with sufficiently high&#xD;
      doses of vitamin D may represent a promising and inexpensive intervention option. To date,&#xD;
      there are few data on the effect of cholecalciferol treatment in patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether oral vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation improves chronic heart failure (measured with the surrogate parameter of&#xD;
      NT-proBNP levels at month 0 and 6).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of data suggests that low vitamin D levels may adversely affect cardiovascular&#xD;
      health. For many cardiovascular events, seasonal variability with peak incidence in the&#xD;
      winter months is proven. This may be attributable at least in part to declining body stores&#xD;
      of vitamin D beginning with September. Recently, there have been several case reports about&#xD;
      severe cardiomyopathy caused by vitamin D deficiency, especially in dark-skinned children who&#xD;
      had low vitamin D levels. The heart is an important target organ for vitamin D, both on a&#xD;
      genomic and nongenomic level. Myocytes express the vitamin D receptor and several models of&#xD;
      hypertension in animal studies have shown that vitamin D treatment is able to prevent cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy [9-10]. Vitamin D seems to inhibit activation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system as well as the expression of genes involved in the development of myocardial&#xD;
      hypertrophy. There is accumulating evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be an important&#xD;
      factor in the development of congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In chronic hemodialysis patients, vitamin D supplementation has been associated with&#xD;
      reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and a reduction of QT dispersion, the latter being&#xD;
      considered a major risk factor for sudden cardiac death. A small study from 1984 showed an&#xD;
      improvement in left ventricular function after treatment with cholecalciferol in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients. A recent study from our group has reported a negative correlation of 25(OH)D levels&#xD;
      with NT-pro-BNP levels, New York Heart Association functional classes and impaired left&#xD;
      ventricular function. Furthermore, hazard ratios for death attributable to heart failure and&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death were 2.84 and 5.05, respectively, when patients with 25(OH)D &lt;25ng/ml&#xD;
      were compared with those having serum levels of 25(OH)D &gt;75 ng/ml [11]. The anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties of vitamin D also appear to play a role in congestive heart failure, as studied in&#xD;
      a recent interventional trial. In animal models, vitamin D deficiency was proven to be&#xD;
      associated with developing myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis with aberrant cardiac&#xD;
      contractility and relaxation. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency can raise parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      secretion, which in turn may increase insulin resistance and be associated with the&#xD;
      development of diabetes, hypertension and inflammation. In summary, vitamin D seems to exert&#xD;
      a multitude of different effects all working in concert to protect the vascular and cardiac&#xD;
      system by influencing various hierarchical levels of biologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a randomized controlled trial in a subgroup of patients with heart failure(n=105, ≥&#xD;
      70 years) was able to demonstrate a significant decrease in BNP levels at 10 and 20 weeks,&#xD;
      while the primary endpoint &quot;functional capacity&quot; and quality of life did not differ between&#xD;
      intervention and placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because in this latter trial, even the intervention group did not reach normal vitamin D&#xD;
      levels, we will use a higher dose of vitamin D given in shorter intervals.&#xD;
