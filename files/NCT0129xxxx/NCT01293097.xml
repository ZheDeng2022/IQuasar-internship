    <textblock>
      This randomized, open label, controlled, parallel group study is designed to test whether&#xD;
      2-day high dose atorvastatin administration before PCI and 30-day continuous intensive&#xD;
      atorvastatin treatment is superior to usual care, in terms of peri-PCI cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      as well as 6-month prognosis. The goal is to set up an optimized protocol for peri-PCI statin&#xD;
      treatment in Chinese CHD patients. Safety will also be observed.&#xD;

      The study objective is to test whether 2-day high dose atorvastatin administration before PCI&#xD;
      and 30-day continuous intensive atorvastatin treatment is superior to usual care, in terms of&#xD;
      peri-PCI cardiovascular events, as well as 6-month prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2160 patients with non-ST segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS)or stable angina&#xD;
      pectoris (SAP) scheduled for selective PCI are randomized into two groups. The study group is&#xD;
      given atorvastatin 80 mg/d×2d before PCI while the control group receives usual care. After&#xD;
      angiography, patients who are not undergoing PCI procedure will be excluded from the study as&#xD;
      selection failure. After PCI procedure, the study group is given atorvastatin 40mg/d until 30&#xD;
      days after PCI while the control group receive usual care. The last visit will be at 6 months&#xD;
      after PCI. Patients data such as troponin, CK-MB, Scr, CCR, ALT, AST before and after&#xD;
      procedure will be recorded. 1100 effective patients will be finally enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at about 54 centers in China. Data will be collected on 2,100&#xD;
      NSTE or SAP patients undergoing PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: MACE within 30 days after PCI. Secondary outcome: Post-procedural change of&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers (hs-CRP); Morbidity of CIN; Proportion of patients who experience at&#xD;
      least once AST &gt; 3ULN，ALT &gt; 3ULN or CK &gt; 5ULN after initiation of study treatment. Proportion&#xD;
      of patients who experience at least once AST, ALT, or CK&gt;ULN after initiation of study&#xD;
      treatment; Proportion of patients who take reduced dose of atorvastatin, withdraw study&#xD;
      treatment, or withdraw study due to adverse events; Combined endpoint of death, cardiac&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac hospitalization, revascularization, and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events within 6 months after PCI.&#xD;
