    <textblock>
      There has been reports that low dose prednisolone stabilizes CD4-counts in HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals. However, until now, there are no prospective randomized studies on the use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids in latent HIV disease. Furthermore, low dose prednisolone (5 mg/d) is not&#xD;
      sufficient tested for the risks and benefit for HIV patients especially for those living in&#xD;
      poor settings with a higher risk of infections. This study will assess the benefit and the&#xD;
      safety profile for low dose prednisolone therapy for patients in a region with limited&#xD;
      resources and high prevalence of infections.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           For treatment in advanced HIV infection, combination therapy with antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
           (ARVs) is the best option under current international standards. The benefit of ARVs is&#xD;
           best, if they are used relatively late in the course of the disease, commonly after a&#xD;
           progression of years. However, under a global perspective, more than 90% of those who&#xD;
           need ARVs world-wide have no access to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ARVs are not used in early stages of infection without significant immunodeficiency.&#xD;
           Although a variable degree of immunodeficiency may be present even in early HIV disease,&#xD;
           there is no established treatment for this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Immunodeficiency is associated with a decline of a certain population of lymphocytes,&#xD;
           the CD4 cells or T-helper cells. It seems to be a useful concept to postulate that a&#xD;
           treatment which slows down this loss of CD4 cells could also slow down the progression&#xD;
           of HIV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In vitro findings and clinical studies showed a CD4 cell stabilizing effect of&#xD;
           corticosteroids. First clinical studies were based on relatively high dosages (Andrieu&#xD;
           JM 1995, LU W 1995, Andrieu JM 2004,). These are hardly justifiable for a longer time,&#xD;
           because of numerous side effects, e.g. immunosuppression of the cellular immune system,&#xD;
           the manifestation of diabetes or the Cushing syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 2005 Ulmer et al. reported in a mono-centric open label study a CD4- stabilizing&#xD;
           effect under the administration of low dose prednisolone (5 mg/d) (Ulmer A 2005).&#xD;
           Patients with more than 300 CD4 cells/µl were included. After two years the 28 patients&#xD;
           on treatment presented 176.1 more CD4 cells than those of 62 control patients in&#xD;
           comparison to their baseline counts (p 0.0009) and after three years the 15 patients on&#xD;
           treatment presented 236.2 more CD4 cells/µl than those of 33 control patients in&#xD;
           comparison to their baseline counts (p = 0,0021). The initiation of treatment with the&#xD;
           more expensive and toxic ARVs was delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on this study and an increasing amount of experience by Ulmer and others, it seems&#xD;
           to be justified to systematically investigate the effect of low dose prednisolone on the&#xD;
           progression of HIV disease. The costs of 5 mg prednisolone per day is in a range of 3 US&#xD;
           $ per year (Action Medeor). If it turned out that low dose prednisolone prolongs the&#xD;
           period until ARVs become indicated without imposing intolerable risks on the patient,&#xD;
           this approach could be a very attractive future option for countries with health systems&#xD;
           in resource-poor settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 RATIONAL FOR THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Until now, there are no prospective randomized studies on the use of corticosteroids in&#xD;
           latent HIV disease. Furthermore, low dose prednisolone (5 mg/d) is not sufficient tested&#xD;
           for the risks and benefit for HIV patients especially for those living in poor settings&#xD;
           with a higher risk of infections. This study will assess the benefit and the safety&#xD;
           profile for low dose prednisolone therapy for patients in a region with limited&#xD;
           resources and high prevalence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 SITE DESCRIPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted at the Bugando Medical Centre in Mwanza, Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 PRIMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of the low dose prednisolone&#xD;
           therapy on the time to progression of HIV disease. The time to progression is defined as&#xD;
           the time between the baseline and the change of staging to advanced disease (CDC stage&#xD;
           A3, B3 or C) or death (see Appendix Va).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 SECONDARY&#xD;

        4. PLAN OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a double blinded, randomized, phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral&#xD;
           low dose prednisolone therapy for HIV infected patients with CDC Stage A1,2 or B1,2 (see&#xD;
           Appendix Va).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trial is a mono-centred and involves 400 eligible patients in Tanzania, divided in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  200 Patients in Study medication group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  200 Patients in Placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study enrollment period will last for 12 month (30 patients per month). A study&#xD;
           period of 24 month will follow. After 12 months, the first intermediate analysis will be&#xD;
           done. In case of no significant negative safety aspects, the study will continue for the&#xD;
           next 12 month. A follow-up period for further evaluation can be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 STUDY TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients in the Treatment Group will get prednisolone 5 mg per os daily. The placebo&#xD;
           group will get one tablet of placebo per os daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 DOSE MODIFICATION AND DELAY&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no dose modification planned in this study. Study drug related reactions like&#xD;
           hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, hypertension, gastric ulcer, and diabetes&#xD;
           will be treated according to local standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 DISCONTINUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be removed from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  disease progression: upgrading of clinical stage and/or CD4 cell count &lt; 200/µl,&#xD;
                both requiring the start of HAART ( = primary study objective, study completed);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  development of unacceptable toxicity not manageable by symptomatic care;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  administration of antiretroviral treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  significant protocol violation in the prednisolone group, e.g. interruption of&#xD;
                taking the study medication for more than four weeks (compliance);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  consent withdrawn;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  investigator's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are always allowed to refuse the participation of study and will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The reason for removal for all patients will be documented on the case report form.&#xD;
           Patients who are not eligible or not valuables for the study analysis will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 PRE-STUDY SCREEN&#xD;

        5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.1 TIME TO PROGRESSION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time to progression is defined as time period between the baseline and the change of&#xD;
           staging( see appendix Va).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Progression is:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/µl; (Stage A3, B3 )&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CDC clinical stage C; all counts;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.2 AMOUNT OF CD4 CELLS&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number of the CD4 cells at baseline (= 100%) will be compared to the number during&#xD;
           the study (&gt; 100%: increase; &lt; 100%: decrease).&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.3 QUALITY OF LIFE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Some Quality of life questions will be completed for each patient during the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1.4 OVERALL SURVIVAL&#xD;
&#xD;
           The duration of survival will be determined by measuring the time interval between the&#xD;
           initial dose of study medication and the date of death. The overall survival will be&#xD;
           evaluated in the prolonged follow up period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENT METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.1 SUSPECTED ADVERSE RESPONSE (SUSAR), ADVERSE EVENT AND TOXICITY&#xD;
&#xD;
           Toxicity is defined as a study drug related Suspected Adverse Response (SUSAR) and&#xD;
           Adverse events (AE) Grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life threatening). It will be evaluated based&#xD;
           on a graded scale of 0-4 using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (see Appendix III).&#xD;
           Toxicities that can not be graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria will be graded&#xD;
           as mild (asymptomatic), moderate (symptomatic but not interfering significantly with&#xD;
           function), severe (causing significant interference with function) or life-threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The SUSAR´s are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Abdominal pain Hypertension Diabetes Hyperglycaemia Fluid retention Pneumonia Gastritis&#xD;
           Weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
           The AEs are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Abdominal Pain Nausea Candidiasis Peptic ulcer Diarrhoea Pneumonia Fever Skin Herpes&#xD;
           simplex,zoster Vomiting Hepatitis (liver function) Urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
           AEs and SUSARs will be monitored during every visit using a hard coded page in the case&#xD;
           report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional AEs occurring can be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2.2 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemical and haematological tests will be conducted on blood samples once a month at&#xD;
           every visit. If AEs occur additional tests have to be done according to local standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For later additional laboratory analysis a small amount of plasma samples and T-Cells&#xD;
           will be stored at the National Institute for Medical Research. These samples will be&#xD;
           analyzed in Germany (Medical Mission Institute, University of Wuerzburg) for identifying&#xD;
           the status of activation of the immune system, co-infections and virus characterization.&#xD;
