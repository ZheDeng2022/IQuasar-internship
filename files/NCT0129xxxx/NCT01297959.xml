  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical&#xD;
      application of E-101 Solution directly into the surgical incisional wound in the prevention&#xD;
      of infection of superficial and deep surgical incisional wounds. E-101 Solution is an&#xD;
      enzyme-based antiseptic that is being developed for direct application to a surgical&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this standard-of-care, pivotal Phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of topical E-101 Solution after direct application into the principal surgical&#xD;
      incision in the prevention of superficial and deep incisional surgical site infections (SSI)&#xD;
      within 30 days after elective colorectal surgery. The study is intended to support a target&#xD;
      indication statement of: &quot;E-101 Solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of incisional&#xD;
      surgical site infections following elective colorectal surgery&quot;. E-101 Solution is comprised&#xD;
      of the active ingredients of glucose oxidase (GO) and porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO) that&#xD;
      produce coupled reactions after the addition of glucose substrate. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      E-101 Solution topically applied directly into the principal incision is safe and&#xD;
      significantly reduces the incidence of incisional SSI compared to placebo topical&#xD;
      application. (The principal surgical incision is ≥ 5cm and &lt; 35 cm used as a hand port,&#xD;
      colorectal specimen extraction port, or extracorporeal manipulation port depending on the&#xD;
      specific colorectal surgical approach.)&#xD;

             index-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Likely preoperative urinary tract infection, as evident by: i) symptoms of upper&#xD;
             urinary tract infection (e.g., fever and/or flank pain) or ii) symptoms of lower&#xD;
             urinary tract infection (e.g., urinary frequency, dysuria, urgency, and/or suprapubic&#xD;
             pain); accompanied by any one of the following: 1) bacteriuria of ≥104 bacteria/mL&#xD;
             urine or 2) positive urine leucocyte esterase or positive nitrite urine dipstick&#xD;
             tests. Also exclude any man under age 60 years who has both positive urine nitrite and&#xD;
             leucocyte esterase dipstick tests - even if he is asymptomatic (unless he has&#xD;
             predisposing factors for urinary tract infection - e.g., spinal cord injury). (Note:&#xD;
             Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Undergoing a significant concomitant surgical procedure (e.g., hysterectomy) or any&#xD;
             mesh repair (either synthetic or biological mesh) as part of closure. The following&#xD;
             concomitant procedures are allowed: appendectomy, cholecystectomy, oophorectomy,&#xD;
             removal of Meckel's diverticulum, primary repair of small ventral hernia (i.e., &lt;30&#xD;
             cm2), liver biopsy/wedge resection (but not liver resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Participants with a condition (e.g., recurrent urinary tract infections, nail&#xD;
             infections, sinusitis, dental infections, vaginitis/vaginosis, or chronic bronchitis)&#xD;
             requiring frequent or chronic administration of antimicrobials (received&#xD;
             antibiotics/antimicrobials at least twice for ≥ 2 weeks during past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Preoperative prothrombin time or international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal. (Note: Testing should be performed at the local laboratory.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Postsurgical life expectancy ≤ 60 days (in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Any participant in which the planned surgery would include: i) placement of a stoma in&#xD;
             the principal incision; ii) placement of a drain into the supra-peritoneal fascia&#xD;
             space that emerges through the principal incision; iii) placement of a drain into the&#xD;
             intraperitoneal space that emerges through the principal incision; and iv)&#xD;
             supplementation of any of the irrigation fluid with antibiotic or antiseptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Participant with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are likely&#xD;
             to need &gt; 24 hours postoperative ventilator support (e.g. participant on chronic or&#xD;
             intermittent supplemental oxygen or an estimated forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
             (FEV1) less than 50% of expected based on bedside spirometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. If, in the opinion of Investigator, the potential participant would likely be unable&#xD;
             to maintain adequate care of the principal incision post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Anticipate that participant will not be available for study visits/ procedures or if&#xD;
             in the opinion of Investigator there is concern that participant might not comply with&#xD;
             study visits/procedures (e.g., due to ongoing illicit drug usage or alcohol abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Lack of willingness to have personal study-related data collected, archived, or&#xD;
             transmitted under a blinded condition to regulatory agencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Participation within 30 days before the start of this study in any experimental drug&#xD;
             or device study; or currently participating in a study in which the administration of&#xD;
             investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated.&#xD;

        <description>Superficial SSI: purulent drainage (PD) from superficial incision (SI), organisms isolated from aseptically obtained culture fluid from SI, pain/tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat extending from principal incision (PI), or PI deliberately opened by surgeon for presumptive PI infection and was culture-positive, a negative wound culture but clinical evidence of infection on Clinical Infection Wound Scale (CIWS). Deep incisional SSI: PD from deep incision (DI) but not from organ/space component of the surgical site, fever (&gt;38°C), localized wound pain, or wound tenderness, or DI spontaneously dehisces and/or deliberately opened by surgeon, and microbiological culture of DI by aseptic collection or deep wound swab was positive, an abscess or other evidence of infection involving DI was found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathological or radiological examination, negative deep wound culture but clinical evidence of deep wound infection on CIWS.</description>
        <time_frame>Surgery (Day 0) up to 30 days post-surgery</time_frame>
        <population>ITT Analysis Set included all randomized participants in their assigned treatment group except those were found between randomization and before surgery to either meet exclusion criteria or not meet inclusion criteria, who withdrew consent or were treated at site 03-03 (participants were excluded because of a systematic problem in incisional SSI surveillance due to a lack of blinded assessors). Cumulative Treatment Incisional SSI was reported which included Superficial SSI and Deep SSI.</population>

          <description>Superficial SSI: purulent drainage (PD) from superficial incision (SI), organisms isolated from aseptically obtained culture fluid from SI, pain/tenderness, localized swelling, redness, or heat extending from principal incision (PI), or PI deliberately opened by surgeon for presumptive PI infection and was culture-positive, a negative wound culture but clinical evidence of infection on Clinical Infection Wound Scale (CIWS). Deep incisional SSI: PD from deep incision (DI) but not from organ/space component of the surgical site, fever (&gt;38°C), localized wound pain, or wound tenderness, or DI spontaneously dehisces and/or deliberately opened by surgeon, and microbiological culture of DI by aseptic collection or deep wound swab was positive, an abscess or other evidence of infection involving DI was found on direct examination, during reoperation, or by histopathological or radiological examination, negative deep wound culture but clinical evidence of deep wound infection on CIWS.</description>
          <population>ITT Analysis Set included all randomized participants in their assigned treatment group except those were found between randomization and before surgery to either meet exclusion criteria or not meet inclusion criteria, who withdrew consent or were treated at site 03-03 (participants were excluded because of a systematic problem in incisional SSI surveillance due to a lack of blinded assessors). Cumulative Treatment Incisional SSI was reported which included Superficial SSI and Deep SSI.</population>
