        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a minimum of 2.0 cm of non-ulcerated, non-inflammatory&#xD;
             columnar-lined esophagus or squamous esophageal lined tissue suitable for ablation. A&#xD;
             patient may be treated with up to 2 zones of ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is 18 to 80 years of age at the time of consent (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has provided written Informed Consent Form (IFC) using a form that has been&#xD;
             approved by the Institution's reviewing IRB/EC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP)&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's esophagectomy is clinically necessary due to reasons unrelated to this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is deemed operable per standard institutional criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a known history of unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would limit&#xD;
             ability to comprehend or follow instructions related to IFC, post treatment&#xD;
             instructions or follow-up guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient refuses or is unable to provide written informed consent. - -&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has or is currently undergoing endoscopic ablation therapy within 4 cm from&#xD;
             the proposed treatment area including, but not limited to cryospray therapy, laser&#xD;
             treatment, photodynamic therapy, multi-polar electro coagulation, endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
             resection, radiofrequency ablation or argon plasma coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has esophageal narrowing limiting access to the intended site of ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is undergoing or has recently undergone chemotherapy (within 15 days or WBC&#xD;
             below normal by institutional criteria or standards).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is undergoing or has recently undergone radiation therapy which involved the&#xD;
             esophagus (within 15 days or WBC below normal by institutional criteria or standards).&#xD;
