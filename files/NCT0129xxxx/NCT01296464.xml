    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of a single dose of two experimental&#xD;
      levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (L/C/E) treatment regimens versus standard L/C/E treatment&#xD;
      regimen in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations in terms of&#xD;
      duration of motor response after the first morning dose of levodopa. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety of the L/C/E treatment regimens in patients with PD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, 3-period crossover study comparing the effects of a&#xD;
      single dose of two L/C/E treatment regimens (A and B) and standard L/C/E treatment regimen&#xD;
      (Stalevo) on the duration of motor response in PD patients with wearing-off symptoms after&#xD;
      the first morning dose of levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening visit, 3 treatment visits and an end-of-study visit. Within&#xD;
      14 days of the screening visit, the patients will receive a single morning dose of study drug&#xD;
      (either of the two L/C/E treatment regimens) or Stalevo. The order of the 3 treatment periods&#xD;
      will be randomised according to a crossover design and the duration of each period is 2 days,&#xD;
      followed by a wash-out period (1-9 days) during which the patients will be on their&#xD;
      individual standard PD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each study day, patients will arrive at the study centre in the previous evening. The&#xD;
      patients' own standard PD treatments will be discontinued at the latest by 22:00 to be&#xD;
      continued after completion of the motor part (part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Rating Scale (UPDRS III) next day. After completion of the UPDRS III, patients will return to&#xD;
      their own standard PD treatments. Duration of the study will be 2 to 7 weeks per patient,&#xD;
      depending on the length of the screening and wash-out periods.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Duration of response between 1.5 and 4 hours (based on medical history) to the&#xD;
