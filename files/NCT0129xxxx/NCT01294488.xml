      The overarching aim of the proposed study is to test the implementation effectiveness of two&#xD;
      implementation approaches-Remote Real-Time (RRT) using the internet telemedicine technology&#xD;
      and traditional Phone Consultation (PC) for training practitioners in PCIT. The study will&#xD;
      add to emerging knowledge about how technology can facilitate the transport of evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention models into field settings.&#xD;

      Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported behavioral parent&#xD;
      training program for reducing aggressive behavior in young children and for reducing future&#xD;
      rates of child physical abuse. Prior research has found that an adapted version of PCIT&#xD;
      developed specifically for violent parents in the child welfare system reduced future child&#xD;
      physical abuse recurrence rates from 49% to 19%. OUHSC/CCAN researchers, in prior and ongoing&#xD;
      studies, have found the benefits of PCIT to be durable over time and to generalize across&#xD;
      settings and across children in the same family. Culturally-specific adaptations of PCIT and&#xD;
      adaptations for older abused children and their abusive parents have been developed. A number&#xD;
      of blue-ribbon panels have recommended PCIT for widespread dissemination in child abuse&#xD;
      prevention and intervention service systems, but uptake of PCIT has been limited. One reason&#xD;
      for this is that the traditional PCIT practitioner training models are not easily replicable&#xD;
      in field settings. PCIT has historically been taught in University-based training programs&#xD;
      (graduate programs, internships, etc.) and includes several months of co-therapy mentoring&#xD;
      where trainers work directly with trainees during live sessions. In contrast, given the&#xD;
      difficulties of conducting co-therapy mentoring in field settings, training for widespread&#xD;
      implementation has generally involved initial training in the model followed by phone&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUHSC/CCAN researchers have pilot- and feasibility tested a system using internet-based&#xD;
      telemedicine technology to deliver live, mentored PCIT training. OUHSC/CCAN researchers have&#xD;
      piloted Remote Real-Time (RRT) training at sites in Utah, Seattle, Alaska, Oregon, and&#xD;
      Oklahoma. Feasibility appears excellent, and the approach has been well received. Moreover,&#xD;
      RRT implementation revealed misapplications of the model that had gone unaddressed in phone&#xD;
      consultation. This research project will make use of planned, funded PCIT start-up&#xD;
      implementations at 20-24 agency sites in Washington and Oklahoma. Study participants will&#xD;
      include agency practitioners engaged in implementing the PCIT model and families receiving&#xD;
      PCIT services at these community agencies. Using a multilevel interrupted time series&#xD;
      randomized design; the study will compare the RRT implementation approach with standard phone&#xD;
      consultation (PC). Outcomes will include practitioner fidelity and competency in implementing&#xD;
      PCIT, practitioner acceptance and satisfaction with PCIT, and family outcomes of parental&#xD;
      skill acquisition, parent satisfaction, child aggressive and oppositional behaviors, and&#xD;
      rates of future child welfare abuse reports. A mediational model is proposed in which&#xD;
      differences in client outcomes are mediated by improved practitioner fidelity and competency.&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness and practitioner response to the implementation approach will be examined.&#xD;
      The study thus will inform strategies for facilitating widespread dissemination and&#xD;
      implementation with fidelity of the evidence-based PCIT model, thereby making the model&#xD;
      available to a broader range of agencies and practitioners working with at-risk families.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A major inclusion criterion for agencies is existing plans and financial support for PCIT&#xD;
        implementation because this study's resources cannot fund the phase one didactic training&#xD;
        or clinical implementation. The proposed agencies all have existing funding, including&#xD;
        demonstration grants, Children's Justice grant funding, state contracts, federal&#xD;
        implementation funding, Indian Health Services funding, or SAMHSA funding specifically to&#xD;
        support their PCIT implementation. However without the current project, none of the agency&#xD;
        sites proposed for this study would be using RRT or assessing therapist fidelity; this&#xD;
        study thus provides quality assurance mechanisms that would be unavailable otherwise. The&#xD;
        agencies have reviewed and agreed to a set of agency inclusion criteria for study&#xD;
        participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency should be committed to developing a PCIT program, not simply training&#xD;
             staff. There should be a commitment by leadership to the program's long-term&#xD;
             sustainability, including sustaining the program through staff turn-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency should identify a minimum of three staff for PCIT training (with two staff&#xD;
             members acceptable from very small agencies that do not have three child service&#xD;
             providers), at least one of which is a supervisor. Licensed mental health practitioner&#xD;
             staff with a Master's degree or higher are strongly preferred, although exceptions may&#xD;
             be made in cases where agencies do not have Master's level staff. (For example, some&#xD;
             agencies conducting culturally relevant programs for minority or rural populations are&#xD;
             not always able to employ licensed mental health provider staff. Because RRT may be&#xD;
             especially salient for some of these agencies, these agencies will not be excluded&#xD;
             from the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency should be committed to providing the resources and staff availability to&#xD;
             complete the basic PCIT training package, standard PC consultation, and staff&#xD;
             participation in approximately six months of RRT training.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency should have or be in the process of developing the physical infrastructure&#xD;
             to deliver PCIT. Physical infrastructure includes PCIT rooms with sound equipment,&#xD;
             bug-in-the-ear equipment, and video recording equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency will need to have a dedicated broadband internet line for the RRT&#xD;
             equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency should be able to demonstrate that it has or will develop a referral&#xD;
             network sufficient to provide enough PCIT cases so that therapists can develop&#xD;
             mastery. This can include referral commitments and support from local child welfare&#xD;
             offices, courts, schools, and so forth. If the agency plans to serve child welfare&#xD;
             parents whose children are in foster care, it is imperative that there are firm&#xD;
             commitments for a transportation plan. Preliminary work may be necessary to gain the&#xD;
             cooperation of child welfare and courts to insure that service plans and court orders&#xD;
             are consistent with PCIT (i.e. allowing joint parent-child sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency agrees that basic PCIT training will meet OUHSC training guidelines (to be&#xD;
             described later).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If clients consent to participate, the agency agrees to archive video recordings of&#xD;
             all PCIT sessions and basic PCIT clinical measures from clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The agency is in a state that agrees to provide OUHSC with child welfare outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the event the agency's PCIT start-up plan requires that they begin PCIT services&#xD;
             prior to the start of the study, they will commence archiving session and client data&#xD;
             so that early session fidelity and competency and client outcomes can be tracked.&#xD;
             Standard PC consultation will be provided until the study begins. Session- and&#xD;
             client-level data are routinely collected as part of PCIT implementation, to guide&#xD;
             clinical intervention and assure quality of services. However, no data will be used&#xD;
             for research purposes unless therapists and clients provide informed consent for its&#xD;
             use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study will retain the right to involuntarily remove an agency and its therapists&#xD;
             from the study if PCIT implementation and data collection at the agency proves&#xD;
             infeasible.&#xD;
