      The study is aimed at assessing the safety of AdCh3NSmut and the new candidate vaccine&#xD;
      MVA-NSmut when administered sequentially, or alone, to healthy volunteers and patients with&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection The study also aims at assessing the cellular immune response&#xD;
      generated by AdCh3NSmut and MVA-NSmut administered as mentioned above.&#xD;

      The scientific rationale supporting this study can be summarised as follows: an effective&#xD;
      antiviral T cell response can mediate HCV viral control and induce the spontaneous resolution&#xD;
      of HCV during primary infection. This observation strongly supports the case for the&#xD;
      development of T cell induction strategies as a potential therapy for HCV. A hallmark of&#xD;
      persistent HCV infection, when viral loads are high, is a weak and narrowly focused HCV&#xD;
      specific T cell response, whereas in resolved infection with undetectable viral loads robust&#xD;
      T cell responses are detected. Furthermore, mouse and other human models of persistent viral&#xD;
      infection show that antigen load crucially determines the quality and quantity of the&#xD;
      anti-viral T cell responses so generated [17-18]. This supports the case for the assessment&#xD;
      of efficacy of T cell induction, a) in the setting of low viral loads following viral&#xD;
      suppression with combination therapy, and b) in the setting of high viral loads. Since&#xD;
      pre-existing anti-vector immunity to adenoviral vectors may limit vaccine efficacy, we have&#xD;
      conducted a phase-I clinical trial in healthy human subjects using human (Ad6) and simian&#xD;
      (AdCh3) adenoviral vectors found at low sero-prevalence in human populations, in a&#xD;
      heterologous prime/boost regimen (study HCV001). The same vectors are also under&#xD;
      investigation in HCV infected patients (HCV002). These vectors encode the HCV non-structural&#xD;
      proteins with a genetically inactivated polymerase gene (NSmut). We have shown that both&#xD;
      vectors are safe and highly immunogenic. In preclinical primate studies using identical&#xD;
      vectors, heterologous boosting increased peak responses and long-term immunity. However, in&#xD;
      humans it appears that, although HCV specific T-cell responses increase following boosting,&#xD;
      the magnitude of this response is reduced compared to that observed during vaccine priming.&#xD;
      This is probably due to the induction of cross-reactive immunity between the two vectors. In&#xD;
      contrast, it has recently been shown that Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding the malaria&#xD;
      antigen ME-TRAP very successfully boosts T-cell responses primed with a simian Adenovirus&#xD;
      vector, inducing the highest level of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses ever observed using a&#xD;
      vectored vaccine and affording protection from malaria infection (A. Hill unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons we now wish to assess an MVA construct encoding HCV NS that will be&#xD;
      combined with AdCh3NSmut (or AdCh3NSmut1) in a heterologous prime/boost vaccination regimen&#xD;
      to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this strategy in healthy and HCV infected&#xD;
      patients. This study will address the following questions: In healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can vaccination with MVA-NSmut vector alone safely induce HCV specific T cell responses?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can vaccination using a heterologous prime/boost vaccination schedule with AdCh3NSmut&#xD;
           and MVA-NSmut safely induce HCV specific T cell responses?&#xD;
&#xD;
           In HCV infected patients can a heterologous prime/boost vaccination schedule using&#xD;
           AdCh3NSmut and MVA-NSmut:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safely induce HCV specific T cell responses during pegylated-interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
           (combination) therapy for HCV genotype-1 infection, after a significant decline in viral&#xD;
           load, 14 weeks into therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safely induce HCV specific T cell responses during combination therapy for HCV&#xD;
           genotype-1 infection, 2 weeks into therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safely induce HCV specific T cell responses in patients with chronic HCV (not receiving&#xD;
           combination therapy) and a high viral load?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Suppress viral load in patients with chronic HCV, not on treatment with IFN and&#xD;
           Ribavirin? Since the effect of combination therapy on HCV specific T cells is currently&#xD;
           debated (see below) we will compare the T cell responses generated by the therapeutic&#xD;
           prime/boost vaccination schedule in this study, to a group of matched historical control&#xD;
           patients treated with combination therapy in whom immunological assessment has been made&#xD;
           in an identical way to that proposed in this study.&#xD;
