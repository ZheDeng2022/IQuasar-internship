      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of age and ethnic background on ocular&#xD;
      aqueous humor dynamics and biometric parameters. Data of normal healthy children and adults&#xD;
      will be used as controls for future study of juvenile glaucoma, and diabetes and potentially&#xD;
      for any other condition that affects intraocular pressure in children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and a leading cause of blindness in the United&#xD;
      States1 and the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. In glaucoma, vision is lost&#xD;
      through apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on a&#xD;
      combination of progressive, characteristic vision loss (measured using visual field testing)&#xD;
      and progressive optic nerve head damage (as detected through dilated fundus examinations or&#xD;
      optic disc photography). While ocular hypertension (OHT) is not sufficient for a diagnosis of&#xD;
      glaucoma, it is the greatest prognostic and modifiable factor. In fact, the only effective&#xD;
      treatment for glaucoma currently is to treat the elevated IOP. This treatment does not&#xD;
      provide a cure but it does slow glaucoma progression. IOP is determined by the balance&#xD;
      between aqueous production (flow) and aqueous humor outflow through either the trabecular&#xD;
      meshwork or uveoscleral pathway. Therefore, all clinically available glaucoma treatments are&#xD;
      designed to increase drainage and/or reduce production. The main purpose of the current study&#xD;
      is the determination of aqueous humor dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main types of glaucoma, &quot;open angle&quot; or chronic glaucoma and &quot;closed angle&quot; or&#xD;
      acute glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma tends to progress slowly and may remain undetected until&#xD;
      the patient notices a change in vision. On the other hand, angle closure glaucoma appears&#xD;
      suddenly and can be very painful, therefore is often diagnosed more quickly. The chance of&#xD;
      suffering from either one of these types of glaucoma depends greatly on one's ethnic&#xD;
      background. People suffering from primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) have short axial&#xD;
      lengths and shallow anterior chambers. These physical dimensions are found predominantly in&#xD;
      people from Asia and India. Angle-closure glaucoma is caused by factors that either pull or&#xD;
      push the iris up into the angle, physically blocking the drainage of aqueous humor and&#xD;
      increasing the resistance to outflow. The IOP will increase to dangerous levels in order to&#xD;
      drain the fluid through the obstructed outflow pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow angles are not present in children. As a person ages, the lens of the eye continues to&#xD;
      grow. In some but not all people, this growth pushes the iris forward, narrowing the angle.&#xD;
      Risk factors for developing narrow angles include Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, family history,&#xD;
      and advanced age. Prevalence figures identify East Asia as home to the majority of those&#xD;
      affected by PACG. PACG is acknowledged as a major cause of ocular morbidity in Chinese&#xD;
      populations and is more common among Chinese people than among Caucasian people. Part of the&#xD;
      global project is to travel to China to study Chinese children and adults. This will be done&#xD;
      in collaboration with Ganzu Hospital in Lanzhou, China. This is not part of the current&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open angle glaucoma typically occurs in older patients in the sixth decade of life or more.&#xD;
      African-Americans have up to six times higher risk of developing the condition than the&#xD;
      general population especially if there is a family history of glaucoma. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients who are highly myopic, have diabetes mellitus, or have cardiovascular problems are&#xD;
      at high risk of developing open angle glaucoma. Visual acuity, axial length and medical&#xD;
      history will be collected as part of the current protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike narrow angle glaucoma, patients with open angle glaucoma have a gradual blockage of&#xD;
      aqueous humor outflow despite a seemingly open chamber angle in the drainage pathway. As the&#xD;
      eye ages, the drainage system can become clogged with debris causing pressure inside the eye&#xD;
      to build to harmful levels. Open angle glaucoma can develop gradually and remain undetected&#xD;
      for years. Because there is usually no pain experienced over the months or years of&#xD;
      development and no other symptoms are apparent, the patient is often unaware of the existence&#xD;
      of this serious eye disorder. Since African-Americans are at such a high risk for contracting&#xD;
      glaucoma, children and adults of this ethnic background will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma can occur in children as well as adults. Glaucoma that begins before the child is 3&#xD;
      years old is called infantile or congenital glaucoma. Glaucoma manifesting itself in a&#xD;
      child's teens is juvenile glaucoma. There are many causes of childhood glaucoma, such as&#xD;
      heredity, or injury or certain eye disorders. Once the investigators collect information on&#xD;
      aqueous humor dynamics in healthy teenaged children, the investigators will study children of&#xD;
      the same age with glaucoma. The investigators are planning to conduct these studies at&#xD;
      Paracelsus University in Salzburg Austria. That is not part of the present protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent rabbit study, the investigators have learned that there are distinctive&#xD;
      circadian rhythms of IOP and aqueous humor dynamics in juvenile and adult rabbits. In the&#xD;
      ongoing clinical study of ocular hypertensive patients, the investigators are finding that&#xD;
      some glaucoma medications are not effective at night despite being efficacious during the&#xD;
      day. This has significant clinical importance. The investigators are including the study of&#xD;
      aqueous humor dynamics at night in the current protocol to determine the normal circadian&#xD;
      patterns for each ethnic group and age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, the investigators have found that there are several significant&#xD;
      differences in aqueous humor dynamics in immature animals compared to adult animals. This is&#xD;
      not just a continuum of changes occurring between young and old adults. The investigators&#xD;
      predict that important changes also take place in the ocular fluid dynamics of the eye as a&#xD;
      child matures. The major changes may occur during puberty. Understanding normal ocular&#xD;
      physiology in children will help us to understand the pathological changes taking place in&#xD;
      juvenile glaucoma. The clinical importance of this project is immense&#xD;
