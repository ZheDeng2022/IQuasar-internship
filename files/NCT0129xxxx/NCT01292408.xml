    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine is a drug that has been used to treat malaria and rheumatism. It is&#xD;
      recently discovered that Hydroxychloroquine increases 'autophagy'. Autophagy is a process&#xD;
      whereby cells eat a part themselves giving them extra energy. Cancer cells use autophagy to&#xD;
      survive chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Also, cancer cells use autophagy to survive in&#xD;
      areas of a tumor where there is a low oxygen level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with the drug Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      leads to a decrease of autophagy in breast cancer tissue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to various stresses, cells can launch a process of &quot;self-eating&quot;, termed&#xD;
      autophagy. Thereby, components of the cell are catabolically digested via specific lysosomes&#xD;
      called autophagosomes, to provide the cell with energy and other necessary factors to serve&#xD;
      as a temporary survival mechanism (Chen et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major stressors that can be evaded by autophagy are important for cancer progression and&#xD;
      treatment sensitivity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cells can respond with autophagy to cytotoxic treatment such as chemo- or endocrine&#xD;
           therapy, thereby leading to treatment insensitivity (Kondo et al. 2005; Chen et al.&#xD;
           2010), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cells can survive severe hypoxia using autophagy (Rouschop et al. 2010), and hypoxic&#xD;
           cells themselves are refractory to chemo-, endocrine and radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, tumor cells evade treatment induced cell death by launching a temporary last survival&#xD;
      mechanism. Inhibition of this pathway could lead to sensitization for a variety of cancer&#xD;
      treatment regimen, or to specific cell killing of tumor associated hypoxic cells that would&#xD;
      otherwise be refractory to radiotherapy. Chloroquine (CQ),&#xD;
      N'-(7-chloroquinoline-4-yl)-N,N-diethyl-pentane-1,4-diamine, was discovered in 1934, and has&#xD;
      widely been used as an effective and safe anti-malarial and anti-rheumatoid agent since 1947.&#xD;
      Later, CQ has been rediscovered as a sensitizer of cytotoxic cancer therapies such as&#xD;
      ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics, although the precise mechanism behind this has&#xD;
      remained largely unknown (Solomon and Lee 2009). Most recently, it was discovered that CQ&#xD;
      inhibits the process of autophagy by impairment of autophagic vesicle clearance, as CQ&#xD;
      accumulates in lysosomal vesicles. This has now lead to several investigators proposing that&#xD;
      CQ or one of its analogs can be used to inhibit the autophagic pathway as an additive to&#xD;
      other cytotoxic treatments. Hydrochloroquine (HCQ, Plaquenil) is a CQ derivative with fewer&#xD;
      side effects than CQ, which has long been used as anti-malarial and antirheumatoid agent. It&#xD;
      can be safely used at high doses for extended periods of time. Both CQ and HCQ are under&#xD;
      investigation in clinical trials for glioblastoma, small and non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer (for&#xD;
      reviews see Solomon and Lee 2009 and Chen et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effect of HCQ on tumor tissue, autophagy and/or oxygenation has of yet not been&#xD;
      studied in human patients in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study we intend to investigate the effect of HCQ on breast cancer tissues. To&#xD;
      this end, breast cancer patients that have given informed consent for participation in the&#xD;
      AFTER study (AMO 2010/312), but are not included as their tissue biopsy is found to be ER/PgR&#xD;
      negative, will be asked to take 800 mg once, and then 400 mg/day HCQ for 2 to 3 weeks until&#xD;
      surgery. We will compare tissue characteristics before and after treatment using HCQ, looking&#xD;
      at effects on markers for both hypoxia and autophagy using immunohistochemistry. We expect&#xD;
      that after treatment with HCQ tumor cells in hypoxic areas will no longer be able to survive,&#xD;
      thus decreasing the number of viable hypoxic cells and increasing the amount of necrosis.&#xD;
      This pilot study will serve as a proof of principle for future studies into the effect of&#xD;
      autophagy inhibition on treatment sensitivity in breast cancer&#xD;
