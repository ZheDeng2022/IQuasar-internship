    <textblock>
      Background Some patients complain of excessive evacuation, which may become socially&#xD;
      disabling (Azpiroz F &amp; Malagelada J-R, 2005). However, there no systematic investigation on&#xD;
      the range of gas evacuation in healthy subjects and in subjects complaining of flatulence&#xD;
      under basal conditions and in response to a high-flatulogenic diet (Azpiroz F &amp; Levitt DG,&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients complaining of excessive passage of gas per anus have more intestinal gas&#xD;
      production and more anal gas evacuation during basal conditions and in response to a high&#xD;
      flatulogenic diet than healthy subjects. This abnormality is related to the differences in&#xD;
      colonic microflora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the normal range of intestinal gas evacuation under basal conditions and in&#xD;
           response to a high flatulogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients complaining of flatulence, to determine whether intestinal gas evacuation&#xD;
           under basal conditions and in response to a high flatulogenic diet is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify differences in the microbiota pattern in subjects with normal and excessive&#xD;
           anal gas evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients complaining of flatulence, to determine the segmental distribution of&#xD;
           intestinal gas after a diet challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Healthy subjects (n=20) and patients complaining of flatulence (n=30) will undergo a&#xD;
      3-day basal phase on their current diet and a 3-day challenge phase on a high-flatulogenic&#xD;
      diet; patients will be followed-up for 7 days on a low-flatulogenic diet. The following g&#xD;
      measurements will be performed: daily measurement of the number of anal gas passages with an&#xD;
      event marker, continuous recording of anal gas evacuation in the laboratory using an&#xD;
      electronic leakage-free gas collection system, colonic flora analysis by fecal sampling, and&#xD;
      segmental gas distribution in the gut by abdominal computer tomography (CT) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance These studies will allow to develop the normal range of anal gas evacuation during&#xD;
      basal conditions. Furthermore, a provocative test will be developed for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      excessive gas production in patients complaining of flatulence. This data will allow a proper&#xD;
      diagnosis of these patients and will pave the path for a rational management and for the&#xD;
      development of evidence-based treatment strategies. This pilot study will allow a proper&#xD;
      design with adequate sample size calculation in future interventional studies.&#xD;

      Background Some patients complain of excessive evacuation, which may become socially&#xD;
      disabling (Azpiroz F &amp; Malagelada J-R, 2005). However, the physiology and pathophysiology of&#xD;
      flatulence remains poorly understood (Azpiroz F &amp; Levitt DG, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas evacuated by anus originates by-and-large in the colon, where unabsorbed meal residues&#xD;
      are fermented by colonic bacteria (Anderson et al., 1981;Levitt et al., 1987;Flourie et al.,&#xD;
      1988). Indeed, it has been shown that some food components are incompletely absorbed in the&#xD;
      small bowel and enter the colon (Wolever &amp; Robb, 1992;Grimble, 1989;Steggerda FR, 1968;Wagner&#xD;
      et al., 1977;Steggerda F.R. &amp; Dimmick, 1966;Stone-Dorshow &amp; Levitt, 1987;Wursch et al., 1989)&#xD;
      and that other intraluminal substrates interfere with the absorption of nutrients (Boibin M&#xD;
      et al., 1998;Hamberg et al., 1989;Brugge &amp; Rosenfeld, 1987;Taylor et al., 1986;Layer et al.,&#xD;
      1986). Hence, the volume of gas production and anal evacuation is determined by two main&#xD;
      factors: the diet, particularly the amount of fermentable residues, and the individual&#xD;
      composition of colonic microflora. Within subjects, gas output varies in relation to the diet&#xD;
      (Steggerda FR, 1968;Kirk, 1949). However, there is a great interindividual variability, and&#xD;
      gas evacuation in subjects maintained on a similar diet may differ substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that healthy subjects on a normal diet containing 200 g of beans evacuate&#xD;
      705 mL gas per 24 hours, whereas with a fiber the diet gas evacuation was 214 mL (Tomlin et&#xD;
      al., 1991). In healthy subjects the frequency of gas evacuation is variable, usually around&#xD;
      10 evacuation per day (Furne &amp; Levitt, 1996). Based on observations on a patient that who&#xD;
      passed large amounts of flatus, a classification of foodstuffs depending on their gas&#xD;
      producing capacity was elaborated (Sutalf LO &amp; Levitt MD, 1979). Few studies on specific&#xD;
      foodstuffs have been later added to complement this information (Wolever &amp; Robb, 1992;Wagner&#xD;
      et al., 1977;Hickey C et al., 1972). However, there no systematic investigation on the range&#xD;
      of gas evacuation in healthy subjects and in subjects complaining of flatulence under basal&#xD;
      conditions and in response to a high-flatulogenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Recruitment questionnaire A questionnaire will be used to evaluate gas evacuation,&#xD;
      bowel habit and functional gut symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily measurement of the number of anal gas evacuations and symptoms The number of gas&#xD;
      evacuations per anus will be measured using an event marker during daytime. At the end of the&#xD;
      day the following parameters will be recorded on a questionnaire: discomfort related to&#xD;
      flatulence and evaluation of abdominal discomfort/pain (using 0-10 analogue scales); the&#xD;
      number of bowel movements and form (using the Bristol scale; (Heaton &amp; O'Donnell, 1994) and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal well-being (satisfaction/dissatisfaction using a 10 point scale graded from&#xD;
      +5 to -5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of colonic flora The composition of the intestinal flora will be evaluated measuring&#xD;
      flora composition in stools. Subjects will be supplied with two Stool Collecting Kits (each&#xD;
      containing two weighed sampling tubes containing RNA synthesis stabilization buffers (RNA&#xD;
      later, Ambion), one of which is a spare) into which they will provide a small sample of their&#xD;
      stool (at least 30g). After mixing the stool with the buffer in the supplied tube, subjects&#xD;
      will store the tubes in the box at home until they next visit at the hospital, where it will&#xD;
      be centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5 minutes, supernatant removed and fecal pellet stored at -&#xD;
      80oC in the Gastroenterology Research Unit. Samples will be transported to Danone Research,&#xD;
      France where they will be analysed for composition of intestinal flora (bacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using molecular based methods, the concentration of dominant and some sub-dominant bacterial&#xD;
      groups of intestinal flora will be measured. These include bacteria that belong to&#xD;
      Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Euryarcheota groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous recording of anal gas evacuation Participants will be studied in the laboratory.&#xD;
      After a standard breakfast, rectal gas will be collected via a rectal cannula. Anal gas will&#xD;
      be collected via a leak proof, low resistance collection line, using a barostat and the&#xD;
      volume will be continuously recorded for either 3 or 8 hours (see study design). The&#xD;
      composition of the gas collected will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subjects are positioned in bed, a non-stretch belt, 48 mm wide, with a metric scale&#xD;
      will be adjusted around the abdomen by means of two elastic bands. All girth changes will be&#xD;
      measured while the subjects are breathing relaxed, and will be referenced to the mid point of&#xD;
      respiratory displacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A graded questionnaire will be used to measure the intensity and the type of sensations&#xD;
      perceived, and an anatomical questionnaire to measure the location and extension of the&#xD;
      perceived sensations. The graded questionnaire includes five visual analogue scales graded&#xD;
      from 0 (no perception) to 6 (pain), specifically for scoring: a) sensation of increased&#xD;
      abdominal pressure, b) sensation of abdominal distension, c) colicky/rumbling sensation, d)&#xD;
      puncture/stinging sensation, and d) other type of sensation (to be specified by the&#xD;
      participant in the questionnaire), respectively. The questionnaire includes two additional&#xD;
      scales for scoring feeling of difficult evacuation of gas per anus, and belching,&#xD;
      respectively, that will be analyzed separately. Subjects will be asked to score any perceived&#xD;
      sensation (one or more perceived simultaneously) on the scales. The anatomical questionnaire&#xD;
      incorporates a diagram of the abdomen divided in nine regions corresponding to epigastrium,&#xD;
      periumbilical area, hypogastrium, both hypochondria, flanks, and ileal fossae. Subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed to mark the location, i.e., abdominal region (s) or extraabdominal, where the&#xD;
      sensations are perceived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segmental gas distribution in the gut In patients complaining of bloating, an abdominal CT&#xD;
      scan will be taken. This scan will be used to rule out organic disorders. Furthermore, using&#xD;
      an original program, abdominal morpho-volumetric analysis will be performed to measure gas&#xD;
      volumes in different gut. All female participants with childbearing potential will undergo a&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test 24 hours prior to the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperflatulogenic diet challenge For 3 days participants will be asked to consume a diet rich&#xD;
      in fermentable residues to increase their gas production rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-flatulogenic diet At the end of the study, patients will be put on a low residue diet for&#xD;
      7 days; this will give an indication of the potentially expected response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working Plan Each subject will attend the following visits; the first recruitment visit will&#xD;
      be performed by the attending physician in the outpatient clinic, and the rest, including the&#xD;
      physiological measurements in the Digestive System Research Unit; CT imaging will be&#xD;
      performed in the Department of Radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1. Recruitment: entry questionnaires. Visit 2. Before basal period: instructions,&#xD;
      informed consent, and delivery of event marker, questionnaires, and material for fecal&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3. Last day of basal phase. Continuous recording of anal gas evacuation. Delivery of&#xD;
      dietary instructions (high-flatulogenic diet) and questionnaires. In 8 patients segmental gas&#xD;
      distribution will be also measured during the basal phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4. Last day of challenge phase. Continuous recording of anal gas evacuation. CT for&#xD;
      evaluation of segmental gas distribution in the gut. In patients only: delivery of dietary&#xD;
      instructions (low-flatulogenic diet) and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5. Last day of correction phase. In patients only: collection of data and materials.&#xD;
