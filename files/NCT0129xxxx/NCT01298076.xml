      The specific aims of the study are to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That there is a difference in change in visual acuity resulting from treatment with&#xD;
           intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with advanced&#xD;
           macular oedema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That there is a difference in degree of resolution of macular oedema resulting from&#xD;
           treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab compared with dexamethasone implant in eyes with&#xD;
           advanced macular oedema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That both intravitreal bevacizumab and dexamethasone implants have a manageable and&#xD;
           acceptable safety profile in eyes with diabetic macular oedema&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of vision and the most common cause of&#xD;
      blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries. Swelling&#xD;
      of the central retina, or &quot;macular oedema&quot;, is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is treated with laser photocoagulation of areas of leak in the&#xD;
      macula according to established guidelines which take into account the extent of the leak and&#xD;
      its proximity to the centre of the macula, the &quot;fovea&quot;. This treatment does not always work,&#xD;
      however, and is inherently destructive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New drugs have become available which appear to reduce the risk of loss of vision in eyes&#xD;
      with advanced diabetic macular oedema for which further laser treatment is unlikely to be&#xD;
      beneficial. Intravitreal injection of slow-release steroid formulations such as Ozurdex™, a&#xD;
      slow release formulation of dexamethasone, has been proposed as a new modality to treat&#xD;
      clinically significant DMO. We have recently conducted randomised clinical trials which have&#xD;
      demonstrated that treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) leads to reduction of DMO&#xD;
      and improved vision in these eyes. Another class of drugs, inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial&#xD;
      Growth Factor (VEGF) such as bevacizumab (Avastin®), also appear efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While both drugs appear to reduce macular oedema and improve vision in the short term, they&#xD;
      may have differences which could guide how they are best used. Around 1/3 of eyes that&#xD;
      receive dexamethasone may develop elevated intraocular pressure and cataract, both of which&#xD;
      are manageable but may complicate the picture. Anti-VEGF drugs do not have these local&#xD;
      adverse events, however they must be given more frequently (4-6 weekly vs 4-6 monthly for&#xD;
      Ozurdex™) and it is suspected they may have a neurotoxic effect on the retina. Some&#xD;
      authorities suspect that anti-VEGF treatment may be associated with a small increased risk of&#xD;
      having a stroke or heart attack during treatment, even when they are injected into the eye.&#xD;
      This has not been proven with a related drug, ranibizumab, but it is still possible that it&#xD;
      may occur with bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a, 2 year, phase II, prospective, multicentre, randomised, single-masked&#xD;
      clinical trial of sustained release intravitreal dexamethasone (Ozurdex™) versus intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of bevacizumab (Avastin®) for diabetic foveal oedema that persists or recurs&#xD;
      despite previous laser treatment, or for which the investigator believes laser treatment is&#xD;
      unlikely to be helpful.&#xD;
