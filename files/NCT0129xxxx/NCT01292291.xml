      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help find&#xD;
      prostate cancer and learn the extent of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the safety of MRI and to see how well it works in&#xD;
      diagnosing prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) to&#xD;
           identify men who can safely avoid unnecessary biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the ability of the MP-MRI-based diagnostic pathway to improve the rate of&#xD;
           detection of clinically significant cancer as compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)&#xD;
           biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an MP-MRI based diagnostic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T2-weighted imaging,&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) followed by template prostate&#xD;
      mapping and transrectal ultrasound biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may undergo blood, urine, and tissue sample collection periodically for&#xD;
      biomarker studies. Samples are banked for future research analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline, during, and after&#xD;
      completion of study. An economic analysis will be performed for cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
