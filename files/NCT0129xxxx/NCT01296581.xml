&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor malignancy&#xD;

             investigator's opinion.&#xD;

             ULN within 14 days prior to the start of X-82. Patients with elevated CA 125 levels at&#xD;
             baseline are not required to have measurable disease by RECIST criteria. Patients with&#xD;
