    <textblock>
      By hypothesising that Interstitial Cystitis is an allergic disorder of the urogenital system&#xD;
      that is linked to mast-cells, current therapy with omalizumab may represent a potential non&#xD;
      symptomatic strategy for the treatment of IC/BPS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bladder,&#xD;
      that is characterized by pain in the pelvic region and a frequent need to urinate. So far&#xD;
      there is not a an effective treatment for this uncommon distressing condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab in the&#xD;
      treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome, evaluated by visual analogue score&#xD;
      (VAS) for pain and urgency- frequency, O'Leary-Sant IC symptom and problem index&#xD;
      questionnaire (primary outcome), PUF questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire, and urination diary (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three female adult patients (24-34 years) suffering form Interstitial Cystitis and chronic&#xD;
      bladder pain were included in the study. The omalizumab dose has been calculated on the basis&#xD;
      of body weight and basal levels of total serum IgE. Treatment was administered subcutaneously&#xD;
      every 2 or 4 weeks (according to the calculated total dose) for a total of 48 weeks. Each&#xD;
      vial contained 150 mg of the active compound, therefore the number of injections for each&#xD;
      administration varied between 1 and 3, depending on the total dose used. Patients were&#xD;
      allowed to take drugs used for IC (Fibrase, Pelvilen, Normast, Quercetin, Chondroitin,&#xD;
      Glucosamine per os). During the screening process, the dosage of these drugs was established&#xD;
      and stably maintained during the 4 week run-in period.&#xD;

             provided written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients diagnosed with IC/PBS that underwent treatment, basal levels of total&#xD;
             serum IgE were 30 and 700 IU/ml and patients showed a positive allergic anamnesis&#xD;
