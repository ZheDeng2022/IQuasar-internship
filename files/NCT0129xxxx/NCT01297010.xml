  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of pediatric surgery takes place in an outpatient basis. The occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative vomiting can lead to a delay in hospital discharge. However, the use of&#xD;
      postoperative vomiting prophylaxis exposes patients unnecessarily to the drugs side effects&#xD;
      and also raises the final costs of the surgical procedure. The Objective our study is Compare&#xD;
      the incidence of postoperative vomiting between children who received dexamethasone,&#xD;
      dexamethasone plus ondansetron or placebo for anti-emetic prophylaxis during outpatient&#xD;
      surgery. This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to comparing the use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ondansetron and placebo for postoperative vomiting&#xD;
      prophylaxis in children submitted to general anesthesia. Data analysis will be used is&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test for the categorical variables and the Anova test for numerical variables&#xD;
      as they presented Gaussian variation. The study used a significance level of 5%.&#xD;

      The investigators know that a large number of pediatric surgeries are performed on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting after surgery can lead to delayed&#xD;
      discharge and increased hospital costs. Based on this fact, the investigators find it&#xD;
      relevant to determine the incidence of postoperative vomiting in pediatric surgery patients&#xD;
      to assess the need for antiemetic prophylaxis in this study population being developed in the&#xD;
      surgical ward of the Hospital das Clinicas - Federal University of Pernambuco (HC-UFPE ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted from March 2011 to September 2011.Pacientes pediatric ASA I and&#xD;
      II underwent surgery in the pediatric surgical ward of the HC-UFPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was performed in the program StatCalc Epi-Info 6.04d, based on&#xD;
      data from relevant literature and determined the presence of 44 patients in each of the three&#xD;
      groups, totaling 132 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the preparation room anesthetic in surgical clinics of the&#xD;
      Hospital for three shifts of existing pediatric surgery. After evaluation of each patient and&#xD;
      then filled the criteria of inclusion and exclusion, those responsible will be informed about&#xD;
      the procedures being undertaken and the possible consequences of their participation in&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only after signing an informed consent by the person responsible will be held the allocation&#xD;
      of patients into three groups, after opening the sealed envelope containing the selected&#xD;
      group for that participant. These envelopes are previously prepared by a person outside the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the researcher has no prior knowledge of the group selected for the participant at&#xD;
      the time of the consent solicitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study will fill a flowchart with the profile of the trial, including the&#xD;
      total number of patients, the number of eligible patients, the number of those who were&#xD;
      offered participation in the study, the number of denied and his reason the number of&#xD;
      patients who agreed to participate. The latter will be known only after statistical analysis&#xD;
      Randomization to each specific group will be held in accordance with a table of random&#xD;
      numbers previously generated computer (Random Allocation Software 1.0, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of dexamethasone and ondansetron, or dexamethasone or placebo only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of postoperative vomiting;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for antiemetic therapy in the recovery room post-anesthesia unit (PACU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in PACU&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delaying Hospital discharge All patients and their caregivers will be duly informed of&#xD;
           the research objectives and will be included in the study only if they agree to&#xD;
           participate and sign the Deed of Consent. The project was designed following the&#xD;
           recommendations of Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council and the Declaration&#xD;
           of Helsinki for research involving human subjects (2000). In addition, the project was&#xD;
           submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Hospital das Clinicas-UFPE and approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive all information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this&#xD;
      technique, being safeguarded the right to refuse to participate. The researchers will&#xD;
      undertake to publish the study, regardless of the outcome.&#xD;
