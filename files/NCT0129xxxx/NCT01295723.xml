    <textblock>
      Hypofractionated intraoperative boost (HIOB) is defined as hypofractionated WBRT (40.5 Gy in&#xD;
      2.7 Gy per fraction) preceded by an intraoperative boost to the tumor bed (10 Gy IOERT). The&#xD;
      HIOB study concept will test whether such a combined schedule is superior or iso-effective&#xD;
      standard RT in terms of local control and cosmetic outcome.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to find out the effects (good and bad) of adding a dose&#xD;
      of radiation to the area of the cancer during surgery to whole breast radiation therapy&#xD;
      (WBRT) after surgery. IOERT is the application of electron radiation directly to the residual&#xD;
      tumor or tumor bed during cancer surgery. WBRT is a type of radiation therapy used to treat&#xD;
      patients who have cancer in the breast covering the entire breast tissue. Both immediate and&#xD;
      long-term effects will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with certain types of breast cancer, one standard treatment is removal of the&#xD;
      area of cancer and a small amount of normal tissue around it followed by breast radiation.&#xD;
      The radiation treatment in this situation usually lasts 3 to 5 1/2 weeks of WBRT followed by&#xD;
      5-8 daily radiation treatments at the site where the lump was removed called a &quot;boost&quot;.&#xD;
      During this study, the single dose of electron irradiation (IOERT) given at the surgical site&#xD;
      during the operation will replace the usual 5-8 days of localized radiation and the whole&#xD;
      breast radiation will last 3 weeks.&#xD;
