  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the comparative safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid, obtained from two different sources, in the&#xD;
      treatment of osteoarthritic pain of the knee.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial using a&#xD;
      non-inferiority comparison to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intra-articular&#xD;
      injection of Durolane® vs Artz® in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either Durolane or Artz. All subjects will be followed up for 26&#xD;
      weeks from the initial treatment.The screening period is expected to be up to 2 weeks in&#xD;
      duration before the baseline visit. Each subject will provide a written informed consent and&#xD;
      undergo a qualifying screening. Assessment at screening will include postero-anterior view of&#xD;
      standing weight-bearing semi-flexed radiographs of the study knee. The osteoarthritis changes&#xD;
      of the study knee will be graded 0,1,2,3 or 4 according to the Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic&#xD;
      scoring criteria. Radiographic assessment will be made by an assigned and well trained&#xD;
      investigator at each study center. The study knee and contralateral knee will use the Likert&#xD;
      WOMAC 5-point scoring for pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination of the knees and vital signs will be performed (this examination will be&#xD;
      repeated at end).&#xD;

    <measure>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index) Pain Subscale Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>over 18 weeks (week timepoints 6, 10, 14, and 18)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain assessment is made of 5 items; each has 5 possible values 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. The items are summed for a total range of 0 to 20. Therefore, the pain change from baseline range is -20 to 20. A negative change is a reduction in pain from the baseline pain score.&#xD;
A mixed-effect repeated measures regression model was used to estimate a least square mean for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.&#xD;
Change from baseline was the dependent variable. Subject baseline score was a fixed effect covariate. Enrollment site, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction were fixed class effects. Subject was a random effect. A least square mean single point estimate and 95%CI was calculated for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot; using all data collected at each time point within the &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.</description>

    <description>The comparator product, ARTZ, is manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation, Japan. Subjects randomized to the ARTZ group were administered five weekly intra-articular injections (2.5 ml, NASHA 25 mg). ARTZ is a sterile, viscoelastic nonpyrogenic solution of purified, high molecular weight (620,000-1,170,000 daltons) sodium hyaluronate having a pH of 6.8-7.8. The sodium hyaluronate is extracted from chicken combs.</description>

    <description>The investigational product was provided in pre-filled syringes containing stabilized non-animal hyaluronic acid (20 mg/mL). Only one injection was given for those subjects randomized to the DUROLANE group, followed by 4 sham injections. DUROLANE is free from products of animal origin and is manufactured by Q-Med AB Corporation.The sham injection procedure was same as the active injection, except that they were subcutaneous and an empty syringe was used.</description>

        <title>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index) Pain Subscale Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>Pain assessment is made of 5 items; each has 5 possible values 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. The items are summed for a total range of 0 to 20. Therefore, the pain change from baseline range is -20 to 20. A negative change is a reduction in pain from the baseline pain score.&#xD;
A mixed-effect repeated measures regression model was used to estimate a least square mean for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.&#xD;
Change from baseline was the dependent variable. Subject baseline score was a fixed effect covariate. Enrollment site, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction were fixed class effects. Subject was a random effect. A least square mean single point estimate and 95%CI was calculated for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot; using all data collected at each time point within the &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.</description>

          <title>WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index) Knee Stiffness Subscale Change From Baseline</title>
          <description>Knee stiffness assessment is made of 2 items; each has 5 possible values 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=extreme. The items are summed for a total range of 0 to 8. Therefore, the knee stiffness change from baseline range is -8 to 8. A negative change is a reduction in knee stiffness from the baseline knee stiffness score.&#xD;
A mixed-effect repeated measures regression model was used to estimate a least square mean for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.&#xD;
Change from baseline was the dependent variable. Subject baseline score was a fixed effect covariate. Enrollment site, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction were fixed class effects. Subject was a random effect. A least square mean single point estimate and 95%CI was calculated for the entire &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot; using all data collected at each time point within the &quot;Measured Time Frame&quot;.</description>
          <population>per protocol: all subjects randomized and treated with no important protocol deviation(s), which were established at a blinded data review meeting. An important deviation is any deviation that has the potential to bias the primary outcome.</population>
