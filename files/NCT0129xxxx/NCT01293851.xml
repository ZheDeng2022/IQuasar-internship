      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Docetaxel, the most commonly used drug for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, has&#xD;
      been shown to prolong the lives of women with breast cancer and prevent the cancer from&#xD;
      spreading or returning. However, docetaxel is known to cause nerve damage, including&#xD;
      numbness, tingling, and pain, in 50 to 90 percent of breast cancer patients. This nerve&#xD;
      damage is called peripheral neuropathy, and can be so severe that treatment with docetaxel&#xD;
      may need to be stopped. Researchers are interested in studying docetaxel-related nerve damage&#xD;
      to determine whether certain genetic factors may predispose women to developing this&#xD;
      condition, and to more closely investigate the specific effects of docetaxel on the nervous&#xD;
      system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine nerve damage in women with breast cancer who are being treated with docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and are&#xD;
      scheduled to have docetaxel treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as&#xD;
           well as blood and urine tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires seven visits, one before the start of chemotherapy and six after the&#xD;
           scheduled treatment visits. Study procedures at each visit will take 30 to 45 minutes&#xD;
           and will be done in parallel with scheduled chemotherapy visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will provide blood samples; complete questionnaires to&#xD;
           rate and describe any existing pain, numbness, or tingling in hands and feet before the&#xD;
           start of chemotherapy; have nerve conduction tests; and have a skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit following docetaxel treatment, participants will complete questionnaires&#xD;
           to rate and describe any pain, numbness, or tingling during the course of chemotherapy.&#xD;
           Participants will provide blood samples at every visit and have nerve conduction tests&#xD;
           during the second, fourth, and sixth visits. Participants will also have a second skin&#xD;
           biopsy, either from a site that appears to be experiencing nerve damage or (for those&#xD;
           who are not developing nerve damage symptoms) from a site near the first biopsy&#xD;
           location.&#xD;

      Objective: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most debilitating&#xD;
      side effects of neurotoxic chemotherapy, and can significantly interfere with patient quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL) and the administration of antineoplastic therapy. There is no currently&#xD;
      approved safe and effective treatment for CIPN. This protocol will explore the&#xD;
      molecular-genetic mechanisms associated with the natural history of CIPN progression by (1)&#xD;
      identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins as biomarkers for the onset of&#xD;
      CIPN; (2) evaluation of the relationship between biomarkers and the severity of CIPN during&#xD;
      the observation period, and (3) determining the relationship between molecular-genetic&#xD;
      biomarkers, morphological changes in small nerve fiber and the severity of neuropathic&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Cancer patients who plan to receive chemotherapy treatment with either&#xD;
      taxane class, vinca alkaloid class, platinum compounds or bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, exploratory, natural history study to identify the&#xD;
      molecular-genetic mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in cancer patients.&#xD;
      A physician-based neuropathy scale, patient neurotoxocity questionnaire, and the total&#xD;
      neuropathy score will be used to measure the severity of peripheral neuropathy at baseline&#xD;
      and after completion of each cycle of chemotherapy infusion. Whole peripheral blood and skin&#xD;
      biopsy (only from patients who consent to biopsies) will be collected at baseline and after a&#xD;
      subsequent infusion cycle to evaluate gene/protein expression and immunohistochemical&#xD;
      labeling at peripheral sites of neuropathic injury. Microarray gene expression analysis will&#xD;
      be employed to identify differential regulation of genes involved in the development of CIPN&#xD;
      at the different time points compared with gene expression from the baseline samples. Genes&#xD;
      of interest will be validated by qRT-PCR to identify novel pharmacological targets to be&#xD;
      evaluated in future prospective studies. Protein levels corresponding to the changes in gene&#xD;
      expression will be evaluated using ELISA and verified by Western blotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study will be the changes in gene and protein&#xD;
      expression in the peripheral blood and skin biopsy among cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The secondary outcome will be the relationship between the molecular-genetic&#xD;
      biomarkers identified and the presence of peripheral neuropathic symptoms and their impacts&#xD;
      on patient s QOL.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following to be eligible for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male and female cancer patients will be recruited in this study. However, data&#xD;
             will be separately assessed between males and females due to the differences in&#xD;
             incidence, etiology and hormonal dependence which may confound the final data&#xD;
             analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancer patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy with taxane class, vinca alkaloid&#xD;
             class, platinum compounds or bortezomib&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any one of the following will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide their own informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had prior radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing documented neuropathy or risk factors for neuropathy that may confound&#xD;
             the analysis of factors associated with CIPN such as:&#xD;
