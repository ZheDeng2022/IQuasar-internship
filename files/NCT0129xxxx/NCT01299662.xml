      Vaccines induce protective immunity against numerous infectious diseases. However, current&#xD;
      vaccines have limited efficacy against challenging infections like tuberculosis, malaria, and&#xD;
      HIV. Protein vaccines are safe but, typically they induce weak T cell immunity when&#xD;
      administered alone. Therefore, special attention is being given to adjuvants, which are&#xD;
      enhancers of immunity, that cab mature antigen presenting immunostimulatory dendritic cells.&#xD;
      Our goal is to study in humans the mechanism whereby a synthetic adjuvant, poly ICLC, which&#xD;
      acts on defined pattern recognition receptors, enhances T an B cell immunity. In preclinical&#xD;
      studies, our lab has found in mice that poly IC and its analog poly ICLC are superior&#xD;
      adjuvants for T cell mediated immunity relative to other agonists for PRR. Poly ICLC has been&#xD;
      extensively studied in humans with a favorable safety profile. In a recently completed Phase&#xD;
      I study, poly ICLC was found to be safe and well tolerated when administered as a single dose&#xD;
      of 1.6 mg subcutaneously and intranasally to healthy volunteers. In additional, preliminary&#xD;
      data shows marked upregulation of gene expression in whole PBMSc following s.c. injection of&#xD;
      poly ICLC as well as activation of various blood cell type, including dendritic cells and&#xD;
      monocytes. In this study the investigators propose to extend the evaluation of innate immune&#xD;
      responses following s.d. injection of poly ICLC to healthy volunteers. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to characterize poly ICLC effects on specific blood cell types, focusing on three&#xD;
      different subsets of DC's, by analyzing gene transcriptional changes at baseline and at one&#xD;
      day following its administration. In order to study the early local effects of poly ICLC,&#xD;
      which are important for the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting cells, the&#xD;
      investigators also propose to perform skin biopsies at a skin site contralateral to the&#xD;
      injection site and at the injection site after poly ICLC injections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This protocol will take a systems biology approach to understand in humans a major new area&#xD;
      of vaccine biology: the mechanism whereby adjuvants, acting on defined pattern recognition&#xD;
      receptors [PRR], enhance T and B cell immunity. Our focus is on synthetic double stranded&#xD;
      RNA, or poly IC and its more RNase resistant form, called poly ICLC, which is available for&#xD;
      studies in humans. The PRRs are the cytosolic helicase, MDA-5, and the endosomal toll like&#xD;
      receptor, TLR3. The Steinman lab has pioneered in mice and monkeys that dsRNA is a superior&#xD;
      adjuvant for T cell mediated immunity relative to several PRR agonists (Longhi et al., 2009;&#xD;
      Stahl-Hennig et al., 2009). A major mechanism is that poly IC is a superior inducer of&#xD;
      systemic type I interferon [IFN], which in turn acts on type I IFN receptors [IFNAR] to&#xD;
      mature immune stimulatory function of dendritic cells [DCs]. An adaptive Th1 type T cell&#xD;
      response is induced, but it is independent of IL-12 and IFN-g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparameter approaches now provide the means to understand adjuvant action. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that DCs undergo changes that are adjuvant-specific and then link innate to select forms of&#xD;
      adaptive immunity. Transcriptional arrays of splenic DCs in mice show that dsRNA induces a&#xD;
      massive response with ~1000 splenic DC genes changing &gt;2 fold in 4 hrs. These changes are&#xD;
      driven primarily via type I IFN, produced systemically via MDA-5 in non-bone marrow derived&#xD;
      cells and then acting on DC IFNAR. IFNAR mediate most changes termed &quot;DC maturation&quot; and&#xD;
      acquisition of immune stimulating activity, e.g., high CD86, CD40, IL-15, and mechanisms to&#xD;
      restore homeostasis. In other words, IFN rather than PRR per se, accounts for the bulk of the&#xD;
      poly IC response in DCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently completed phase I study (protocol MAC-682), poly ICLC was found to be safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated when administered as a single dose of 1.6 mg subcutaneously (s.c.) and&#xD;
      intranasally (i.n.) to healthy volunteers. Preliminary innate immune response data shows,&#xD;
      similarly to preclinical studies in mice, marked upregulation of gene expression in whole&#xD;
      PBMCs following s.c injection of poly ICLC. At day 1 following poly ICLC injection, over&#xD;
      2,000 genes are upregulated (&gt; 1.3 fold change of expression at day 1 versus at baseline) and&#xD;
      these responses are specific to the study drug. Importantly, gene changes are homogenous&#xD;
      among the 8 volunteers who received poly ICLC. The top upregulated genes are&#xD;
      interferon-stimulated genes as it would be predicted since poly ICLC is known to induce type&#xD;
      I interferons. In addition, genes associated with dendritric cell (DC) activation such as&#xD;
      CD40 and CD86 are also upregulated at day 1 after poly ICLC injection, as well as genes&#xD;
      involved in signaling pathways such as IRF 5, IRF 7 and STAT1. Poly ICLC induced secretion of&#xD;
      small amounts of types I and II interferons in plasma and these levels peaked at day 2 post&#xD;
      injection. Lastly, FACS analysis of PBMCs demonstrated that poly ICLC induced upregulation of&#xD;
      activation markers on different subsets of blood dendritic cells. Evaluation of later&#xD;
      timepoints are currently taking place but analyses of samples from day 7 show that genes&#xD;
      involved in the generation of T and B cell responses are upregulated and the early&#xD;
      interferon-stimulated genes are trending down to baseline levels of expression. These results&#xD;
      so far show that subcutaneous injection of poly ICLC led to systemic innate immune responses,&#xD;
      dominated by the induction of type I interferons. Assays have been performed in whole PBMCs&#xD;
      however genetic expression patterns of different subsets of blood leukocytes in response to&#xD;
      poly ICLC remain to be defined. We now propose to extend the analysis of systemic immune&#xD;
      responses after poly ICLC to the characterization of its transcriptional effects on specific&#xD;
      FACS sorted blood cell types, such as DCs, monocytes, NK cells as well as T and B cells. By&#xD;
      analyzing individual cell subsets we expect to better dissect how poly ICLC modulates innate&#xD;
      immune responses that can in turn affect adaptive immune responses when given in combination&#xD;
      with an antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant regulation of interferon genes (both type I IFNs and IFN-gamma) was not evident&#xD;
      by gene array analysis of whole PBMC's, despite measurement of small amounts of both&#xD;
      IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma in plasma. It may be that the platform used was not sensitive enough&#xD;
      to detect regulation of IFN genes and we plan to perform RT-PCR to verify these findings.&#xD;
      However, it may be that when we restrict our analysis to peripheral blood, we miss the early&#xD;
      events that take place following poly ICLC administration. In order to understand how poly&#xD;
      ICLC activates different cell populations, it is important to characterize its&#xD;
      immunoregulatory effects both locally and systemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cutaneous immune environment is particularly amenable to PRR ligand modulation as&#xD;
      evidenced by imiquimod, which acts on TLR 7. Indeed, use of imiquimod to stimulate immune&#xD;
      responses against both infectious agents (HPV) and malignancy (squamous and basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma) has been documented. Migratory DCs, which traffic from the skin to the skin&#xD;
      draining LN, have been shown to cross prime immune reponses to self and viral antigens. As&#xD;
      such, it is possible that skin DCs may migrate into skin draining LNs or blood following poly&#xD;
      ICLC administration. However analysis of blood populations alone will likely miss the window&#xD;
      of immune alteration if these events are occuring locally in the skin. Analysis of genetic&#xD;
      expression and of cellular infiltrates at the site of poly ICLC injection, both early on (at&#xD;
      6 hours) and when skin infiltration is evident clinically (at day 1), will likely add to our&#xD;
      understanding of its adjuvant effects. Genomic expression profiles of skin samples have been&#xD;
      successfully used for disease classification and to predict response to treatment in skin&#xD;
      diseases such as psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma (Zaba L et al., 2007; Suarez-Farinas&#xD;
      et al., 2010). Analysis of genomic expression profile in skin after poly ICLC may prove&#xD;
      useful to understand how innate immune responses are initiated by PRRs ligands and perhaps by&#xD;
      other vaccine adjuvants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies of poly ICLC in humans used the intramuscular route of administration.&#xD;
      Subcutaneous administration of poly ICLC has not been studied extensively and protocol&#xD;
      MAC-682 was the first study to use this route of administration in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Following poly ICLC s.c. injection, 8 out of 8 volunteers developed a well-defined area of&#xD;
      erythema, with some degree of induration and tenderness. This injection site reaction usually&#xD;
      peaks at day 2 and is completely resolved by day 7. Histologic data characterizing this&#xD;
      infiltrate is not available in humans. However, data is available in non-human primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A GLP-compliant toxicology study was performed in cynomolgus macaques to investigate the&#xD;
      safety of anti-DEC-205 (3G9) - HIV gag p24 (DCVax-001) in combination with the adjuvant&#xD;
      Hiltonol (poly ICLC) subcutaneously. In this study, macaques were administered a total of&#xD;
      four doses of 10 mg of anti-DEC-205-HIV gag p24 antibody in combination with 2 mg of poly&#xD;
      ICLC, 10 mg of poly ICLC alone or placebo, over 8 weeks. With regard to reactogenicity&#xD;
      (modified Draize scoring), there was evidence to indicate that poly ICLC (10 mg) induced very&#xD;
      slight and transient injection site reaction in the form of erythema; however, the reaction&#xD;
      was reduced or absent with repeated dosing, indicating that it was of minimal toxicological&#xD;
      significance. A number of gross lesions including dark area, dark discoloration or gelatinous&#xD;
      material were present in the most recent site of administration prior to euthanasia, 1 day&#xD;
      after poly ICLC injection. At least one of these findings occurred in all animals of both&#xD;
      genders receiving 10 mg poly-ICLC. Microscopically, these were associated with hemorrhage&#xD;
      and/or presence of extracellular or intracellular (within macrophages) foreign material&#xD;
      presumed to represent predominantly adjuvant/test article. The lesions were therefore&#xD;
      considered consistent with an expected local reaction to foreign material at the injection&#xD;
      sites. Upon recovery (4 weeks after injection), no macroscopic findings related to the&#xD;
      administration of poly-ICLC were noted. Despite differences between the skin of non-human&#xD;
      primates to human skin, we expect to find similar transient cellular infiltration at the site&#xD;
      of poly ICLC s.c. injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its role in anti tumor and viral immunity mentioned above, topical imiquimod&#xD;
      has been used as an adjuvant in combination with intradermal NY-ESO-1 protein in melanoma&#xD;
      patients. This combination induced dermal mononuclear cell infiltrates in all patients. The&#xD;
      infiltrates were composed primarily of T cells, monocytes, macrophages, myeloid DCs, NK&#xD;
      cells, and, to a lesser extent, plasmacytoid DCs (Adams et al., 2008). Poly ICLC however acts&#xD;
      on different PRRs, MDA-5 and TLR-3, and likely induces secretion of type-I IFNs locally. In&#xD;
      situ immunomodulatory effects of poly ICLC are likely to differ from the effects of&#xD;
      imiquimod. Combining immunohistochemistry evaluation of the cellular infiltrates induced by&#xD;
      poly ICLC along with gene array analysis of its transcriptional effects on whole skin from&#xD;
      the injection site may help elucidate the local events and mechanisms whereby poly ICLC&#xD;
      exerts an adjuvant effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By working with our collaborator, Rafick Sekaly, who has used systems biology to monitor&#xD;
      innate and adaptive responses to yellow fever vaccine and other patient cohorts (Gaucher et&#xD;
      al., 2008), we can understand adjuvant perturbation of immune function. Blood and skin&#xD;
      samples collected from the study volunteers will be sent to Dr. Sekaly's lab at the Vaccine&#xD;
      and Gene Therapy Institute, where transcriptional arrays and high order bioinformatics&#xD;
      analyses will be performed to obtain a global understanding of the innate immune responses to&#xD;
      poly ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is an open label study to evaluate the innate immune responses induced&#xD;
      poly ICLC in healthy volunteers. The objectives of the study are to characterize the&#xD;
      transcriptional changes induced by subcutaneous administration of poly ICLC on different&#xD;
      blood cell types and to characterize the cellular infiltrates and transcriptional changes at&#xD;
      the site of poly ICLC injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis Administration of poly ICLC to healthy volunteers will induce distinct&#xD;
      transcriptional changes in different blood cell types, including different subsets of DCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis Administration of poly ICLC to healthy volunteers will induce distinct&#xD;
      transcriptional changes, and T cell and myeloid cell infiltrate in the skin at the site of&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the innate immune responses to poly ICLC in different blood cell types, including&#xD;
      three subsets of dendritic cells after subcutaneous administration to healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the innate immune responses to poly ICLC at the injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the reproducibility of innate immune responses in whole PBMCs after a second&#xD;
           dose of poly ICLC, in volunteers who participated in protocol MAC-682 and now return to&#xD;
           participate in this proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcriptional arrays in whole PBMCs and in 8 subsets of blood leukocytes (naïve and&#xD;
           memory T, NK, B, monocytes and three different subsets of dendritic cells (BDCA1+,&#xD;
           BDCA3+ and BDCA2+ plasmacytoid DCs) following s.c. administration of poly ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow cytometric analysis of activation markers in different subsets of blood leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of cytokines in the serum and/or plasma following s.c. administration of&#xD;
           poly ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine histology and immunohistochemistry to evaluate cellular infiltrates following&#xD;
           subcutaneous injection of poly ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcriptional analysis of skin samples from study drug injection site and from a&#xD;
           non-lesional site of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcriptional analysis of whole PBMC samples at different timepoints following the&#xD;
           first dose and the second dose of poly ICLC in volunteers who participated in protocol&#xD;
           MAC-682 and are now returning to participate in this proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Screening Questionnaire Potential participants will first undergo pre-screening by&#xD;
      telephone to assess medical history and qualification for the study (Appendix C -&#xD;
      Pre-screening Questionnaire). Potential volunteers will have the opportunity to discuss the&#xD;
      study and ask questions of the study recruiter at this time. Those who are eligible and&#xD;
      interested in participation will attend a screening visit at the Rockefeller Hospital&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, study personnel will answer any questions about the study.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study procedures. To ensure&#xD;
      informed consent, the principal investigator or designee will discuss the following processes&#xD;
      and explanations individually with each volunteer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre HIV-test counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sexually active volunteers should use a reliable form of contraception from screening&#xD;
           until 6 weeks after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteer consents to participate, site personnel will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform complete medical history (including concomitant medication);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a general physical examination including height, weight, vital signs (pulse,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature), examination of skin, respiratory,&#xD;
           cardiovascular and abdominal systems, and an assessment of cervical and axillary lymph&#xD;
           nodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and urine specimens for all tests as indicated in the Schedule of&#xD;
           Procedures (Appendix A);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a pregnancy test for all female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening laboratory test(s) may be repeated at the discretion of the principal investigator&#xD;
      or designee to investigate any isolated abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the screening visit occurs more than 45 days prior to date of drug administration, then&#xD;
      study procedures for the screening visit must be repeated. However, the complete medical&#xD;
      history may be replaced by an interim medical history and the informed consent form may be&#xD;
      reviewed without signing again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration Visit (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study drug administration, site personnel will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer any questions about the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review interim medical history (including concomitant medications);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review safety laboratory data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review the informed consent form administered at screening visit with volunteer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a directed physical examination including vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate,&#xD;
           blood pressure and temperature) as well as an assessment of axillary lymph nodes and any&#xD;
           further examination indicated by history or observation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and urine specimens for all tests as indicated in the Schedule of&#xD;
           Procedures (Appendix A);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a pregnancy test for all female volunteers (blood will be sent stat) and obtain&#xD;
           results prior to drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform baseline assessment of the site of study drug and evaluate and record any&#xD;
           systemic symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer study drug (sites of injection may be upper arms, thighs or buttocks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For volunteers who have agreed to undergo skin punch biopsies, two skin punch biopsies&#xD;
           will be performed: one at a skin site contralateral to the injection site and the other&#xD;
           at the injection site, 6 hours after study drug administration. The two selected skin&#xD;
           sites for biopsy will be cleaned with povidone-iodine and anesthetized by injection of&#xD;
           1-2% of xylocaine. L.M.X.4 (Lidocaine 4%) a topical anesthetic cream may also be&#xD;
           applied. Two punch biopsies of skin (6 mm) will be removed. The wounds will be sutured&#xD;
           and sterile dressing applied. This procedure leaves a small and permanent scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The volunteer will have the option to stay in the hospital overnight the night before&#xD;
           study drug or placebo administration and/or the day of study drug administration for&#xD;
           convenience (&quot;boarders&quot;) or be scheduled as a day patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be closely observed for at least 30 - 45 minutes after drug administration.&#xD;
      Vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature) will be monitored at 30&#xD;
      - 45 minutes after vaccination and recorded. Any local and systemic reactogenicity events, as&#xD;
      well as any other event that occurs, will be recorded at 30 - 45 minutes. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      given a diary card (Appendix B) and asked to record any reactogenicity events that occur in&#xD;
      first day after drug administration and between days 1 and 3 and between days 3 and 7. Site&#xD;
      staff will explain to the volunteer how to record reactogenicity events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical photography will be done to document the injection site and changes post injection,&#xD;
      if any. The volunteer's identity will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 Post-Drug Administration Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of interim medical history and use of concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If symptoms are present, perform a symptom-directed physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess local and systemic reactogenicity as well as any other adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and urine specimens for all tests as indicated in the Schedule of&#xD;
           Procedures (Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For volunteers who have agreed to undergo skin punch biopsies, one additional skin punch&#xD;
           biopsy will be performed 1 day after study drug administration, at the injection site.&#xD;
           The selected skin site for biopsy will be cleaned with povidone-iodine and anesthetized&#xD;
           by injection of 1-2% of xylocaine. L.M.X.4 (Lidocaine 4%) a topical anesthetic cream may&#xD;
           also be applied. One punch biopsy of skin (6 mm) will be removed. The wound will be&#xD;
           sutured and sterile dressing applied. This procedure leaves a small and permanent scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Drug Administration Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to return to the clinic 2, 3, and 7 days after study drug&#xD;
      administration. On those days the following will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of interim medical history and use of concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If symptoms are present, perform a symptom-directed physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess local and systemic reactogenicity as well as any other adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and urine specimens for all tests as indicated in the Schedule of&#xD;
           Procedures (Appendix A);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 2, volunteers will be asked to return to the clinic for an additional assessment of&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity. The following will be conducted at this visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of interim medical history and use of concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If symptoms are present, perform a symptom-directed physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess any adverse events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood and urine specimens for all tests as indicated in the Schedule of&#xD;
           Procedures (Appendix A);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suture removal after optional skin biopsies, if biopsies are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will not be shipped to our collaborator, Dr. Rafick Sekaly until his IRB approval is&#xD;
      accepted and reviewed by Rockefeller's IRB.&#xD;

    <measure>To evaluate the innate immune responses to poly ICLC in different blood cell types, including three subsets of dendritic cells after subcutaneous administration to healthy volunteers.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The variables to be assessed include:&#xD;
Transcriptional arrays in whole PBMCs and in 8 subsets of blood leukocytes (naïve and memory T, NK, B, monocytes and three different subsets of dendritic cells (BDCA1+, BDCA3+ and BDCA2+ plasmacytoid DCs) following s.c. administration of poly ICLC.&#xD;
Flow cytometric analysis of activation markers in different subsets of blood leukocytes.&#xD;
Measurement of cytokines in the serum and/or plasma following s.c. administration of poly ICLC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the reproducibility of innate immune responses in whole PBMCs after a second dose of poly ICLC, in volunteers who participated in protocol MAC-682 and now return to participate in this proposed study.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The following variable will be assessed:&#xD;
- Transcriptional analysis of whole PBMC samples at different timepoints following the first dose and the second dose of poly ICLC in volunteers who participated in protocol MAC-682 and are now returning to participate in this proposed study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate innate immune responses to poly ICLC at the injection site.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The following will be assessed:&#xD;
Routine histology and immunohistochemistry to evaluate cellular infiltrates following subcutaneous injection of poly ICLC.&#xD;
Transcriptional analysis of skin samples from study drug injection site and from a non-lesional site of skin.</description>
