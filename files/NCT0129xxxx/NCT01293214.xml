      Limb transplantation surgery is the transfer of one or more limbs from a deceased human donor&#xD;
      to a patient with single or multiple limb amputation. Hand transplantation is an innovative&#xD;
      reconstructive procedure that has the potential to significantly improve the lives of hand&#xD;
      amputees. The purpose of this study is to develop the best practices for multiple limb&#xD;
      transplantation that will improve the outcomes of future limb transplant recipients.&#xD;

      Limb transplantation surgery, the transfer of the limb(s) from a deceased human donor to a&#xD;
      patient with amputation of one or more limbss, is an experimental reconstructive procedure&#xD;
      that has the potential to significantly improve the lives of amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb transplantation is similar to face transplantation in that the tissues transplanted&#xD;
      include skin, tendons, muscles, ligaments, bones and blood vessels. The transplant team at&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital includes a wide variety of medical and surgical specialties. The&#xD;
      team hopes to build upon the success of their first face transplantation to provide amputee&#xD;
      patients with the significant benefits of limb transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toward this goal, BWH is actively seeking qualified candidates for the limb transplant&#xD;
      research study. We will be studying a small group of people to learn more about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How to advance the science of limb transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How to support and limit transplant rejection issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How people do after limb transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We describe limb transplant surgery as a life-giving procedure because it has the potential&#xD;
      to dramatically improve, that is to restore, both a patient's mental and physical health and&#xD;
      his/her ability to function and integrate in society. However, as with any other type of&#xD;
      organ transplantation, this improvement will require the patient to make a lifetime&#xD;
      commitment to taking medications that suppress the body's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional reconstruction methods are always considered first, but they may provide less&#xD;
      than optimal results for certain patients. There are many sophisticated prostheses that&#xD;
      satisfactorily replace the basic function of a missing limb. However, replacing limbs (in&#xD;
      whole or in part) with prosthetics remains suboptimal in that prostheses do not provide&#xD;
      sensation and do not have a natural appearance. Limbtransplant surgery, however, has the&#xD;
      potential to deliver these desired functional and aesthetic benefits. Functionally, limb&#xD;
      transplant surgery can provide a patient with new limbs that, after extensive rehabilitation,&#xD;
      allow him/her to perform daily activities and, in most cases, return to work. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the ability to restore a near-normal aesthetic appearance of the limb(s) can lead to&#xD;
      tremendous psychological benefits, including elevated confidence and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the time we begin our search for a qualified limb transplant recipient to the continuing&#xD;
      care we provide following surgery, a significant amount of time, expertise and attentiveness&#xD;
      is contributed toward making the procedure a progressive success. Limb transplant candidates&#xD;
      go through an extensive screening process that is likely to last several months. This&#xD;
      screening includes a psychiatric and social support evaluation and a series of imaging tests&#xD;
      to help determine a patient's physical and mental readiness for the procedure. If, upon&#xD;
      completion of the screening process, it is determined that a patient is a suitable candidate,&#xD;
      we will place the patient on a transplant waiting list. We will then begin working with the&#xD;
      New England Organ Bank (NEOB) team to find a donor who matches the recipient's tissue&#xD;
      requirements - for example similar age and correct blood type. This search could take many&#xD;
      months, and, if a suitable donor is not found within one year, we will speak with the patient&#xD;
      to determine whether he/she is willing to continue waiting.&#xD;
