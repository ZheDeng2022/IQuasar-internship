  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will develop and evaluate a community-based approach for disseminating comparative&#xD;
      effective reviews (CERs) about breast cancer prevention to African American women. The&#xD;
      specific aims of our research, as shown below, will target this population because of&#xD;
      persistent disparities in breast cancer morbidity and mortality among this population. Our&#xD;
      primary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate uptake of a community-based strategy for disseminating CERs about breast&#xD;
           cancer prevention to African American women based on sociodemographic characteristics,&#xD;
           beliefs about medical research, and medical history. We predict that participation in a&#xD;
           community forum will be higher among women with greater socioeconomic resources, those&#xD;
           who have a family history of breast cancer, and women who have more positive beliefs&#xD;
           about research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of evidential versus non-evidential content about breast cancer&#xD;
           prevention on psychological and behavioral outcomes that include: knowledge of breast&#xD;
           cancer risk factors and prevention strategies, communication with individuals in their&#xD;
           social and medical network, and distrust of medical research. We predict that women who&#xD;
           receive evidential content that is specific for African American women will report&#xD;
           greater knowledge about breast cancer risk factors and prevention strategies, will be&#xD;
           more likely to discuss breast cancer prevention strategies with individuals in their&#xD;
           social and medical network, and will report greater reductions in distrust of medical&#xD;
           research compared to those who receive non-evidential content.&#xD;
