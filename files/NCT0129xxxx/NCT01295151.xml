  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to fill a clear knowledge gap and provide guidance for&#xD;
      rheumatologists and reassurance to the patient group on a management challenge faced daily in&#xD;
      rheumatology practice. Specifically, it aims to provide robust evidence on the optimal&#xD;
      management of patients with established RA that have failed an anti-TNF therapy (the first of&#xD;
      the biological therapies to be introduced); in particular, the investigators wish to address&#xD;
      whether the currently licensed but non NICE-approved treatment options, TNF-blocking drug or&#xD;
      abatacept, are equivalent to the NICE-approved treatment, rituximab. If so, the intention is&#xD;
      to broaden treatment options and target these specific therapies to disease sub-groups.&#xD;

                  TNFi.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  • This may include patients that have shown a reduction in DAS28 of &gt; 1.2 but&#xD;
                  still demonstrate unacceptably high disease activity in the physician's judgement&#xD;

                  reason for cessation of first TNFi.&#xD;

             arthritis with onset prior to 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients receiving doses of prednisolone &gt; 10mg/day within the 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving intra-articular or intra-muscular steroid injections within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the screening visit.&#xD;

             stroke (within 12 weeks before the screening visit), or any other condition which, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk to participate in the&#xD;

             the start of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients with active current hepatitis B and/or C infection. Patients should have been&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Men whose partners are of child-bearing potential but who are unwilling to use an&#xD;
