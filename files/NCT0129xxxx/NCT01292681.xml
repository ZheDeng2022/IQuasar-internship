      Because of metastatic liver cancer of the colon or rectum, patients will be treated with&#xD;
      cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy). In the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre the&#xD;
      investigators investigate whether the imaging techniques at an early stage of treatment can&#xD;
      predict which patients will have benefited from this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study the investigators use two different scanners: a MR (magnetic resonance) scanner&#xD;
      and a PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scanner combined with a CT (Computer Tomography)&#xD;
      scanner. An MR scanner is a large magnet and looks like a CT scanner which also makes&#xD;
      pictures. But instead of using X-rays the recordings are made with magnetic fields. The scan&#xD;
      consists of a table on which the patient will lie with the head in a half-dome with a camera.&#xD;
      The examination with the MR scan is not painful and not harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PET scan is a type of CT scan that makes (after administration of a radioactive liquid),&#xD;
      a scan of (part of) the body. The amount of radioactivity that is used for the study is so&#xD;
      small that it will not have an adverse impact on the patient. This research is two times&#xD;
      combined with a''normal''CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the MR scan, the investigators can research the oxygensupply, the aggressiveness of the&#xD;
      tumour and the degree of liver metastases that die from the chemotherapy . The investigators&#xD;
      can also, after administration of a MR contrast agent, investigate the blood supply of a&#xD;
      tumor through imaging. If you are treated with the chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine the&#xD;
      investigators can monitor the intake of this agent in the liver metastases. The PET CT scan&#xD;
      tells us more about the metabolism in the liver metastases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a frequently occurring cancer and about half of the patients develop&#xD;
      distant metastases to the liver. Only a subset of patients respond to systemic treatment,&#xD;
      which is potentially toxic and expensive. Therefore, predictive markers are needed to&#xD;
      determine treatment efficacy at an early stage. Preferably, they should provide insight into&#xD;
      the biology of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. In the past it has been shown that several&#xD;
      biomarkers as assessed with PET, MRI and MRS can serve as predictive markers. Response to&#xD;
      systemic therapy depends on several factors: delivery of the drug by the tumor vascular&#xD;
      system; cellular uptake, retention and metabolism; intrinsic sensitivity to a specific drug.&#xD;
      The relative contribution of these factors to response will be different for different drugs.&#xD;
      Since systemic treatment of colorectal cancer involves a combination of drugs, predictive&#xD;
      markers should be sensitive to a range of these factors. In this project we propose the&#xD;
      integrated analysis of noninvasive functional and molecular in vivo imaging methods in order&#xD;
      to predict the response to treatment in patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Tumor vascularity can be assessed by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (DCE-MRI). The fluoropyrimidines FU and capecitabine - which are part of standard treatment&#xD;
      regimens - contain a fluorine atom which can be measured by fluorine-19 MR spectroscopy (19F&#xD;
      MRS). The intracellular uptake and metabolism of drugs is an energy-consuming process.&#xD;
      18F-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) provides information on&#xD;
      glucose uptake and hexokinase activity. Tumor characterization in terms of grade and&#xD;
      aggressiveness may give a relevant approximation to the intrinsic sensitivity of a tumor to a&#xD;
      drug. With 1H MRS the total amount of choline (tCho), a precursor of cell membranes, can be&#xD;
      measured. Tumor cellularity and extracellular matrix composition can be assessed with&#xD;
      diffusion weighted MRI (DWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to obtain data on the biology data of colorectal cancer liver&#xD;
      metastasis, namely tumor vascularization (DCE-MRI), tumor cellularity (DWI), tumor (choline)&#xD;
      metabolism (1H MRS) and tumor glucose metabolism (FDG-PET). These data will be correlated&#xD;
      with the clinical outcome of patients and with drug uptake and metabolism (19F MRS). We will&#xD;
      study the relative contribution of each imaging method to predict the outcome of patients&#xD;
      with colorectal cancer at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do pre-treatment characteristics of liver metastases of colorectal cancer as assessed by&#xD;
           dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), 1H MR&#xD;
           spectroscopy (MRS) and FDG-PET predict treatment outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do early changes (one week after start of treatment) in DCE-MRI, DWI, 1H MRS and FDG-PET&#xD;
           characteristics of liver metastases of colorectal cancer predict treatment outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do 19F MRS parameters of fluoropyrimidine metabolism in liver metastases of colorectal&#xD;
           cancer predict treatment outcome at an early stage (one week after start of treatment)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the relative contribution of each above mentioned imaging method to predict&#xD;
           treatment outcome of colorectal liver metastases? Design: 60 patients with liver&#xD;
           metastases of colorectal cancer treated with fluoropyrimidine-based therapy will&#xD;
           participate to the study. Baseline 1H MRS of the liver will be performed in a session at&#xD;
           3 Tesla followed by DCE-MRI and DWI at 1.5 Tesla. FDG-PET will be added to the standard&#xD;
           baseline CT scan, using our clinical PET-CT scanner. DCE-MRI, DWI, 1H and 19F MRS as&#xD;
           well as FDG-PET of the liver will be repeated one week after start of treatment.&#xD;
           Clinical response will be evaluated after three treatment cycles by FDG-PET-CT. We will&#xD;
           assess the relative contribution of each imaging method as well as the integrated use of&#xD;
           these methods for the identification of predictive biomarkers for response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of this study: Since the response of a tumor to systemic drugs may be highly&#xD;
      variable between patients, a method that predicts the sensitivity of a tumor to treatment at&#xD;
      an early stage would enable individualization of therapy and consequently would protect&#xD;
      patients against the toxic effects of ineffective treatment. Preferably, those predictive&#xD;
      markers should also give us further insight into the biology of colorectal cancer. For this&#xD;
      reason we propose to study a combination of in vivo noninvasive imaging methods which allow&#xD;
      the monitoring of relevant biomarkers&#xD;
