  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall development plan is to show that the combination of tried-and-proven&#xD;
      decongestant/antihistamine ingredients (pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and chlorpheniramine&#xD;
      maleate), plus a very small amount of belladonna alkaloids (.24 mg atropine sulfate) is a&#xD;
      comprehensive, safe and effective B.I.D. drug treatment regimen, indicated for the relief of&#xD;
      symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children 12 years of age&#xD;
      and older. Treated symptoms include nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, itchy nose,&#xD;
      itchy/watery eyes, and post nasal drip syndrome [reduction in tickly cough (acute or&#xD;
      chronic), mucus in the back of the throat, sore throat, and hoarseness]. Considering the&#xD;
      favorable safety and efficacy results of Phase 1 and Phase 2, the purpose of Phase 3 is to&#xD;
      assess and compare the safety and efficacy of the study drug in a larger group comparatively&#xD;
      with a placebo control group. Objectives: A) To report and compare total symptom scores (TSS)&#xD;
      by SAR subjects rating the efficacy of STAHIST vs. placebo in relieving nasal congestion,&#xD;
      rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, and post-nasal drip over the two-week study period. B)&#xD;
      Report any side effects or adverse drug reactions and rate the severity of any incident. C)&#xD;
      Compare and report each symptom score, total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), and post-nasal drip&#xD;
      symptom scores (PND-S) between the two study arms.&#xD;

      Phase 3 clinical trial will be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical Practices and is a&#xD;
      multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of STAHIST (IMP) in 300 adult and adolescent subjects 12-60 years of&#xD;
      age, of either sex or any race with a minimum 2-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      (SAR) and a baseline minimum total symptom score (TSS) of not less than 8 on the S5 Subject&#xD;
      Diary. Subjects will be treated twice daily with IMP or placebo for a period of two weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will visit the study site for at least 4 visits: screening, randomization/study&#xD;
      inception, end-of-week one, final visit, and unscheduled visits as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run In (washout period): Subjects will be required to stop using oral nasal decongestants or&#xD;
      first generation antihistamines for 48 hours, second generation antihistamines and Singulair&#xD;
      for seven days, systemic corticosteroids for 30 days, and nasal or ocular corticosteroid&#xD;
      medications for two weeks. Use of these drugs will also not be allowed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose will be administered at the study site and subjects will be monitored on-site&#xD;
      for one hour following dosing. There will be 24-hour on-call telephone access between&#xD;
      physician/office staff and study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Study Flow Chart will be used to facilitate trial management, record completed tasks as&#xD;
      well as document their time of completion (See Study Flow Chart and Source Documents-Appendix&#xD;
      D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will include monitoring of subject-reported AEs, measurement of vital&#xD;
      signs, and assessment of safety laboratory data. Qualified independent, non-study&#xD;
      administration individuals will be selected prior to the start of treatment for the purpose&#xD;
      of safety monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 subjects will be randomized. Assuming a screen failure test rate of approximately 33%,&#xD;
      approximately 450 subjects will be screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, the CSR will be prepared by the Sponsor, reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by the Principal/Coordinator Investigator before submission.&#xD;
