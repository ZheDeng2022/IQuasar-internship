    <textblock>
      The investigators postulate that nebivolol will be more effective than an equivalent dose of&#xD;
      a comparative BB, specifically sustained release metoprolol succinate, in improving the&#xD;
      availability of NO, lowering blood pressure, and reducing albuminuria with implications for&#xD;
      slowing progression of CKD and cardiovascular protection in this high risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized pilot clinical trial to determine&#xD;
      the relative efficacy and tolerability of nebivolol versus sustained release metoprolol&#xD;
      succinate in improving blood pressure in patients with CKD and albuminuria. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint would be a decrease in asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA). Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      would include a reduction in blood pressure, urinary F2-isoprostanes and albuminuria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of mortality related to&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) disease compared with the general population. Furthermore, a reduced&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR), defined as &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m², has been shown to be&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of hospitalization, death and cardiovascular events&#xD;
      independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Albuminuria, a marker of endothelial dysfunction or kidney damage, or both, frequently&#xD;
      accompanies a reduction in GFR during the development of CKD, and is a well-recognized risk&#xD;
      factor for kidney disease progression. Importantly, the presence of albuminuria has also been&#xD;
      shown to be a powerful predictor of CV mortality independent of other risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of progressive renal&#xD;
      disease and may be a link between CKD and CV mortality. Levels of asymmetric dimethyl&#xD;
      arginine (ADMA), a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, are elevated in patients&#xD;
      with CKD. Elevated levels of ADMA have been shown to correlate with the presence of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and to predict mortality in patients with CKD. In addition, ADMA has&#xD;
      been shown to be associated with progression of non-diabetic kidney disease and lowering ADMA&#xD;
      levels could potentially prevent progressive renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress also plays a fundamental role in the development of endothelial function and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. While markers of oxidative stress are notoriously difficult to&#xD;
      measure, F2- isoprostanes are considered to be reliable biomarkers of in vivo lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation. F2-isoprostanes are a family of prostaglandin F2 isomers produced by free&#xD;
      radical peroxidation of arachidonic acid and have been used as end points in clinical studies&#xD;
      of anti-oxidant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure control is an important factor in predicting CV mortality. However, in&#xD;
      patients with CKD, blood pressure is frequently difficult to control. Angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with or without&#xD;
      diuretics, are the antihypertensive agents of choice in patients with CKD. More recently, the&#xD;
      combination of an ACEI and a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) have been shown to&#xD;
      be more effective than an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in controlling blood pressure in&#xD;
      patients with essential hypertension including those with CKD or diabetes mellitus. However,&#xD;
      even with this combination of medications, blood pressure control in patients with CKD is&#xD;
      often difficult to achieve. The effect of beta adrenergic blocking agents (BB) on lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure has not been extensively investigated in patients with CKD. A randomized&#xD;
      control trial in hemodialysis patients from Italy showed that there was a higher two-year&#xD;
      survival in those receiving carvedilol. Beta blockers are not routinely used to lower blood&#xD;
      pressure in patients with CKD due to the possibility that these medications may have a&#xD;
      deleterious effect on insulin resistance, although this theory has been disproved in a large&#xD;
      clinical trial. A recent review points out that beta blockers are underused in patients with&#xD;
      CKD although they offer many potential benefits in this patient population. This is not&#xD;
      surprising, as sympathetic overactivity is an important contributor to cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and propensity to sudden death in patients with CKD. However, despite the potential benefits&#xD;
      of BBs in patients with CKD their use remains limited because of the potential for inducing a&#xD;
      relatively high rate of adverse effects and the lack of data in regard to their effectiveness&#xD;
      in patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent availability of the third generation beta blocker nebivolol, known to improve the&#xD;
      availability of nitric oxide by reducing ADMA levels, thereby improving endothelial function,&#xD;
      provides an opportunity to more effectively control blood pressure, prevent the progression&#xD;
      of CKD, and also the occurrence of CV events. A reduction in the bioavailability of nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) has been shown to play a significant role in both endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      hypertension. Therefore, increasing the availability of nitric oxide can potentially be very&#xD;
      beneficial. In a comparative study in patients with diabetes mellitus a trial of nebivolol&#xD;
      versus metoprolol showed that metoprolol raised ADMA levels, suggesting a worsening of&#xD;
      endothelial function, whereas nebivolol did not have this effect. Thus, nebivolol would&#xD;
      appear to have a major advantage over other BBs in patients CKD due to diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
      hypertension although this has not yet been systematically studied.&#xD;
