      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preparing a vessel with&#xD;
      photoablation with Spectranetics CVX-300® Excimer laser and laser catheters prior to local&#xD;
      Paclitaxel delivery compared to local Paclitaxel delivery without initial photoablation&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-arm randomized study. The control cohort (PTX PTA group, Admiral&#xD;
      Inpact or Pacific Inpact, Medtronic-Invatec) will be treated with a PTX-coated PTA balloon.&#xD;
      The experimental cohort (Laser+PTX PTA group) will be treated with photoablative atherectomy&#xD;
      followed by a PTX-coated PTA balloon. Subjects meeting the definitions of Rutherford Clinical&#xD;
      Categories 1 to 5 with instent lesions located in superficial femoral artery and the&#xD;
      popliteal artery above the knee joint are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      preparing an instent lesion with photoablative atherectomy prior to local Paclitaxel delivery&#xD;
      compared to local Paclitaxel delivery without initial photoablative atherectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Lesion Percent Diameter Stenosis (%DS) at 1 Year defined as the narrowest point of the&#xD;
      target lesion divided by the estimated native vessel diameter at that location as determined&#xD;
      by the ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary outcomes will be summarized in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Procedural Success: Defined as ≤ 30% residual stenosis following the procedure at the&#xD;
           target lesion, without periprocedural complications, as determined by the ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Major Adverse Event Rate at 30 Days and 1 Year: Defined as major unplanned amputation of&#xD;
           the treated limb, all-cause mortality within 1 year of the index procedure or&#xD;
           clinically-driven target vessel revascularization within 30 days of the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in WIQ Score at 6 Months and 1 Year: Defined as an increase in Walking&#xD;
           Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) score at 6 months and 1 year compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improvement in EQ-5D Score at 6 Months and 1 Year: Defined as an increase in the EQ-5D&#xD;
           questionnaire score at 6 months and 1 year compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Improvement in Rutherford Clinical Category at 6 Months and 1 Year: Defined as an&#xD;
           improvement in clinical status indicated by a decrease of one or more in Rutherford&#xD;
           Clinical Category at 6 months and 1 year compared to baseline, that is attributable to&#xD;
           the target limb (in cases of bilateral disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Improvement in Ankle-Brachial Index at 6 Months and 1 Year: Defined as an increase in&#xD;
           the ankle-brachial index (ABI) at 6 months and 1 year compared to baseline in subjects&#xD;
           with compressible arteries and baseline ABI &lt; 0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Clinically-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) at 6 Months and 1 Year. Defined&#xD;
           as any reintervention or artery bypass graft surgery involving the target lesion in&#xD;
           which the subject has ≥ 50% diameter stenosis in the presence of recurrent symptoms&#xD;
           (i.e. claudication) or ≥ 70% stenosis without any symptoms (i.e. decreased ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patency Rate (Peak Systolic Velocity ≤ 3.5) at 6 &amp; 12 Months: Defined by duplex&#xD;
           ultrasound core lab measurement of peak systolic velocity (PSV) ratio ≤ 3.5 at the&#xD;
           target lesion with no clinically-driven reintervention within the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Alternative Patency Rate (Peak Systolic Velocity ≤ 2.4) at 6 &amp; 12 Months: Defined by&#xD;
           duplex ultrasound core lab measurement of peak systolic velocity (PSV) ratio ≤ 2.4 at&#xD;
           the target lesion with no clinically-driven reintervention within the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Minimum Lumen Diameter at 1 Year: Determined by angiographic assessment of the target&#xD;
           lesion at 1 year by the ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Net Lumen Gain at 1 Year: Defined as the difference between the target lesion MLD at&#xD;
           baseline and 1 year following the index procedure per angiographic assessment determined&#xD;
           by the ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patency Rate at 1 Year: Defined as ≤ 70% stenosis per angiography as determined by the&#xD;
           ACL.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Secondary Patency Rate at 1 Year: Defined as ≤ 70% stenosis per angiography as&#xD;
           determined by the ACL, maintained by repeat percutaneous intervention.&#xD;
