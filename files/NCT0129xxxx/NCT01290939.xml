      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      lomustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known which regimen of bevacizumab&#xD;
      given together with lomustine is most effective in treating patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme in first recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the addition of&#xD;
      bevacizumab to lomustine improves overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma compared to treatment with lomustine alone.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the therapeutic role of bevacizumab as well as the most favorable approach&#xD;
           to treatment optimization for sequencing the combination of bevacizumab and lomustine in&#xD;
           patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution, WHO&#xD;
      performance status (0 vs &gt; 0), steroid administration (yes vs no), and largest diameter of&#xD;
      tumor (≤ 40 mm vs &gt; 40 mm). Patients are randomized at 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Lomustine 90 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 160 mg) + bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2&#xD;
           weeks (at further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).&#xD;
           In the absence of hematological toxicity &gt; grade 1 during the first cycle the dose of&#xD;
           lomustine can be escalated to 110 mg/m² (cap 200 mg) in their second cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (control arm): Lomustine single agent 110 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 200 mg) (at&#xD;
           further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One cycle will be defined arbitrarily (due to the lomustine sequencing) as 6 weeks for all&#xD;
      arms. Day 1 of a cycle will be the first day when medication is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously collected blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGMT methylation status,&#xD;
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, and biomarkers of the VEGF pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their caregivers/relatives complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20) at baseline, at 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      study therapy. Patients also undergo neurocognitive assessment at baseline, at 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      then every 12 weeks after completion of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks.&#xD;

             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile&#xD;
             (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the&#xD;
             start of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients within one year of entering the menopause must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective non-hormonal method of contraception during the treatment period and for at&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males must agree to use an effective method of contraception during the treatment&#xD;

             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; such&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Before patient randomization and study related procedures (that would not have been&#xD;
             performed as part as standard care), written informed consent must be given according&#xD;
             to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations. Informed consent should also be given for&#xD;
             biological material to be stored and used for future research on brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a buffer range from the normal values of +/- 5 % for hematology and +/-&#xD;
             10% for biochemistry are acceptable. A maximum of +/- 2 days for timelines may be&#xD;
             acceptable (one day for post operative MRI).&#xD;
