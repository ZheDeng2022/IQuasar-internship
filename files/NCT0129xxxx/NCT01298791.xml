  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction is affected by physician communication styles and communication at the&#xD;
      bedside. The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial involving both&#xD;
      providers and families to determine if providers sitting down while talking with families,&#xD;
      will improve one aspect of quality care delivered during an inpatient stay as measured by&#xD;
      patient/family satisfaction. The investigators will additionally study the affects of the&#xD;
      intervention on the following outcomes: family assessment of provider communication,&#xD;
      readmission rates, and length of stay.&#xD;
