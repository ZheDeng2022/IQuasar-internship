  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LBH589 is an oral drug that targets the myelofibrosis cells in the bone marrow and induces&#xD;
      cell death by allowing for the expression of certain suppressed genes that are important in&#xD;
      regulating cell survival. Based on laboratory studies, the hypothesis is that this drug will&#xD;
      selectively kill the stem cells responsible for causing myelofibrosis and result in reduction&#xD;
      in spleen size and ultimately restoration of normal bone marrow function.&#xD;
