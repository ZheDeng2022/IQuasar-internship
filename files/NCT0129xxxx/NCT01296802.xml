  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Illicit use of the psychostimulant &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is&#xD;
      considered a major public health issue. In Switzerland, MDMA and congeners are - after&#xD;
      cannabis and cocaine - number three in the ranking of the most popular illicit drugs.&#xD;
      Worldwide, Ecstasy is estimated to be even the second most popular illicit drug, used by&#xD;
      millions of regular users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of animal data, it is likely that MDMA at high or cumulative doses damages&#xD;
      serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the human brain. However, because of a multitude of&#xD;
      methodological problems and a limited number of studies conducted in human subjects, no firm&#xD;
      conclusions can yet be established whether chronic MDMA exposure produces a long lasting 5-HT&#xD;
      deficiency syndrome, with consequent neuropsychiatric risks. To further address the putative&#xD;
      neurotoxicity of MDMA in the human brain, we propose that novel functional assays of&#xD;
      serotonergic neurotransmission may be useful to clarify this issue. We suggest that a 5-HT&#xD;
      challenge study using positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with the 5-HT&#xD;
      releaser dexfenfluramine [(+)FEN] may test the functional integrity of the 5-HT system in the&#xD;
      living human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, in a placebo-controlled study, the 5-HT release capacity of serotonergic&#xD;
      neurons shall be investigated by assessing [18F]-altanserin binding to 5-HT2A receptors&#xD;
      following (+)FEN challenge in former and continuing MDMA users, and age and sex-matched&#xD;
      MDMA-naïve controls. (+)FEN is a potent serotonin releaser without relevant affinity for&#xD;
      5-HT, dopamine (DA) or norepinephrine (NE) receptors, and devoid of acute adverse effects in&#xD;
      man. This makes (+)FEN an ideal pharmacological probe to explore functional integrity of&#xD;
      serotonin neurotransmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim of our investigation is to detect possible impairments of cognitive functions&#xD;
      and to study their relationship to serotonin neurotransmission as indexed by PET. In the&#xD;
      course of the neuroimaging study, the investigators therefore also measure cognitive (e.g.&#xD;
      attention, visual and working memory, learning, executive function) and affective functions&#xD;
      (e.g. anxiety, impulsivity), suspected to be altered due to chronic MDMA use. Using&#xD;
      correlational analyses, the investigators aim to determine if circumscribed regions of&#xD;
      altered 5-HT function are associated with specific impairments in cognitive and/or&#xD;
      behavioural parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that (+)FEN-evoked 5-HT release will discernibly alter availability of 5-HT2A&#xD;
      receptors to [18F]-altanserin, with a pattern revealing the spatially heterogeneous&#xD;
      vulnerability of 5-HT innervations to MDMA. The investigators predict that [18F]-altanserin&#xD;
      volume of distribution (DV) will decline following (+)FEN challenge to a lesser extent in&#xD;
      current MDMA users compared to MDMA-naïve control subjects. On the basis of animal data and&#xD;
      recent neuroimaging studies in humans, the investigators hypothesize that functional recovery&#xD;
      in former MDMA users will be manifest by a normalization or overshoot of the 5-HT release&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our methodology will allow us to quantitatively assess serotonergic functions in the living&#xD;
      human brain. The novel combination of (+)FEN-induced release of 5-HT from intracellular&#xD;
      storage vesicles and subsequent PET assessment of competitively altered [18F]-altanserin&#xD;
      binding at postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors will provide a more direct biological marker of in&#xD;
      vivo serotonin function than has been hitherto available. By applying this new&#xD;
      pharmacological challenge/PET neuroimaging approach to groups of current and former users of&#xD;
      MDMA, the investigators shall be able to gain important new insight in the debated functional&#xD;
      consequences of MDMA use, especially concerning the controversy about the reversibility of&#xD;
      5-HT changes following cessation of MDMA use. Successful completion of this project should&#xD;
      have useful implications for public education and harm reduction with respect to MDMA use,&#xD;
      and may also facilitate the development of possible treatment options for chronic MDMA users.&#xD;

      Introduction: Illicit use of the psychostimulant 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,&#xD;
      &quot;ecstasy&quot;) is considered a major public health issue. In Switzerland, the proportion of&#xD;
      teenage MDMA users has increased continuously in recent years. According to a representative&#xD;
      survey from 2002, approximately 3.3% of the 15-16 year old students in Switzerland have taken&#xD;
      MDMA at least once. Compared with the corresponding data from 1994 (1.8%) and 1998 (1.9%),&#xD;
      the increase of MDMA use among is evident. In another survey from the Swiss Institute for the&#xD;
      Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction (SFA/ISPA) 2.2% of the anonymously interviewed&#xD;
      subjects between 15 to 39 years reported experiences with MDMA. Also worldwide, MDMA has&#xD;
      become one of the most widely used illegal psychoactive drugs, with millions of regular&#xD;
      users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute administration of MDMA produces a rapid and marked release of serotonin (5-HT) via&#xD;
      inhibition and reversal of the 5-HT transporter. Since the late 1980s, studies in non-human&#xD;
      primates have provided convincing evidence that high doses of MDMA cause a substantial and&#xD;
      sustained long-term neurotoxic loss of exclusively 5-HT nerve terminals with an associated&#xD;
      depletion of up to 95% of 5-HT in several brain regions. In contrast, other neurotransmitter&#xD;
      systems such as dopamine or norepinephrine remain undamaged. Subsequently, two studies with&#xD;
      MDMA users have also shown selective decrements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations&#xD;
      of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid, a marker for 5-HT depletion. In contrast, CSF concentrations&#xD;
      of homovanillic acid or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, the major metabolites of dopamine&#xD;
      and norepinephrine, were unchanged. Some imaging studies with serotonergic radioligands&#xD;
      showed reduced 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in cortical and subcortical brain regions of&#xD;
      MDMA users. Moreover, electrophysiological studies have also suggested alterations of the&#xD;
      5-HT system in regular users of MDMA. However, most of these findings in humans have been&#xD;
      strongly criticised for methodological flaws (e.g. small sample sizes or lack of specificity&#xD;
      of the applied radioligands). Consequently, there is as yet no convincing evidence for a&#xD;
      selective serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA in humans. Moreover, the mechanism of MDMA&#xD;
      neurotoxicity in animals is still under debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of these reservations, it has been consistently shown that MDMA users display&#xD;
      dose-related impairments of verbal and visual-spatial memory, and impairments of executive&#xD;
      functions and decision-making cognition. So far, the neuroanatomical basis of these&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits, and their relationship with 5-HT depletion, remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of animal data, it is likely that MDMA at high or cumulative doses damages 5-HT&#xD;
      neurons in the human brain. However, because of a multitude of methodological problems and a&#xD;
      limited number of studies conducted in human subjects, no firm conclusions can yet be&#xD;
      established whether chronic MDMA exposure produces a long lasting 5-HT deficiency syndrome,&#xD;
      with consequent neuropsychiatric risks. To further address the putative neurotoxicity of MDMA&#xD;
      in the human brain, we propose that, in addition to the present receptor mapping studies,&#xD;
      novel functional assays of serotonergic neurotransmission may be useful to clarify this&#xD;
      issue. Specifically, we suggest that 5-HT challenge studies using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) in conjunction with the serotonin releaser dexfenfluramine [(+)FEN] may test&#xD;
      the functional integrity of the 5-HT system in the living human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To overcome impediments of previous imaging studies we propose to use a more direct&#xD;
      approach to assess the integrity of serotonergic function in the human brain. 5-HT2A receptor&#xD;
      mapping with PET and [18F]-altanserin, in combination with (+)FEN challenge, shall be used to&#xD;
      investigate the 5-HT release capacity in current and former users of MDMA in comparison to&#xD;
      drug-naïve control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the comparison of changed specific binding of [18F]-altanserin to 5-HT2A&#xD;
      receptors following (+)FEN-induced 5-HT release will reveal whether chronic abuse of MDMA&#xD;
      leads to functional alterations in the human brain, and if MDMA users face an increased risk&#xD;
      of developing a chronic serotonin deficiency syndrome, possibly associated with cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and depression or anxiety. Our biological marker for 5-HT function in vivo shall&#xD;
      enable us to topographically map regional 5-HT release, and hence to determine if the&#xD;
      hypothesized 5-HT depletion has global or focal consequences for the action of (+)FEN. The&#xD;
      putative functional consequences (affect regulation, cognition, and behaviour) can be linked&#xD;
      to regions of reduced 5-HT transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By investigating current and former MDMA users, we shall assess the reversibility of 5-HT&#xD;
      depletion. Furthermore, our (+)FEN challenge/PET imaging technique may reveal regions of&#xD;
      increased 5-HT transmission due to hyperinnervation of 5-HT dendrites (&quot;sprouting&quot;), as&#xD;
      occurs in MDMA-treated primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of the PET study, we shall also measure cognitive (e.g. attention, visual and&#xD;
      working memory, learning, executive function) and affective functions (e.g. anxiety,&#xD;
      impulsivity), suspected to be altered due to chronic MDMA use. Using correlational analyses,&#xD;
      we aim to determine if circumscribed regions of altered 5-HT function are associated with&#xD;
      specific impairments in cognitive and/or behavioural parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current status of the project and pilot data: The radiosynthesis of the tracer&#xD;
      [18F]-altanserin was established and validated according to GMP guidelines. The study and the&#xD;
      use of (+)FEN and [18F]-altanserin has already been approved by the local ethics committee,&#xD;
      Swissmedic and the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health (BAG). Furthermore, more than 50&#xD;
      present and former MDMA users and 20 drug-naïve control subjects have been screened, and&#xD;
      found to meet general inclusion criteria. We applied our method to four healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers to prove our concept. The PET scans were metabolite corrected and normalised&#xD;
      according to Logans graphical method. The regions of interest-based analysis was done with&#xD;
      PMOD. We found that the apparent distribution volume (DV) of [18F]-altanserin was strongly&#xD;
      decreased in all brain regions by about 11 to 15%. Thus, the proposed method is suitable to&#xD;
      investigate 5-HT release capacity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypotheses: We hypothesize that (+)FEN-evoked 5-HT release will discernibly alter&#xD;
      availability of 5-HT2A receptors to [18F]-altanserin, with a pattern revealing the spatially&#xD;
      heterogeneous vulnerability of 5-HT innervations to MDMA. We predict that [18F]-altanserin DV&#xD;
      will decline following (+)FEN challenge to a lesser extent in current MDMA users compared to&#xD;
      MDMA-naïve control subjects. On the basis of animal data and recent neuroimaging studies in&#xD;
      humans, we hypothesize that functional recovery in former MDMA users will be manifest by a&#xD;
      normalization or overshoot of the serotonin release capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-HT neurotransmission will not be homogeneously reduced in chronic MDMA users, but that&#xD;
      toxic effects will be most evident in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures such as&#xD;
      caudate nucleus and thalamus; these regions are innervated by fine fibers arising from the&#xD;
      dorsal raphe nuclei that are especially sensitive to MDMA neurotoxicity in non-human&#xD;
      primates. Based on results of recent human studies, we furthermore anticipate a dose-related&#xD;
      impairment of cognitive functions, especially of memory and learning, as well as an increased&#xD;
      state anxiety in current MDMA users, followed by improvement after cessation of drug use,&#xD;
      although recovery may be incomplete. Finally, we hypothesize that the degree of impairment of&#xD;
      cognitive functions will correlate significantly with the measured reduction of 5-HT&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: To compare 5-HT neurotransmission in current MDMA users, former MDMA users, and&#xD;
      MDMA-naïve control subjects, 16 subjects per group will be examined with [18F]-altanserin PET&#xD;
      under two conditions. On two days - separated by an interval of 7 days - subjects will&#xD;
      receive, in random order, placebo or 60 mg (+)FEN. Two hours later subjects will be&#xD;
      positioned in the GE PET/CT with the head partially immobilized. Following acquisition of a&#xD;
      low dose CT transmission scan, [18F]-altanserin (250 MBq, high specific activity) will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously as a bolus over 30 sec, and dynamic PET data will be acquired&#xD;
      during 90 minutes as a series of 36 frames increasing in duration from one minute to ten&#xD;
      minutes. Subsequently, subjects will undergo a series of cognitive tasks from the Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Moreover, potential affective reactions&#xD;
      to the 5-HT release, anticipated group differences and the time course of affective reaction&#xD;
      will be assessed by repeated use of psychometric questionnaires, specifically the State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Adjective Mood Rating Scale (AMRS). At intervals during the&#xD;
      extended scanning and cognitive testing, venous blood samples will be collected for assay of&#xD;
      (+)FEN, prolactin and cortisol concentrations by standard clinical procedures. The&#xD;
      neuroendocrine responses will be correlated with the individual PET and neuropsychological&#xD;
      test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and screening procedure: Participants for the study are recruited by means of flyers&#xD;
      distributed at locations associated with the &quot;techno&quot; and &quot;rave&quot; scene in Zurich, with the&#xD;
      help of local associations involved in drug prevention/information and harm reduction.&#xD;
      Experimental groups are matched for sex, age, and cannabis use. Sixteen subjects of both&#xD;
      genders, aged 18 to 35, will be recruited for each of the following three experimental&#xD;
      groups: 1) Current MDMA users (self-estimated lifetime use of ≥ 50 tablets of &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, the&#xD;
      last intake is dated back within the last 4 weeks), 2) former MDMA users (self-estimated&#xD;
      lifetime use of ≥ 50 tablets, but subjects will have stopped using Ecstasy for at least one&#xD;
      year prior inclusion), and 3) MDMA-naïve control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health of subjects will be determined by a general medical examination including&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and standard laboratory parameters. To exclude subjects with current or&#xD;
      past psychiatric conditions, all subjects will be assessed and diagnosed by a clinical&#xD;
      psychologist using the SKID-I. During recruitments, potential subjects will be provided with&#xD;
      extensive background information regarding administration of (+)FEN, neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, PET measures, and associated (radiation) risks, and will then be invited to give&#xD;
      their written informed consent. Special liability is covered by hospital insurance for all&#xD;
      subjects participating in this project. Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion; all female&#xD;
      potential test subjects will have to agree to carry out a pregnancy test before entering the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed history of psychoactive drug use, including type of drugs, first and last use, and&#xD;
      estimated total use will be recorded. All subjects will have to agree to abstain from using&#xD;
      any psychoactive drug (except nicotine and cannabis) for at least two weeks before the first&#xD;
      PET scan. At the beginning of each of the two experimental days, urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected and screened for the presence of psychoactive drugs or metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of the project: Our methodology will allow us to quantitatively assess serotonergic&#xD;
      functions in the living human brain. The novel combination of (+)FEN-induced release of 5-HT&#xD;
      from intracellular storage vesicles and subsequent PET assessment of competitively altered&#xD;
      [18F]-altanserin binding at postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors will provide a more direct&#xD;
      biological marker of in vivo serotonin function than has been hitherto available. By applying&#xD;
      this new pharmacological challenge/PET neuroimaging approach to groups of current and former&#xD;
      users of MDMA, we shall be able to gain important new insight in the debated functional&#xD;
      consequences of MDMA use, especially concerning the controversy about the reversibility of&#xD;
      5-HT changes following cessation of MDMA use. The topographic mapping of regional 5-HT&#xD;
      release following (+)FEN challenge in two groups of MDMA users and in a drug-naïve cohort&#xD;
      will help to assess the contentious issue if chronic MDMA users face the risk of developing a&#xD;
      global 5-HT deficiency syndrome, characterized by cognitive and affective changes. Successful&#xD;
      completion of this project should have useful implications for public education and harm&#xD;
      reduction with respect to MDMA use, and may also facilitate the development of possible&#xD;
      treatment options for chronic MDMA users.&#xD;
