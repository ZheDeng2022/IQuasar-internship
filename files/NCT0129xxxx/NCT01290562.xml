  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with new or recurrent spine metastases are currently treated with low doses of&#xD;
      radiation delivered in up to ten treatments (wide-field radiation therapy). Stererotactic&#xD;
      body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a technique in which high doses of radiation targeted precisely&#xD;
      to the metastases to be treated are administered in a small number of sessions, thus reducing&#xD;
      the radiation damage to the surrounding tissue and areas of the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of spine SBRT as an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional radiation for patients with no prior radiation, prior radiation, and in the&#xD;
      post-operative patient&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spine SBRT is currently being practiced as an alternative to conventional wide-field&#xD;
      radiation in the up-front management of spinal metastases, in the re-irradiation scenario,&#xD;
      and in the post-operative setting. This study proposes to treat patients with a uniform spine&#xD;
      SBRT approach, and collect prospective outcome data as a basis for future randomized trial&#xD;
      design. Preliminary evaluation of our technique has yielded acceptable accuracy in treatment&#xD;
      delivery as compared to the literature, and our practice follows current standards in major&#xD;
      university hospitals performing this technique. Furthermore, preliminary data also suggest&#xD;
      efficacy and safety for patients treated with SBRT for spinal metastases in a previously&#xD;
      radiated field. However, well defined prospective outcomes are lacking in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There a 3 cohorts for this study each with a target accrual of 30 patients. Cohort 1:&#xD;
      patients with spinal metastases and no prior radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: patients with spinal metastases with a history of previous radiation to the&#xD;
      affected spinal segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: post-operative patients with spinal metastases with or without a history of&#xD;
      previous radiation to the affected spinal segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with either 20-24 Gy in one fraction (recommended) or 20-24 Gy&#xD;
      in two fractions, or 20-24 Gy in three fractions. There is also and optional imaging&#xD;
      component of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of spine SBRT in select groups of&#xD;
      patients using image based and symptom based local control criteria&#xD;
