      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to provide clinical data to demonstrate&#xD;
      the safety and activity of a concentrate of nucleated cells from bone marrow aspirate (BMAC)&#xD;
      produced with the Harvest Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate System for treating patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the infusion of bone marrow nucleated cells into the coronary sinus is&#xD;
      safe as assessed by adverse event records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of the infusion of bone marrow nucleated cells on the clinical course of&#xD;
      angina and heart failure as measured by QOL questionnaire, Minnesota Living with Heart&#xD;
      Failure, NYHA and CCS classification and SPECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of the infusion of bone marrow nucleated cells on heart function as&#xD;
      measured by ejection fraction (EF) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) by&#xD;
      ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of the infusion of bone marrow nucleated cells on the area of ischemia&#xD;
      as measured by myocardial SPECT studies and ECHO.&#xD;
