    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of bevacizumab and&#xD;
      carboplatin can help to control recurrent ependymoma. The safety of this drug combination&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ependymomas are glial based tumors arising from the ependymal lining of the ventricular&#xD;
           system and central canal of the spinal cord&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These tumors affect both adults and children and represent approximately 1.2%-7.8% of&#xD;
           all intracranial cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, the standard therapy for newly diagnosed low-grade ependymoma includes total&#xD;
           surgical excision, when possible, followed by radiation therapy. Complete surgical&#xD;
           resection is often not possible because of the location of the tumor and the concern for&#xD;
           damage to surrounding eloquent brain during surgery. The situation is even more critical&#xD;
           for patients with anaplastic ependymomas because of the higher proliferative rate and&#xD;
           greater propensity for tumor infiltration into surrounding normal brain, preventing any&#xD;
           possibility of complete tumor removal by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients with the more aggressive anaplastic ependymoma, chemotherapy is often&#xD;
           administered either before or after the radiation in the hope that infiltrating tumor&#xD;
           cells will be eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extensive experience has been gathered with the use of bevacizumab in other&#xD;
           neuroepithelial tumors such as malignant gliomas. Based on the interesting results&#xD;
           observed in the reported small series of patients with recurrent ependymomas treated&#xD;
           with bevacizumab, as well as on the evidence of vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
           (VEGF)-promoted angiogenesis in these tumors, we designed a phase II study to test the&#xD;
           efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent ependymoma. As results in most types&#xD;
           of tumors have indicated that anti-angiogenesis therapies are more effective when given&#xD;
           in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, in this study bevacizumab will be combined&#xD;
           with carboplatin. The choice of carboplatin is justified by the fact that, as detailed&#xD;
           above, this remains the most effective agent in this disease, and extensive toxicity&#xD;
           data is available for the combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin in a variety of&#xD;
           tumor types, including glioblastomas (GBMs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent low&#xD;
      grade or anaplastic ependymoma. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the&#xD;
           treatment of recurrent low grade or anaplastic ependymoma. This trial is designed&#xD;
           utilizing a Simon optimal two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carboplatin will be given on day 1 of each cycle. Bevacizumab will be administered on&#xD;
           days 1 and 15 of each cycle. The total duration of treatment will be 6 cycles. After&#xD;
           cycle 6, carboplatin should be discontinued, but bevacizumab may be continued at the&#xD;
           discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be monitored for hematologic or serologic evidence of myelosuppression,&#xD;
           hepatic injury, renal injury, and electrolyte disturbances and for clinical evidence of&#xD;
           other toxicity.&#xD;

             definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be&#xD;
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent ependymoma is not mandated for&#xD;
             eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease&#xD;
             post-operatively, a CT/ MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in the immediate&#xD;
             post-operative period or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             consent. If the within 96-hour after surgery scan is more than 14 days before consent&#xD;
             the scan needs to be repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of&#xD;
             imaging and consent, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dosage for&#xD;
             at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy* and must have an interval of&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 42 days from the completion of radiation therapy to study&#xD;

             extensive leptomeningeal disease) but have refused palliative craniospinal&#xD;
             radiotherapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic&#xD;
             radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation&#xD;
             necrosis based upon either positron emission tomography (PET) or Thallium scanning, MR&#xD;
             spectroscopy, or surgical/pathological documentation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B (Beta)-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;

             cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the&#xD;
             patients ability to tolerate this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or&#xD;
