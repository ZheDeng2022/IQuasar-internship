  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational prospective study will evaluate, according o usual local clinical&#xD;
      practice, feasibility of endoluminal revascularization in diabetic patients with type C and D&#xD;
      lesions, according to TASC II Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 300 patients will be treated with usual revascularization procedure. Each patient will&#xD;
      be followed at least 12 months to evaluate clinical outcome and limb salvage interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2000, the Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) stated that patients with CLI&#xD;
      should be treated with revascularization, to provide sufficient blood flow to relieve the&#xD;
      rest pain and heal skin lesions. TASC also suggested that the best procedure should avoid a&#xD;
      general anaesthesia, pose a lesser systemic stress and have fewer serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these considerations pose peripheral angioplasty (PTA) as the procedure of choice, when&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, TASC Recommendations, published in 2000 and confirmed in 2007, use&#xD;
      morphological criteria to define guidelines for the choice of revascularization procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these recommendations, type C and D lesions, which comprise most serious&#xD;
      stenosis and occlusions, affecting long tracts of vessels, are candidate to bypass&#xD;
      interventions, more than PTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This choice was due to the first impression, then denied by BASIL study, that PTA could be&#xD;
      affected by a reduced efficacy on limb salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic Patients are characterized by high prevalence of long occlusions in crural arteries&#xD;
      and this anatomical asset reduces, according to TASC II criteria, the feasibility of Bypass&#xD;
      Graft (BPG) in a large number of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary experience showed the feasibility of PTA in diabetic patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI), with a high percentage of efficient revascularization,&#xD;
      regardless of morphology and number of obstructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate outcomes after PTA procedure also in patients with lesions of 20&#xD;
      cm or longer in superficial femoral arteries or with &quot;long lesions&quot; in subpopliteal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diabetic patients referring to our Diabetic Foot Centre either for foot lesions or rest&#xD;
      pain will be assessed for the presence of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) according to TASC II&#xD;
      Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients, according to usual local clinical practice, will undergo to angiographic&#xD;
      evaluation and, if feasible, to peripheral angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral pulses will be evaluated by palpation and auscultation with a continuous-wave&#xD;
      Doppler technique, the ankle-pressure will be recorded, when assessable (foot arteries absent&#xD;
      or not compressible because of medial calcifications), the transcutaneous oxygen tension&#xD;
      (TcPO2) will be evaluated at the dorsum of the foot and a duplex scanning will be performed.&#xD;
      In all patients with one reduced or absent foot pulse, TcPO2 &lt; 50 mmHg, ankle-pressure &lt; 70&#xD;
      mmHg, significant obstructions present at duplex scanning, an arteriography will be carried&#xD;
      out. In all patient with obstruction &gt; 50% of vessel diameter, PTA will be the first-choice&#xD;
      revascularization procedure and will be performed in the same session of the angiographic&#xD;
      study. In patients in whom PTA will not be feasible, a by-pass operation was considered. The&#xD;
      patients in whom PTA or BPG were not possible, received a therapy with prostanoids or lumbar&#xD;
      sympathectomy plus prostanoids, when possible. In patients in whom the therapies did not&#xD;
      relieve the rest pain or the gangrene was extended above the Chopart joint, an&#xD;
      above-the-ankle-amputation was proposed and performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTA procedure PTA was considered indicated for angiographically documented obstructions&#xD;
      greater than 50% of the vessel lumen. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia&#xD;
      through antegrade puncture of the ipsilateral common femoral artery. If obstructions were&#xD;
      present in the iliac trunk at duplex scanning, the puncture was performed by contralateral&#xD;
      approach. Vessel recanalization was considered successful when direct flow was obtained in&#xD;
      treated vessel, with no residual stenosis &gt; 50% of vessel diameter along the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPG procedure The choice of proximal and distal BPG anastomoses depended on the angiographic&#xD;
      picture and aimed at obtaining at least one patent foot artery. The inflow was optimized,&#xD;
      when possible, by combining femoral-popliteal bypass and PTA of the iliac trunk. Moreover,&#xD;
      also in view of a following distal angioplasty, the distal anastomosis was performed on the&#xD;
      most suitable popliteal or tibial artery segment by using intraluminal clamping and&#xD;
      microsurgical technique. The surgery has always been carried out under epidural anesthesia.&#xD;
      The autogenous saphena vein was employed if present and in good condition. If venous conduit&#xD;
      could not be used, alloplastic prosthetic material (polytetrafluoroethylene: PTFE) was&#xD;
      employed and the peripheral below-the-knee anastomosis consisted of a venous cuff using the&#xD;
      Miller's technique, or &quot;composite&quot; bypass with interposition of distal venous segments. The&#xD;
      absence of an available saphena and an angiographic score of run off &gt;7 on the Rutherford&#xD;
      scale did not exclude any patient, who otherwise could be eligible only for a major&#xD;
      amputation, from a revascularization with distal bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of non revascularized patients Prostanoids (alprostadil-α-cyclodextrine 60-120&#xD;
      μgr/day) were infused intravenously on average 5 days before hospital discharge. When&#xD;
      possible and accepted by the patients, lumbar sympathectomy was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients the pain change was recorded and the TcPO2 and ankle-pressure values were&#xD;
      reassessed 5 days after the PTA, BPG, lumbar sympathectomy and medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb salvage In patients complaining of rest pain without foot ulcer, the disappearance of&#xD;
      pain was considered to be a successful limb salvage. In patients with foot ulcer we&#xD;
      considered limb salvage successful when the ulcer was healed and plantar stand was&#xD;
      maintained, even when achieved by tarsal-metatarsal amputation and the patient is able to&#xD;
      walk without crutches or artificial leg. Conversely, any above-the-ankle amputation was&#xD;
      considered a failure. Limb salvage was considered early when pain disappeared and ulcer&#xD;
      healed in 30 days after hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After hospital discharge All the patients with foot ulcer were examined weekly&#xD;
      until ulcer healing. All patients were provided with extra-deep rocker shoes with soft&#xD;
      thermoformable leather and customized insoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of PTA restenosis was assessed clinically only, based on pain reappearance or ulcer&#xD;
      recurrence. In these situations ankle-pressure and TcPO2 were reassessed and duplex scanning&#xD;
      was performed (22). If ankle pressure and TcPO2 were significantly worse (&lt;15% of the&#xD;
      post-PTA value) and Duplex scanning was positive, the patient underwent a repeated&#xD;
      angiographic evaluation and a further PTA, if possible. Morphological restenosis was not&#xD;
      investigated: in absence of rest pain or ulcer reappearance we do not perform any&#xD;
      revascularization (23), therefore we consider the morphological restenosis clinically&#xD;
      irrelevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPG treated patients were followed with vascular surgery protocol (24). The graft patency was&#xD;
      assessed with clinical examination and ultrasound study at 30 days, 3,6,12 months and&#xD;
      thereafter every 6 months. Pulse systolic velocity and anastomosis morphology were assessed&#xD;
      by ultrasound study. Finally, inflow is compared with pre-operative condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every invasive treatment (PTA, BPG, sympathectomy, surgical operation on the foot) the&#xD;
      written informed consent form was proposed and obtained from the patient.&#xD;
