    <textblock>
      Bakground In Burkina Faso, since the adoption of this new malaria treatment policy in 2005,&#xD;
      several studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of ACTs have been carried out by&#xD;
      different research teams at different sites according to an irregular chronology and&#xD;
      according to different methods. Studies conducted in children 6 to 59 months with supervised&#xD;
      use of ACTs indicate adequate clinical and parasitological response rates varying between 93%&#xD;
      to 98% after correction to the PCR at day 28. With the introduction of seasonal malaria&#xD;
      chemoprevention (SMC) by the Sulfadoxine-Pyriméthamime/amodiaquine combination in almost all&#xD;
      health districts of Burkina Faso, ASAQ is no longer recommended for the treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria in the areas covered by this intervention. In 2017, DHA-PPQ was added&#xD;
      to the national treatment guidelines as a first-line treatment option. The therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy study carried out in 2017-2018 by the CNRFP showed a PCR-corrected treatment failure&#xD;
      rate of over 10% with the AL combination. However, molecular analyzes have not shown the&#xD;
      presence of mutations at position 580 on the PfK-13 gene which is associated with resistance&#xD;
      to artemisinin derivatives. The combination artesunate-pyronaridine (As-Pyr) was recently&#xD;
      added to the WHO Prequalified Medicines List and Essential Medicines List. In 2019, it&#xD;
      received regulatory marketing authorization to be used as a treatment for malaria in Burkina&#xD;
      Faso. Burkina Faso (along with the Niangoloko and Bobo Dioulasso centers) was one of the&#xD;
      countries where clinical trials p ar the As-Pyr association were led. This combination has&#xD;
      been found to be effective and well tolerated in Burkina Faso. The combinations of AL and&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ were observed to be well tolerated in previous efficacy studies. The combinations&#xD;
      DHA-PPQ and As-Pyr could potentially replace AL as first-line treatment in Burkina Faso if&#xD;
      the results of these planned therapeutic efficacy studies continue to show a high rate of&#xD;
      failures with AL. The herein study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of AL, DHA-PPQ and&#xD;
      As-Pyr in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children in three health districts in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, namely the health districts of Banfora, Nanoro and de Gourcy. This study will&#xD;
      provide PNLP and the Ministry of Health with additional data and evidence on the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of these treatments against malaria in Burkina Faso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The primary objective is to assess the clinical and parasitological&#xD;
      efficacy of AL, DHA-PPQ and AS-Pyr in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in&#xD;
      children aged 6 months to 12 years, corrected by PCR on day 28 (AL) or 42 (DHA-PPQ &amp; AS-Pyr).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study settings The study will be conducted at the medical center (CMA of Niangoloko, the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (URCN) and the medical center with surgical antenna (CMA) of&#xD;
      Gourcy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations Febrile patients of both sexes aged between 6 months and 12 years with confirmed&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum mono-infestation who wellcome for an outpatient visit to the&#xD;
      health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures It will be a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-arm study involving three&#xD;
      sites representing the three epidemiological facies of malaria in Burkina Faso. The three&#xD;
      therapeutic combinations (AL, DHA-PPQ and As-Pyr) will be tested in different sites with&#xD;
      different characteristics of transmission and resistance of malaria. Children with&#xD;
      uncomplicated malaria who meet the criteria for inclusion in the study will be recruited and&#xD;
      treated with the combination of AL or DHA-PPQ or As-Pyr. They will be monitored for 28 days&#xD;
      for the AL group and 42 days for the DHA-PPQ and AS-Pyr arm. The follow-up will consist of&#xD;
      scheduled control visits during which clinical examinations and laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      carried out. A total of 1050 children will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late&#xD;
           parasitological failure or adequate clinical and parasitological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The frequency and nature of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The blood concentration of lumefantrine on day 7&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, three-arm study involving three sites representing the three different epidemiological facies of malaria in Burkina Faso.The three therapeutic combinations (AL, DHA-PPQ and As-Pyr) will be tested in different sites with different characteristics of transmission and resistance of malaria. Participants will be treated for 3 days then followed during by 28-days (AL arm) and 42-days (DHA-PPQ and Pas-Pyr). There will be no comparision between study arms, but the for each arm, the efficacy will be measured and compared to WHO critical value.</intervention_model_description>
