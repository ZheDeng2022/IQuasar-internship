  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, observational cohort study. Patients with recurrent angina symptoms and a&#xD;
      cardiac history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with one or more saphenous vein&#xD;
      grafts (SVG) will be eligible for inclusion in this registry. Study objective: to investigate&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes in patients with prior CABG evaluated for SVG dysfunction and&#xD;
      progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Follow-up will be collected through electronic&#xD;
      medical patient records and standardized telephonic assessment at 1, 3 and 5 years follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with a history of CABG with one or more venous bypass grafts and recurrent&#xD;
      angina symptoms who are referred to the Amsterdam University Medical Centers will be screened&#xD;
      for potential inclusion in the registry. Patients will be eligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
      registry after consideration of in- and exclusion criteria. Subsequently patients will be&#xD;
      approached for study participation. Patients can freely withdraw informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study at any time.&#xD;

    <description>Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Grading Scale measures whether patient have angina pectoris complaints, and to what extent patients experienced this. It uses a scale of 1-4 where 1 means angina pectoris (chest pain) only occurs with strenuous, rapid or prolonged exertion, and 4 means angina is present during little physical effort or even during rest.</description>

    <description>Rose dyspnea scale questionnaire (RDS) measures dyspnea complaints, or shortness of breath. It consists of 4 questions about dyspnea complaints in the everyday life of patients. For every patient, a score is compiled of the highest limitation in daily life, resulting in a score of 0-4, where 0 means no dyspnea complaints and 4 means the patient has complaints during no or minimal physical effort.</description>
