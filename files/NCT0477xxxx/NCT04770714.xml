  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In current clinical practice, women with biopsy proven breast cancer can be sent for breast&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) prior to surgery in&#xD;
      order to delineate the extent of a known cancer and / or assess for the presence of occult&#xD;
      secondary cancers. This study seeks to compare the global costs (based on actual&#xD;
      reimbursement rates) of CEM/breast MRI, downstream imaging testing, and diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      in women randomized to breast MRI versus CEM. Secondary goals are to compare patient&#xD;
      preferences for CEM vs MRI and clinically relevant outcomes (e.g. conversion from lumpectormy&#xD;
      to mastecomy).&#xD;

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the global costs of two standard of&#xD;
      care imaging techniques in patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis and planned breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized to either CEM or&#xD;
      breast MRI. The purpose of this study is to compare the global costs (based on actual&#xD;
      reimbursement rates) of initial imaging modality (CEM or breast MRI), downstream imaging&#xD;
      related to breast cancer evaluation, and diagnostic breast procedures in women randomized to&#xD;
      breast MRI versus CEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include assessment of patient's reported satisfaction with the initial&#xD;
      imaging technique received (CEM versus MRI), quantifying differences in health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (as assessed by the patient reported Euro quality of life 5D questionnaire),&#xD;
      rate of conversion from planned lumpectomy to mastectomy, and rate of re-operation for&#xD;
      positive margins.&#xD;
