  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic success rates of indirect&#xD;
      pulp treatment (IPT) performed by combining 2% chlorhexidine gluconate with mineral trioxide&#xD;
      aggregate (MTA) versus IPT performed with MTA in children's vital primary molars. A&#xD;
      randomized, split-mouth design including 40 children aged 4-8 years was implemented. The&#xD;
      study sample composed of 80 primary molars with deep carious lesions. Each child had 1 pair,&#xD;
      one tooth from each pair was allocated randomly either to the 2% chlorhexidine gluconate/MTA&#xD;
      group or the MTA group. All teeth were restored with stainless steel crowns. Follow-up is&#xD;
      carried out to evaluate the teeth clinically and radiographically.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial was performed in a split-mouth&#xD;
      design. Eighty primary molars in forty subjects were randomly allocated that each subject had&#xD;
      one tooth treated with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate and MTA (experimental group), and the other&#xD;
      tooth treated with only MTA (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was held at King Abdulaziz University Dental Hospital (KAUDH), Jeddah. Forty&#xD;
      healthy children with the age range 4- to 8-year-old were included. Each patient had at least&#xD;
      two first primary molars or two second primary molars with deep occlusal or proximal caries&#xD;
      not approaching the pulp indicated for IPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative periapical radiographs of the teeth considered for treatment in the study were&#xD;
      made using extension cone paralleling technique in the x ray machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure was performed in two visits by one operator to allow for the setting of MTA.&#xD;
      Stainless steel crowns were used as final restorations.&#xD;
