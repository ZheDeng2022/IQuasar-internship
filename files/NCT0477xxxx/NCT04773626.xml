    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer remains the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths. For colon cancer alone, 101,220 new cases were projected to occur in&#xD;
      2019, causing51,020 deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of risk factors have been identified that influence susceptibility to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, including a family history, the presence of adenomatous polyps, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), and number of environmental factors of which&#xD;
      diet is the most significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRC differs from many other cancers in that diagnosis of the disease can be made earlier by&#xD;
      screening techniques including colonoscopy. The progression of CRC is well established and&#xD;
      begins with hyperproliferation of the colonic mucosa and adenoma formation and then&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas that vary in metastatic potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression from normal intestinal epithelium to an invasive carcinoma is estimated to&#xD;
      take 7-12 years. With the advent of early screening measures developed over the last few&#xD;
      decades, CRC has become a preventable disease by treating patients with adenomatous polyps.&#xD;
      Nearly 50% of patients diagnosed with CRC develop metastasis within five years. Most commonly&#xD;
      these tumors metastasize to the liver and lungs but may be discovered in many other sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant improvements in both prevention and screening over the last twenty years,&#xD;
      about 36,500 (36%) of such cases are still being diagnosed in stage III, with regional lymph&#xD;
      node involvement (LN+, N1a-b, N2a-b) or tumor deposits (TD+, N1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor deposits (TDs) or mesenteric tumor satellites were firs described in rectal carcinoma&#xD;
      by Gabriel et al at St. Mark's Hospital in 1935. Subsequently, TDs have been detected in&#xD;
      various malignancies other than colorectal carcinoma, including gastric, pancreatic,&#xD;
      gallbladder, and bile duct carcinomas . Over the years, there is much debate about the&#xD;
      genesis, histopathologic characteristics, and prognostic value of TDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDs are associated with advanced colorectal carcinoma stage and poor prognosis, with variable&#xD;
      outcome due to different definitions of TDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the 5th edition, published in 1997, TNM classification did not consider microscopic&#xD;
      TDs to be lymph node metastases (LNMs), and they classified them as discontinuous extension&#xD;
      in the T category .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 5th TNM edition the 3-mm rule was introduced, which stated that TDs &gt;3mm in diameter&#xD;
      were LNMs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 6th edition published in 2002, TDs were classified based on the contour of the&#xD;
      deposit. A TD with a smooth contour was considered as LMN, whereas a TD with an irregular&#xD;
      contour was considered as venous invasion (V1/2) or lymphatic invasion (L1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8th TNM Edition clarified that the presence of TDs does not change the primary tumor T&#xD;
      category, but changes the node status (N) to pN1c if all regional lymph nodes are negative on&#xD;
      pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies of rectal cancer patients, it should be taken into account that TDs may indicate&#xD;
      microscopic residuals of the main tumor after neoadjuvant chemo radiation and not&#xD;
      discontinuous foci of tumor as indicated in the classic definition of TDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of TDs was an independent adverse prognostic factor that was significantly&#xD;
      associated with shorter disease-free survival independent of lymph node status in stage IV&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients who underwent simultaneous resection for synchronous colorectal&#xD;
      liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After chemo-radiotherapy, rectal cancer is usually associated with small clusters of tumor&#xD;
      cells or isolated tumor cells, scattered within or outside the rectal wall which are often&#xD;
      associated to fibrosis and chronic inflammation, as well as other radiation induced changes.&#xD;
      The prognostic significance of TDs in rectal adenocarcinoma following neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiation has not yet been determined, although this remains an important issue given&#xD;
      that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation have more advanced tumors and the&#xD;
      highest risk of distant and local recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDs were associated with higher rates of lymph node involvement, distant metastases and&#xD;
      reduced survival; more over TDs are associated with aggressive characteristics, including&#xD;
      higher rates of positive circumferential resection margins.&#xD;
