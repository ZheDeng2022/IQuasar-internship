    <measure>Amygdala activation during stress</measure>
    <time_frame>fMRI will begin 2 hours post-drug administration and will last no more than 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete 1 fMRI scan following CBD administration and another fMRI scan following placebo administration. During each scan, participants will complete the Emotion Regulation Task (ERT). The first primary outcome measure will be amygdala response during the negative emotionality contrast of the ERT during their CBD relative to their placebo scan.</description>

    <time_frame>fMRI will begin 2 hours post-drug administration and will last no more than 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete 1 fMRI scan following CBD administration and another fMRI scan following placebo administration. During each scan, participants will complete the Cyberball Task.

    <description>Participants will complete 1 fMRI scan following CBD administration and another fMRI scan following placebo administration. During each scan, participants will complete the Emotion Regulation Task (ERT). The first secondary outcome measure will be participants' pattern of seed-based functional connectivity with the amygdala during the negative emotionality contrast of the ERT during their CBD relative to their placebo scan.</description>

    <ipd_description>Because this is a pilot project, we do not plan to share to data. Pending the results of the pilot project, we hope to pursue funding for a larger study to examine sex differences in neural response to CBD more directly (including both male and female participants) and on a larger scale (larger sample than pilot project), and we will plan to make these data available to other researchers.</ipd_description>
