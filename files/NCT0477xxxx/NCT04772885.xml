  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KT-474 is an oral heterobifunctional small molecule IRAK4 degrader being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)/toll-like receptor (TLR)-driven&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory diseases. This first-in-human (FIH) study will characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of a single ascending dose and&#xD;
      multiple ascending doses of KT-474 in healthy volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      (AD) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The effects of food on the absorption of KT-474 will&#xD;
      also be evaluated in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, single and multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose trial of KT-474 that will characterize the safety, PK and PD of orally&#xD;
      administered KT-474 after a single dose (Part A) and after repeated dosing first in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers (Part B) and then in patients with AD or HS (Part C). Initially, a dose&#xD;
      range of KT-474 in single ascending dose (SAD) escalation cohorts will be explored in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Up to two single dose cohorts of healthy subjects is also planned to understand&#xD;
      food effects (FE) on the PK of KT-474. Enrollment of healthy subjects into 2-week multiple&#xD;
      ascending dose (MAD) escalation cohorts will be initiated once sufficient safety and PK data&#xD;
      from multiple SAD cohorts are available to inform the safe starting dose for the 2-week MAD&#xD;
      portion of the study. After the MAD portion in healthy subjects is completed, the safety, PK,&#xD;
      and PD of a dose of KT-474 that was found to be safe in healthy subjects when administered&#xD;
      for 2 weeks will then be evaluated in AD or HS subjects for two weeks of dosing.&#xD;

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
