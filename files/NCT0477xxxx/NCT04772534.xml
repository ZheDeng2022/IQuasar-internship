      The primary objective of this study is the estimation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) 6,&#xD;
      11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 seroconversion at 1 month post last dose (Month 7)&#xD;
      following 3 doses and 2 doses of the 9vHPV vaccine. No hypothesis will be tested since this&#xD;
      study is an estimation-only study.&#xD;

    <description>Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA). Seroconversion is defined as changing serostatus from seronegative at Day 1 to seropositive at 4 weeks post last vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event</measure>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The percentage of participants with solicited injection-site AEs (erythema/redness, pain and swelling) will be assessed.</description>

    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one that results in death, is life threatening, or requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event that may require medical intervention. An SAE that is judged by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine is defined as a vaccine-related SAE.</description>
