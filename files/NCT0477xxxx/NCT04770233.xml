      The project is a pragmatic registry-based RCT aiming to investigate ACL injury treatment.&#xD;
      Study results will help fill knowledge gaps, facilitate shared decision making and strengthen&#xD;
      patient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be randomized to (1) early ACL surgery followed by rehabilitation or&#xD;
      (2) active rehabilitation with optional delayed surgery if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and data collection is conducted through the Norwegian National Knee Ligament&#xD;
      Registry (NNKLR) which is a well established population based ACL registry. Participation is&#xD;
      based on informed consent to participate in the NNKLR and the registry-based RCT. The study&#xD;
      uses the platform and outcome measures of the NNKLR to collect and measure data. The data&#xD;
      will be stored as usual in the NNKLR, but RCT specific data will be exported for analysis and&#xD;
      stored inTjenester for sensitive data (TSD). Data collected in NNKLR are: patient data (age,&#xD;
      height, weight, activity level, smoking-and snuff habits), knee injury data (injury data,&#xD;
      injury mechanism, additional knee injury), treatment (non-operative or ACL reconstruction,&#xD;
      reoperation), surgical details (operation date, antibiotics, anti-coagulants, graft type and&#xD;
      size, approach for femoral tunnel, additional injury and additional surgical procedure) and&#xD;
      patient reported knee function at baseline, 2, 5 and 10 years. Also, x-rays and MRIs will be&#xD;
      imported for included patients and stored in TSD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite years of research on treating ACL injuries, it remains uncertain who should undergo&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery and who should not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project aims to provide definitive answers to these important clinical questions&#xD;
      affecting more than 4,000 patients each year in Norway. We will provide this information by&#xD;
      conducting a large comparative effectiveness trial of standard treatments for ACL deficiency.&#xD;
      This RCT exploit the infrastructure of the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry (NNKLR),&#xD;
      which uniquely include non-surgically treated ACL-tears and has almost complete coverage of&#xD;
      surgical reconstructions. Our multi-center register-RCT design considerably reduces costs and&#xD;
      enables us to more rapidly include many more patients. Consequently, the design and study&#xD;
      size will give the results excellent external validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery or not? It is estimated that 50% of patients with an ACL tear are treated surgically&#xD;
      with a reconstruction.[1, 2] The majority of patients are young and active.[3] The general&#xD;
      consensus in Scandinavia is that patients who manage to regain acceptable knee function after&#xD;
      active rehabilitation alone should not initially have surgery. This treatment algorithm is&#xD;
      supported mainly by only one high-quality randomized controlled trial.[4, 5] Prospective&#xD;
      studies have reported that the functional recovery, the long term patient outcome and the&#xD;
      radiographic sign of osteoarthritis are similar between patients treated surgically or&#xD;
      non-surgically.[6-8] However, conclusion about cause and effect cannot be made due to the&#xD;
      study designs. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is a low-quality evidence that&#xD;
      there was no difference between surgical and non-surgical treatment, and studies with high&#xD;
      external validity is lacking.[9] In the debate of early surgery or not, the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent meniscal and chondral injury in an unstable knee is often highlighted by promoters&#xD;
      for early surgery. However, the studies behind this argument reports on the correlation&#xD;
      between the timing of surgery and concomitant meniscal and cartilage injuries rather than on&#xD;
      whether the initial treatment chosen was surgical or non-surgical.[10] This introduces a&#xD;
      selection bias as a patients having surgery late may not be representative of all&#xD;
      non-surgically treated patients. The findings in a systematic review on this topic by authors&#xD;
      in the project group high-light that the uncertain estimate of new meniscal tears after ACL&#xD;
      injury should not guide clinical practice for all patients.[11] Even though joint stability&#xD;
      often is achieved with surgery, the rate of return to pre-injury activity level after surgery&#xD;
      is reported less than 50%, and no consistent results in reduction of the risk of later&#xD;
      osteoarthritis have been shown.[12] Admittedly, the risk of serious complications after ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction is in general low, however still potentially devastating to the knee&#xD;
      function.[13, 14]&#xD;
&#xD;
      About the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Register&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NNKLR was established in 2004 as the worldÂ´s first national cruciate ligament&#xD;
      register[15]. The NNKLR assesses the outcome based on the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Outcome Score (KOOS) which is the gold standard validated patient reported outcome measure&#xD;
      (PROM) [16] and by recording revision surgeries or other surgeries to the index knee. Since&#xD;
      2004 cruciate ligament reconstructions performed in Norway have been reported to the register&#xD;
      with subsequent registration of revision surgeries and with input of PROM at 2, 5 and 10&#xD;
      years postoperatively. Just below 3000 patients are included yearly in the register. This has&#xD;
      provided a unique resource for research and quality assessment, detecting inferior surgical&#xD;
      procedures and providing prognostic information to guide practice.[17] Registries have had&#xD;
      two major weaknesses limiting overall research impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-operatively treated injuries have not been included. This selection bias severely&#xD;
           skews the evidence base for treatment guidelines.[17, 18,19] The NNKLR has recently&#xD;
           piloted a project trying to mend this weakness.[20] The license for NNKLR issued by the&#xD;
           Norwegian Data Inspectorate has been amended to allow for inclusion of patient at the&#xD;
           time of ACL injury, allowing for follow-up within the register for the patients not&#xD;
           undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The design is fundamentally that of a prospective cohort. This does not allow&#xD;
           researchers to make firm conclusions about differences in outcome between treatments.&#xD;
           This major weakness of all national ACL registers is due to the inherent bias of being&#xD;
           mainly observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Register-RCT The classic RCT remedies confounding bias by randomly allocating patients to&#xD;
      each treatment ensuring equal distribution of measured and, importantly, unmeasured&#xD;
      characteristics. However, RCTs often have strict inclusion and exclusion criteria leading to&#xD;
      diminished generalizability to the general population. One may ask what good are RCTs if they&#xD;
      can answer questions regarding only a tiny fraction of the population.[21] They are often&#xD;
      expensive and time-consuming, limiting the possible amount of patients included. Recently, as&#xD;
      an answer to these limitations, the implementation of randomization into registers has been&#xD;
      proposed, and termed &quot;the register-based RCT&quot; (R-RCT).[22] The promise of this approach has&#xD;
      been highlighted in high-ranking journals as the &quot;next disruptive technology in clinical&#xD;
      research&quot;.[21] Simply put, patients are included in a quality register, and the treatment is&#xD;
      randomized. The outcome data is collected automatically through the register, cutting the&#xD;
      costs and simplifying the follow-up. Analysis of the subsequent register data can conclude on&#xD;
      effect estimates between treatments with the same level of evidence as those from regular&#xD;
      RCTs, only with a greater external validity. The feasibility R-RCTs has been shown mainly in&#xD;
      trials relating to interventions in cardiology and has only very recently been used in&#xD;
      orthopedic trauma surgery[23-25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment problems has been highlighted as a challenge in a previous RCT on ACL&#xD;
      treatment.[26] The R-RCT mediates this by facilitating multi-center collaboration to ensure&#xD;
      rapid inclusion of patients in the proposed trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses, aims and objectives The overall aim of this project is to assess the effect of&#xD;
      surgical treatment and non-surgical treatment of patients with a complete tear of the&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament as assessed with the KOOS which is the commonly accepted gold&#xD;
      standard patient reported outcome measure for knee injuries [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives Investigate the outcome of surgical and non-surgical treatment of&#xD;
      ACL-injury through a multi-center register-based RCT with outcome collection of primary&#xD;
      endpoints solely performed by the NNKLR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project methodology The NNKLR follows the patients until 10 years and this is the minimum&#xD;
      time the project will follow the included patients. We include in the consent the possibility&#xD;
      to contact all patients after the regular follow-up by the NNKLR as we plan to follow-up&#xD;
      patients until 20 years after the injury and we also include in the consent the possibility&#xD;
      of linking to for example the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project arrangements, method selection and analyses All participating centers already care&#xD;
      for patients with cruciate ligament injuries and have all necessary equipment for this. The&#xD;
      data collection at inclusion will be solely through a secure web-based system (Medisinsk&#xD;
      Registreringssystem (MRS)- Helse Midt-Norge IT). During the planning and running of the trial&#xD;
      the research group will work closely with the NNKLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The NNKLR is a national quality registry. Reporting surgically treated patients to&#xD;
      the register is mandatory for the surgeon. The surgeon report patient-specific data and&#xD;
      surgical details on either a paper form or through a secure web-based interface at the time&#xD;
      of inclusion. Information on implants used at surgery is registered with stickers provided by&#xD;
      the manufacturers attached on the paper form, and by scanning the barcodes providing the same&#xD;
      information when reporting electronically. Identical patient-specific data is collected at&#xD;
      inclusion for the patients treated non-surgically. The web-based interface is maintained by&#xD;
      the Medical Register System in the IT department of Central Norway Regional Health Authority.&#xD;
      The NNKLR will be the main source of outcome collection in the planned trials. The patient&#xD;
      reports PROMs at the time of inclusion and at 2-, -5- and -10-year follow-up, either through&#xD;
      a paper-form or electronically. Clinical follow-up with subsequent primary or revision ACL&#xD;
      reconstructions or other knee surgery to the index or contralateral knee are to be reported&#xD;
      to the register by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study design is a register-based multi-center RCT. The structured&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be identical in both groups and follow standardized goal-oriented&#xD;
      guidelines.[27, 28] Randomization strategy: Randomization will be performed when the patients&#xD;
      are included at first visit through the NNKLR embedded randomization module developed and&#xD;
      implemented in this project. We will utilize centralized randomization stratified by&#xD;
      participating centers[29, 30] Allocation concealment will be secured by requiring&#xD;
      registration into the NNKLR and the R-RCT before allocation is revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The sample size calculation will be based on a standard deviation of&#xD;
      20 for KOOS Quality of Life, a 90 % statistical power to detect a minimally clinically&#xD;
      relevant difference of 10 between the treatment groups, an alpha level of 0.05 and allowing&#xD;
      for a 20% drop-out rate.[5] In the non-surgically vs. surgical treatment RCT without&#xD;
      stratification for age and activity level this will require at least 230 patients. Allowing&#xD;
      for sub-group analysis on activity levels based on best estimates will increase sample-size&#xD;
      to approximately 328 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: All subjects randomized will be included in the analysis. Investigation&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint will be performed using analysis of covariance for the different&#xD;
      treatment groups, stratified by site and adjusted and unadjusted for baseline&#xD;
      KOOS-scores.[31] Both intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses will be performed. An&#xD;
      absence of a clinically relevant difference will be assumed if the confidence interval of the&#xD;
      difference includes differences of less than 10 units between groups. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be analyzed by analysis of covariance (KOOS) and chi-square tests (return to pre-injury&#xD;
      activity level). Additional data collected outside NNKLR is clinical imaging (MRI/x-rays)&#xD;
      taken in the course of treatment. Resource use (health economy) will be analysed through&#xD;
      linkage to other registers (eg. NPR, IPLOS, Reseptregister) as stated in the consent and if&#xD;
      needed supplemented with data from the electronic patient record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding The project is fully funded through Program for klinisk behandlingsforskning&#xD;
      (KLINBEFORSK) with a grant for the period of 2020 through 2024. There are no financial&#xD;
      interests involved for neither the researchers nor the patients in this RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      User involvement We have teamed up with a named user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations and data handling All participants must give written informed consent&#xD;
      to be included into both the NNKLR an the register-based RCT. The NNKLR has a standing&#xD;
      license from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority ref.nr. 16/01130-3/CDG covering both&#xD;
      non-operatively treated and surgically treated patients included in the registry. The&#xD;
      protocol for the register-based RCT and user-approved consent have been reviewed and approved&#xD;
      the Regional Committees on Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC SÃ).Before patient&#xD;
      inclusion, the Ethical Boards at the including centres will need to review and approve the&#xD;
      protocol (currently approved at Akerhus University Hospital).&#xD;
