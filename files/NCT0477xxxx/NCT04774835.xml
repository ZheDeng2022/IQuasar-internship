  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes different designs with Aim 1 being a cluster randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      to investigate the use of HIV self-testing (HIVST) as a mode of HIV testing in Western Kenya&#xD;
      in addition to the standard of care, assisted partner services (aPS). Aim 2 includes focus&#xD;
      group discussions, in-depth interviews, semi-structured interviews, direct observation of&#xD;
      facility infrastructure and clinic procedures, and data extraction from facility and&#xD;
      county/national databases and expenditure reports to study acceptability, costs, and&#xD;
      implementation aspects of HIVST within the aPS framework.&#xD;

    <description>aPS will be offered to sexually active men and women who test HIV seropositive at the study sites by facility staff supported by aPS advisors. Those accepting aPS will be asked to provide names and contact information (phone numbers; home and work addresses) for their sexual partners, and these partners will be contacted, notified anonymously of the HIV exposure, and offered HIV self-testing by HTS counselors working at the facilities. Any partner who tests HIV seropositive will receive assistance linking to care and registering in an HIV comprehensive care clinic. They will also receive aPS so that their partners can be notified and HIV tested. Follow-up of index clients will continue after testing through HTS locations and all partners will be followed to determine HIV testing and treatment outcomes.</description>
