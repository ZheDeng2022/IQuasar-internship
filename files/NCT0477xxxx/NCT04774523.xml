  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIO|Adapt study is designed to provide evidence for the clinical benefit of the CRT AutoAdapt&#xD;
      feature. This feature provides continuous adaptation of AV delay and biventricular pacing&#xD;
      modality. However, additional clinical data on the short and mid-term improvement of CRT-D&#xD;
      patients by the CRT AutoAdapt feature are needed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The magnitude of clinical and hemodynamic benefit of CRT varies significantly among its&#xD;
      recipients. Many studies report that approximately one-third of the implanted population show&#xD;
      no clinical improvement at follow-ups. There are many clinical factors that are associated&#xD;
      with the CRT response and the grade of benefit, such as type of cardiomyopathy, severity of&#xD;
      electrical conduction abnormalities, dyssynchrony, and scar burden. In addition, there are&#xD;
      device-related factors such as lead location, insufficient ventricular pacing percentage&#xD;
      (%V), and suboptimal atrial-ventricular (AV) and ventricle- ventricle (VV) timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main finding in such CRT non-responders is a suboptimal AV-timing (47%). The optimization&#xD;
      of AV and VV intervals during biventricular (BiV) pacing is an option to maximize the&#xD;
      positive effects of CRT, by taking advantage of the full atrial contraction for optimal&#xD;
      filling of the ventricles. Optimization is usually accomplished by using echocardiography or&#xD;
      other methods. However, such methods are time consuming for the hospitals and may not provide&#xD;
      a benefit for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common pacing mode for CRT therapy is BiV pacing, but many acute and chronic&#xD;
      randomized clinical studies have demonstrated that left-ventricular (LV) pacing can be at&#xD;
      least as effective as BiV pacing. In patients with sinus rhythm and normal atrioventricular&#xD;
      (AV) conduction, pacing the left ventricle only with an appropriate AV interval can result in&#xD;
      an even superior LV and right ventricular (RV) function compared with standard BiV pacing. LV&#xD;
      pacing has been proposed as an alternative approach to apply cardiac resynchronization as it&#xD;
      has been shown that LV pacing induces short-term hemodynamic benefits compared to BiV pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different algorithms have been developed by different manufactures to provide continuous&#xD;
      automatic CRT optimization, allowing a more physiologic ventricular activation and greater&#xD;
      device longevity in patients with normal AV conduction due to the reduction of unnecessary RV&#xD;
      pacing. Studies with the Medtronic Adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy (aCRT)&#xD;
      algorithm, that provides automatic ambulatory selection between synchronized LV or BiV pacing&#xD;
      with dynamic optimization of atrioventricular and interventricular delays, have shown that&#xD;
      the algorithm is safe and as effective as BiV pacing with comprehensive echocardiographic&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRT AutoAdapt feature by BIOTRONIK optimizes the CRT therapy settings of the device&#xD;
      automatically and continuously. This algorithm adjusts the AV delay and sets the ventricular&#xD;
      pacing configuration to BiV or LV. The settings are based on intracardiac conduction times,&#xD;
      which are measured every 60 seconds to select the optimal configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to show non-inferiority of this feature compared to standard&#xD;
      echo-based optimization with regard to clinical benefit.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the AutoAdapt group undergo the echo-based assessment of the acute hemodynamic effect of the CRT AutoAdapt feature.&#xD;
Three steps must be followed:&#xD;
Standard AV programming: perform echo for AoVTI assessment.&#xD;
Echo-optimized AV programming: perform standard echo-based AV-optimization (Ritter method or iterative method, according to routine at investigational site); measure AoVTI at optimized setting.&#xD;
AutoAdapt optimized programming: The system allows different programming options for the parameter 'Adaptive AV reduction'. The nominal value is 0.7, but it can be modified to different values ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. The AoVTI shall be measured at three settings of the &quot;Adaptive Av reduction&quot; parameter: at standard setting, at 0.5 and at 0.9.</description>
