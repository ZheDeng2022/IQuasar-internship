  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan works in imaging patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may find and diagnose prostate&#xD;
      cancer and improve monitoring of treatment response.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) then undergo PET/CT over&#xD;
      2-3 minutes per bed position at baseline. Patients receiving systemic therapy undergo an&#xD;
      additional 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan 6 weeks after initiating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study, patients are followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in planned management strategy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months post-scan 1</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using conventional imaging with executed management strategy incorporating information from first (scan 1) 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), regardless of treatment modality. Will be expressed as the percentage of total patients imaged in which change in management occurred, regardless of treatment modality. The rate of change in management will also be estimated within each group (initial staging, biochemical recurrence, and pre/post treatment). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be used to express precision of the estimates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Major change in management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years post-scan</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as a change in treatment modality (e.g. change from systemic therapy to radiation therapy). Will compare by planned management strategy using conventional imaging and executed management strategy incorporating information from scan 1 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, regardless of treatment modality. 95% CIs will be used to express precision of the estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minor change in management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years post-scan</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as changes within a treatment modality (e.g. change in planned radiation field or change in systemic therapy regimen to be used for a patient already planned to receive systemic therapy). Defined as a post-scan change within a treatment modality (e.g. alteration to salvage radiation field). 95% CIs will be used to express precision of the estimates.</description>

    <measure>68Ga-PSMA-11 standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax)</measure>

    <measure>Change in 68Ga-PSMA-11 SUVmax</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks after systemic therapy initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Expressed as percent (%) change from scan 1. Will be determined and correlated with change in prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for measurable lesions, as assessed using Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficient. The relationship of changes in SUVmax and SULpeak with clinical response categories will also be assessed graphically and summarized overall with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Clinical response categories will be defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease and determined by clinical assessment, conventional imaging, and biopsy (if available). The subgroup analysis of this group will be exploratory. Changes in uptake will be compared among all groups using ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test and between pairs of groups using the t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-scan</time_frame>
    <description>Will be performed only in patients with biopsy or surgical resection specimens. Lesions on each scan will be categorized as positive or negative. Pathology results will also be scored as positive or negative based on the clinical interpretation. These results will then be used to calculate accuracy with 95% CIs. CIs will be calculated using the non-parametric bootstrap with resampling by patient to account to dependence between lesions from the same patient.</description>
