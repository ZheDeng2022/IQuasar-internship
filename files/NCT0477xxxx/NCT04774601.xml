      Chronic liver disease is a significant health issue among children and it can result in&#xD;
      fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure. Since the prognosis and monitoring of these diseases&#xD;
      are different from each other, The term chronic liver disease (CLD) implies a long standing&#xD;
      irreversible change in the hepatic structure that may end in complications like cirrhosis&#xD;
      leading to premature death. While liver needle biopsy is still recognised to be the gold&#xD;
      standard for the assessment of liver fibrosis in the diagnosis and follow-up of chronic liver&#xD;
      diseases, researchers tend to study non-invasive methods in the determination of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis, as liver needle biopsy is an invasive, painful and expensive procedure, which can&#xD;
      cause possible sampling errors and potential complications , Conventional ultrasonography is&#xD;
      preferred for the investigation of chronic liver diseases in children, as it is non-invasive,&#xD;
      cheap, feasible and available. Elastography, an ultrasonographic non-invasive procedure that&#xD;
      measures tissue stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver fibrosis is a result of chronic damage, and attacks and remissions throughout the&#xD;
      course of the disease trigger the formation of fibrosis. Apart from being a direct indicator&#xD;
      of liver damage, fibrosis has an important role in the development of hepatocyte dysfunction&#xD;
      and portal hypertension. In a clinical aspect, knowing the state and progress of fibrosis is&#xD;
      important in the assessment of treatment response for the severity and the prognosis of the&#xD;
      disease. The degree of fibrosis in the liver is important in the determination of prognosis,&#xD;
      and management of the process in chronic liver disease. Patients with fibrosis benefit from&#xD;
      treatment in case of early diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Elastography is a non-invasive method.&#xD;
