  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin microbiome of atopic dermatitis patients and healthy volunteers will be studies by&#xD;
      collecting and analysing skin swabs on different timepoint. Additional, effort will be made&#xD;
      to isolate and characterize Lactobacillus spp. and other beneficial micro-organisms on the&#xD;
      skin. Second aim of this study is to evaluate a topical probiotic cream in atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      treatment. A double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study will be performed in parallel&#xD;
      with the skin microbiome analysis. Both clinical effect on the symptoms of atopic dermatitis&#xD;
      and effect on the skin microbiome and survival of beneficial bacteria on the skin will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live micro-organisms which when administered in adequate amounts can exert a&#xD;
      health benefit on the host. This health-promoting effects have been extensively studied in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal niche but it becomes more and more clear that other niches are also&#xD;
      interesting for the potential of probiotics. Recent breakthroughs in 'next generation&#xD;
      sequencing' (NGS) technologies are making it now possible to map the microbiota after DNA&#xD;
      extraction, which is very interesting for bacteria that are not or difficult to cultivate.&#xD;
      The research into the microbiota of the skin with such new NGS technologies shows that there&#xD;
      is also an equilibrium in the skin composition of the microbiota and that there is a&#xD;
      disturbance of the skin microbiota in atopic dermatitis (AD). The etiology of AD is complex,&#xD;
      with the manifestation of the disease being influenced by various genetic and immune&#xD;
      mechanisms acting in concert with environmental factors. A reduction in the skin microbial&#xD;
      diversity is often observed and flares are characterized by an abundance of skin pathobionts&#xD;
      such as Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, topical probiotic strains could have a positive&#xD;
      effect on the skin microbiome and function by inhibiting pathogens, restoring the skin&#xD;
      microbiome and/or barrier function and executing anti-inflammatory effects on the skin cells.&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to analyse the skin microbiome in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and patients AD to obtain in depth data of the composition of the skin microbiome and&#xD;
      identify possible biomarkers for AD. In parallel, a double-blind placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      with topically applied live lactobacilli will be performed to give more insights in the&#xD;
      working mechanisms of lactobacilli on AD skin. More specifically to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the 'live' Lactobacillus species as 'active ingredient' in relation to acne symptoms and skin&#xD;
      microbiome modulation.&#xD;
