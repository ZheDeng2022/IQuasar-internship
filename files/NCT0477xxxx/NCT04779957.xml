  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft nephrectomy is associated with massive allo-sensitization following this event. The&#xD;
      occurrence of anti-HLA antibodies is a major barrier to perform a second kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Investigators propose here to evaluate in a phase II pilot study, the safety&#xD;
      of the use of a single dose of Tocilizumab immediately before or after graft nephrectomy. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint evaluated here is the occurrence of serious infectious complications&#xD;
      following graft nephrectomy, with a treatment by Tocilizumab. Secondary endpoints evaluated&#xD;
      here are - to evaluate all complications after graft nephrectomy, - and the Tocilizumab&#xD;
      effectiveness to reduce anti-HLA antibodies at one year post nephrectomy.&#xD;

      Background: graft nephrectomy is associated with massive allo-sensitization following this&#xD;
      event The occurrence of anti-HLA antibodies is a major barrier to perform a second kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Moreover, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome can occur which could&#xD;
      lead to serious patient's complications, in case of early graft thrombosis. To date, no&#xD;
      treatment or strategy is available to reduce these risks, after graft nephrectomy. IL-6 is a&#xD;
      key cytokine in inflammation, but also in the development of T and B cells activation. This&#xD;
      treatment previously demonstrated a major role in the occurrence of allo-antibodies.&#xD;
      Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody blocking IL6 receptor, previously used with success in&#xD;
      kidney transplantation to reduce anti-HLA antibodies mediated rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Investigators hypothetize that Tocilizumab is usefull to prevent&#xD;
      allo-sensitization post graft nephrectomy. They propose here to evaluate in a phase II pilot&#xD;
      study, the safety of the use of a single dose of Tocilizumab immediately before or after&#xD;
      graft nephrectomy.&#xD;
