  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effect of a digital health coaching program on self-efficacy and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia that is newly diagnosed. A digital health coaching program may help leukemia&#xD;
      patients report information about their health while receiving treatment, which may lead to&#xD;
      improvement in overall health.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of digital health coaching on self-efficacy among two cohorts of&#xD;
      individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),&#xD;
      respectively, as measured by the Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI version [v.] 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the relationship between self-efficacy and patient reported outcomes among&#xD;
      individuals with and without digital health coaching, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. The physiologic and psychosocial outcomes of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by&#xD;
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia Questionnaire (FACT-Leu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. The symptom experience of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by the MD Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. The financial toxicity of individuals with AML and CLL as measured by the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Score for Financial Toxicity (COST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive the PACK Health digital health coaching program over 3 months&#xD;
      consisting of communication initiated by either the PACK Health coach or the patient through&#xD;
      either text, e-mail, or phone call, to provide education and support related to a specific&#xD;
      topic such as fatigue, nutrition, or exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care support services consisting of a telephone triage&#xD;
      line that patients may call when experiencing physical or psychological concerns, or with any&#xD;
      other questions related to their disease or treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI) is 27-item instrument that measures self-efficacy in coping with cancer across 7 domains. These include: Seeking and Understanding Medical Information, Emotion Regulation, Coping with Treatment Related Side Effects, Accepting Cancer/ Maintaining a Positive Attitude, Seeking Social Support, and Using Spiritual Coping. The instrument utilizes a 7-point response scale ranging from 1 &quot;Not at all confident&quot; to 7 &quot;Confident&quot; (higher score equals greater efficacy for coping).&#xD;
Minimum Score-27, max- 189&#xD;
Will be calculated along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Linear mixed models (LMMs) will be created to assess the correlation between self-efficacy, using the Cancer behavior inventory (CBI), and physiologic and psychosocial outcomes (as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia Questionnaire).&#xD;
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Leukemia Questionnaire (FACT-Leu) is a 44-item measure of quality of life associated with leukemia treatment. It consists of 4 defined domains: physical, social, emotional, and functional, as well as 17 items related to additional disease and treatment related concerns. Responses are measured on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).&#xD;
• Minimum Score -0, Maximum Score - 176</description>

    <description>Linear mixed models will be created to assess the correlation between self-efficacy (CBI) and symptom experience (as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory).&#xD;
The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a multiple-symptom measure of the severity of cancer-related symptoms and the functional interference caused by symptoms that is sensitive to disease and treatment changes. Patients rate the severity of 13 physical, affective, and cognitive symptoms on 0-10 numeric scales, ranging from &quot;not present&quot; to &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The MDASI also assesses 6 items related to symptom interference with functioning, also a 0-10 numeric scale ranging from &quot;did not interfere&quot; to &quot;interfere completely.&quot; The MDASI takes less than five minutes to complete.&#xD;
• Minimum Score - 0, Maximum Score - 190</description>

    <description>LMMs will be created to assess the correlation between self-efficacy (CBI) and perceived financial toxicity (as measured by the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity).&#xD;
Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) is an 11-item instrument used to measure the financial toxicity of cancer treatment, which has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with HRQoL. The instrument consists of 11 items, utilizing a five-point ordinal scale ranging from (0- Not at all) to (4- Very much).&#xD;
