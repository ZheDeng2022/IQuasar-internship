      We propose a study of a strategy designed to 1) increase cervical cancer screening using a&#xD;
      community-based approach, and 2) determine the efficacy of HPV vaccination in a region of&#xD;
      Kenya where half of all children are chronically exposed to aflatoxin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is caused by oncogenic HPV, and is the main cause of cancer-related death&#xD;
      among Kenyan women [1-3]. This malignancy is preventable through a combination of screening&#xD;
      of adult women and vaccination of children and adolescents against HPV infection. However,&#xD;
      only 5% of Kenyan women are regularly screened, and only 14% have ever been screened, which&#xD;
      in Kenya is done by a method known as Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) [3, 4].&#xD;
      Obstacles to screening include travel to clinics, costs, poor specificity of VIA, lack of&#xD;
      trained personnel, and others. In addition, while safe and effective HPV vaccines have been&#xD;
      available for 15 years, very few (&lt;1%) Kenyan children and adolescents have been vaccinated&#xD;
      [5, 6]. Obstacles to vaccination include costs, delivery infrastructure, lack of education,&#xD;
      travel to clinics, and others. In addition, there are few studies of HPV vaccination in&#xD;
      African children, and two-dose regimens may not provide adequate protective antibody levels&#xD;
      among children chronically exposed to aflatoxin, a potent immunosuppressive agent found in&#xD;
      contaminated corn. We propose a study of a strategy designed to 1) increase cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening using a community-based approach, and 2) determine the efficacy of HPV vaccination&#xD;
      in a region of Kenya where half of all children are chronically exposed to aflatoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 (Cervical cancer screening): Evaluate High-Risk (HR)-HPV DNA testing of&#xD;
      self-collected vaginal swabs as a triage step for VIA among rural Kenyan women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: All women with negative HR-HPV DNA tests will have normal VIA examinations or&#xD;
      falsely-abnormal VIA examinations based on cervical biopsy results. Our rationale is that if&#xD;
      this hypothesis is correctly proven, it will suggest that VIA is unnecessary for women with&#xD;
      negative HR-HPV DNA tests in self-collected vaginal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 (HPV vaccination): Determine the effects of chronic aflatoxin exposure among&#xD;
      Kenyan children/adolescents on the likelihood of seroconversion to HPV types represented in&#xD;
      the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to children/adolescents without detectable plasma aflatoxin,&#xD;
      children/adolescents with evidence of chronic aflatoxin exposure will have a reduced&#xD;
      likelihood of seroconversion to HPV types represented in the HPV vaccine. Our rationale is&#xD;
      that if this hypothesis is correctly proven, it will suggest that adjustments in vaccination&#xD;
      doses/schedules may be needed for children with chronic exposure to aflatoxin to assure&#xD;
      adequate protection against HPV infection.&#xD;
