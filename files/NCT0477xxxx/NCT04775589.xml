  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate a telehealth Stepped Exercise Program for Knee&#xD;
      OsteoArthritis (STEP-KOA) among rural veterans. Methods: This is a single arm, pre-post pilot&#xD;
      trial of the 6-month STEP-KOA program among rural Veterans with a physician diagnosis of knee&#xD;
      OA who self-report knee pain â‰¥3 on a 0-10 scale and self-reported difficulty with either&#xD;
      walking or stair climbing. We aim to enroll 20 Veterans in this project but may enroll up to&#xD;
      30 in order to obtain sufficient information to evaluate the program, particularly among&#xD;
      Veterans who live in very rural areas. Assessments will be conducted via a combination of&#xD;
      telephone and video at baseline and 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-up. Assessments will include&#xD;
      questionnaires related to pain, function and physical activity, as well as several physical&#xD;
      performance tests. STEP-KOA begins with a low cost, primarily self-directed exercise program&#xD;
      (supported by an internet-based tool; Step 1). Patients are then assessed for degree of&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms, and then can step up sequentially to telephone or video-based&#xD;
      physical activity coaching (Step 2) and physical therapy (Step 3) if they do not make&#xD;
      clinically relevant improvements in prior steps. For this project, patients will be assessed&#xD;
      approximately every 2 months to determine step progression. Participants will advance to the&#xD;
      next step if they do not meet response criteria for pain and function established by the&#xD;
      Outcome Measures in Rheumatology group and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International&#xD;
      (OMERACT-OARSI). The Step 2 intervention involves bi-weekly telephone or video calls. Step 3&#xD;
      involves 3 telehealth PT visits, based on standard care for knee OA.&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>24-item measure assessing lower extremity pain, stiffness and function. All items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4; total score 0-96), with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-second chair stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rise and sit back down in a chair as many times as they can during 30 seconds, without using hands or arms for support. Higher numbers of chair stands indicate better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2 minute march test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to march in place, taking as many &quot;steps&quot; as they can within 2 minutes, bringing the knees to approximately a 90-degree angle. If the patient is not bringing knees to an appropriate height, the study team member administering the test will ask them to raise their knees higher; if proper knee height cannot be maintained, the patient may continue the test, but this is noted on the score sheet. Higher numbers of steps indicate better function.</description>
