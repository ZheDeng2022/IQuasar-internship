  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity strength, range of motion, activity limitations, fatigue and pain are&#xD;
      well-documented concerns for women receiving treatment for breast cancer. Research has shown&#xD;
      that cancer-related treatment side effects are amenable to rehabilitation interventions when&#xD;
      identified early during treatment for breast cancer. Despite this, early rehabilitation has&#xD;
      been reported in only 1-2% of individuals diagnosed with cancer. The Prospective Surveillance&#xD;
      Model (PSM), a comprehensive model of survivorship care supported by the American Cancer&#xD;
      Society and the National Cancer Institute, recommends a baseline assessment (near the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis) and ongoing surveillance and intervention of impairments that minimize the impact&#xD;
      of cancer treatments. A significant gap in knowledge currently exists with regards to the&#xD;
      effectiveness of employing the PSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of implementing the PSM on impairments and&#xD;
      functional limitations in women diagnosed with breast cancer during the first six months of&#xD;
      treatment. A randomized controlled trial will be applied to examine a total of 28 women&#xD;
      diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who will receive a mastectomy at Prisma Health in&#xD;
      Columbia, S.C. Women will be randomized to one of two groups: PSM or usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to examine the impact of employing early&#xD;
      rehabilitation by implementing a randomized controlled trial at Prisma Health Midlands on&#xD;
      women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who will receive a mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcomes will be collected at 3-time points (baseline, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective measures: Upper extremity active range of motion, upper extremity, strength,&#xD;
           physical function, and arm volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported (questionnaire) measures: Upper extremity function, functional&#xD;
           mobility, balance, health-related quality f life, pain, fatigue, falls and distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient reported measures will also be collected electronically 24 hours after each of&#xD;
      the 3 assessments (baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the 3 study visits will last ~60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are randomized into the intervention group, you will receive ~10 treatment visits with&#xD;
      a licensed physical therapist. Scheduling will be at your convenience and based on what the&#xD;
      physical therapist recommends. Those in the intervention group will receive individualized&#xD;
      physical therapy treatments based on impairments identified. Treatment may include but is not&#xD;
      limited to the following: passive, assisted and active ROM, manual therapy, soft tissue&#xD;
      massage, myofascial release, therapeutic activities and exercise and patient education.&#xD;
      Treatment duration and frequency will be specific to each patient, providing personalized&#xD;
      care. Physical therapy intervention will occur 1-2x/week for 3-6 weeks beginning ~4 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery (x̄=10 visits). Each visit will last ~60 minutes in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care groups will be instructed to continue with their typical daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive a handout containing education and home exercise&#xD;
      instruction which is considered routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a $25 gift card gift card for each completed in person assessment&#xD;
      (baseline, 3 and 6 months post surgery) for a total of $75.&#xD;
