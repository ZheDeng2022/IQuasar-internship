  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project's overall goal is to test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of two&#xD;
      coach-assisted, computer-based, cognitive- behavioral therapy (C-CBT) interventions in&#xD;
      treating depression and anxiety in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. The two&#xD;
      coach-assisted interventions will be compared to the standard C-CBT intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a three-arm randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms and one control&#xD;
      arm. Participants in the first treatment arm will receive a coach-assisted C-CBT intervention&#xD;
      called &quot;Beating the Blues&quot; (BtB). A second treatment arm will receive a coach-assisted,&#xD;
      animated C-CBT intervention called &quot;Entertain Me Well&quot; (EMW). Both treatment arms will have 8&#xD;
      weekly sessions that contain core components of CBT. A coach will provide between-session&#xD;
      support throughout the 8 sessions. The control arm will use the standard care of BtB without&#xD;
      coach assistance.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be interviewed about their perceptions regarding the delivery format, treatment content, and other treatment related factors. Qualitative interviews will be transcribed by research staff and coded using thematic content analysis and axial coding. Qualitative data will be reviewed iteratively until saturation is reached, that is when no new information seems to emerge during coding. Emergence or non-emergence of acceptability theme will be assessed. Findings will be descriptive and will include the percentage of participants who confirm acceptability.</description>
