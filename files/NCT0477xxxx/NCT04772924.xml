    <textblock>
      Patients in this prospective cohort study were selected if they had a history of PCI more&#xD;
      than 1 year previously. 405 patients were divided based on their preferences to fasting and&#xD;
      non fasting and after 1 month of fasting major adverse cardiovascular events were measured&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Between 18 March 2019 and 18 April 2020, patients seen at Professor Kojuri Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Clinic in Shiraz, Iran (email:kojurij@yahoo.com, webpage: http://kojuriclinic.com) for their&#xD;
      annual check-up were selected. We explained the research project to them, and volunteers were&#xD;
      selected. Patients were assigned to the fasting or non-fasting group according to their&#xD;
      preference. All volunteers were informed about the details of this research, and provided&#xD;
      their written informed consent. Patients who declined to participate in the study were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed how to divide their medication across the two daily meals before&#xD;
      dawn and after sunset during the month of Ramadan. We informed patients to immediately stop&#xD;
      fasting and consult the clinic if they experienced any signs of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      including shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations. At the end of Ramadan, patients&#xD;
      were contacted by telephone and asked about their symptoms, including chest pain and dyspnea,&#xD;
      hospitalization, and MACE. The MACE were defined as acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      hospitalization due to congestive heart failure, new-onset atrial fibrillation, stroke, or&#xD;
      cardiac arrest [19, 20]. Symptomatic patients were referred to the clinic for cardiovascular&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was double-blinded. To blind the researchers, the clinic secretary contacted the&#xD;
      patients and asked them not to specify their group (fasting or non-fasting), and then passed&#xD;
      the phone to the researcher. We used alphabetical order in each group to blind the&#xD;
      statisticians. Patients who fasted during Ramadan were designated with the letter X, and&#xD;
      patients who did not fast during Ramadan were designated with the letter Y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analyses we used IBM SPSS software version 25. We used the chi-squared test&#xD;
      to compare categorical variables and Student's t-test to compare the mean values of&#xD;
      continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for&#xD;
      nonparametric variables.&#xD;
