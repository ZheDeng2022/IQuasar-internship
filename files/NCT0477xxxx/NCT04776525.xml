  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of patients with high-grade, localized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of extremities&#xD;
      and trunk wall develop disease recurrence after local therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      ifosfamide and doxorubicin may improve long-term disease-free survival, but the benefit of&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment is limited and predictive factors for treatment response are lacking. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to explore sequential treatment with ifosfamide and doxorubicin in a&#xD;
      neoadjuvant setting and to investigate biomarkers predictive of treatment response.&#xD;

             support with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, with or without&#xD;
             androgens, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients not able to give an informed consent or comply with study regulations as&#xD;
             deemed by study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other significant comorbidities, such as active infection, uncontrolled pulmonary&#xD;
             or liver disease, active cystitis, or any other condition, that based on the&#xD;
             assessment of the treating physician could compromise compliance with the protocol or&#xD;
             predispose the patient to safety risks.&#xD;
