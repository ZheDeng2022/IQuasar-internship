  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation&#xD;
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and&#xD;
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for new mothers. In addition, new&#xD;
      mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight&#xD;
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems&#xD;
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress, defined as anxiety, depression, and insomnia, in this study, often&#xD;
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health&#xD;
      status, maternal and family relationships, and infant-child health. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effects of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) on anxiety, insomnia,&#xD;
      depression, and maternal functioning in first time new mothers following childbirth.&#xD;

      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation&#xD;
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and&#xD;
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for first-time mothers. In addition,&#xD;
      new mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight&#xD;
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems&#xD;
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress, defined as depression, anxiety and insomnia, in this study, often&#xD;
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health&#xD;
      status, maternal and family functioning, and infant-child outcomes. These conditions commonly&#xD;
      present as co-morbidities, but are often unrecognized in clinical practice or under-treated&#xD;
      as co-morbidities in new mothers. This unrecognized cluster of co-morbidities may lead to&#xD;
      psychological distress and subsequently poor outcomes for mothers, their infants and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment recommendations for depression, anxiety and insomnia are primarily&#xD;
      pharmaceutical or psychotherapy, both of which have limitations related to cost, time&#xD;
      involved and ineffectiveness for some women. Consequently, there is a need to examine other&#xD;
      treatment approaches including complementary modalities, such as cranial electrotherapy&#xD;
      stimulation (CES), particularly in light of current evidence that shows the efficacy of early&#xD;
      detection, intervention and treatment for pregnant and postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of CES on anxiety in new&#xD;
      mothers following childbirth. The secondary objectives are to: (1) determine the effects of&#xD;
      CES on depression and insomnia; (2) explore the effect of CES on maternal functioning in new&#xD;
      mothers following childbirth, and (3) to examine if items 1 &amp; 2 on the 14 item Hamilton&#xD;
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A14) perform well as a screening test for anxiety. Please see the&#xD;
      enclosed Instrument Description document for detailed information related to this scale.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The blocked randomization method will be used to assign participants to active and sham groups. Participants will be assigned to CES treatment or sham CES using a 1:1 ratio. Electromedical Products International, Inc. (EPI) will randomize the assignment of appropriate devices to active or sham groups by using a random list of computer generated numbers (1 for active and 2 for sham) in randomly selected block sizes. The PI and participants are blinded to which participants have Alpha-Stim® CES active or sham devices until data analysis is complete. After the completion of data analysis, blinding will be broken.</masking_description>
