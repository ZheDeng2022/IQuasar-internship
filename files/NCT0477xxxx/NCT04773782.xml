  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label trial of avapritinib in patients aged 2 to less&#xD;
      than 18 years of age with with relapsed/refractory (R/R) solid tumors with mutations&#xD;
      (including non-synonymous point mutations, insertions, and deletions) in KIT or PDGFRA, or&#xD;
      gliomas with the H3K27M mutation, and no available alternative treatment options. This is a&#xD;
      single-arm trial in which all patients will receive avapritinib. The study consists of 2&#xD;
      parts: dose confirmation, safety, and PK (Part 1) and initial efficacy, safety, and PK at the&#xD;
      Part 2 recommended dose (Part 2).&#xD;

             despite standard therapy and no alternative treatment option is available OR Confirmed&#xD;
             diagnosis of H3K27M mutant glioma that has failed standard therapy or for which no&#xD;
             standard therapy that may convey clinical benefit exists, as judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CNS disease should be on a stable dose (≤10% change) of corticosteroids&#xD;
