  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with COPD as a result of hyperinflation adapt to the increased workload&#xD;
      through shortening and overactivation of other muscles because of their dual function as&#xD;
      muscles of the upper limb and neck motion which makes them limited in function and decreases&#xD;
      the range of motion in these joints. Another resultant effect of these changes is the&#xD;
      shortness of breath taking place following the inability of patients to perform daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research is focusing on the use of Muscle Energy Techniques (METs) for such&#xD;
      circumstances. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether METs result in an improvement&#xD;
      in rib cage mobility which could potentially lead to improvements in pulmonary function and&#xD;
      activities of daily of living (ADLs) in a group of patients diagnosed with COPD. If positive&#xD;
      results are obtained, such an intervention might provide a possible addition to the&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions already available for COPD patients. The result of this&#xD;
      intervention may provide physiotherapists with further techniques for use in such patients;&#xD;
      ones which will be of benefit to the patients and their quality of life and also to the&#xD;
      health services.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial (RCT) shall be carried out on an approximate sample of 110&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with COPD. Participants shall be randomly assigned to an intervention and&#xD;
      a control group. The intervention group shall be receiving a 4 week programme of Muscle&#xD;
      Energy Techniques whereas the control group shall continue with their prescribed medications&#xD;
      and any conventional physiotherapy sessions suggested for these patients.&#xD;
