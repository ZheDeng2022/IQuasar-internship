  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Higher aerobic capacity before surgery, as indicated during submaximal exercise testing by&#xD;
      the oxygen uptake (VO2) at the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT), is assumed to be&#xD;
      prognostic for a better and faster postoperative recovery in patients with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      testing (CPET) is the gold standard to measure aerobic capacity; however, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether it is feasible to perform CPET using cycle ergometry in patients with knee OA prior&#xD;
      to TKA surgery. The hypothesis is that performing CPET is feasible and participants will meet&#xD;
      the feasibility criteria for success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this cross-sectional feasibility study is to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility of CPET in patients with knee OA three to six weeks prior to TKA surgery in three&#xD;
      domains: a) recruitment rate of participants who are representative of the target study&#xD;
      population; b) reaching the VAT during CPET; and c) acceptability and suitability. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to investigate aerobic capacity of the study population and to compare&#xD;
      values with normative values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of patients with knee OA scheduled for primary unilateral TKA&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of CPET will be assessed against five criteria: 1) recruitment rate ≥20%; 2) CPET&#xD;
      performance rate ≥90%; 3) ≥90% of participants reached the VAT; 4) no serious adverse events;&#xD;
      and 5) ≥80% of participants had a positive attitude towards CPET. Aerobic capacity is&#xD;
      determined by the VO2 at the VAT and the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPET is considered a safe procedure. Participants perform the CPET instead of a walking test&#xD;
      following the standard preoperative screening and complete a questionnaire to examine their&#xD;
      experiences. The investigator will contact the participants one week after the CPET to&#xD;
      inquire whether they have developed any complaints afterwards. Benefit from participation is&#xD;
      that all patients objectively get insight in their preoperative aerobic capacity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether it is feasible to perform submaximal exercise testing using cycle&#xD;
      ergometry to measure aerobic capacity in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Individuals prior to TKA surgery experience increasing knee&#xD;
      pain and are progressively restricted in their activities of daily living (ADL), sports and&#xD;
      work, which negatively affect their aerobic capacity. This causes severe deconditioning,&#xD;
      which is more prominent in patients with more severe knee OA. As part of usual care before&#xD;
      TKA procedure, patients are screened for risk factors for delayed recovery by measuring&#xD;
      physical functioning. Although various practical performance-based tests are performed,&#xD;
      measuring aerobic capacity is included nowhere. Therefore, a walking test will be replaced by&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) using cycle ergometry, which is the gold standard for&#xD;
      measuring aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A higher aerobic capacity prior to TKA surgery is assumed to be prognostic for a better and&#xD;
      faster postoperative recovery. The first step is to explore whether it is feasible to perform&#xD;
      a submaximal CPET prior to TKA surgery using cycle ergometry in patients with knee OA. When&#xD;
      the feasibility criteria are met, the possible prognostic value of preoperative aerobic&#xD;
      capacity on postoperative recovery can be investigated in a subsequent prospective cohort&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to investigate the feasibility of submaximal CPET in patients with knee OA&#xD;
      three to six weeks prior to TKA surgery in the MUMC+ regarding three domains: 1) recruitment&#xD;
      rate of participants who are representative of the target study population; 2) feasibility of&#xD;
      CPET procedure; and 3) acceptability and suitability of CPET. These domains are&#xD;
      operationalized with five feasibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: to explore the aerobic capacity of the study population, individuals&#xD;
      with knee OA scheduled for TKA surgery, using submaximal parameters (VO2 at the VAT and OUES)&#xD;
      and compare their aerobic capacity with normative values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional study will be conducted at the Maastricht University Medical Center&#xD;
      (MUMC+). CPET will be performed three to six weeks before the TKA surgery following the&#xD;
      preoperative screening. The study will include 15 to 20 participants.&#xD;
