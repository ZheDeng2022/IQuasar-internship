    <textblock>
      A randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, double blind study to compare the 3-month&#xD;
      adherence and efficacy of Active Iron in subjects with or at-risk of iron deficiency and a&#xD;
      history of intolerance to oral iron. Subjects with intolerance and treatment failure due to&#xD;
      oral iron (male and female subjects, aged 18 to 55 years, with mild to moderate iron&#xD;
      deficiency, with or without anaemia) are eligible. Sixty subjects are randomised into three&#xD;
      groups (14 mg elemental iron, 25mg elemental iron and 50mg elemental iron daily). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess adherence/persistence (including using pill counts). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess gastrointestinal tolerability, haematological efficacy and health&#xD;
      related quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 2.2. billion people worldwide have anaemia and half of this burden is caused by&#xD;
      iron deficiency [Lopez 2016]. The commonest causes of iron deficiency are inadequate intake,&#xD;
      poor absorption of iron [Stoffel 2017] and blood loss, for example due to menstruation [World&#xD;
      Health Organization Guideline: Daily iron supplementation in adult women and adolescent&#xD;
      girls; Geneva 2016, Low 2016]. Supplementation with oral iron is well established to prevent&#xD;
      and treat iron deficiency anaemia and to promote recovery of iron and haemoglobin levels post&#xD;
      blood loss or blood donation [Low 2016, McNamee 2013]. However, iron food fortification and&#xD;
      oral iron supplements are frequently limited by poor absorption and poor tolerability [Munoz&#xD;
      2009]. Ferrous sulfate is considered the gold standard and the only oral iron form on the WHO&#xD;
      Essential Medicines List, yet has fractional absorption of only 16%-21% from daily or&#xD;
      alternative daily doses [Stoffel et al 2017]. It is also poorly tolerated, causing adverse GI&#xD;
      effects in a majority of patients [Pereira 2014]. This results in poor adherence in up to 50%&#xD;
      of users, significant nutritional deficit and treatment failure [Tolkien 2015]&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously evaluated a formulation of microspheres of iron sulfate in a denatured&#xD;
      whey protein (WP) matrix at a daily elemental iron dose of 25mg daily, marketed as Active&#xD;
      Iron, in comparison with equi-dose immediate release and modified release ferrous sulfate&#xD;
      (Wang et al. Acta Haematologica Acta Haematol 2017;138:223-232). In these evaluations, the&#xD;
      iron-WP formulation has shown better absorption and there were no reports of adverse effects.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in-vitro data show that the iron-WP matrix formulation can protect HT20 gut&#xD;
      endothelial cells and CaCO2 cells from oxidative stress and cell damage associated with&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate. In a post-marketing survey of 101 people taking Active Iron (age 43 ± 10&#xD;
      years, 83% female) with a history of intolerance to oral iron, 87% reported no adverse&#xD;
      effects after 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study aims to compare the 3-month adherence and efficacy associated&#xD;
      with a 25mg single daily dose, a lower (14mg) single daily dose and twice daily dosing with&#xD;
      25mg (50mg daily), in subjects with treatment failure (iron deficiency and with a history of&#xD;
      intolerance to oral iron). The primary objective of the study is to assess the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects adherent and persistent (&gt;80% based on pill counts) from baseline to weeks 6 and&#xD;
      baseline to week 12. Secondary objectives aim to further assess compliance (average&#xD;
      compliance), tolerability (incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms GSRS instrument), efficacy&#xD;
      (change in haemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation, iron binding protein) and health&#xD;
      related quality of life (SF36 instrument).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 90 subjects will be screened in order to identify up to 60 eligible subjects, and 54&#xD;
      evaluable subjects. Participants will be male and female, between 18 and 55 years of age,&#xD;
      with mild to moderate iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin ≥9.5 g/dL and &lt;12.0 g/dL for&#xD;
      females and ≥10.0 g/dL and &lt;13.0 g/dL for males and ferritin &lt; 30 µg/L) or ferritin &lt; 30 µg/L&#xD;
      and no anaemia. There will be stratified randomisation to include up to 30 patients with iron&#xD;
      deficiency and mild to moderate anaemia as well as up to 30 patients with iron deficiency&#xD;
      without anaemia. Other pre-specified sub-groups for evaluation of the primary and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include women with reported symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding and participants&#xD;
      with intolerance of liquid iron products or lower doses (&lt; 50mg elemental iron). Separate&#xD;
      analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be carried out in participants in the&#xD;
      multivitamin and mineral sub study. Finally, due to the suspension of some clinics during&#xD;
      Covid lockdown, we carried out a prespecified analysis of patients completing the study&#xD;
      before the onset of the Covid 19 Pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to one of three treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ACTIVE IRON™ (ferrous sulfate) 14 mg elemental iron once daily (plus matching placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ACTIVE IRON™ (ferrous sulfate) 25 mg elemental iron once daily (plus matching placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ACTIVE IRON™ (ferrous sulfate) 25 mg elemental iron twice daily (plus matching placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 4 visits over a 12 to 14-week period. At the screening visit (visit&#xD;
      1), informed consent shall be obtained. Demographic data, vitals, anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      and prior and concomitant medications will be recorded. Subjects will be asked questions&#xD;
      relating to their iron deficiency anaemia and medical history associated with this. Female&#xD;
      subjects will be asked questions regarding their menstrual periods and intolerance to other&#xD;
      iron products. A fasting blood sample will be collected and a full blood count, including&#xD;
      Ferritin and Serum iron/Transferrin will be measured. Blood and serum samples will be frozen&#xD;
      and retained for post-hoc analysis of other biomarkers relevant to iron metabolism (e.g.&#xD;
      hepcidin, soluble transferrin receptor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed the subject will be invited to attend a baseline visit (visit&#xD;
      2, Time 0). At this visit, a blood sample will be collected and a full blood count, including&#xD;
      Ferritin and Serum iron/Transferrin will be measured. For women of childbearing age, a urine&#xD;
      sample will be collected, and pregnancy test performed. Subjects will be queried about any&#xD;
      changes in their health status and any non-treatment emergent events and medications will be&#xD;
      recorded. Subjects will complete the following questionnaires: Gastrointestinal Symptom&#xD;
      Rating Scale (GSRS Instrument), the Short Form-36 (SF-36 Instrument) and for women who are&#xD;
      menstruating, they will report the date, duration and blood flow of their last menstrual&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups, but will be blinded as to&#xD;
      which group they are in. Subjects will be supplied with a 6-week supply of study product and&#xD;
      instructions on dosing. Subjects will be instructed to following their habitual diet and&#xD;
      exercise routine and to not consume any disallowed medications or supplements that could&#xD;
      interfere with the assessment of the study product for the duration of the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be provided with an appointment to return to the study site at week 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 3 and 9 ('phone visits'), all subjects will be asked (to complete the GSRS, and women&#xD;
      who are menstruating, will complete Menstrual Period Questionnaire, to record the date,&#xD;
      duration and blood flow of their last menstrual period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic site at week 6 (visit 3) and 12 (visit 4). At each visit,&#xD;
      subjects will be queried about any changes in their health status and any adverse events and&#xD;
      medications will be recorded. A blood sample will be collected and a full blood count,&#xD;
      including Ferritin and Serum iron/Transferrin will be measured. Subjects will complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires: GSRS, SF-36 and for women who are menstruating, the Menstrual&#xD;
      Period Questionnaire. Subjects will return any unused study product and additional product&#xD;
      will be dispensed. The adherence based on pill count will be determined for the period.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to continue following their habitual diet and exercise routine&#xD;
      and to not consume any disallowed medications or supplements that could interfere with the&#xD;
      assessment of the study product for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 4th visit (week 12), subjects will be invited to partake in an optional, open-label,&#xD;
      follow-up for 3 months after the completion of the blinded intervention phase. Participants&#xD;
      who decide to partake in the optional, open-label follow-up study will continue to receive&#xD;
      the same dose of Active Iron™ as they received during the blinded intervention phase, for a&#xD;
      further 12 weeks, in addition to a multivitamin and mineral complex that is designed to&#xD;
      maximise iron metabolism and haemoglobin/red blood cell formation. This complex contains&#xD;
      vitamin A, D, B2, B6, B12, folic acid and copper. Subjects will return for an interim&#xD;
      follow-up visit at week 18 (visit 5), and a final visit at week 24 (visit 6). At these visits&#xD;
      subjects will undergo standard assessments and complete the following questionnaires: GSRS,&#xD;
      SF-36 and for women who are menstruating, the Menstrual Period Questionnaire. Subjects will&#xD;
      also answer questions on the tolerability of the study product.&#xD;
