  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open, multiple-dose phase Ib/IIa clinical study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of BAT5906 injection in patients with diabetic macular edema. BAT5906's&#xD;
      phase I study on w-AMD shows that it is safe from 0.3-4.0 mg, and the higher dose (2.5 mg and&#xD;
      4 mg) may maintain the effect for longer; the same target drugs (such as brolucizumab and&#xD;
      Abecip ) It has also been found in clinical studies that high doses can extend the dosing&#xD;
      interval and reduce the dosing frequency. Therefore, in this study, two safe and effective&#xD;
      doses were selected, and the optimal clinical effective dose and frequency of BAT5906 in DME&#xD;
      were initially explored.&#xD;
