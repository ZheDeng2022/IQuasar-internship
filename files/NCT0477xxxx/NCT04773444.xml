  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of an eccentric endurance training on central and peripheral hemodynamic&#xD;
      adaptations and erythrocyte rheology during maximal exercise remained to be unexplored. The&#xD;
      current study examined the contribution of rheological functions and/or hemodynamic&#xD;
      adaptation to changes in oxygen consumption (VO2) following the matched-power output&#xD;
      eccentric (ECT) or concentric cycling training (CCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A total of 39 sedentary males were randomly assigned into either CCT (n=13) or ECT&#xD;
      (n=13) for 30 min a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks at 60% of maximal workload or to a CTL&#xD;
      (control group, n = 13). A graded exercise test (GXT) was performed before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Central and microvascular adaptations were evaluated using thoracic impedance&#xD;
      and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), respectively. Rheological characteristics was&#xD;
      determined by an ektacytometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endurance training is a well known strategy for improving fitness capacity. However, some&#xD;
      populations are intolerance to complete the usual exercise training program, such as chronic&#xD;
      heart or pulmonary disease or the elderly. Therefore, ECT is a candidate training strategy&#xD;
      for those individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythrocytes deformability is significantly related to the blood perfusion in&#xD;
      microcirculation. The impaired erythrocyte-related rheology further lead to reduced aerobic&#xD;
      capacity by our research team. Therefore, the lower energy consumed in ECT may avoid the&#xD;
      oxidative stress. To now, less studies have demonstrated whether ECT influences peripheral&#xD;
      hemodynamics by erythrocyte rheology and the blood flow from the central effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to investigate the effects of CCT and ECT on oxygen consumption&#xD;
      response explained by changes in local blood perfusion, blood cell rheology, or central&#xD;
      function to attempt developing its application in rehabilitation.&#xD;
