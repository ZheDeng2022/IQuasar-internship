  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease (GD) is the most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism in iodine sufficient&#xD;
      countries and Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is its most common extrathyroidal manifestation.&#xD;
      Restoration and maintenance of euthyroidism are imperative in Graves' disease patients with&#xD;
      GO. The main treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs, radioactive&#xD;
      iodine (RAI), and surgery. Whether one or the other therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism&#xD;
      offers the best protection against GO is not established. The study is aimed at comparing the&#xD;
      effects of a conservative approach (antithyroid drugs, ATDs, experimental arm) vs an ablative&#xD;
      approach (radioiodine or total thyroidectomy) of thyroid treatment on the overall outcome of&#xD;
      GO in patients with GD and moderate-to-severe and active GO treated with intravenous&#xD;
      glucocorticoids.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 48 and 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of a disease specific quality of life questionnaire (GO-QoL) at 24, 48 and 72 weeks. Positive response: an improvement in the questionnaire by at least 6/48 points. The GO-QoL contains 8 questions on visual functioning and 8 questions on appearance. The minimal clinically important difference in scores is ≥ 10 points for invasive therapies, but a change of 6 is already perceived by patients as beneficial and is associated with an important change in daily functioning. The GO-QoL is well validated, widely used, and available in eight languages. The GO-QoL is recommended as an independent outcome measure in randomized clinical trials24.</description>
