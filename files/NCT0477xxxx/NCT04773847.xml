  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcome of MimetikOss&#xD;
      3D as a patient-specific bone substitute in regeneration of osseous defects in several&#xD;
      maxillofacial indications. The primary objective is to evaluate the capacity of MimetikOss 3D&#xD;
      to perform bone substitute requirements, i.e long-term regeneration of bony tissue in complex&#xD;
      defects without detrimental resorption. The secondary main objectives are to assess the&#xD;
      versatility of MimetikOss 3D by the variety of maxillofacial sites regenerated and the&#xD;
      surgical technique improvement (in terms of surgery duration, blood loss, ease-of-use of the&#xD;
      product and surgeon satisfaction).&#xD;
