      This exploratory phase IIa, double blind, randomized, vehicle controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      dose-finding trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FOL-005 topical&#xD;
      formulation (at 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% strength) administered once daily (in the evening) for 16&#xD;
      weeks in healthy male subjects with androgenetic alopecia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This exploratory phase IIa, double blind, randomized, vehicle controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      dose-finding trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of FOL-005 topical&#xD;
      formulation (at 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% strength) administered once daily (in the evening) for 16&#xD;
      weeks in healthy male subjects with androgenetic alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be performed at three centers in Germany. The aim of the trial is to determine&#xD;
      the most efficacious dose of FOL-005 topical formulation based on efficacy dose trends. It is&#xD;
      planned to randomize 220 subjects (with a ratio 1:1:1:1 FOL-005 0.1%; FOL-005 0.5%; FOL-005&#xD;
      1.5%; vehicle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening period of up to three weeks and a treatment period of 16&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized at Baseline (Day 1) and will apply the investigational&#xD;
      products themselves at home once daily for 16 weeks. Subjects will return to the sites bi-&#xD;
      weekly for check of compliance and assessment of local tolerability. At Day1, Day 84 and Day&#xD;
      112 subjects will be evaluated for hair growth parameters by TrichoLAB imaging. The end of&#xD;
      the clinical trial for each individual subject is defined as the Final Visit at Day 112. In&#xD;
      case of premature termination of a randomized subject an Early Termination (ET) visit should&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This trial will be conducted as a double-blind trial. Neither the Investigator nor the subject will know the identity of the IP assigned. Also, all other persons involved in the trial (e.g. Data Manager and Trial Statistician) remain blinded until all possible queries are resolved and 'closure of the data base' is done, i.e. after quality assurance of the data and hard lock of the data base clean files.</masking_description>
