  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study addressing the challenge of predicting disease progression and/or&#xD;
      recurrence in patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal, pancreatobiliary, or&#xD;
      esophagogastric cancer that are receiving anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating how patient-reported outcomes (e.g. symptoms, quality of&#xD;
      life) and biomarkers compare to standard of care clinical assessments such as imaging and&#xD;
      tumor markers in predicting the clinical outcomes (e.g. disease progression and survival) in&#xD;
      patient populations with colorectal, pancreatobiliary, or esophagogastric cancer that are&#xD;
      receiving anti-cancer therapy Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcomes will be collected through a series of self-administered&#xD;
           questionnaires and blood draws will be used to obtain bio and tumor marker information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information will also be collected from the participants electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue may be obtained for next-generation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will conclude after participants are no longer receiving anti-cancer&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 600 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

    <measure>Treatment Response at 1st Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is treatment response (RECIST 1.1) at first scan (&gt;1 month post-treatment start). Both response status (PR vs SD or PD [including death]) and clinical benefit status (PR or SD vs PD [including death]) will be examined. Primary analyses will compare one month change from baseline in tumor markers, MAF of the selected clonal mutation in ctDNA, and PROs (symptoms, mood, and QOL) individually and a composite score in predicting response and clinical benefit (CB) at first scan.</description>

    <measure>PROs and Biomarkers as predictor of survival using cox proportional hazards model</measure>
