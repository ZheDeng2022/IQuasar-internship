    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of repotrectinib in combination with osimertinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, Part Ia and Part Ib, and its purpose will be to find&#xD;
      the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) as defined by the primary safety and&#xD;
      tolerability endpoint. The Phase Ia study will also determine the impact of repotrectinib on&#xD;
      osimertinib pharmacokinetics (PK) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if reached, of&#xD;
      repotrectinib given in combination with osimertinib and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be conducted according to a 'Rolling-6' based study design with 3 dose&#xD;
      levels for repotrectinib: 80 mg once a day (QD), 160 mg QD or 160 mf QD during 14 days&#xD;
      followed by 160 mg twice a day (BID); in combination with 80 mg QD of osimertinib. A total of&#xD;
      6 patients will be enrolled in each dose level cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this Phase Ib study will test early drug activity (efficacy) of the proposed&#xD;
      combination treatment in an expansion cohort at the RP2D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (TKI) designed to inhibit activating EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R)&#xD;
      and resistant T790M mutations with low activity against wild type EGFR. Repotrectinib,&#xD;
      potently inhibits Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Ros proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), and&#xD;
      Tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) family kinases; this novel target drug also inhibits Janus&#xD;
      kinase 2 (JAK2), sarcoma (SRC), and focal adhesion (FAK), which have shown to be important&#xD;
      targets associated with EGFR TKI resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I study of repotrectinib in combination with osimertinib in patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, Part Ia and&#xD;
      Part Ib:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: of the Phase I study will enroll approximately 9-18 patients in up to 3 dose levels&#xD;
      of 3-6 patients each: 80 mg once a day (QD), 160 mg QD or 160 mf QD during 14 days followed&#xD;
      by 160 mg twice a day (BID); in combination with 80 mg QD of osimertinib. Patients will&#xD;
      receive the combination treatment daily in 3-week cycles until disease progression occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: of the Phase I study is a dose expansion to assess additional PK and safety&#xD;
      parameters. Part B will enroll between 20 and 30 patients in 2 cohorts of at least 10&#xD;
      patients each. The 2 cohorts are defined by treatment history: Cohort I, those who have&#xD;
      progressed on osimertinib; Cohort II, those who progressed on any first or second generation&#xD;
      TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1A portion of this study will test the safety, tolerability, PK effects, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the EGFR TKI inhibitor osimertinib in combination with repotrectinib&#xD;
      in adult patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC. The phase 1B (expansion cohort)&#xD;
      of this study will test the efficacy of the combination of osimertinib and repotrectinib in&#xD;
      terms of progression-free survival and response rate in EGFR TKI-naïve patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
