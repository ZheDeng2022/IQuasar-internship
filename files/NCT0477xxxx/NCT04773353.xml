Subjects randomized to FE 999049 will have their individual dose determined on the basis of their anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level at screening and their body weight at randomization. For subjects with low AMH (&lt;15 pmol/L) the daily FE 999049 dose will be 12 μg, irrespective of body weight. For subjects with high AMH (≥15 pmol/L) the daily FE 999049 dose will be on a continuous scale ranging from 0.19 to 0.10 μg/kg, i.e. dependent on actual AMH and body weight.The daily FE 999049 dose will be fixed throughout the stimulation period and maximum allowed daily dose will be 12 μg.
