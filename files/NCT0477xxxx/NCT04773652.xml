  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the most important causes of&#xD;
      death and disability around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is early restoration of&#xD;
      coronary artery flow in order to preserve viable myocardium. Primary percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) has proven to be superior to other reperfusion strategies in terms of&#xD;
      mortality reduction and preservation of left ventricular (LV) function. Despite improvements&#xD;
      in the treatment of MI, 30% of patients show LV remodeling post-MI. Over time, remodeling&#xD;
      adversely affects cardiac function and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Early&#xD;
      risk stratification is essential to identify patients who will benefit from close follow-up&#xD;
      and intense medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most widely investigated functional left ventricular (LV) characteristic to predict&#xD;
      patient outcome after STEMI is LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Several structural LV&#xD;
      characteristics have also shown to be important predictors of cardiovascular adverse events&#xD;
      and death, including LV end diastolic volume (LVEDV), end systolic volume (LVESV) and mass&#xD;
      (LVM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the current reference standard for&#xD;
      assessing ventricular volumes and mass. Adverse remodeling results from an inability of the&#xD;
      heart to maintain geometry post MI in the context of large infarcts and increased wall&#xD;
      stresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compensatory hypertrophic response of the remote non-infarcted myocardium (end diastolic&#xD;
      wall thickness (EDWT) and end systolic wall thickness (ESWT)) might also play an important&#xD;
      role in the remodeling after myocardial infarction but this needs to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infarct size -as a crucial endpoint for adverse remodeling- is influenced by several factors:&#xD;
      - the size of the area at risk (AAR) (myocardium supplied by the culprit vessel); residual&#xD;
      flow to the ischemic territory (e.g., collateral flow); myocardial metabolic demand; and the&#xD;
      duration of coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the size and distribution of the infarction area after revascularization&#xD;
      therapy can facilitate prompt and appropriate clinical intervention. Biomarkers such as&#xD;
      troponin and creatine kinase are mainly used for AMI identification but lack myocardial&#xD;
      specificity and may overestimate the (IS). Left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) fails to&#xD;
      detect minimal and early pathological changes. The myocardial damage following STEMI can be&#xD;
      assessed accurately by delayed gadolinium enhancement imaging using CMR imaging. In the acute&#xD;
      phase of a STEMI, the extracellular space is increased in the infarct region due to a&#xD;
      combination of necrosis, hemorrhage, and edema. The extent of hyper enhancement in the acute&#xD;
      phase has been related to the outcome in patients with STEMI. However, later on the necrotic&#xD;
      tissue is replaced by fibrotic scar tissue also with increased extracellular space. This&#xD;
      process leads to ongoing 'infarct shrinkage' after the first week until the infarction&#xD;
      reaches its final size after âˆ¼30 days. - - Measurement of hyper enhancement in the acute&#xD;
      phase of an infarction might therefore overestimate the necrotic infarct size, whereas 'final&#xD;
      extent of hyper enhancement' is more precisely related to the amount of necrotic tissue. In&#xD;
      STEMI patients the prognostic importance and predictors of the final infarct size are not&#xD;
      fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial strain is a quantitative index based on measuring myocardial deformation during a&#xD;
      cardiac cycle. Major tools for detecting changes in myocardial strain include CMR tagging,&#xD;
      CMR feature tracking (FT-CMR) and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown an advantage of strain in sensitively and accurately diagnosing and assessing IS&#xD;
      compared to traditional functional indexes. However, the degree to which strain analysis can&#xD;
      reflect the infarction areas quantified by CMR, adverse LV remodeling as well as the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of this analysis is still under dispute. In the past 3 years in&#xD;
      particular, newly developed three-dimensional (3D) STE has overcome the inherent shortcomings&#xD;
      of two-dimensional (2D) STE.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 100 consecutive patients with acute STEMI presenting to Aswan Heart&#xD;
      Centre catheterization-lab for primary PCI matching the selection criteria. Diagnosis of&#xD;
      STEMI will be based upon:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm in at least 2 contiguous leads or&#xD;
      new/presumably new left bundle branch block, plus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Typical anginal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or diagnostic levels of serum cardiac biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patients will undergo primary PCI according to the recent practice guidelines and&#xD;
      the local hospital policy in managing ST elevation MI patients. Echocardiography and CMR will&#xD;
      be performed twice: within 48 hours of admission and 3 months following the index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve-lead electrocardiogram will be recorded at baseline and 30-min post-procedure.&#xD;
           The ST-segment changes will be evaluated in the single lead with the most prominent&#xD;
           ST-segment elevation before intervention. The ST-segment elevation will be measured to&#xD;
           the nearest 0.5 mm at 60 ms after the J point. Significant ST segment resolution (STR)&#xD;
           is defined as a reduction in ST-segment elevation of 50% after 30 min of infarct artery&#xD;
           recanalization .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately before the procedure, patients will receive aspirin (300 mg), clopidogrel&#xD;
           (600 mg), or ticagrelor (180 mg). Adjunctive pharmacological treatment during the&#xD;
           procedure will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Unfractionated heparin as an initial bolus of 70 U/kg and additional boluses during&#xD;
                the procedure to achieve an activated clotting time of 250 to 350 s (200 to 250 s&#xD;
                if Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonist is used). Heparin will be&#xD;
                discontinued at the end of percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The use of a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist during the procedure, primary PCI technique,&#xD;
                indications, and methods of thrombectomy if indicated will be done under the&#xD;
                regulations of the local hospital policy and the most recent practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           These include age, gender, weight, height, body mass index, body surface area, smoking&#xD;
           status, history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, prior history of&#xD;
           coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary interventions. Times from onset of&#xD;
           pain to first medical contact, to definitive diagnosis, to needle and to restoration of&#xD;
           coronary flow will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory work up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complete blood count, INR, cardiac biomarkers (total CK, CK-MB, troponin), Brain&#xD;
           natriuretic peptide (BNP), soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), liver enzymes&#xD;
           (ALT and AST), urea and creatinine, and serum electrolytes (Na, K).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Angiographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIMI flow grade will be assessed at three different time points; immediately after the&#xD;
      diagnostic coronary angiography, after wiring the culprit vessel and at the end of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIMI 0 flow: refers to the absence of any antegrade flow beyond a coronary occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIMI 1 flow: refers to faint antegrade coronary flow beyond the occlusion, with&#xD;
           incomplete filling of the distal coronary bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIMI 2 flow: refers to delayed or sluggish antegrade flow with complete filling of the&#xD;
           distal territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TIMI 3 flow: refers to normal antegrade flow with complete filling of the distal&#xD;
           territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ The myocardial blush grade (MBG): Myocardial blush grade evaluates contrast density in&#xD;
           the myocardial region of the infarct-related artery compared to regions of&#xD;
           non-infarct-related arteries on coronary angiography. It will be reported at the end of&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBG 0: no myocardial blush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBG 1: minimal myocardial blush or contrast density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBG 2: moderate blush or contrast density, but less than a contralateral or ipsilateral&#xD;
           non infarct-related artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBG 3: normal myocardial blush or contrast density similar to a contralateral or&#xD;
           ipsilateral non infarct-related artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When myocardial blush persisted (&quot;staining&quot;), this phenomenon suggested leakage of the&#xD;
      contrast medium into the extravascular space, and will be graded 0 Angiographic incomplete&#xD;
      reperfusion is defined as TIMI flow grade &lt; 2 or MBG &lt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo transthoracic echocardiography using xMATRIX X5-1 phased array sector&#xD;
      probe (1 - 5 MHz) of the Philips iE33 xMATRIX and EPIQ 7 machines (Philips Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Andover, MA, USA). The blood pressure and heart rate during the study will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standard views will be obtained and analyzed in accordance with the American Society of&#xD;
           Echocardiography guidelines. . The following variables will be noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Left ventricular ejection fraction: calculated by the modified Simpson's rule by&#xD;
                tracing the endocardial border at end-diastole and end-systole in the two-chamber&#xD;
                and four-chamber views.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV): absolute&#xD;
                values and indexed to body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities: wall motion scores for the&#xD;
                seventeen myocardial segments and wall motion score index.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pulsed Doppler mitral inflow: E and A wave velocities, and E/A ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Lateral and medial mitral annular tissue Doppler E', A', and S' wave velocities,&#xD;
                lateral and medial E/E' ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Left atrial volume: absolute and indexed to body surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2D Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) of the left ventricle:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Image acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Images will be acquired using the same probe for conventional echocardiography of&#xD;
                the Philips machine. Digital loops will be acquired from basal, mid, and apical&#xD;
                parasternal short axis views, and apical long-axis, two-chamber and four-chamber&#xD;
                views. Frame rates have to be higher than fifty frames per second.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Strain analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The digitally stored clips will be analyzed offline using TomTec software. For each of&#xD;
           the three apical views, the operator manually identifies three points: two on each side&#xD;
           of the mitral valve, and a third at the apex of the left ventricle (LV). The software&#xD;
           automatically detects the endocardium at end-systole and tracks myocardial motion during&#xD;
           the entire cardiac cycle. The software automatically calculates the peak longitudinal&#xD;
           and circumferential strain for each individual segment in a seventeen-segment left&#xD;
           ventricle model, expressed as bull's eye, and calculates global longitudinal /&#xD;
           circumferential strain by averaging local strains along the entire left ventricle. The&#xD;
           software provides the strain curves for the 16 myocardial segments (excluding the apical&#xD;
           cap). Using a similar process for the short axis views, the software automatically&#xD;
           detects the endocardium and generates peak radial strain for each myocardial segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3D Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) of the left ventricle:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Image acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
                â€¢ Three-dimensional echocardiography Images will be acquired using the same probe&#xD;
                of the Philips machine for conventional echocardiography. Images will be acquired&#xD;
                from the apical window, taking care to include the entire LV cavity within the&#xD;
                pyramidal scan volume. The dataset will be acquired over 4 consecutive cardiac&#xD;
                cycles during a short breath-hold to avoid stitching artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Strain analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Offline analysis of global and regional longitudinal, circumferential, and&#xD;
                     radial strain will be performed using TomTec software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Magnetic Resonance protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies will be performed on a 1.5 T unit (AERA [Siemens Medical System, Erlangen, Germany])&#xD;
      using electrocardiographic triggering and a cardiac-dedicated phase-array coil. For the&#xD;
      assessment of LV volumes and function, steady-state free precession breath-held cine images&#xD;
      (bSSFP) will be acquired in the following orientations: vertical long axis, horizontal long&#xD;
      axis and short axis. Standard parameters are: repetition time/echo time 3.6/1.8 ms; flip&#xD;
      angle 50-70Â°; slice thickness 6 mm; matrix 160 Ã— 256; field of view 350-400 mm; and temporal&#xD;
      resolution 25 msec. The set of short axis images will encompass the left ventricle entirely,&#xD;
      with a between slices gap of 2 mm. For delayed enhancement imaging, a dose of 0.15 mL of&#xD;
      gadolinium per kilogram of body weight will be administered and images will be acquired 10&#xD;
      minutes after contrast injection. The sequence used will be a segmented inversion recovery&#xD;
      gradient-echo pulse sequence using the same image orientations as the cine images. Scan&#xD;
      parameters are: TR/TE 4.01/1.25 ms, flip angle 15Â°, matrix 208 x256, and voxel size 1.6 x&#xD;
      1.3x5 mm3. T1 is adjusted to achieve optimal nulling of myocardial signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All images will be analyzed offline using Philips IntelliSpace Portal V8.0 workstation&#xD;
      (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) for analysis of LV volumes, function, and infarct&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feature tracking strain analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed offline using Segment Medviso software that estimates myocardial&#xD;
      strain curves by computing inter-frame deformation fields using a tracking strategy based on&#xD;
      non-rigid image registration. Instead of myocardial boundaries tracking only, the method uses&#xD;
      the entire image content (i.e. blood pool and entire myocardium) during the optimization&#xD;
      process. Circumferential and radial LV myocardial Lagrangian strain are evaluated on&#xD;
      short-axis cine SSFP images; longitudinal Lagrangian strain is derived from vertical&#xD;
      long-axis ones. First, both endo- and epicardial contours are manually drawn at end diastole&#xD;
      in the long and short-axis. Contours are propagated automatically by the software throughout&#xD;
      the cardiac cycle generating myocardial strain and strain rate curves, with both global and&#xD;
      regional values.28&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infarct size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be determined using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) technique, which uses&#xD;
      half the maximal signal within the scar as the threshold. The total final infarct area is&#xD;
      expressed as percentage of the LV volume, given by the sum of the volume of hyperenhancement&#xD;
      on delayed contrast enhanced images (necrosis/scar) for all slices divided by the sum of the&#xD;
      LV myocardial cross-sectional volumes (%LV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LV volumes, function, and strain analysis will be performed in both the baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up CMR study; the final infarct size will be calculated from the follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second follow-up visit will be scheduled at 6 months of the index event to collect the&#xD;
      following data on clinical outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality (all-cause and cardiac)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recurrent angina assessed by Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Re-infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Target lesion revascularization (TLR): either repeat percutaneous or surgical&#xD;
           revascularization for a lesion anywhere within the stent or the 5-mm borders proximal or&#xD;
           distal to the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Target vessel revascularization (TVR): Revascularization of the same vessel of the&#xD;
           primary event either surgical or percutaneous other than TLR definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Re-hospitalization for heart failure. Data on compliance to medications will be reported&#xD;
           as well. A written informed consent will be obtained from all patient&#xD;
