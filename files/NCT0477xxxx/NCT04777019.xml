  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer aided detection (CADe) algorithms have been developed to overcome human errors and&#xD;
      assist endoscopists in detecting more polyps during colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the accuracy of the novel Pentax Discovery CADe system (Discovery-AI) against&#xD;
      pre-recorded videos of colon polyps of various size, shape and pathology while using videos&#xD;
      of normal colon segments as controls from two different institutes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Details regarding polyp size and location, morphology including Paris classification, optical&#xD;
      assessment, and bowel preparation were prospectively collected and recorded in the online&#xD;
      Redcap software. Final results of polyp histology were also collected. The video library was&#xD;
      then independently reviewed for quality assessment by 3 experienced gastroenterologists.&#xD;
      Videos that passed the initial quality assessment were then independently evaluated using the&#xD;
      Discovery-AI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study was to evaluate overall performance of Discovery-AI system for polyps of&#xD;
      various size, morphology and pathology utilizing a prospectively developed video library.&#xD;

    <description>The video library was developed during screening and surveillance colonoscopy and included details on polyp size, location, morphology, overall Boston bowel preparation score (BBPS) and segmental BBPS. Each video segments ranged from 35 seconds to 75 seconds. Before inclusion, each video was evaluated by 3 expert endoscopists individually to assess overall quality of the video. Quality of video was assessed based on pixel resolution and aspect ratio, bowel preparation, overall speed of withdrawal, colon distension, and adequate mucosal exposure. If the video was deemed of adequate quality by at least 2 endoscopists, it was included in the study cohort.</description>

        Currently, the most commonly used quality marker in conventional colonoscopy (CC) is&#xD;
        adenoma detection rate (ADR), which has been shown to inversely correlate with the&#xD;
        incidence of CRC.3 Although colonoscopy is generally considered to be the most accurate&#xD;
        screening modality, a substantial number of polyps are still missed. Hence population&#xD;
        scheduled for a colonoscopy at either of the institution were part of the project.&#xD;
