  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of LP-168 in subjects with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory B-cell malignancies. LP-168 is a small molecule inhibitor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives for the study are to assess the safety and tolerability profile,&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      LP-168 administered once or twice daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL); and to&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-168 in adult subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect&#xD;
      of LP-168 on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM,&#xD;
      FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is declared and the RP2D is established, additional subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      a cohort expansion phase (Phase 1b).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A classic &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used to establish the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), MTD, and RP2D. Three to six subjects per treatment cohort will be assigned to receive sequentially higher oral doses of LP-168 on a once or twice daily schedule for 28 days (a &quot;Cycle&quot;), starting at a dose of 100 mg/day. Once all subjects in a given cohort have reached Cycle 1 Day 28, these data will be reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) for decisions on dose escalation for a new dose cohort. Subjects will receive once-daily or twice-daily oral dose of LP-168 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another criterion for withdrawal from treatment is noted.</intervention_model_description>
