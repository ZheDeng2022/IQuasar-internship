  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study how the brain learn to avoid certain stimuli&#xD;
      or situations using an experimental paradigm. The big goal is to measure brain responses and&#xD;
      subject's feelings and expectations when they are learning to actively avoid experimental&#xD;
      stimuli, and how fear extinction learning and monetary cost can change how and when subjects&#xD;
      are to avoid.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to study the neural correlates of avoidance learning using a recently&#xD;
      validated conditioning and active avoidance paradigm (CAAP). The overarching objective is to&#xD;
      measure the neural correlates of active avoidance, and how fear extinction learning and&#xD;
      monetary cost modulate these avoidance responses. Participants will include trauma-exposed&#xD;
      healthy controls (TEHC), and participants with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
      Avoidance is common and often hinders the progression and success of extinction-based&#xD;
      exposure therapy in PTSD. The data to be gathered in this study will enable us to probe&#xD;
      neural mechanisms of avoidance, extinction, and decision-making to avoid or not, in addition&#xD;
      to understanding the impact of cost on avoidance decision-making. These data will provide a&#xD;
      more integrated platform for the understanding of the mechanisms of avoidance in both&#xD;
      trauma-exposed healthy controls and PTSD psychopathology, which has important implications&#xD;
      for treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Skin Conductance Response will be collected from subjects during the entire course of the experiment, inside or outside of the fMRI scanner, to measure stress/sweat level. SCR is used by many psychological experiments to measure the participants stress/sweat, or level of anxiety in a particular moment, or in response to a specific cue.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a 3T MRI scan during the both experimental. All standard sequences and RF coils which we intend to use at the Center for Brain Imaging are FDA certified.fMRI data will be collected from subjects during the entire course of the 2-day experiment inside the fMRI scanner. fMRI data, including blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses, is used in neuroimaging studies assess neural correlate activations and observe the increase/decrease in activation of a particular brain area in response to a specific cue.</description>

    <description>After the initial screening / baseline assessment visit, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder participants will undergo two Experimental Visits, which included participation in an emotional learning paradigm and an fMRI scan over the course of two consecutive days. Participants will be asked to look at pictures on a computer screen to measure physiological response physiological response (skin conductance response) and brain responses using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) machine. These two visits will be scheduled within a month from the baseline assessment visit.</description>

    <description>Participants will be administered increasing intensities of mild electric shock via electrodes connected to the foot. New Biopac stimulators that can deliver higher shock intensity, provided participants agreement will be used to assure adequate conditioning levels. Stimulation is measures in milliamps (mA), and each delivered stimulation will be 0.5 seconds long (500 milliseconds). To colored (blue, red, &amp; yellow) light stimuli (CS). The light stimulus is followed by a shock or no shock depending on color (blue &amp; red - shock; yellow - no shock).</description>

    <description>Via button pressing. Only one stimulus-CS (i.e. blue colored light) will enable control over experiencing the shock: the participant can press the button during the first 2 seconds of the light presentation to avoid the shock. CS stays on for 6 seconds after the button is pressed. If the button is pressed, no shock will be administered. After 6 seconds, the light ends and the relief epoch ('good feeling') begins. Pressing the button to the other CS (i.e. red colored light) will not prevent the shock from occurring- the participant will still receive the mild shocked at CS offset (after 6 seconds). The third CS (i.e. yellow light) will serve as a control CS, so while the button is available, pressing it or not is of no consequence.</description>
