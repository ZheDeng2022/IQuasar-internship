  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orofacial pain is diagnosed for more than 1.9 percent of general population and for 0.3&#xD;
      percent origin of the facial pain is unknown. Commonly atypical facial pain is treated as a&#xD;
      neurological condition without an emotional or psychiatric evaluation. Since atypical pain&#xD;
      and mood affective disorders can be related, patients do not receive proper care for this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between atypical facial pain syndrome&#xD;
      and affective mood disorders. We aim to assess patients' with no diagnosed organic pathology&#xD;
      tendency towards anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and one of big five personality traits&#xD;
      through self-rating questionnaires. We will compare the gathered data with biosensors from&#xD;
      iMotions software.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients evaluate their spontaneous episodic pain before assessing self-evaluating questionnaires. Patient pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale of 0-10, zero being no pain, ten being an unbearable/unimaginable pain. The higher score may lead to a possibilty of developing mood disorders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital anxiety and depression scale is a fourteen-item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The anxiety and depression subscales each range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety/depression complains. Patients were defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score was 8 or more in the corresponding subscale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh sleep quality index</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index contains 19 self-rated questions which measures seven aspects of sleep: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0 indicates no difficulty, while 3 indicates severe difficulty). The seven component scores are then summed to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points (0 indicating no difficulty, and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all the seven areas of sleep quality).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Big Five personality traits</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Big five personality traits questionnaire is a 25-item questionnaire compiled from Goldberg et al. 1999. Respondent chooses between a pair of adjectives and chooses an according score from one to seven. All personality dimensions are evaluated separately from specific pairs of adjectives and sum of these pairs scores. Lithuanian version is adapted from A.Buneviƒçius (2006).</description>

    <measure>Facial expression analysis. Duration of neutral valence.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial expression analysis. Total duration.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment score gathered once (Day 1)</time_frame>
