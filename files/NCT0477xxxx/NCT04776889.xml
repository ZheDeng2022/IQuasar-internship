      Aim: The role of surgical castration and rosuvastatin treatment on lipid profile and lipid&#xD;
      metabolism related markers was evaluated for their prognostic significance in metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mPC) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 70 newly diagnosed castrated mPC patients treated with castration were&#xD;
      recruited and divided into two groups: Group I included 30 patients and served as control&#xD;
      (statin non-users) while group II included 40 patients treated with Rosuvastatin (20 mg/day)&#xD;
      for 6 months and served as statin users. Prostate specific antigen (PSA), epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR), Caveolin-1, lipid profile (LDL, HDL, triglycerides and cholesterol)&#xD;
      and lipid metabolism related markers (aldoketoreductase (AKR1C4), HMGCoA reductase, ABCA1,&#xD;
      and SLDL RP1) were measured at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. Overall survival (OS) were&#xD;
      analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and COX regression for prognostic significance.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted at the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI), Cairo University. The study ID BB1901-30303 was approved by the Institutional Human&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of NCI, Egypt, Number 00004025, with IRB review Number 201819019.3&#xD;
      and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with informed consent was taken&#xD;
      from all participants. The study included 70 Egyptian metastatic prostate cancer (m PC)&#xD;
      patients who were treated and followed up in the NCI hospital in the period from January 2019&#xD;
      till December 2020. Patients were recruited from January to June 2019, then followed-up to&#xD;
      December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were withdrawn from all patients at baseline to monitor parameters under&#xD;
      investigation. Then, all patients were subjected to surgical castration and divided in to two&#xD;
      groups. Group I included 30 patients and served as control (statin non-users). Group II&#xD;
      included 40 patients treated with Rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 months and served as statin&#xD;
      users. Then, blood samples were withdrawn from the two groups after 3 and 6 months. Full&#xD;
      demographic information and clinicopatholologic characteristics were obtained for each&#xD;
      patient including; age, comorbid diseases, initial complain symptoms, family history of&#xD;
      malignancy, smoking status and performance status. Also, serum level of prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gleason score and metastasis sites were&#xD;
      recorded. The treatment modality and decision making were according to NCI guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected whole blood samples into k.EDTA tubes were incubated at room temperature for 15&#xD;
      minutes and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1500 rpm. The plasma supernatant was carefully&#xD;
      collected and freezed until analysis. Plasma protein concentrations of some lipid&#xD;
      reprogramming and prostate cancer aggressiveness markers were measured. Kits were probed&#xD;
      against human soluble low density lipoprotein receptor related protein -1 (SLDLRP-1;&#xD;
      catalogue number: SL2705Hu), human ATP binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA-1; catalogue&#xD;
      number: SL0314Hu), Human Aldoketo-reductase family 1 member C4 (AKR-1C4; catalogue number:&#xD;
      SL3032Hu), human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co-enzyme A reductase (HMGCR; catalogue number:&#xD;
      SL3030Hu), human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; catalogue number: SL0665Hu) and&#xD;
      human Caveolin-1 (Cav-1; catalogue number: SL0427Hu). Procedures were carried out in&#xD;
      accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of the markers in plasma&#xD;
      samples was calculated by comparing the OD of the samples to the corresponding plotted&#xD;
      standard curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analysis were performed using The Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24. Normal distribution and variance homogeneity of data were&#xD;
      assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene's tests, respectively. Numerical data were&#xD;
      summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical data were summarized as&#xD;
      count and percentage. Patients were stratified according to their clinicopathological factors&#xD;
      and for more than two subgroups of patients, the change in measured parameters were tested&#xD;
      for significance using Kruskal-Wallis test and the pairwise comparison were done using&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney. The change in proteins concentration over time was tested using Friedman test&#xD;
      of significance. Spearman correlation analysis was used to test all possible correlations.&#xD;
      Kaplan- Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate as well as&#xD;
      median levels of OS after two years of follow up. OS was calculated from date of diagnosis to&#xD;
      date of death by any cause. Living patients or patients lost to follow-up were censored on&#xD;
      the last known alive date. The hazardous effect of death or progression Cox proportion hazard&#xD;
      Model was used to evaluate the hazardous effect of different clinicopathological and proteins&#xD;
      levels on death and progression. All P-values are two-sided. P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
