      An open label RCT assessing the efficacy of a combined treatment approach for PTSD, using&#xD;
      Ketamine infusions and online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To introduce a previously untreated patient population with PTSD to new therapeutic&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) To provide new insights into the functional role of Glutamate in affective disorders as&#xD;
      well as in learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) To explore the utility of pharmacologically-enhanced psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is an open label randomized control trial assessing the efficacy of a&#xD;
      combined treatment of sub-anaesthetic IV Ketamine in conjunction with online CBT (eCBT). In&#xD;
      the study, 20 participants with refractory PTSD will be randomly assigned either to an&#xD;
      experimental group receiving a combination of Ketamine and eCBT over 14 weeks, or they will&#xD;
      be assigned to a 14-week waitlist-control group (at the end of which they would receive the&#xD;
      experimental treatment). Both groups will be assessed for symptoms of PTSD and comorbid&#xD;
      disorders before treatment, at the 7-week halfway point, and at the end of the 14 week&#xD;
      experimental period. Symptoms of PTSD and comorbid disorders for participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group are expected to improve significantly more than participants in the&#xD;
      waitlist-control.&#xD;
