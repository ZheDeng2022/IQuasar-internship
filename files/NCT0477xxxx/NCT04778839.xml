      A Phase I Study of Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion To Evaluate the&#xD;
      Safety、Tolerability、Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of Paclitaxel Micelles for&#xD;
      Injection in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. The first part is dose escalation and the second&#xD;
      part is dose Expansion.During the course of dose escalation, 18-27 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      to assess the safety、tolerability、pharmacokinetics、preliminary efficacy ,and determine the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of Paclitaxel Micelles for&#xD;
      Injection, and explore phase II clinical dosages. The second part will be adjusted according&#xD;
      to the result of the first part. It will be divided into 4 groups, including advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer group, ovarian cancer group, non-small cell lung cancer group and gastric cancer&#xD;
      group, with 20 subjects in each group, to further evaluate the safety, tolerance, PK and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel micelle.&#xD;
