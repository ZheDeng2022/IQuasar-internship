      This study is a randomised, double-blind, three-arm, parallel group, single-dose study. A&#xD;
      total of 201 healthy subjects aged 18-55 years will be randomised 1:1:1 to receive a single&#xD;
      dose of either SB17, EU sourced Stelara®, or US sourced Stelara®. All investigational&#xD;
      products (IPs) will be administered subcutaneously in the abdomen.&#xD;
