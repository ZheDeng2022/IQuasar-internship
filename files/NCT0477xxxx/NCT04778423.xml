      This project will answer the overarching research question &quot;What is the feasibility of&#xD;
      developing and implementing AVATAR therapy to reduce the power of the eating disorder voice&#xD;
      in patients with eating disorders?&quot;. AVATAR therapy for eating disorders has been developed&#xD;
      based on AVATAR therapy for psychosis. The feasibility of using AVATAR therapy in eating&#xD;
      disorders will be tested using non-concurrent multiple baselines single case experimental&#xD;
      design. The first stage (A1) will involve participants being randomly allocated to either a&#xD;
      two, three or four week-baseline. The second will be the intervention phase (B) where&#xD;
      participants will receive the AVATAR treatment which will last approximately 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      third stage (A2) will be a 4-week follow-up period after the intervention phase, where&#xD;
      participants will also complete a qualitative interview.&#xD;

      This project will answer the overarching research question &quot;What is the feasibility of&#xD;
      developing and implementing AVATAR therapy to reduce the power of the eating disorder voice&#xD;
      in patients with eating disorders?&quot;. The aims are: 1) To use a collaborative approach that&#xD;
      involves patients, carers and clinicians to adapt the AVATAR therapy in psychosis for&#xD;
      patients with eating disorders. 2) To assess the feasibility of using this therapy in eating&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To use a collaborative approach that involves patients, carers and clinicians to adapt&#xD;
      the AVATAR therapy in psychosis for patients with eating disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Two collaborative workshops will be organised with a total of 16 people with lived&#xD;
      experience of the illness (patients or carers) and 16 clinicians (approximately eight&#xD;
      people/workshop), to review the contents of AVATAR therapy for eating disorders developed&#xD;
      based on AVATAR therapy for psychosis. We will describe the structure and content of the&#xD;
      therapy manual and will encourage the members of the group to provide feedback. The workshop&#xD;
      will be video recorded. We will revise the therapy manual based on an iterative process of&#xD;
      feedback and review. Outcome: the outcome will consist of a revised version of the AVATAR&#xD;
      therapy manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To assess the feasibility of using AVATAR therapy in eating disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      General procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and flyers placed at South&#xD;
      London and Maudsley Hospital NHS Trust. They will be able to contact the researchers involved&#xD;
      in the study by email. The researchers will then send the study information sheet by email&#xD;
      and will assess eligibility to take part, should the participants wish to take part. Once&#xD;
      eligibility is confirmed, participants will received a link to Qualtrics. Survey settings&#xD;
      will eliminate the possibility of missing or repeated data. Participants will freely access&#xD;
      the survey via a web link on the Internet. The online survey will include completion of the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires (described below). At the end of the intervention, and four-week&#xD;
      follow-up, participants will receive two more links to Qualtrics, to complete the&#xD;
      end-of-intervention and follow-up questionnaires, respectively. Following completion of the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaires, participants will be invited to take part in the AVATAR therapy&#xD;
      (described below), which will be delivered by one of the clinical researchers in the team.&#xD;
      AVATAR therapy will be delivered remotely using a secure encrypted video-call system which&#xD;
      will enable the delivery of the therapy in accordance with the clinical manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The project will use a non-concurrent multiple baselines single case experimental&#xD;
      design (SCED) divided into three stages (A1BA2). The first stage (A1) will involve&#xD;
      participants being randomly allocated to either a two, three or four week-baseline. The&#xD;
      second will be the intervention phase (B) where participants will receive the AVATAR&#xD;
      treatment which will last approximately 6 weeks. The third stage (A2) will be a 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up period after the intervention phase, where participants will also complete a&#xD;
      qualitative interview. Participants will be randomly allocated to variable baselines using a&#xD;
      random number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose collecting data from 50 individuals. This is supported by scholars who suggest&#xD;
      numbers ranging from 24 to 50 for feasibility studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVATAR therapy for eating disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy will be delivered by the members of the research team. In the first session&#xD;
      (assessment), following a clinical assessment of the role of the eating disorder voice,&#xD;
      participants will create a computerised representation of the eating disorder voice (avatar)&#xD;
      on a computer. They will be able to manipulate the facial and voice characteristics of the&#xD;
      avatar and will be asked to provide examples of the critical eating disorder comments most&#xD;
      often spoken by the avatar. In the following sessions (6-8 therapy sessions), participants&#xD;
      will interact with the avatar displayed on the computer screen for 5-10 minutes. The&#xD;
      therapist will facilitate the dialogue by speaking the avatar's voice as well as their own&#xD;
      (therapist) voice from a different room. The therapist will have a video link with the&#xD;
      participant and therefore will be able to monitor the participants' responses to the avatar.&#xD;
      The participant will be able to press a &quot;stop&quot; button should they want to stop the session.&#xD;
      The main goal during the interaction with the avatar is for participants to stand up to the&#xD;
      critical comments made by the avatar and build a sense of power, control and self-awareness&#xD;
      in the context of the eating disorder voice. The sessions will be conducted remotely, using a&#xD;
      personal laptop or computer. This will provide patients with the opportunity to practise&#xD;
      answering back to the eating disorder voice during a meal, a time at which the eating&#xD;
      disorder voice is loudest. The content of the sessions has been adapted from AVATAR for&#xD;
      psychosis and is subject to further review as outlined in Research Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Recruitment of 80% or more of the targeted sample size in 18 months, (2) Adherence to&#xD;
      protocol: 80% retention rate at 6-8 weeks (end of therapy), (3) Adherence to AVATAR therapy:&#xD;
      80% of patients completing at least 5 sessions (based on average attendance of 5 sessions in&#xD;
      the psychosis trial), (4) Participants' satisfaction with the AVATAR therapy (80% of&#xD;
      participants reporting a satisfaction rating of 7 or over, on a Likert scale ranging from 0&#xD;
      &quot;not satisfied at all&quot; to 10 &quot;very satisfied&quot;), (5) Estimation of effect size and standard&#xD;
      deviation of change in power of the eating disorder voice and eating disorder symptoms. In&#xD;
      addition to these parameters, we will record any issues related to the technical functioning&#xD;
      or operation of the intervention.&#xD;
