      While gastroenterologists care for many of the pediatric patients with Functional&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), the majority of the burden continues to be borne by&#xD;
      general pediatricians, especially with respect to initial diagnosis. Unfortunately, FGIDs are&#xD;
      often diagnosed incorrectly by primary care providers, and patients often wait months to&#xD;
      years before a correct diagnosis is made, and effective treatment is begun. Furthermore,&#xD;
      primary care providers are often unaware of recent guideline changes or the evidence base for&#xD;
      children with FGIDs, leading to overuse of testing, inappropriate or ineffective treatment,&#xD;
      and increased costs. Given this information, it is essential that we develop interventions&#xD;
      that target pediatric primary care providers to improve their care for children with FGIDs.&#xD;
      The investigators propose that using a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that&#xD;
      incorporates the Rome IV criteria for diagnosis and evidence-based care for FGIDs will&#xD;
      improve the (1) accuracy of diagnosis and (2)_ effectiveness of clinical care. A CDSS has&#xD;
      advantages with respect to guideline adherence and automated diagnosis, because it can&#xD;
      provide focused, real-time, patient-specific data to the clinician. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that automation of screening, diagnosis, and management of FGIDs using the Rome&#xD;
      IV criteria will result in improved resolution of FGIDs (primary outcome), as well as&#xD;
      decreased utilization of medical services (secondary outcomes). This hypothesis will be&#xD;
      tested utilizing a randomized controlled trial. The intervention clinic sites will be&#xD;
      provided access to both the FGIDs Screening Module and the Treatment Module. The control&#xD;
      clinics will have the FGIDs Screening Module. However, control clinics will not have access&#xD;
      to the FGIDs Treatment Module. These clinic sites will be given access to the pre-screener&#xD;
      form section of the module, so that providers are made aware of a positive screen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are extremely common in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, and represent a wide range of disorders that are related to the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, but have no clear structural, anatomic, or histopathologic cause. FGIDs represent an&#xD;
      enormous burden on patients and families, and patients with these functional disorders have&#xD;
      much higher health care utilization and related costs. As there are no biochemical markers or&#xD;
      structural abnormalities that can be used to diagnose these disorders in children&#xD;
      objectively, FGIDs are diagnosed according to the symptom-based Rome criteria. While&#xD;
      gastroenterologists care for many of the pediatric patients with FGIDs, the majority of the&#xD;
      burden continues to be borne by general pediatricians, especially with respect to initial&#xD;
      diagnosis. Unfortunately, FGIDs are often diagnosed incorrectly by primary care providers,&#xD;
      and patients often wait months to years before a correct diagnosis is made, and effective&#xD;
      treatment is begun. Furthermore, primary care providers are often unaware of recent guideline&#xD;
      changes or the evidence base for children with FGIDs, leading to overuse of testing,&#xD;
      inappropriate or ineffective treatment, and increased costs. Given this information, it is&#xD;
      essential to develop interventions that target pediatric primary care providers to improve&#xD;
      their care for children with FGIDs. This study proposes that using a Clinical Decision&#xD;
      Support System (CDSS) that incorporates the Rome IV criteria for diagnosis and evidence-based&#xD;
      care for FGIDs will improve the (1) accuracy of diagnosis and (2)_ effectiveness of clinical&#xD;
      care. A CDSS has advantages with respect to guideline adherence and automated diagnosis,&#xD;
      because it can provide focused, real-time, patient-specific data to the clinician. Studies of&#xD;
      barriers to guideline implementation have shown multiple factors at work: unfamiliarity with&#xD;
      a guideline, lack of self-efficacy, or difficulty implementing the guideline components&#xD;
      within the current workflow of a practice. CDSS can overcome many of these barriers because&#xD;
      they are integrated with systems that routinely store and retrieve patient information and&#xD;
      can improve workflow by providing clinicians with patient-specific advice at the time of the&#xD;
      patient visit. The study investigators hypothesize that automation of screening, diagnosis,&#xD;
      and management of FGIDs using the Rome IV criteria will result in improved resolution of&#xD;
      FGIDs (primary outcome), as well as decreased utilization of medical services (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). This hypothesis will be tested utilizing a randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      intervention clinic sites will be provided access to both the FGIDs Screening Module and the&#xD;
      Treatment Module. The control clinics will have the FGIDs Screening Module. However, control&#xD;
      clinics will not have access to the FGIDs Treatment Module. These clinic sites will be given&#xD;
      access to the pre-screener form section of the module, so that providers are made aware of a&#xD;
      positive screen for a FGID. The investigators have chosen not to have an arm without provider&#xD;
      notification due to concern that identification of symptoms without notifying the patient's&#xD;
      provider represented an ethical concern. If anything, this will bias towards a null result.&#xD;
      Since FGIDs have both a high rate of relapse, and a high rate of spontaneous resolution, it&#xD;
      is necessary to assess the pattern of symptoms across multiple time points. As such, we plan&#xD;
      to gather various data from parents/patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12-months via phone interview.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will assess parental satisfaction with the screening and treatment of&#xD;
      their child's particular FGID at the 3-month phone interview. For assessment of health care&#xD;
      utilization, the study will look at the following variables in the 12 months after initial&#xD;
      Rome IV screening positive: a) outpatient sick visits for any complaint; b) outpatient sick&#xD;
      visits with an associated GI billing code; c) visits to statewide providers, including&#xD;
      inpatient hospital stays, outpatient clinic visits, and emergency room visits; d) GI-related&#xD;
      testing and procedures; e) use of any medications prescribed to treat Rome IV diagnoses.&#xD;
      These data will be obtained from multiple sources including the EMR, and Indiana Network for&#xD;
      Patient Care (INPC).&#xD;
