      Timely and accurately predicting the occurrence of sepsis and actively intervening in&#xD;
      treatment may effectively improve the survival and cure rate of patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using machine learning and natural language processing, we want to develop models to 1)&#xD;
      identify all children with sepsis admitted to hospital and 2) stratify them to distinguish&#xD;
      those who are at high risk of death b) How will you undertake your work? From Shanghai&#xD;
      hospitals anf MIMIC III, we will develop a very large dataset of patient admissions for all&#xD;
      medical conditions including sepsis from the electronic health record. This data will include&#xD;
      both structured data such as age, gender, medications, laboratory values, co-morbidities as&#xD;
      well as unstructured data such as discharge summaries and physician notes. Using the dataset,&#xD;
      we will train a model through natural language processing and machine learning to be able to&#xD;
      identify people admitted with sepsis and identify those patients who will be at high risk of&#xD;
      death. We will test the ability of these models to determine our predictive accuracies. We&#xD;
      will then test these models at other institutions.&#xD;

      Introduction:Timely and accurately predicting the occurrence of sepsis and actively&#xD;
      intervening in treatment may effectively improve the survival and cure rate of patients with&#xD;
      sepsis. There have been a large number of research results on the prediction of sepsis&#xD;
      produced by two methods: the sepsis detection and evaluation method based on clinical scoring&#xD;
      mechanisms and the sepsis detection method based on machine learning model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Reasonable and effective data pre-processing can significantly improve the&#xD;
      timeliness and accuracy of early warning models of sepsis. Given the problems of high time&#xD;
      dispersion, uneven distribution, and large differences of common sepsis prediction modeling&#xD;
      indicators, the study proposed a method of hybrid interpolation based on time window-related&#xD;
      sepsis indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:The study designed the traditional data interpolation method based on linear, MGP,&#xD;
      average, nearest neighbour and the hybrid interpolation method (CTWH) based on correlation&#xD;
      time window (CTW) proposed in the study for experimental comparison. Experiments were&#xD;
      performed respectively in sample sets with no experimental data removal and sample sets with&#xD;
      90% missing values removal. By comparing with the performance of the existing sepsis&#xD;
      indicator interpolation methods on the same baseline model, the effectiveness of the method&#xD;
      was proven from the accuracy and timeliness of the prediction results. In the end, the&#xD;
      results of the experimental method were analyzed and explained from a clinical perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the characteristics of high dispersion, uneven distribution, and large differences&#xD;
      between features of commonly used indicators in sepsis prediction models, this study proposed&#xD;
      an efficient data interpolation strategy. After elimination of missing data of 90% and 0%,&#xD;
      the interpolation method proposed in this study performed better than the existing methods&#xD;
      like mean interpolation and linear interpolation, KNN, MGP on the static baseline and time&#xD;
      series models. At the same time, this method also provided an idea to explore the length of&#xD;
      the interpolation window, and supported the prospective study of missing value interpolation&#xD;
      and data pre-processing.&#xD;
