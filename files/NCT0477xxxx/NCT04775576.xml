  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the volume management methods performed by using conventional&#xD;
      method and PVI monitoring in intraoperative fluid treatment during bilateral&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy operation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative fluid management is very important in terms of postoperative organ perfusion&#xD;
      and complications. While various complications such as acute renal failure, hypotension,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, anastomotic leakage can be seen due to intraoperative hypovolemia; Hypervolemia&#xD;
      can cause pulmonary edema, postoperative pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation need,&#xD;
      delayed wound healing, gastrointestinal system (GIS) edema and decreased intestinal motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing the quality of intraoperative fluid therapy is a situation that may affect the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of patients due to all these reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional fluid management is widely used in clinical practice. In this method, the fluid&#xD;
      need of the patient is decided according to pulse, arterial blood pressure, central venous&#xD;
      pressure, urine output and clinical condition. In the targeted fluid therapy method, besides&#xD;
      static parameters such as pulse, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure; Dynamic&#xD;
      parameters such as Stroke volume variability (SVV), pulse pressure variability (PPV), pleth&#xD;
      variability index (PVI), continuous hemoglobin (SpHb) are also used noninvasively. Studies&#xD;
      related to SpHb, which provides noninvasive continuous hemoglobin monitoring in accordance&#xD;
      with pulse oximetry, show that there is a decrease in blood product transfusion compared to&#xD;
      cases managed with conventional laboratory follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary goal is to compare the control group (conventional fluid management) with the PVI&#xD;
      group (Pleth Variability Index and SpHb guided targeted fluid management) protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, we aim to compare the amount of crystalloids and blood products, blood&#xD;
      lactate, serum creatinine and electrolyte levels applied in the intraoperative period as a&#xD;
      result of both protocols. Our secondary aim will be to compare the length of stay in the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a single center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study.&#xD;
      It was aimed to evaluate fluid therapy during elective total abdominal hysterectomy and&#xD;
      bilateral salpingooferectomy operation. Before the operation, patients will be divided into 2&#xD;
      groups randomly. For randomization, the automatic system on the randomization.com website&#xD;
      will be used. All patients included in the study will be premedicated with 1mg of midazolam&#xD;
      after monitoring with pulse, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation. Then, invasive&#xD;
      arterial cannulation will be applied and continuous blood pressure monitoring will be done.&#xD;
      In the PVI group, non-invasive PVI and SpHb monitoring will also be performed from the other&#xD;
      upper extremity without arterial cannulation. After two minutes of preoxygenation, anesthesia&#xD;
      induction will be started. Anesthesia induction doses used routinely in our clinic include iv&#xD;
      2 mg / kg propofol, 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium and 2 μg / kg fentanyl. Sevoflurane will be&#xD;
      administered by inhalation during anesthesia maintenance after tracheal intubation.&#xD;
      Initially, all patients will be given 250 ml intravenous crystalloid. Then 8-10 ml / kg /&#xD;
      hour iv fluid maintenance will be started for the control group. If the mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) is &lt;65 mmHg or the decrease in MAP is more than 20%, 250 ml iv colloid will be&#xD;
      applied. If the decrease in MAP continues despite the colloid bolus or if the MAP is below 65&#xD;
      mmHg, noradrenaline infusion will be started. Patients in the PVI group will be started on&#xD;
      maintenance fluid therapy at 2-3 ml / kg / hour. In addition to standard monitoring, if PVI&#xD;
      is &lt;13% and OAB≥65mmHg in measurements made with PVI, current fluid therapy will continue. If&#xD;
      PVI is &lt;13% and MAP &lt;65 mmHg, noradrenaline infusion will be started. If PVI is&gt; 13% and&#xD;
      OAB≥65 mmHg, 250 ml iv colloid bolus will be administered, and iv colloid bolus will be&#xD;
      continued until the PVI is &lt;13% in the 5-minute follow-ups. If PVI&gt; 13% and MAP &lt;65 mmHg,&#xD;
      patients should receive 250 ml i.v. colloid infusion will be given, if MAP &lt;65mmHg continues&#xD;
      in 5 minutes follow-up, 250 ml i.v. Colloid and noradrenaline infusion will be started and&#xD;
      repeated until the OAB≥65 mmHg and PVI &lt;13%. The decision to transfuse in both groups will be&#xD;
      taken under the guidance of the European Society of Anesthesia (ESA) perioperative bleeding&#xD;
      management guidelines. In the control group, hemorrhage will be monitored with laboratory Hb&#xD;
      values, while SpHb and laboratory Hb values will be evaluated together in the PVI group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the ASA1-2-3 risk group who will undergo elective total abdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
      and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy under general anesthesia, between the ages of 18-65, will&#xD;
      be included in this study. The study will be conducted with 80 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      arterial blood gas, lactate concentration at hourly intervals, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum&#xD;
      urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chlorine values, hospital stay, hourly intervals,&#xD;
      intraoperative hourly and postoperatively 24 hours later, The amount of crystalloids and&#xD;
      blood products used intraoperatively, postoperative volume dependent complications and their&#xD;
      frequency will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by anesthesiologists in the operating rooms located in the&#xD;
      central campus of our hospital.&#xD;
