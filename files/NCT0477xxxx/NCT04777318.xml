  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proprioceptive sensitivity decreases in individuals with neck pain compared to those without&#xD;
      neck pain. While organizing the treatment program of patients with neck pain, evaluation of&#xD;
      cervical proprioception and its addition to the treatment have gained importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the effects of muscle energy technique applied to patients&#xD;
      with chronic neck pain on cervical proprioception and motor control and to compare the&#xD;
      results of muscle energy technique application with cervical mobilization techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spondylosis (SS) is defined as chronic disc degeneration due to aging caused by&#xD;
      degenerative changes in the muscles, tendons, joints or bones of the neck or shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of cervical spondylosis includes various factors such as bad posture, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, neck strain, and overload in sports or occupational activities. Proprioception is&#xD;
      defined as sensory feedback that contributes to muscle sensation, postural balance and joint&#xD;
      stability. It is possible that loss of cervical proprioception and motor control affect&#xD;
      segmental stability. This increases the risk of injury following minor trauma. It has been&#xD;
      reported that proprioceptive sensitivity is worse in individuals with neck pain compared to&#xD;
      those without neck pain, and the degree of the disorder is related to the severity of pain.&#xD;
      Some evidence-based studies have shown that manual techniques improve proprioception and&#xD;
      motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that Muscle Energy Technique (MET), which has gained popularity in recent&#xD;
      years, increases cervical joint mobility and reduces pain in patients with chronic neck pain.&#xD;
      MET is a form a manual therapy which uses a muscle's own energy in the form of gentle&#xD;
      isometric contractions to relax the muscles via autogenic or reciprocal inhibition mechanism.&#xD;
      It has been reported that MET stimulates joint proprioceptors, creates a different movement&#xD;
      activity in the area of proprioceptive disorder and allows the central nervous system to&#xD;
      normalize proprioceptive and motor coordination in this segment. The effect of MET on&#xD;
      cervical proprioception in patients with cervical spondylosis has not been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active participation of the patient in movement is extremely important in proprioceptive&#xD;
      feedback, motor control and motor learning. For this reason, it will be useful to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of MET, which includes active muscle contractions of the patient, on the&#xD;
      proprioceptive sensation and to compare the results with more passive applications&#xD;
      (manipulation or mobilization) in terms of determining the optimal treatment method.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Individuals between the ages of 40-65 diagnosed with cervical spondylosis will be included in the study. The sample size was determined as 66 subjects, 22 in each group, under the assumption that the one-way ANOVA test would be applied in the comparison between groups and the effect size would be f = 0.40, α = 0.05, β = 0.20.&#xD;
Considering the possibility of using the nonparametric equivalent instead of the parametric ANOVA test in the analyzes that will start after the data collection phase, this initial sample size was increased by 15% and corrected to 76 people. Considering that there may be people who may leave the study, this sample size was increased by 25% and the final sample size was determined as 95 people.</masking_description>

    <description>In addition to conventional therapy, the muscle energy technique will be applied to the individuals in the second group at the same frequency. Muscle energy technique will be applied to the upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoideus , scalene (anterior-medius-posterior) and levator scapula muscles. According to the MET post-isometric relaxation method, each muscle will be applied as one set (each set includes three repetitions). The patient will be asked to perform a 7-second isometric contraction corresponding to 20% of the maximum isometric contraction force in the area where the limitation is felt. After the application, the patient will be asked to breathe and relax. The stretching will be kept beyond the resistance barrier for 30 seconds and then the technique will be repeated by taking the neck back to the barrier point.</description>
