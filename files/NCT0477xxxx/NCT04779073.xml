  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to determine the physiotherapists' knowledge and qualifications of&#xD;
      CPR, their beliefs about the use of CPR in an emergency, and their perception of CPR&#xD;
      competence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary arrest is a sudden stop of breathing and circulation. Resuscitation is an&#xD;
      effort to restore spontaneous heartbeat, respiration and brain functions .Although it is&#xD;
      actually a standard algorithm, the approach to cardiopulmonary resuscitation can vary among&#xD;
      practitioners.Resuscitation success; practitioner, the state of the arrested person,It&#xD;
      depends on several factors such as the resources and equipment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main issue in the success of the resuscitation; how quickly the scene can be reached and&#xD;
      how effective CPR can be performed.Guidelines on CPR, including resuscitation information,&#xD;
      are updated by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Resuscitation Council&#xD;
      (ERC) in various time periods.Although there are some differences in resuscitation practices,&#xD;
      the importance of early diagnosis and rapid intervention are emphasized in both guidelines.&#xD;
      The shortest possible time for the patient to return to life after cardiac arrest Basic Life&#xD;
      Support (TYD) and Advanced Life Support (ADS) should be initiated in the period.TYD is&#xD;
      applied by non-professional but trained individuals without any material or medication. On&#xD;
      the other hand, IDE is applied by a professional team of health professionals using the&#xD;
      necessary materials and medicines. It is possible to encounter a cardiac arrest anywhere&#xD;
      inside or outside the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that healthcare workers have been trained on TYD and VBS is an important factor in&#xD;
      increasing the chances of arrest cases to come back to life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only two published studies on the attitudes of physiotherapists towards CPR have been&#xD;
      identified in the literature. One of these was a study involving 140 hospital-based&#xD;
      physiotherapists who investigated their knowledge, attitudes and practices in CPR in&#xD;
      South-West Nigeria. The authors found that 64% of respondents had insufficient to average&#xD;
      theoretical knowledge about CPR and only 45% of respondents held a positive attitude about&#xD;
      the importance of CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second study was conducted with 2,614 healthcare professionals from two Swedish&#xD;
      hospitals, where participants filled out a questionnaire about physical / mental discomfort&#xD;
      and attitudes towards CPR before and after training. A total of 228 assistant health&#xD;
      professionals were included in the sample, including physiotherapists, occupational&#xD;
      therapists, psychologists, social workers, and biomedical analysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthcare professional groups relied more on CPR knowledge after training; however, one&#xD;
      limitation of this is that they do not test pre- or post-practice CPR skills. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the applicability of the findings was limited, as the group of physiotherapists was an&#xD;
      unidentified subset of 228 allied health professionals in the study.&#xD;
