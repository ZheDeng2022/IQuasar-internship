      The primary objective of this study is to measure the success rate of lumbar fusion in&#xD;
      subjects at 12 months when instrumented lumbar arthrodesis is performed using OssiMend&#xD;
      Bioactive Moldable as the bone grafting material. The primary endpoints are radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of fusion and the absence of serious adverse events attributable to OssiMend&#xD;
      Bioactive Moldable. The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical outcomes over a&#xD;
      period of 1 year (2 years, if possible).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be 18 years of age or older at the time of consent and must have a&#xD;
             documented diagnosis of degenerative disc disease (DDD) that has failed to respond to&#xD;
             nonoperative treatment for at least 6 months. DDD is defined by back and/or radicular&#xD;
             pain with degeneration of the disc as confirmed by medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, and radiographic studies that may include CT, MRI, plain X-ray film,&#xD;
             discography, myelography, etc. with one or more of the following findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Instability as defined by &gt;3mm translation or &gt;5 degrees angulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Osteophyte formation of facet joints or vertebral endplates&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decreased disc height, on average by &gt;2mm, but dependent upon the spinal level&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Facet joint degeneration/changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is under 18 years of age at the time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has had prior lumbar spine fusion surgery at any level&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is currently undergoing treatment for malignancy or has undergone treatment&#xD;
             for malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the two years (24&#xD;
             months) following arthrodesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an active (local or systemic) infection or is undergoing adjunctive&#xD;
             treatment for infection&#xD;
&#xD;
