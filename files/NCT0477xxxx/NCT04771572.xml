  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study with a dose-escalation phase (Phase 1a) and&#xD;
      a cohort expansion phase (Phase 1b), to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of&#xD;
      LP-118 under a once daily oral dosing schedule in up to 100 subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-118&#xD;
      administered once daily (QD) as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory NHL, RT, MM, T-PLL (Group 1) and acute leukemia (AML, ALL), MDS, MDS/MPN,&#xD;
      MF (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect&#xD;
      of LP-118 on objective response rate (ORR) using disease specific response criteria,&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      adult subjects with relapsed/refractory NHL, RT, MM, T-PLL (Group 1); and acute leukemia&#xD;
      (AML, ALL), MDS, MDS/MPN, MF (Group 2&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1a dose-escalation will begin with group 1 and proceed until DLT is observed and MTD is established, or until an RP2D is established. Subjects enrolled in the 10 mg dose cohort will receive 10 mg LP-118 once daily. Subjects enrolled in the 20 mg dose cohort will receive 10 mg LP-118 for the first day, followed by 20 mg LP-118 once daily thereafter. Subjects enrolled in the rest of the dose cohorts will follow 3+3 study design, starting with an accelerated step-up dosing schedule until they reach the designated target dose (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg). Once the MTD or RP2D is established for group 1, the phase 1a dose escalation can proceed for group 2. The starting dose level for group 2 will be one dose level below the MTD or RP2D established for group 1.</description>
