  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular fractures of the mandibular condyle ((IAFC) are usually treated by means of&#xD;
      physical therapy with or without transient maxillo-mandibular fixation (conservative or&#xD;
      closed treatment). However, this can lead to incomplete manducatory function recovery due to&#xD;
      limited mandibular mobility. During the last 15 years, a growing interest has emerged for&#xD;
      open (surgical) treatment of these fractures. Although there is more and more evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that the open treatment may be the treatment of choice for selected cases of&#xD;
      subcondylar fractures, the best option remains controversial for high condylar fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to compare mandibular mobility at 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment between open (surgical) and closed (conservative) treatment of intra-articular&#xD;
      fracture (high fracture) of the mandibular condyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open multicenter randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized 1 :1 between open and closed-treatment group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mandibular condyle is one of the most frequent locations of facial fractures. It can lead&#xD;
      to severe functional impairment if the occlusion is not properly restored and the mandibular&#xD;
      mobility not recovered totally or within an acceptable range. Most frequent sequels of these&#xD;
      fractures include limitation of mandibular movements resulting in limited mouth opening,&#xD;
      occlusal disturbance causing chewing malfunction, chronic pain, chronic temporo-mandibular&#xD;
      joint (TMJ) disorder and facial asymmetry. The risk of permanent limited mouth opening is&#xD;
      even higher when the fracture is located inside the TMJ. Although the superiority of surgical&#xD;
      treatment is now widely accepted for low-level fractures of the condylar unit (i.e.,&#xD;
      extra-articular fractures) the treatment of fractures involving the TMJ in adult patients is&#xD;
      still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment principles in these fractures can be ranked in two groups: closed and open&#xD;
      treatments. Closed treatment - also called closed reduction or conservative treatment -&#xD;
      consists in prolonged physical therapy frequently associated with transient&#xD;
      maxillo-mandibular fixation (MMF). Open treatment consists in open reduction and internal&#xD;
      fixation of the fracture (ORIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized controlled trial has ever evaluated the superiority of open versus closed&#xD;
      treatment, and treatment strategy for IAFC remains a matter of ongoing debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare mandibular mobility at 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment between open (surgical) and closed (conservative) treatment of intra-articular&#xD;
      fracture (high fracture) of the mandibular condyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare between open (surgical) and closed (conservative)&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal mouth opening (in mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal mandibular protrusion (in mm),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal lateral excursion (in mm),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lateral deviation of the mandible during mouth opening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  occlusal disturbance evaluated by both the patient and the surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain using a visual analog scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  subjective functional impairment as assessed by the Mandibular Function Impairment&#xD;
           Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of sick leave&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to normal activity recovery (social activities, eating, sports) We will also&#xD;
           evaluate compliance with the intervention. This trial is an open multicenter randomized&#xD;
           controlled trial with 2 parallel arms. Eligible patients will be randomized 1 :1 between&#xD;
           open and closed-treatment group.&#xD;
