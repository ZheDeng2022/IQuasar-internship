      The aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of the use of antidepressants in the&#xD;
      treatment of muscle type temporomandibular disorders, with a sample of 60 to 80 participants.&#xD;

      Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) involve alterations of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ),&#xD;
      masticatory muscles, and related structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data indicates that 33% of the general population has at least one symptom of a&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and 6% to 7% have TMDs severe enough to seek specific&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of pain and disability in myofascial pain is understood via a bio- psychosocial&#xD;
      model reflecting a complex interaction between physical, behavioral, social, and&#xD;
      psychological factors. In turn, the treatment of myofascial pain is often multimodal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing pain may be associated with co-morbid conditions such as anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      sleeplessness. It is important to recognize and treat emotional distress as well as physical&#xD;
      symptoms. Chronic pain and depression seem to share common neurochemical substrata and&#xD;
      perhaps even similar dysfunctional alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic syndromes such as bruxism and TMD are commonly associated with depression. Research&#xD;
      Investigator reported that 39% of patients with TMD are moderately to severely depressed and&#xD;
      55% have moderate to severe somatization symptoms. A cross-cultural study by List and Dworkin&#xD;
      supported these findings, showing that 45% of Swedish patients and 51% of American patients&#xD;
      who met the diagnostic criteria for TMD also suffered from moderate to severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If pain assumes a chronic nature, more centrally mediated mechanisms take effect, for which&#xD;
      peripherally acting analgesics have less efficacy. The clinician must recognize the involved&#xD;
      alterations in pain characteristics, such as quality, duration, and intensity, as peripheral&#xD;
      pain becomes more continuous, diffuse, and difficult to localize. In such instances, the&#xD;
      possibility of new targets for treatment emerges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prominence of tryciclic antidepressants (TCAs) as a first-line treatment has declined&#xD;
      over time and the introduction of more tolerable medications such as the selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been done. TCAs are still used today, but they are most&#xD;
      commonly prescribed for patients whose depression does not respond to SSRIs or serotonin and&#xD;
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). TCAs are also used to treat depressed patients&#xD;
      with somatization pain or insomnia, due to their low addictive risk and sedative and&#xD;
      analgesic qualities; however, TCAs are associated with a high suicide risk when taken in&#xD;
      overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past several years, tricyclic antidepressants have been used successfully to manage&#xD;
      and control a variety of chronic pain conditions. Research Investigators reported that a&#xD;
      pharmacological protocol for the control of pain associated with chronic temporomandibular&#xD;
      disorders (TMD) based on the use of amitriptyline and found that 25 mg/day of amitriptyline&#xD;
      was sufficient to significantly reduce the pain of chronic TMD without producing side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Investigator showed that 75 mg of amitriptyline provided significantly more pain&#xD;
      relief than 25 or 50mg in patients with chronic pain. However, the patients on higher doses&#xD;
      also had more adverse events such as dry mouth and drowsiness. It should also be kept in mind&#xD;
      that no dose-response relation- ship has been demonstrated for the antidepressant or mood&#xD;
      effects of amitriptyline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Investigator compared the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and&#xD;
      amitriptyline in combination and separately in patients with chronic TMD. They discovered&#xD;
      improvements in all subgroups (CBT alone, amitriptyline alone, CBT plus amitriptyline, and&#xD;
      the placebo group) with an average decrease in pain intensity of 55%. The combination group&#xD;
      of CBT plus amitriptyline, however, was the only group that continued to show improved scores&#xD;
      on the visual analog pain scale at the follow-up 4 weeks after treatment was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurotransmitter serotonin regulates a wide range of functions including sleep,&#xD;
      temperature, and mood. Based on that we could suggest that it has a positive impact on&#xD;
      Chronic Pain patients. However, Serotonin also suppresses dopamine release from the&#xD;
      mesocortical tract, which can result in serotonin-induced disinhibition of movement. In other&#xD;
      words, dopamine functions to prevent spontaneous movements, but if serotonin inhibits the&#xD;
      action of dopamine, then spontaneous movements can occur. This is thought to be one of the&#xD;
      most plausible mechanisms involved in the repetitive muscle contractions seen in bruxism.&#xD;
      This mechanism also explains how the SSRIs, which increase concentrations of serotonin, have&#xD;
      the ability to deregulate movement and induce bruxism.&#xD;
