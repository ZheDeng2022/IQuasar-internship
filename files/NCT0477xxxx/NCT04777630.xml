    <textblock>
      Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a condition in which people experience complex visual&#xD;
      hallucinations, such as 'Acrobats balancing on bicycles' or 'Spiders crossing meals'. The&#xD;
      condition usually occurs in people who have significant vision loss due to eye disease. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to help understand how these hallucinations come about.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the healthy visual system, the eye provides input to a large area of the brain that&#xD;
      performs the computations required to allow us to see the world. There are specialised brain&#xD;
      regions responsible for processing of faces, objects, motion and colour. When the eye is no&#xD;
      longer working, these parts of the brain lose their input and this may lead to abnormal&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all people with eye disease and vision loss develop CBS, so the investigators will use&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare the brains of people with and without the&#xD;
      condition. In particular the investigators are interested in measuring the levels of&#xD;
      chemicals in the visual areas of the brain to see whether they are disrupted in CBS, leading&#xD;
      to the hallucinations. It is possible to measure how the different areas of the visual brain&#xD;
      are connected together and see whether this is altered in CBS, perhaps with increases in the&#xD;
      strength of connection between specialised areas. These measures will be related to&#xD;
      questionnaires about hallucinations and vision. This will be done by comparing low vision who&#xD;
      experience Charles Bonnet visual hallucinations compared to low vision patients who do not&#xD;
      have hallucinations. Assessments will take place at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative&#xD;
      Imaging (WIN) based at the John Radcliffe Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide insight into the role of the brain in generating CBS hallucinations,&#xD;
      helping us to design a larger study and eventually to test whether there are interventions to&#xD;
      help improve the condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) has been reported in people with visual impairment, and is&#xD;
      surprisingly common with an estimated prevalence of 10-34% of low vision patients from local&#xD;
      audits. It consists of complex visual hallucinations such as seeing snakes rising from&#xD;
      people's heads or elephants inside a room (see review, Carpenter, Jolly et al. 2019).&#xD;
      Patients experience CBS hallucinations over many years, and although they retain knowledge it&#xD;
      is not real, the hallucinations can be frightening and cause considerable distress. Patients&#xD;
      with CBS have a lower quality of life compared to patients with vision loss without CBS.&#xD;
      Moreover, CBS is under reported due to the fear of being labelled with mental health disease,&#xD;
      adding to the negative consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no established treatment for CBS, with the mainstay of management in low&#xD;
      vision clinics revolving around reassurance. Many patients receive inappropriate care from&#xD;
      other healthcare practitioners as reported by Judith Potts, founder of Esme's Umbrella, a&#xD;
      patient support charity dedicated to Charles Bonnet Syndrome. A clearer understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying CBS would help to ensure the medical community takes the condition&#xD;
      seriously and therefore adequately counsel presenting patients. In addition, understanding&#xD;
      the neural mechanisms of CBS can provide a model for investigating how the brain reorganizes&#xD;
      in response to sensory impairment and may eventually lead to improvement in the management&#xD;
      and treatment of the neurological consequences of eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual processing becomes more complex throughout the pathway from the retina, primary visual&#xD;
      cortex to the more specialised processing in higher visual areas. Thus, the complex nature of&#xD;
      the hallucinations in CBS (faces, objects, animals), in spite of blurred vision, appears to&#xD;
      implicate the higher visual areas in the visual ventral stream that are known to be process&#xD;
      objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotransmitters are the chemicals that allow communication across the brain. Some&#xD;
      neurotransmitters increase the activity in the brain (excitatory) and others reduce activity&#xD;
      (inhibitory). A candidate mechanism for CBS from computational modelling is the imbalance of&#xD;
      excitation:inhibition: loss of feedforward visual input may give greater prominence to&#xD;
      feedback in higher visual areas, causing hallucinations. A recent EEG study has provided&#xD;
      experimental support, showing that hyperexcitability of the visual cortex was a key&#xD;
      difference between people who have hallucinations versus those who do not. A critical proof&#xD;
      of this theory would require measurement of excitatory and inhibitory neurochemicals,&#xD;
      glutamate and GABA respectively, in visual areas. This is still outstanding and will be&#xD;
      tackled by this study. MRS-imaging is a cutting-edge method to quantify the concentration of&#xD;
      neurochemicals in the brain. Rather than providing a single measurement from a large volume&#xD;
      of tissue (30x30x30mm), this technique provides high spatial resolution (5x5x20mm)&#xD;
      measurements that permits comparison across the visual cortex. MRSI is the only technique&#xD;
      that can non-invasively quantify neurochemicals in the living human brain, and MRS-imaging&#xD;
      can provide concentrations of the neurotransmitters in multiple locations, which can then be&#xD;
      compared across groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, based on previous work and the nature of the hallucinations, the investigators&#xD;
      predict that patients with CBS likely show 1) changes in the neurotransmitter balance across&#xD;
      the visual cortex; 2) increased influence of feedback mechanisms from higher visual areas and&#xD;
      3) abnormal activity in the ventral visual stream to visual stimulation. Our goal is to&#xD;
      characterise the visual cortex of CBS patients by using rigorous non-invasive multi-modal MR&#xD;
      imaging techniques. Using state-of-the-art methods, the team will measure concentrations of&#xD;
      excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, identify changes in connectivity, and measure&#xD;
      evoked visual activity in patients with CBS and visually impaired participants without CBS.&#xD;
      In addition, the team will obtain clinical evaluation and qualitative assessments of&#xD;
      hallucinations.&#xD;
