  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate changes in insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and endocrine&#xD;
      profile in HIV-negative subjects exposed to dolutegravir (an antiretroviral drug used in HIV&#xD;
      treatment) in order to investigate the role all these different factors may potentially have&#xD;
      in weight gain recently reported in clinical cohorts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, crossover study investigating the difference in changes in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (determined by peripheral glucose uptake using a euglycaemic clamp) with the administration&#xD;
      of dolutegravir (DTG) compared to no DTG for 28 days in HIV seronegative healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised 1:1 to one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dolutegravir 50 mg once daily for the first 28 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment for the last 44 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment for the first 28 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dolutegravir 50 mg once daily for the last 28 days of the study (day 44-72).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research bloods, endocrine profiles, weight and urine samples will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      as well as day 28, 44, and 72 to enable comparative analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored whilst taking the study medications. Participants will&#xD;
      exit the study 72 days post-randomisation, with a follow-up call 28 days after exiting.&#xD;
