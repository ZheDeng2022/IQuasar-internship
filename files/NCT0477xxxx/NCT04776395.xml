    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of iberdomide when given alone or in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone in treating intermediate or high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma patients.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with iberdomide may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Dexamethasone is a synthetic steroid&#xD;
      (similar to steroid hormones produced naturally in the adrenal gland), and is used with other&#xD;
      drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. Giving iberdomide with dexamethasone my&#xD;
      improve time to progression to symptomatic myeloma with improved tolerability.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of iberdomide hydrochloride (iberdomide) and&#xD;
      iberdomide with dexamethasone in intermediate- and high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 1- and 2- year progression free survival rates of patients receiving&#xD;
      iberdomide with and without dexamethasone in intermediate-risk and high-risk smoldering&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to progression, and overall survival of patients with intermediate-&#xD;
      and high-risk smoldering myeloma receiving iberdomide with and without dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study the risk of adverse hematologic and non-hematologic events observed in patients&#xD;
      receiving iberdomide with and without dexamethasone for treatment of intermediate- and&#xD;
      high-risk smoldering myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate stem cell mobilization failure and early stem cell mobilization feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effects of iberdomide on cereblon targets Aiolos and Ikaros in natural&#xD;
      killer (NK)- and T- cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the effect of iberdomide with and without dexamethasone on T-cell and NK-cell&#xD;
      counts and activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the prognostic impact of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) on bone marrow samples in subjects who achieved&#xD;
      a complete response (CR) or better and evaluate the correlation between MRD status and&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the association between anti-tumor activity and immune cells in tumor and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive iberdomide hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive iberdomide&#xD;
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive iberdomide hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 6&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             contraception: one highly effective, and one additional effective (barrier) measure of&#xD;
             contraception without interruption 28 days prior to starting investigational product,&#xD;
             during the study treatment (including dose interruptions), and for at least 28 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of iberdomide. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study and for 3 months afterwards&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subjects must be either postmenopausal, free from menses &gt;= 2 years (yrs),&#xD;
                  surgically sterilized, willing to use two adequate barrier methods of&#xD;
                  contraception to prevent pregnancy, or agree to abstain from heterosexual&#xD;
                  activity starting with screening and for 3 months after last treatment in all&#xD;
                  patients&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova while taking protocol therapy&#xD;
                  and for at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to&#xD;
             any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;

             iberdomide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because protocol therapy has the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to protocol treatment of the&#xD;
             mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of iberdomide. The following are exceptions to this criterion: intranasal,&#xD;
             inhaled, topical or local steroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injection);&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses that do not exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone or equivalent steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions&#xD;
             (e.g, computed tomography [CT] scan pre-medications)&#xD;
