    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how Osseodensification, a well-defined bone&#xD;
      preparation procedure utilizing special densifying burs (a tool to prepare bone) compares to&#xD;
      the standard drilling procedure utilizing regular bone drills, to possibly enhance dental&#xD;
      implant healing.&#xD;

      Our postulated null hypotheses is that implants placed with osseodensification surgical&#xD;
      drilling compared to those placed with subtractive conventional drilling technique in a&#xD;
      split-mouth design will result: 1) in the same insertion torque values and; 2) in the same&#xD;
      implant stability quotient values when measured immediately after implant placement and after&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.Perform a prospective clinical study to investigate implant primary stability through&#xD;
      measuring insertion torque values (IT) and Implant stability quotient (ISQ) when implants are&#xD;
      placed using a standard drilling protocol (subtractive surgical drilling, as recommended by&#xD;
      implant manufacturers) compared to osseodensification drilling protocol in a split-mouth&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.Implant stability quotient will be measured once the implant is placed (immediate), and at&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.To investigate, and analyze these two surgical drilling protocols as function of different&#xD;
      implant manufacturers with variations in diameter and length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.To further track trends in the use of osseodensification surgical drilling once the patient&#xD;
      receives the prosthodontic reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E.To share the knowledge generated from this prospective analysis through scientific&#xD;
      publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection will focus on the need of implant placement on the right and left&#xD;
      equivalent sides of the maxilla/mandible where one side/site will receive implant(s) placed&#xD;
      post osseodensification surgical drilling recommended by Densifying reference guide of the&#xD;
      Densah Burs manufacturer, and the other side/site will receive implant(s) placed by the&#xD;
      control technique, which is subtractive conventional drilling recommended by the specific&#xD;
      implant manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be provided, explained and signed by participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Dental Implant procedure, participating patients will be asked to participate in 6-12&#xD;
      weekly follow visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Selection and Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will include 23 patients. Patients should not be in another research study or have not&#xD;
      been in any other research study in the last 90 days. They cannot be in this study if they&#xD;
      are abusing any drugs.&#xD;

      equivalent sides of the maxilla/mandible where one side/site will receive implant(s) placed&#xD;
      by osseodensification surgical drilling according to the manufacturer Densifying Reference&#xD;
      Guide, and the other side/site will receive implant(s) placed by the control surgical&#xD;
      technique, which is subtractive conventional drilling recommended by the implant&#xD;
      manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be provided, explained and signed by participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Dental Implant procedure, participating patients will be asked to participate in 6-12&#xD;
      weekly follow visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The implants will both be placed in the upper or lower jaw. The type of placement&#xD;
           preparation of the first implant will be determined by chance (like flipping a coin)&#xD;
           with other preparation for the second implant site. Implant primary stability will be&#xD;
           measured initially by measuring insertion torque values utilizing a commercially&#xD;
           available and validated clinical torque indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implant placement procedure will follow the standard of care for both implants for pain&#xD;
           management, aftercare and infection control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the weekly follow-up visits over 6-12 weeks, we will conduct a non-invasive&#xD;
           measurement of Implant secondary stability utilizing the Osstell device. Osstell is a&#xD;
           resonance frequency tester, which will create a gentle vibration in the implant and&#xD;
           measure how much if any the implant moves with the vibration. The device will not loosen&#xD;
           the implant. The standard of care is after confirming implant healing and high secondary&#xD;
           stability is to initiate yearly follow up as needed.&#xD;
