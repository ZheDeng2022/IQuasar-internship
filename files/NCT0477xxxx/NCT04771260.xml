      This research study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Explore and understand how health and social care for people with fibromyalgia living in&#xD;
      the UK is organised and delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Identify models of practice to inform co-design of new care pathways for people with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia living in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, up to ten UK-based case studies will be conducted in total: at least one each in&#xD;
      England, Scotland and Wales. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 10 participants&#xD;
      per case study, for a total of 100 participant interviews. Qualitative observations&#xD;
      (in-person or on-line) will be conducted with a similar number of people (total 100&#xD;
      participants). Online focus groups will also be carried out with approximately 6 to 8&#xD;
      participants per group (up to ten groups for a total 60-80 participants). Participants will&#xD;
      include healthcare professionals (for example, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals),&#xD;
      social care practitioners (for example, social prescribers), service delivery managers,&#xD;
      commissioners and other individuals involved in the organisation and delivery of health and&#xD;
      social care services for people with fibromyalgia living in the UK.&#xD;
