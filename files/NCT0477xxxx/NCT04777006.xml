  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malawi is a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa that has limited resources to address a&#xD;
      significant burden of disease-including HIV/AIDS. Additionally, depression is a leading cause&#xD;
      of disability in the country but largely remains undiagnosed and untreated. Lack of&#xD;
      cost-effective, scalable solutions is a fundamental barrier to expanding depression&#xD;
      treatment. Against this backdrop, one major success has been the scale-up of a network of&#xD;
      more than 700 HIV clinics, with over half a million patients enrolled in ART. As a chronic&#xD;
      care system with dedicated human resources and infrastructure, this presents a strategic&#xD;
      platform for integrating depression care, and responds to a robust evidence base outlining&#xD;
      the bi-directionality of depression and HIV outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate a stepped model of depression care that combines group-based&#xD;
      Problem Management Plus (group PM+) with antidepressant therapy (ADT) for 420 adults with&#xD;
      moderate/severe depression in Neno District, Malawi, as measured by the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Rollout will follow a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design in&#xD;
      which 14 health facilities are randomized to implement the model in five steps over a&#xD;
      15-month period. Primary outcomes (depression symptoms, functional impairment, and overall&#xD;
      health) and secondary outcomes (e.g. HIV: viral load, ART adherence; diabetes: A1C levels,&#xD;
      treatment adherence; hypertension: systolic blood pressure, treatment adherence) will be&#xD;
      measured every three months through 12-month follow-up. The investigators will also evaluate&#xD;
      the model's cost-effectiveness, quantified as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)&#xD;
      compared to baseline chronic care services in the absence of the intervention model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to compare the effects of an&#xD;
      evidence-based depression care model versus usual care on depression symptom remediation as&#xD;
      well as physical health outcomes for chronic care conditions. The investigators will also&#xD;
      look at the indirect effects of the intervention at the household level. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the intervention will be effective at reducing depression symptoms,&#xD;
      improving physical health, and improving household members' wellbeing, compare to treatment&#xD;
      as usual. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention will be highly&#xD;
      cost-effective, meaning that the cost per QALY gained will be less than Malawi's median GDP&#xD;
      per capita. If determined to be effective and cost-effective, this study will provide a model&#xD;
      for integrating depression care into HIV clinics in additional districts of Malawi and other&#xD;
      low-resource settings with high HIV prevalence.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder imposes catastrophic health and economic impacts in Malawi, and&#xD;
      throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Depression is a leading cause of disability in Malawi. Yet,&#xD;
      best evidence suggests that over 90% of individuals with the condition receive no treatment&#xD;
      (1). The cost of inaction is liable to have wide-ranging impacts. In terms of health,&#xD;
      depression-when untreated-typically observes a recurrent trajectory across the lifespan, and&#xD;
      is associated with significant depreciation in quality of life. Depression also indirectly&#xD;
      impacts other health outcomes, including HIV outcomes such as adherence to antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy and health-seeking behavior. In terms of social ecology, depression affects&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships, engagement in household activities, and labor force&#xD;
      participation. The World Economic Forum has estimated a $30 trillion loss over a twenty-year&#xD;
      span due to neglected treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions, largely due to lost labor&#xD;
      force participation (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrating depression care into Neno's HIV platform represents a cost-effective, scalable&#xD;
      solution in Neno District, Malawi, consistent with best practices. Over the past 10 years,&#xD;
      Malawi has enrolled over a million individuals in antiretroviral therapy. Current enrollment&#xD;
      levels stand at 580,000. This has been achieved by introducing a framework of HIV care&#xD;
      delivery, the basis of which is a network of 706 HIV clinics throughout the country. Over&#xD;
      this same timeframe, HIV has evolved from an acute condition with poor prognosis, to a&#xD;
      chronic condition with vastly improved survival rates. Given this context, the HIV system is&#xD;
      a strategic point of entry for screening and treating depression, as it represents a&#xD;
      leveragable chronic care system. In Neno District, HIV facilities have already transitioned&#xD;
      into an integrated chronic care platform for treating conditions like diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      asthma and epilepsy. Likewise, community health screenings, routine in Malawi, could be&#xD;
      leveraged to screen for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overarching Objective. Evaluate a clinical model of screening and treatment for depression in&#xD;
      terms of 'real world' effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at reducing depression in Neno&#xD;
      District.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1. Determine the implementation strategy effectiveness-in terms of improved&#xD;
      depression (PHQ-9), daily functioning (WHODAS), and overall health (EQ5D)-of introducing a&#xD;
      stepped model of depression care (behavioral therapy and antidepressant therapy) among adults&#xD;
      receiving integrated chronic care in Neno District, Malawi between July 1, 2021-June 30,&#xD;
      2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2. Determine the cost-effectiveness the stepped model of depression care&#xD;
      (behavioral therapy and antidepressant therapy) among adults receiving integrated chronic&#xD;
      care in Neno District, Malawi between July 1, 2021-June 30, 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Assess positive externalities associated with depression care, including&#xD;
      improved wellbeing among household members of treated patients, and improved physical health&#xD;
      outcomes among patients receiving depression care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Inspect mediators and moderators of improved depression care, including a dose&#xD;
      effect from level of treatment received (number of behavioral therapy sessions), reduced&#xD;
      internalized mental health stigma, and improved perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The framework strategically addresses the bi-directionality of depression and HIV outcomes. A&#xD;
      broad literature throughout sub-Saharan Africa has outlined the impact of HIV-including&#xD;
      HIV-related stigma, reduced quality of life and ability to maintain employment-on elevated&#xD;
      depression levels (3). Depression, in turn, predicts HIV-related outcomes such as adherence&#xD;
      to ART. As such, targeting depression care among a population that includes HIV+ individuals&#xD;
      in Malawi should yield significant benefits in terms of HIV-related outcomes. Outside&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, there is increasing evidence that integrative health services represents&#xD;
      stronger value for money than stand-alone models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research examining the benefits and costs of treating neuropsychiatric conditions, including&#xD;
      depression, suffers two key limitations. First, evaluations have only measured&#xD;
      individual-level, direct treatment effects. This approach under-appreciates the social&#xD;
      ecology of mental health: that individuals are typically situated within families, and&#xD;
      families within communities. From this lens, neuropsychiatric disorders have shown adverse&#xD;
      effects-in terms of burden of care and emotional wellbeing-on household members. Previously,&#xD;
      the investigators showed that, when individuals' mental health improves through treatment,&#xD;
      indirect benefits are observed among household members (4). Likewise, measurement limited to&#xD;
      direct treatment effects overlooks indirect benefits to overall health, including for&#xD;
      comorbid conditions such as HIV, that may result from mental health intervention. A second&#xD;
      shortcoming is that evaluations have focused on measuring costs of standalone interventions,&#xD;
      which are costlier than those that leverage existing systems. For instance, interventions for&#xD;
      youth have often integrated within school systems to lower costs. In Malawi, the national HIV&#xD;
      system-already transitioning to an integrated chronic care platform in Neno District-holds&#xD;
      potential to treat depression at lower costs by building on established systems of&#xD;
      longitudinal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of historical objectives, a preponderance of mental health evaluations in&#xD;
      low-resource settings has stopped at the point of measuring effectiveness, rather than&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness, with a few exceptions by project members. The consequences are marked: In&#xD;
      settings of financial constraint such as Neno District, Malawi, resources allocated to a&#xD;
      particular program necessarily means resources allocated away from another. As such,&#xD;
      assessing intervention costs are fundamental for determining scalability. A collaborative&#xD;
      care model of treatment for depression and comorbid conditions such as HIV and diabetes has&#xD;
      the potential to overcome resource constraints, which cost-effectiveness analysis would&#xD;
      demonstrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate an evidence-based stepped care model of depression treatment&#xD;
      integrated into Neno's HIV system, assessing health outcomes and cost-effectiveness,&#xD;
      inclusive of direct and indirect benefits. Partners In Health (PIH), in collaboration with&#xD;
      the Malawian Ministry of Health, has operated in Neno District-home to 165,000 Malawians-for&#xD;
      12 years. The investigators proposed to integrate a stepped care model for&#xD;
      depression-combining antidepressant therapy (ADT) with group-based Problem Management Plus&#xD;
      (PM+), the elements of which have been successfully instituted by the research team in&#xD;
      low-resource settings, ranging from Rwanda to Haiti. The proposed study will evaluate a model&#xD;
      that trains clinical staff situated in clinics to screen and diagnose depression, and&#xD;
      administer PM+ among those with a diagnosis of moderate or severe depression. Over five&#xD;
      weekly 1.5-2.5 hour group sessions, the behavioral intervention combines empirically-based&#xD;
      treatment components such as psychoeducation, strategic problem solving, and behavioral&#xD;
      activation (5). This will be coupled with antidepressant therapy (ADT) among those with&#xD;
      severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess intervention benefits, the investigators will measure patient outcomes for&#xD;
      depression every 3 months-including baseline, post-intervention, 6-months, and 12-months&#xD;
      follow-up-as well as markers of comorbid conditions: including viral load and ART adherence&#xD;
      among those are HIV+ (71% of the sample) as well as other disease-specific outcomes such as&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure for hypertensive patients (17% of sample) and hemoglobin A1C for&#xD;
      diabetic patients (2% of sample)-supported by an electronic medical records system.&#xD;
      Importantly, to quantify indirect benefits of depression care, the investigators will also&#xD;
      interview household members at baseline and 6-months follow-up to evaluate burden of care,&#xD;
      including emotional distress and missed days of work. The investigators will convert direct&#xD;
      and indirect benefits to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of Study. We will implement a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention for depression care within Neno's HIV system, currently&#xD;
      undergoing transition to a chronic care platform, examining depression symptoms and outcomes&#xD;
      of comorbid conditions, inclusive of HIV, across 14 facilities rolled-out clinic-wide in five&#xD;
      steps over 15 months (6). This design is a gold standard experimental approach aligned with&#xD;
      PIH's clinical goal to implement depression care permanently throughout Neno District, and is&#xD;
      a methodological framework on which we have unique expertise, including locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place of Study. This study will take place in Neno District, a catchment area of 165,000&#xD;
      Malawians, where 12,186 are enrolled in integrated chronic care-including for HIV. Five-year&#xD;
      retention in ART in Neno District is 80%, while five-year mortality is close to 15%. The&#xD;
      viral suppression rate is 83%. These figures signify Neno as high performing but also&#xD;
      underscores significant room for improvement-particularly among the most vulnerable, such as&#xD;
      those with depression. As such, we do not anticipate a ceiling effect for measuring HIV&#xD;
      outcomes among those concurrently enrolled in depression care. This is also true for other&#xD;
      chronic conditions: e.g. only 60% of hypertensive patients currently have controlled systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (&lt;140 mm Hg). Successes to-date have been achieved through modest human&#xD;
      resource investments such as CHWs, suggesting replicability nationally. This has been&#xD;
      supported by the investigators' past cost-effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population. The investigators intend to recruit at least 420 adults with depression&#xD;
      for participation in this study, beginning July 1, 2021 and continuing through June 30, 2025.&#xD;
      This number is based on the sample size needed for us to determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      depression treatment, as well as the prevalence of depression in Malawi: At each ICC clinic,&#xD;
      200-1,800 patients are seen on a quarterly basis. The investigators anticipate 10%-12% of all&#xD;
      patients (n=12,186) will screen positive for depressive symptoms, and 6% will be diagnosed&#xD;
      with moderate/severe depression. Prior studies in Malawi have found acceptance of research&#xD;
      study participation is 90% or higher. In addition, the investigators will be conducting&#xD;
      interviews with 210 households among half of participants-in order to determine whether the&#xD;
      intervention improves quality of life within households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Techniques and Tools. The full study period is January 1, 2021 through June 30,&#xD;
      2025. The first six months will be preparation. Beginning July 1, 2021, all adults attending&#xD;
      integrated chronic care clinics will be screened for depression symptoms using the PHQ-2 by&#xD;
      existing clinical officers. Consistent with the prior screening literature, those with a&#xD;
      score &gt; 2 will complete remaining questions of the PHQ-9; and a score &gt;9 will trigger&#xD;
      administration of a brief diagnostic interview--adapted from the CIDI 3.0--by a trained&#xD;
      counselor. Those with PHQ-9&lt;10 (no/mild depression) will receive a psychoeducation session,&#xD;
      but will not be enrolled-based on limited availability of health professionals and need-based&#xD;
      prioritization. Those with moderate/severe depression (PHQ-9&gt;9, corresponding to diagnosis of&#xD;
      major depression) will be eligible for cohort enrollment. Screening, diagnosis and enrollment&#xD;
      will occur continuously across all facilities over the full trial period; those who meet&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria will be enrolled. Treatment will be rolled-out progressively: patients in&#xD;
      each cluster's cohort will be initiated into the intervention: Three facilities will begin&#xD;
      treatment immediately (Step 1), with remaining facilities will initiate treatment at three-&#xD;
      (Step 2), six- (Step 3), nine- (Step 4) or twelve-months (Step 5) later. The stepped-wedge&#xD;
      approach enables all facilities throughout Neno District to implement the model, as such&#xD;
      maintaining equipoise. Assessment of patients on outcome measures will occur at every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination. The investigators assume n=30 enrollees per facility (total&#xD;
      n=420), based on depression prevalence in Malawi. The investigators further assume loss to&#xD;
      follow-up of 15%, based on intervention trials that the investigators have conducted in&#xD;
      similar settings. To account for clustering, the investigators calculated detectable&#xD;
      differences using an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05 within treatment&#xD;
      group and 0.01 within rollout step, based on depression treatment studies in multiple&#xD;
      developing countries, including the investigators' pilot work. Based on this, the&#xD;
      investigators find n=420 enrollees to be sufficient (power &gt; 0.80; (alpha=.05; 2-tailed) for&#xD;
      detecting a clinically meaningful standardized effect size of 0.5 (Cohen's d) for primary&#xD;
      outcomes, including accounting for cluster autocorrelation. This is not separated by modality&#xD;
      (though the investigators will explore this): it is to assess overall effectiveness of the&#xD;
      stepped care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Techniques and Tools. Over the 15-month roll-out period, primary outcomes&#xD;
      (PHQ-9, WHODAS, EQ5D) will be measured at three-month intervals among all participants from&#xD;
      point of enrollment, consistent with the three-month increments between steps (see above).&#xD;
      Three-month increments will coincide with treatment initiation, post-intervention, 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months follow-up. In the event an enrolled individual no longer meets criteria at&#xD;
      treatment initiation, the individual will leave the cohort and not be eligible for treatment&#xD;
      but will continue to be evaluated every three months for future eligibility. Given that&#xD;
      screening, diagnosis and enrollment will occur at all facilities over the full trial period,&#xD;
      the investigators expect any reduction in patients enrolled in the cohort due to lagged&#xD;
      treatment initiation will be offset by newly-identified individuals over this same period.&#xD;
      This is consistent with an open cohort design for stepped-wedge trials. Ultimately, this&#xD;
      approach enables all facilities to implement the model, maintain equipoise, and create&#xD;
      control sites by randomizing roll-out sequence. Measurement intervals are consistent with&#xD;
      best practices in outcomes tracking, including past trials. Interviews with household members&#xD;
      will be conducted at treatment initiation and 6-month follow-up, among 210 randomized&#xD;
      households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Analysis will assume a mixed-effects longitudinal regression framework, which&#xD;
      the team has implemented in similar contexts. To account for nesting of patients within&#xD;
      treatment groups and clusters, as well as time points (autocorrelation), patient, patient&#xD;
      group and cluster will be incorporated as random effects, while cluster assignment and&#xD;
      covariates are included as fixed effects-using STATA's MIXED command. The investigators will&#xD;
      run sensitivity analyses to test if data are missing at random (MAR), and examine stigma and&#xD;
      social support as moderators, as well as potential mediation using causal mediation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness. The investigators will use linear mixed-effects regression analysis to test&#xD;
      differences between study arms on change in primary outcomes. Models will adjust for patient&#xD;
      demographics, as well as stigma and social support. Analysis will assume an intention-to-&#xD;
      treat (ITT) framework, with and without multiple imputation analysis. In addition to ITT, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a 'completers only' analysis to exam outcomes among those who&#xD;
      adhered to treatment, and examine dose response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness. Health measures will be converted to QALYs using the EQ5D-3L cross-walk&#xD;
      between domain-specific outcomes. This approach has been utilized and published on&#xD;
      previously. QALY estimates will be related to base case and treatment cost estimates. For&#xD;
      formal CEA, the investigators will use a gold standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)&#xD;
      simulation-based approach in TreeAge, from a societal perspective. For sensitivity analyses,&#xD;
      the investigators will vary discount rates from 0-5%, based on health-adjusted life&#xD;
      expectancy. Unit of interest is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per&#xD;
      QALY, comparing the cost of integrated chronic care before and after introduction of the&#xD;
      depression treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based treatment of depression. Drawing from a manual-driven framework of enhanced&#xD;
      Problem Solving Therapy (PST) known as Problem Management Plus (PM+), developed by the WHO&#xD;
      for low-resource settings, the investigators will implement a gold standard, stepped approach&#xD;
      to treatment for depression. The model will follow a group format, based on three&#xD;
      considerations: this lowers costs of human resources, which is essential when considering&#xD;
      national scalability; it provides peer support during treatment; and it is culturally&#xD;
      appropriate for the setting. These considerations have been sources of advocacy for the group&#xD;
      model by WHO. In settings where group format has been implemented, results have been&#xD;
      comparable to individual format. Local counselors will administer PST in five 1.5-2.5 hour&#xD;
      sessions, with 6-8 participants per group, consistent with WHO guidelines. Among those with&#xD;
      PHQ-9&gt;15, antidepressant therapy (ADT) will be offered following WHO mhGAP procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression screening. The investigators will screen patients ages 18+ enrolled in ICC clinics&#xD;
      in Neno District, beginning the first quarter of Y2. Screening, diagnosis and enrollment into&#xD;
      the treatment cohort will occur continuously across facilities, administered by data clerks&#xD;
      and counsellors trained on the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, respectively (6). Screening will also occur&#xD;
      every 3 months among individuals in the active cohort to determine current treatment&#xD;
      eligibility status. The PHQ-2 assesses frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia, and has&#xD;
      been implemented throughout Africa. Use of PHQ-2 as a first step has will save time: the&#xD;
      investigators are screening 12,186 adults. The selected threshold allows high sensitivity.&#xD;
      Patients who screen positive with the PHQ-2 (score &gt;2; range: 0-6) will immediately receive&#xD;
      remaining PHQ-9 questions, on which a score &gt; 9 (range: 0-27) represents a possible&#xD;
      depressive disorder. Those with PHQ-9&lt;10 will receive a psychoeducation session from the&#xD;
      clinical officer, using a manual on which they have been trained. Those with PHQ&gt;9&#xD;
      (moderate/severe depression) will be referred to a counselor to administer the diagnostic&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression diagnosis. Counselors will review PHQ-9 scores and administer a brief diagnostic&#xD;
      interview--based on the Comprehensive International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)--to diagnose&#xD;
      depression: 5 of 9 symptoms present and functional impairment. All patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      for suicide risk and whether immediate intervention is warranted. If so, they will be&#xD;
      referred to the supervising physician at the health facility, triggering an emergency&#xD;
      protocol. Patients will be assigned to one of three categories: mild, moderate and severe&#xD;
      depression. Those with a negative diagnosis will not be eligible for the intervention, and&#xD;
      will undergo PHQ-2 screenings at subsequent visits for eligibility. Those with a positive&#xD;
      diagnosis and PHQ-9&gt;10 will be eligible. Those with PHQ-9 10-14 will be offered PST alone.&#xD;
      Those with PHQ-9&gt;15 (moderate-to-severe depression) will be offered PST and ADT as joint&#xD;
      treatment, with the alternative to choose a single modality. Pregnant women with severe&#xD;
      depression will also be eligible for ADT. Best evidence, including recent systematic reviews,&#xD;
      does not find increased risk for mother or infant with appropriately administered ADT, and&#xD;
      there are significant potential benefits of improved wellbeing of the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychoeducation and treatment selection. Counselors will inform patients on availability of&#xD;
      PST and ADT, outline potential benefits and risks, provide an overview of the study, and&#xD;
      acquire informed consent. Those who decline care will be offered psychoeducation and referred&#xD;
      to available resources. Among those who elect PM+, the first PM+ session will also&#xD;
      incorporate in-depth psychoeducation. Patients with a PHQ-9 score of 10-14 will be provided&#xD;
      the option of ADT but recommended PM+ instead, given that behavioral therapy has established&#xD;
      efficacy and avoids potential side effects of ADT. Patients with PHQ-9 &gt; 15 will also be&#xD;
      given the options of PST, ADT, or both, and recommended both. At facilities randomized to&#xD;
      administer the intervention immediately, patients will be informed of date, time and location&#xD;
      of their first PM+ session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Management Plus (PM+). Counselors (n=8) will receive intensive training in Year 1 by&#xD;
      to administer PM+ using a manualized approach. Training and supervision are described below.&#xD;
      PM+ is a WHO-enhanced framework of Problem Solving Therapy (PST) for implementation by lay&#xD;
      personnel in low-resource settings like Neno, designed to be conducted in five weekly 1.5-2.5&#xD;
      hour sessions. Elements of PM+, including sequential problem solving, have been applied by&#xD;
      the research team in numerous settings with marked success, including in Lilongwe. This&#xD;
      district-wide randomized trial leveraging Neno's existing infrastructure would represent a&#xD;
      critical evidential support for WHO's agenda to expand the model globally. Modules include:&#xD;
      psychoeducation, managing problems, behavioral activation, social support strengthening, and&#xD;
      stress reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressant Therapy (ADT). The investigators expect 20-25% of study participants-i.e.&#xD;
      those who meet diagnostic criteria-to have moderately severe or severe depression and opt to&#xD;
      enroll in ADT. Fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and&#xD;
      amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), are part of Malawi's national formulary.&#xD;
      Neno District has a robust supply chain, which will reduce stock-out. Potential side effects&#xD;
      of ADT are modest but include nausea, insomnia, and nervousness and will be communicated to&#xD;
      participants prior to initiation. There is modest evidence ADT may increase risk of&#xD;
      suicidality; this risk will be stated in informed consents, counselors will be trained to&#xD;
      identify this risk, and will be formally assessed during outcome assessments, with the&#xD;
      potential to trigger protocol for suicidal ideation. Benefits of ADT often outweigh risk of&#xD;
      harm and negative impact of untreated depression. Fluoxetine is typically the first drug of&#xD;
      choice because it is better tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing Algorithm: Daily dose will commence at 20 mg of fluoxetine, or 25 mg of amitriptyline.&#xD;
      Dose increments and levels are the same for each drug. At monthly follow-up visits, a dose&#xD;
      increment or medication change may be considered based on measures of treatment response and&#xD;
      side effects, using the Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist. This algorithm-based process&#xD;
      will be repeated bi-weekly until the patient is fully responding to treatment for a period of&#xD;
      three months (PHQ-9 &lt; 5). Dose escalations of more than one increment and medication changes&#xD;
      will be reviewed with the doctor-in-charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes. Measures will include surveys, laboratory assays, pharmacy data, and data&#xD;
      abstracted from medical charts and the Depression Care Registry. Survey measures that have&#xD;
      not been translated into Chichewa in the course of prior research will be translated using&#xD;
      standard translation, back-translation methods, and will be administered at each assessment,&#xD;
      unless otherwise noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression symptoms. Depression symptoms will be measured with the PHQ-9, which has been&#xD;
      translated previously and locally-validated. The investigators have elected to use PHQ-9&#xD;
      because it has been implemented throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including Malawi, where the&#xD;
      scale has shown high sensitivity responding to treatment, as well as concurrent and&#xD;
      predictive validity. It contains nine four-point ordinal response items on topics such as&#xD;
      hopelessness, psychosomatic response (e.g. sleeplessness, loss of appetite) and anhedonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional impairment. Functional impairment including aspects of daily functioning,&#xD;
      correspond to DSM diagnostic criteria. The investigators will evaluate this using the 12-item&#xD;
      WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS). The WHODAS has been validated in a diverse&#xD;
      range of sub-Saharan African contexts, including Malawi, and covers topics like completing&#xD;
      household chores, concentrating, and maintaining relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall health. A health profile will be generated for each individual using the EQ-5D-3L,&#xD;
      previously validated in Malawi. This survey determines patients' overall health at time of&#xD;
      interview and offers a cross-walk to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes. Secondary outcomes will constitute those measuring indirect benefits and&#xD;
      costs of treatment. Indirect benefits will be incorporated into cost-effectiveness estimates&#xD;
      by internalizing improvements among comorbid conditions such as HIV and hypertension, as well&#xD;
      as reduced household burden of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART adherence. ART adherence will be measured in terms of whether HIV+ enrollees have&#xD;
      returned to an IC3 for antiretrovirals (ARVs) within the past three months, an approach&#xD;
      considered more reliable than self-reports. This interval overlays with clinical protocols&#xD;
      throughout Malawi in terms of the duration for which ARVs are supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral load. Viral load will be measured as part of HIV+ patients' clinical assessment&#xD;
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, 6- and 12-month follow-up, consistent with ongoing care&#xD;
      at IC3s. This is considered a key metric for determining treatment plans and is highly&#xD;
      sensitive to compliance with prescribed ART regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV disease staging. Staging will be evaluated every three months among HIV+ enrollees,&#xD;
      consistent with IC3 visits. This approach to tracking disease progression is commonly used in&#xD;
      low-resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic care outcomes. Chronic care outcomes on hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and epilepsy&#xD;
      will be abstracted from electronic medical records. Systolic blood pressure and adherence to&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication (measured by medicine pickups) will be measured among those with&#xD;
      hypertension. Among those with type-2 diabetes, adherence to quarterly visits and A1C (or&#xD;
      random blood sugar) levels will be abstracted. Among those with epilepsy, the investigators&#xD;
      will catalog number of reported seizures in past quarter, and adherence to antiepileptics as&#xD;
      measured by quarterly medicine pickups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household burden of care. Lastly, household burden of care will be evaluated with household&#xD;
      members using a locally-adapted version of the Burden Assessment Schedule (BAS), previously&#xD;
      implemented by the team. The survey assesses dimensions of emotional and functional burden of&#xD;
      care, including missed work, guilt and worry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediators and Moderators. Analyses will also include three mediators/moderators assessing&#xD;
      potential pathways by which depression treatment leads to alleviation of depression symptoms,&#xD;
      including enhanced social support, reduced HIV and depression-related stigma, and performance&#xD;
      of psychosocial counsellors as quantified by fidelity to PM+ protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived social support. Social support strengthening is a focus of PM+. This will be&#xD;
      measured with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), previously&#xD;
      validated, to assess support before and after care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived stigma. Self-perceived stigma is associated with HIV status and depression,&#xD;
      including in Malawi. The investigators will adapt the AIDS-Related Stigma Scale (ARSS) and&#xD;
      Internalizing Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale in Year 1 of the project-both designed&#xD;
      for use in community-based settings in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM+ fidelity. Fidelity checklist scores will be generated for each counsellor by a lead&#xD;
      clinical officer or supervisor. Research has shown that fidelity protocols are predictive of&#xD;
      patient outcomes in the context of depression care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Household Interviews. Adult household members of participants-one per household-will be&#xD;
      identified for participation based referral by the study participant and/or&#xD;
      self-identification as a social support in close contact with the study participant. This&#xD;
      individual will be informed that the research team is conducting a broad study on the&#xD;
      relationship between individual and household health. Household interviews will chiefly&#xD;
      comprise a subset of the battery administered to participants: specifically, the PHQ-9,&#xD;
      WHODAS, and EQ-5D-3L (primary outcomes). In addition, household members will complete the&#xD;
      BAS, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation. In the final year of the project, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      qualitative interviews to assess provider and patient experiences on their perceived effects&#xD;
      of the intervention, as well as implementation barriers and strategies used to solve them.&#xD;
      The goal is to identify key lessons learned, and to ready the intervention tools for scale-up&#xD;
      at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider experience: In Year 5, the investigators will interview 10 clinical officers who&#xD;
      prescribed ADT, as well as psychosocial counsellors who led PM+ sessions as well as diagnosed&#xD;
      patients. In addition to discussing perceived strengths and weakness of the intervention and&#xD;
      its implementation, the investigators will also discuss the training and supervision process,&#xD;
      as well as provider job satisfaction and burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient experience: A random sample of 20 participants (10 male, 10 female) will be&#xD;
      interviewed after their final study assessment to assess their experiences with the&#xD;
      intervention - including logistical aspect of participation, impact on personal mental health&#xD;
      and wellbeing, as well as changes in relationships at the household level.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Household burden of care will be evaluated with household members using a locally-adapted version of the Burden Assessment Schedule (BAS). This uses a 4 point ordinal scale from &quot;not-at-all&quot; (1) &quot;to a lot&quot; (4) and comprises 19-items, as detailed in Reinhard et al, 1994. A higher score indicates more significant (worse) burden of care. Investigators will examine change in continuous score on this measure.</description>

    <intervention_name>Problem Management Plus</intervention_name>
    <description>PM+ is a cognitive-behavioral intervention that trains recipients to improve their management of practical problems, and uses the term &quot;problem management&quot; rather than &quot;problem solving&quot; to emphasize that many problems encountered by individuals living in adverse circumstances may not be &quot;solvable&quot;. The &quot;plus&quot; in PM+ underscores additional evidence-based behavioral strategies incorporated into the model, including: stress management strategies, behavioral activation, and social support strengthening. In total, PM+ comprises five sessions held once per week for 1.5. to 2.5 hours per session. The model has shown success in reducing depression symptoms in low-resource settings such as Nepal and Pakistan.4</description>

    <intervention_name>Antidepressant Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), are part of Malawi's national formulary. Neno District supply chain is supported by PIH, which reduces stock-outs relative to those observed in other Malawian settings. Fluoxetine is typically the first drug of choice because it is safer and better tolerated.&#xD;
Daily dose will commence at 20 mg of fluoxetine, or 25 mg of amitriptyline. At monthly follow-up visits, a dose increment or medication change may be considered based on measures of treatment response and side effects, using an Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist. This algorithm-based process will be repeated every other week until the patient is fully responding to treatment (PHQ-9 &lt; 5) for a period of three months. Dose escalations of more than one increment and medication changes will be reviewed with the doctor-in-charge. If on ADT at end of study, it will be sustained as part of usual care.</description>
