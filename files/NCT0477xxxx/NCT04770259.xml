  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people (EP) have increased, as well as life expectancy at birth. In Chile there are&#xD;
      more than 2 million 800 thousand EP, which corresponds to 1/6 of the Chilean population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EP have a higher disease burden and mortality when facing surgery and in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this population frequently has longer hospital stays due to its degree of fragility,&#xD;
      surgical complications or decompensation of its underlying pathologies, directly affecting&#xD;
      health care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inadequate preparation of the EP prior to surgery determined that the requirements of&#xD;
      in-hospital as well as out-of-hospital care are extended, with the consequent which entails a&#xD;
      higher cost in health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research underestimates the conditions of frailty and dependence in the EP. In&#xD;
      addition, it is not routinely evaluated prior to surgery, as well as nutritional, metabolic,&#xD;
      cognitive status and / or delirium screening is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are accelerated recovery programs, which relate their interventions to specific&#xD;
      pathologies; however, the age of the person is not taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical pre-habilitation interventions in the EP usually focus their efforts on physical and&#xD;
      cardiovascular aspects, not including an integrative pre-surgical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the foregoing, a prospective, interventional, longitudinal and randomized study has&#xD;
      been proposed in a population of the EP who will undergo elective urology and coloproctology&#xD;
      surgeries in two university hospitals (private and public).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate how the implementation of a timely pre-surgical&#xD;
      conditioning (APO) protocol for frail elderly people reduces the days of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APO considers the most relevant aspects of physical and cardiovascular pre-habilitation,&#xD;
      in addition to contemplating evaluations of frailty, dependence, cognitive status, screening&#xD;
      for delirium, nutritional and metabolic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, interventional, longitudinal and randomized study has been proposed in a&#xD;
      population of the EP who will undergo elective urology and coloproctology surgeries in two&#xD;
      university hospitals: Red de Salud UC-Christus and Hospital Clinico La Florida. Both based on&#xD;
      Santiago de Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate how the implementation of a timely pre-surgical&#xD;
      conditioning (APO) protocol for frail elderly people reduces the days of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM will be screened according to: co-morbidities, degree of frailty and dependence. This&#xD;
      procedure will be carried out by a trained register nurse (RN) from the team at each center,&#xD;
      who through a random system will enter 50% of the patients to the APO protocol (intervention)&#xD;
      and the other 50% to the standard protocol of each institution. After that the RN will&#xD;
      measure nutritional and cognitive status, drugs and alcohol consume and will take the&#xD;
      protocol blood samples in the first evaluation two to three days after receiving an order for&#xD;
      surgery for the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The APO considers the evaluations for a geriatric team, physical therapist team and&#xD;
      nutritionist team in order to find out the most relevant aspects of physical, cardiovascular&#xD;
      geriatric syndromes, cognitive status, nutritional and metabolic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      physical therapist team and nutritionist team they will prepare to the EP to surgery with&#xD;
      physical, cardiovascular and dietary protocols adjusted to the patient, for the time of 4 to&#xD;
      5 weeks before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission of hospitalization for surgery, the RN in each of the two hospitals will&#xD;
      evaluate the state of frail and dependence, nutritional and cognitive status, drugs and&#xD;
      alcohol consume and delirium status in which the patients of both groups arrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesia and anesthesia of all patients in both groups, control and intervention, will&#xD;
      be standardized to reduce confounding associated with intra- and postoperative anesthesia and&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registered nurse will follow the patient throughout the in-hospital process and via&#xD;
      telemedicine or face-to-face will interview patients one month, second month and third month&#xD;
      after discharge in search of possible problems associated with the peri-operative process.&#xD;
