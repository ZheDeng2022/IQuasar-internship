    <textblock>
      This is a multiple site, randomized, double blinded parallel-group controlled study. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated, daily&#xD;
      sessions with the STARSTIM device, which delivers transcranial cathodal direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS). Subjects will be treated with STARTSTIM or sham device for 10 sessions&#xD;
      over a 2-week period. The subjects will be followed for an additional 10 weeks post&#xD;
      treatment. Quality of Life questionnaires and adverse events will be collected and evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Study design is an evaluation of the STARSTIM device (tDCS) in subjects over 9 years of age,&#xD;
      diagnosed with epilepsy with focal seizures with or without focal to bilateral tonic clonic&#xD;
      seizures. Seizure diaries will be collected for 12 weeks to establish a rate of seizure for&#xD;
      each subject prior to treatment. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive an&#xD;
      active STARSTIM treatment or a sham treatment. Neither the study investigator nor subject&#xD;
      shall be notified of the treatment assignment. Treatment will be done daily at the&#xD;
      investigator's site for 10 days. A Seizure Diary will be maintained through the course of the&#xD;
      treatment and the follow up period. Subjects will have 3 follow up visits to evaluate their&#xD;
      seizure rate, adverse events, medications and quality of life. A Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      will be utilized to evaluate safety events through study milestones. Seizure frequency rates&#xD;
      pre, during and post treatment will be evaluated for both the active and sham treatment arms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. 9 years old or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of epilepsy with focal seizures with or without focal to bilateral tonic&#xD;
             clonic seizures (International League Against Epilepsy classification). Diagnosis&#xD;
             established by both clinical history and an EEG consistent with focal seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Epilepsy is refractory to treatment, defined as: failure to achieve adequate seizure&#xD;
             control despite demonstrated compliance, according to medical records, on at least two&#xD;
             (2) FDA-approved ASDs at a daily dose considered therapeutic for the patient's&#xD;
             demographic according to package labeling, within approximately the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Seizure frequency &gt;= 3 and &lt;= 20 per month, over the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Currently on 1-4 ASDs with no changes in antiepileptic drug doses in the 3 weeks prior&#xD;

             enrollment are permitted only if clinically necessary.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Evidence for more than one seizure focus. (NOTE: For this study, a seizure focus is&#xD;
             defined as a cortical region confined to one hemisphere and either one lobe or on a&#xD;
             junction of two adjacent lobes from which seizures arise, as documented by scalp or&#xD;
             intracranial EEG, that is either supported or not refuted by MRI, and either supported&#xD;
