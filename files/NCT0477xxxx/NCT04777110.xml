    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, controlled, single blind clinical trial on the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of esmketamine injection in electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esmketamine injection in the treatment of&#xD;
      non convulsive electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients with depression receiving MECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research drug was esketamine injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design was a multicenter, randomized, single blind, parallel controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 mg / kg as the experimental group. The normal saline group was the control group (0.05 ml&#xD;
      / kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated according to the main efficacy index (remission rate) of this&#xD;
      study. It was assumed that the remission rate of the esketamine injection group was better&#xD;
      than that of the control group. The parameters were set as test level α = 0.05, unilateral, β&#xD;
      = 0.8, the cut-off value was 6%, the experimental group: the control group was 1:1, according&#xD;
      to the results of previous clinical trials and combined with literature, the remission rate&#xD;
      of the control group was 69%, 159 cases in each group, considering the 20% shedding rate, 198&#xD;
      cases in the experimental group and 198 cases in the control group were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. experimental group&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients were given intravenous injection of 0.25 mg / kg esketamine, 1.5 mg / kg&#xD;
           propofol and 1 mg / kg succinylcholine in turn. After anesthesia, the patients were&#xD;
           given electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were given 0.05ml/kg of normal saline, 1.5mg/kg of propofol and 1mg / kg of&#xD;
      succinylcholine. After anesthesia, the patients were given electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation 1. Main efficacy indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remission rate of depressive symptoms after MECT treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remission was defined as two consecutive hdrs-24 scores ≤ 10 after receiving MECT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition rate of remission rate: the proportion of patients with remission of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in this group&#xD;
