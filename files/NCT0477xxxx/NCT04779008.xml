  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote Ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been reported to improve myocardial&#xD;
      microcirculation, promote collateral circulation recruitment, and improve myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion in patients.Two large randomized controlled trials demonstrated a perioperative&#xD;
      cardioprotective effect of RIPC (reduced troponin levels), but did not find that a single&#xD;
      preoperative RIPC improved long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG).The&#xD;
      effect of a single RIPC before CABG may be too short. This study aims to investigate whether&#xD;
      long-term RIPC improved myocardial perfusion in patients 3 months and 6 months after CABG&#xD;
      surgery , and to detect changes in blood vascular endothelial growth factor, Nitrc Oxide,&#xD;
      adenosine，and Endothelin-1, and to observe MACCE event rates at 12 months.&#xD;

      A total of 210 patients were randomly divided into three groups according to the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria, with 70 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient underwent one RIPC (Four five-minute cycles of upper limb ischaemia and Four&#xD;
      five-minute pauses using a blood pressure cuff air vehicle to 200 mmHg) 1 hours before&#xD;
      surgery, then normal surgery, and RIPC was performed on the second day after surgery and&#xD;
      every day after surgery, which lasted for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients underwent once RIPC 1 hours before surgery, and then normal medical procedures were&#xD;
      performed with no additional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients did not receive any additional intervention. All patients were evaluated in three&#xD;
      ways. First: 7days and 3 months after surgery , the quantitative examination of myocardial&#xD;
      blood flow was conducted to observe the improvement of myocardial blood perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second: The changes in the concentrations of vascular colorectal growth factor, Nitrc Oxide,&#xD;
      adenosine, and endothelin-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, patients were evaluated for 6 months and 12months MACCE incidence (cardiovascular&#xD;
      death, Nonfatal myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization, and stroke).&#xD;
