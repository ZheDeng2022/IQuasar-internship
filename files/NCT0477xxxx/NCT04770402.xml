  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN), other symptoms, and potential opioid and&#xD;
      concomitant medication sparing effects in comparison to standard of care management in&#xD;
      Multiple Myeloma subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to strengthen the care of persons with Multiple Myeloma by improving quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL) and ability to perform daily activities through reduced Chemotherapy-Induced&#xD;
      Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms. CIPN debilitates and erodes QOL by preventing&#xD;
      individuals from pursuing their normal activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The features of CIPN, including physical, social/family, emotional, functional, and specific&#xD;
      CIPN symptoms, will be measured with the validated FACT-GOG-NTX. This project brings&#xD;
      necessary attention and scientific inquiry to supportive cancer care, which is sometimes&#xD;
      de-prioritized behind disease treatment. The potential for nonpharmacologic acupuncture to&#xD;
      reduce CIPN and other symptoms with minimal side effects has beneficial implications for&#xD;
      disease treatment. Patients with controlled symptoms are better able to tolerate&#xD;
      life-prolonging treatment and avoid chemotherapy dose reductions which result from neurotoxic&#xD;
      side effects of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consent and are determined to be eligible will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment or standard of care treatment for their CIPN. Subjects'&#xD;
      socio-demographics, medical history, opioid and concomitant medication intake information&#xD;
      will be collected. Subjects who are randomized to the acupuncture treatment arm will receive&#xD;
      12 sessions of acupuncture over approximately 10 weeks. Subjects randomized to standard of&#xD;
      care will continue with standard of care therapy per their physician for treatment of their&#xD;
      CIPN. All subjects will complete questionnaires at Baseline, mid-point, and endpoint.&#xD;
      Responses to questionnaires will then be analyzed towards answering the study's objectives.&#xD;
