  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the killing of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells by&#xD;
      cells of the immune system. The study aims to slow the progressive, immune-mediated loss of&#xD;
      insulin-producing beta cells that occurs after clinical presentation. The investigators have&#xD;
      identified a pathway that is important for immune cells to kill beta cells, and a drug that&#xD;
      will block this pathway and prevent beta cell death. This drug, baricitinib, is already in&#xD;
      clinical use for rheumatoid arthritis, and is currently in clinical trials for other&#xD;
      diseases, including childhood autoimmune diseases. It is hypothesized that baricitinib&#xD;
      treatment for 48 weeks will preserve beta cell function in children and young adults with&#xD;
      recently-diagnosed T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to recruit 83 participants aged 12-30 years who have been recently diagnosed&#xD;
      with T1D. Two thirds of the participants will be randomly assigned to receive baricitinib,&#xD;
      one third will receive placebo. The trial will test if baricitinib can slow the progressive&#xD;
      loss of insulin-producing beta cells in these patients. The primary objective is to determine&#xD;
      if baricitinib can reduce the loss of meal-stimulated plasma C-peptide, a measure of&#xD;
      beta-cell function. Maintaining endogenous insulin in recent-onset T1D improves glucose&#xD;
      control and may lead to long-term improvements in glucose and lower rates of serious diabetes&#xD;
      complications and death.&#xD;
