  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCMA-targeted prime CAR-T&#xD;
      cells therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited options for treatment of relapse/refractory Multiple Myeloma. BCMA is&#xD;
      expressed on most Multiple Myeloma cells so it is an ideal target for CAR-T. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of prime CAR- T targeting BCMA in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma. The primary goal is safety and efficiency&#xD;
      assessment, including adverse events and disease status after treatment.&#xD;
