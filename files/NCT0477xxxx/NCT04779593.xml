  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in maintenance treatment for HFE hemochromatosis since at least one year will be&#xD;
      included in a two year study period and randomized in two groups experimental and control&#xD;
      group. Because proton pump inhibitors are widely used as chronic medication, and because they&#xD;
      can significantly modify iron absorption, patients will be stratified according to the use of&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors and gender. A first bloodletting will be performed at inclusion with&#xD;
      the same volume as usually performed by the patients. Results of the biological test&#xD;
      performed at this visit will guide the time schedule and volume of the next bloodletting&#xD;
      according to randomization group (patients treated with bloodletting according to current&#xD;
      guidelines &quot;ferritin alone&quot; versus patients treated with bloodletting according to&#xD;
      &quot;transferrin saturation and serum ferritin&quot;).Blood count and iron metabolism parameters will&#xD;
      be performed at each bloodletting and follow-up visits. Time schedule and volume of&#xD;
      bloodletting will be adjusted to biological results after each follow-up visit. Volume and&#xD;
      schedule for bloodlettings will be determined according to guidelines specifically designed&#xD;
      for this study to assure harmonization of treatment management, and centrally validated&#xD;
      through the recording of the biological tests in the electronic Case Report Form which will&#xD;
      provide the investigator with the volume and schedule of the next bloodletting. There will be&#xD;
      two ways of treatment modification: either change of schedule or volume of bloodletting.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo follow-up visit every six months with clinical examination,&#xD;
      questionnaires at J0, M12 and M24 (SF-36; AIMS2-SF, WOMAC, EQ-5D-5L), and biological test.&#xD;
      For health economics analysis, data will be obtained thanks to a dedicated extraction from&#xD;
      SNDS database SNDS database will allow to gather hospital stays, visits, and other&#xD;
      healthcare-related costs as well as vital status (date (month/year) of death) and cause of&#xD;
      death. A de-identified copy of the clinical database, restricted to the relevant variables,&#xD;
      will be sent for semideterministic matching purpose with SNDS extraction using four key&#xD;
      variables: gender, same date (month/year) of birth, same date (day/month/year) of visit for&#xD;
      bloodletting; pending, of course, regulatory authorization.&#xD;

    <description>At D0, M12 and M24. This 36 item patient reported survey of patient's health is the most commonly used and validated health survey instrument for appraising quality of life.&#xD;
Items are grouped in 8 scaled scores exploring multiple dimension of global health (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health).&#xD;
Scoring will be performed as recommended by the SF-36 instruction manual to create the eight scale scores. Furthermore, these subscales sum to obtain the total SF-36 score and will be summarized into two composite scores (physical and mental quality of life).</description>

    <description>At D0, M12 and M24. The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 Short Form (AIMS2-SF) is a specific tool to measure changes in global health, pain, mobility and social function in patients with arthritis. It was described in 1992 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and include 26 items that are summarized in scales according to a predefined scoring system: mobility, physical activity (walking, bending, lifting), dexterity, household activity (managing money and medications, housekeeping), social activities, activities of daily living, pain, depression, and anxiety. The French translation has been validated and this questionnaires has been widely used in the rheumatology field to assess quality of life of patients with arthritis. Because HFE related arthropathy is very similar to osteoarthritis this questionnaire is ought to be adequate in this setting.</description>

    <description>At D0, M12 and M24. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument which evaluates the generic quality of life (http://www.euroqol.org/). It is a preference-based health-related quality of life measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The answers given to EQ-5D permit to find 243 health states that can be converted into utility score anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. EQ-5D is an instrument developed in Europe, widely used in cost-utility analysis. It has been validated in a representative sample of French population.</description>
