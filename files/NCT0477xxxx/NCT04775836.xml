  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigators present methods and preliminary results from the&#xD;
      PLATFORM-CVD Study, an EHR-based multicenter cohort. This study will focus on assessing the&#xD;
      distribution of major cerebrovascular diseases, determining the risk factors associated with&#xD;
      disease incidence and worse in-hospital outcomes, as well as describing the quality of care.&#xD;
      Data from this cohort will be used to develop suitable prediction models for cerebrovascular&#xD;
      diseases using real-world data and to understand how outcomes for cerebrovascular diseases&#xD;
      would change with quality improvement interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to healthcare quality measures is needed to reduce the burden of cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease and improve clinical outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) can facilitate the&#xD;
      standardization of care provision and the improvement of disease prediction and prevention.&#xD;
      Although the EHRs in clinical settings are increasingly prevalent in China, they are rarely&#xD;
      used for healthcare research. the investigators aimed to conduct an EHR-based registry study&#xD;
      to improve the healthcare and outcomes for cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four hospitals were enrolled in the PLATFORM-CVD Study in January 2018. Data&#xD;
      collection began on February 1st, 2019. Historical data from January 2017 are abstracted&#xD;
      first and prospective data are continuously reported until May 20th, 2020. Data were&#xD;
      abstracted from the medical records, including hospital information system, laboratory&#xD;
      information management system, and picture archiving and communication systems by an&#xD;
      extract-transform-load tool. The EHR system included diagnostic information for cerebral&#xD;
      infarctions (I63), nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhages (I61), nontraumatic subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhages (I60), transient cerebral ischemic attacks and related syndromes (G45),&#xD;
      intracranial and intraspinal phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (G08), vascular dementia (F01),&#xD;
      and other aneurysms (I72). The quality of stroke care was assessed by 21 evidence-based&#xD;
      performance measures. In-hospital outcomes were calculated including mortality, length of&#xD;
      stay, and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLATFORM-CVD Study leverages EHRs to better understand incident cerebrovascular diseases&#xD;
      in China. Data from this cohort will serve as a unique platform for quality assessment and&#xD;
      improvement for acute treatment and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular diseases, as well&#xD;
      as in-hospital outcome risk predictions and health economic evaluations.&#xD;
