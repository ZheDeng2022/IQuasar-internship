  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) results in hand and arm function impairments and decreased&#xD;
      independence in performance of daily activities such as bathing, eating, dressing, writing,&#xD;
      or typing. Recent approaches that involve the application of non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      have the potential to strengthen the remaining connections between the brain and the spinal&#xD;
      cord for improved hand function. Combining brain stimulation with performing upper limb&#xD;
      functional tasks may further increase the ability of individuals with tetraplegia to use&#xD;
      their hands. The purpose of this study is to investigate if &quot;random noise&quot;, a special type of&#xD;
      brain stimulation that most people cannot feel, can be used to enhance upper limb function in&#xD;
      individuals with spinal cord injury. Specifically, the investigators will examine if a&#xD;
      combined treatment protocol of random noise and fine motor training results in greater&#xD;
      improvements in motor and sensory hand function compared to fine motor training alone.&#xD;

      Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) results in upper extremity (UE) functional impairments that&#xD;
      can restrict independence, social participation, and overall quality of life. Evidence shows&#xD;
      that short duration of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can strengthen the transmission&#xD;
      of information through the spared corticospinal pathways and improve UE functional recovery&#xD;
      in individuals with tetraplegia. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is a&#xD;
      clinically accessible NIBS approach, has been used to modulate cortical plasticity and&#xD;
      improve hand function. However, the high variability in the reported effects of tDCS raises&#xD;
      questions about its clinical value and highlights the need to investigate more robust NIBS&#xD;
      protocols. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is a novel NIBS approach that&#xD;
      produces more consistent facilitatory effects compared to tDCS. TRNS delivers a low&#xD;
      alternating current with a continuously changing intensity over a wide frequency range.&#xD;
      Further, tRNS has excellent tolerability and no risk of skin burns since it is a polarity&#xD;
      independent stimulation approach. When tRNS is applied over the motor cortex, it increases&#xD;
      cortical excitability in the hand representation area and enhances motor learning in healthy&#xD;
      adults. Despite the potential promise of tRNS in increasing corticomotor drive for improved&#xD;
      motor performance, its application in persons with SCI is novel. Therefore, in this study,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to use tRNS to augment the therapeutic effects of functional task&#xD;
      practice (FTP). Our aim is to compare the efficacy of a 3-day tRNS+FTP protocol on cortical&#xD;
      excitability, UE motor, and sensory function to tDCS+FTP and to sham-stimulation+FTP in&#xD;
      individuals with tetraplegia.&#xD;

    <description>The communication between brain and spinal cord will be evaluated. Sensors that detect muscle activity will be placed over hand muscles. Pulses of stimulation will be applied to the head using a type of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The size of the muscle response will be recorded.</description>
