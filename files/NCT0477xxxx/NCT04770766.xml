      This study will explore the result of different skill-mix in ED/UTCs in England, to make&#xD;
      recommendations about the best balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives have helped design the study. There will&#xD;
      be an independent PPI panel who can feed in their views and experiences to all parts of the&#xD;
      study. The panel will be run by an experienced patient and public involvement expert, who is&#xD;
      a member of the core study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be split into four phases over two-and-a-half years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One will find out in detail what the staffing models are in EDs/UTCs. The investigators&#xD;
      will look at published research evidence and at NHS public documents, and will interview&#xD;
      regional and national senior NHS clinicians, managers, commissioners and lay representatives.&#xD;
      Then, information about staff which is already collected regularly across England will be&#xD;
      analysed for patterns. What non-medical practitioners do and how independently they work in&#xD;
      two different ED/UTCs will also be examined. The panel of patient and public involvement&#xD;
      representatives and a panel of non-medical practitioners will help interpret these findings.&#xD;
      The study will develop a system for classifying 'skill-mix' in each organisation and a way to&#xD;
      measure how much support and supervision non-medical practitioners need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Two will look at figures regularly collected from all NHS Trusts in England between&#xD;
      2017 and 2021, to assess whether different skill mixes lead to different patient outcomes.&#xD;
      The number of patients who return again to the ED within a week is the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Three will involve looking in detail in six ED/UTCs. The investigators will collect in&#xD;
      depth local data to add to the national data we looked at in Phase Two. This will include&#xD;
      looking closely at staff records and patients' clinical records to illustrate more detail&#xD;
      about skill-mix in the organisations and the outcomes for patients. The study plans to gauge&#xD;
      how independently the types of practitioners assess and treat patients and to also survey and&#xD;
      interview patients so that their experience can be understood, alongside the views of staff&#xD;
      who will also be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Four will pull all of the results together. The panels of patient and public&#xD;
      involvement representatives and non-medical practitioners will help with this synthesis. The&#xD;
      study aims to make recommendations on skill-mix and levels of independence that will deliver&#xD;
      the best outcomes for patients, for staff and for the NHS.&#xD;

      Primary research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the impact of different non-medical practitioner skill-mix in Emergency Departments&#xD;
      (ED) and Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC) in acute hospitals on patient and service processes&#xD;
      and outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing demand for emergency and urgent care has occurred alongside staffing shortage,&#xD;
      particularly of doctors. Re-shaping of the workforce has resulted, including the introduction&#xD;
      of non-medical practitioners (NMPs), such as nurse practitioners and physician associates.&#xD;
      Despite 20 years of NMPs in EDs, there is limited evidence of effectiveness of individual&#xD;
      roles, and none as to appropriate skill-mix of staff, at what level of independence from&#xD;
      senior medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore how NMPs are being deployed and the impact of different skill-mix including NMPs&#xD;
      in EDs and UTCs on patient experience, quality of care, clinical outcomes, activity, staff&#xD;
      experience and costs in acute NHS trusts in England, in order to inform workforce decisions&#xD;
      of clinicians, managers and commissioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methods study will be conducted in three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One (months 1-12) aims to describe the rationale for, and configurations of, the NMP&#xD;
      workforce in EDs/UTCs in England, and to develop analytical tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will undertake and publish a scoping literature and policy review on&#xD;
           NMP development and skill-mix outcomes, informed by interviews with senior NHS&#xD;
           clinicians, managers, commissioners and lay representatives (Work package [WP] 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NHS Digital and NHS Benchmarking national data, 2017-2021 will be used to describe&#xD;
           quantitatively the NMP and other clinical workforce (skill-mix); and observation (WP2)&#xD;
           will enable qualitative description of the level of independence/supervision of NMPs and&#xD;
           doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP1 and WP2 results will be triangulated in consultative activities with patient and&#xD;
           public and NMP representatives, and the independent study steering committee, to develop&#xD;
           three analytical tools: a skill-mix ratio classification, a quantitative measure of&#xD;
           independence and supervision, and a logic model for NMP skill-mix (WP3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two (months 13-18) aims to utilise the analytical tools to assess the impact of&#xD;
      skill-mix ratios on national ED/UTC indicators of quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢The investigators will conduct and publish a quasi-experimental study of associations of&#xD;
      skill-mix ratio classifications with our primary outcome (rate of unplanned return to the&#xD;
      ED/UTC in seven days, a proxy for clinical safety), secondary outcomes (national indicators&#xD;
      of ED/UTC quality and performance), and cost-effectiveness. (WP4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase three (months 13-24) aims to explain the effectiveness and acceptability of skill-mix&#xD;
      ratios through investigation in six local-level case study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The WP4 analysis will be repeated with added precise local quantitative data on NMP&#xD;
           types (trust management information), controlling for level of independence/supervision&#xD;
           of the clinician (collected via structured observation). Patient satisfaction will be&#xD;
           added as an outcome, collected prospectively via questionnaire (WP5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experience of including NMPs in the skill-mix will be investigated through&#xD;
           qualitative interviews with patients and staff (WP6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase four (months 25-30) the investigators will prepare a synthesis of findings, using&#xD;
      the logic model, for structured discussion at a stakeholder event to prepare recommendations&#xD;
      and outputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timelines for delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place from March 2021 to August 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will generate new knowledge and understanding of optimum/most effective/impact&#xD;
      of different skill-mix outcomes to translate into workforce models with our NHS partners.&#xD;
      Commissioners, clinicians and managers will be able to assess their local skill-mix in&#xD;
      relation to the guidance on (optimum) skill-mix outcomes. Dissemination throughout the study&#xD;
      will include policy briefings, academic outputs, bite-size findings, conference presentations&#xD;
      and social and mainstream media routes accessible to stakeholders.&#xD;
