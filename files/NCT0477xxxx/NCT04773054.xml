  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data showed that the rate of periprosthetic infections in patients undergoing a hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty revision for aseptic loosening is higher than what can be ascertained with&#xD;
      conventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to assess the adequacy of next-generation sequencing of 16s ribosomal&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplicons for identifying occult infections and improving the&#xD;
      diagnostic workup. Moreover, additional testing has been planned in order to increase&#xD;
      knowledge on the etiopathogenesis of infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periprosthetic infection following hip arthroplasty is one of the main causes of implant&#xD;
      failure that leads to multiple surgical interventions, prolonged hospitalization, and higher&#xD;
      complication rate and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data prove that the rate of periprosthetic infections is higher than what can be&#xD;
      ascertained with conventional techniques and highlight as analytical methods that allow an&#xD;
      early and accurate diagnosis may help clinicians identify effective treatment and mitigate&#xD;
      the devastating consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies based on culture-independent assays, i.e., the next-generation sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS) of 16s rRNA gene amplicons, have entered medical microbiology as an alternative to&#xD;
      traditional bacterial identification methods. NGS has been proven to detect microorganisms in&#xD;
      culture-negative periprosthetic joint infection and seems to be a valid adjunct in&#xD;
      identifying causative pathogens in samples from patients undergoing a hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      revision for aseptic loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiota profiling using NGS may also help identify patients prone to develop&#xD;
      infections. In predisposing clinical conditions, i.e., obesity and diabetes, the metabolic&#xD;
      and nutritional alterations modify the composition and the immunomodulatory properties of&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota. Saprophytic, non-pathogenic microorganisms usually found in the&#xD;
      intestine and oral cavity can be transferred to other areas becoming a potential source of&#xD;
      periprosthetic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, microorganisms may live in the periprosthetic microenvironment without giving&#xD;
      signs of overt infection. However, bacterial products, i.e., &quot;microbe-associated molecular&#xD;
      patterns&quot; (MAMPs) or &quot;pathogen-associated molecular patterns &quot;(PAMPs), adhere to the implant&#xD;
      surface or the wear particles and may elicit a local inflammatory response characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of cells capable of producing cytokines that promote osteoclastogenesis,&#xD;
      periprosthetic resorption and consequent loosening of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the current knowledge suggests that the hip arthroplasty loosening, classified as&#xD;
      aseptic according to the preoperative clinical and laboratory investigations, could be&#xD;
      directly or indirectly associated with infectious pathogenesis even if the microbial cultures&#xD;
      on periprosthetic tissues are negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a small-scale study to assess the adequacy of NGS for identifying&#xD;
      occult infections and improving the diagnostic workup in patients undergoing a hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty revision for aseptic loosening. Moreover, additional testing has been planned to&#xD;
      enhance knowledge on the role of unusual or difficult-to-cultivate microorganisms in the&#xD;
      etiopathogenesis of implant failure.&#xD;
