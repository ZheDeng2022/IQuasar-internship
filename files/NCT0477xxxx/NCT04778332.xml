  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the risk, consequences and epidemiology of electric&#xD;
      scooter accidents admitted to the emergency room at St. Pierre University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study aims to include any patient admitted to the Adult&#xD;
      Emergency Department of St.Pierre University Hospital Brussels following an accident related&#xD;
      to the use of an electric scooter in order to describe and understand the epidemiology,&#xD;
      complications and treatment of injuries associated with this means of transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to include all accidents occurring in the emergency room during the period&#xD;
      from 01/06/2019 to 30/06/2020.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients over the age of 16 years with traumatic injuries due to an accident related to&#xD;
      the use of an electric scooter were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon admission to the Emergency Department, patients over 16 years of age who accepted were&#xD;
      included in the study. The objectives of the study were firstly to describe the context and&#xD;
      incidence of scooter accidents, and secondly to understand the epidemiology, complications&#xD;
      and treatment of injuries associated with this means of transport and finally, to estimate&#xD;
      the economic impact assessed by the number of days of post-traumatic work disability, the&#xD;
      need for access to more specialised and therefore more expensive care (operating theatre&#xD;
      interventions, scanner-type radiological examinations or hospitalisation in intensive care&#xD;
      units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analyzed were based on :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) the time and day of the accident, 2) the time of presentation at the hospital (same day or&#xD;
      after the accident), 3) the mechanism of the accident, whether there were one or two people&#xD;
      on the scooter, 4) the use or non-use of the protective helmet, 5) the influence of alcohol ;&#xD;
      6) the mode of arrival at the emergency room (type of ambulance or by one's own means); 7)&#xD;
      the injury assessment, paraclinical examinations; 8) treatments; 9) hospitalization or not;&#xD;
      10) temporary work interruptions .&#xD;
