      The objective of this multicentre descriptive analysis is to describe the clinical and&#xD;
      biological characteristics of patients who have received Programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) /&#xD;
      (PDL1) Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) immunotherapy outside of a clinical trial in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is now an option in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. A French&#xD;
      study, Mesothelioma Avastin plus Pemetrexed-cisplatin Study 2 (MAPS 2), prospective in 2nd&#xD;
      line or more, found 40% and 52% disease control rate with respectively an anti-PD1 antibody&#xD;
      or a combo of anti-PD1 and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4). Safety&#xD;
      was rather good with 14% and 26% grade 3-4 in the Nivolumab and combo group respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to this trial and data from the literature, Programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) /&#xD;
      (PDL1) Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) immunotherapy became an option in the treatment of&#xD;
      malignant pleural mesothelioma, after validation by a multidisciplinary meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicentre descriptive analysis is to describe the clinical and&#xD;
      biological characteristics of patients who have received anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy outside&#xD;
      of a clinical trial in terms of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
