  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) or tennis elbow; is the most common cause of lateral pain in the&#xD;
      elbow, with an incidence of 1-3% in the general population. It is thought to develop as a&#xD;
      result of overuse inflammation of the wrist joint extensor tendons, originating from the&#xD;
      lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The most common symptom is the pain located in the lateral&#xD;
      aspect of the elbow, which can spread across the forearm extensor face and is aggravated by&#xD;
      wrist extension, forearm supination, and strong grip movements of the hand. The diagnosis is&#xD;
      made by clinical and ultrasonographic evaluations. Significant correlations were found&#xD;
      between clinical symptoms of LE and increased joint extensor tendon thickness, focal&#xD;
      hypoechogenicity, intratendinous calcification, bone abnormality, and diffuse heterogeneity&#xD;
      findings that can be monitored by diagnostic ultrasound. Wait-see policy, conservative&#xD;
      treatment regimens, local injections, and surgical approaches are the treatment methods that&#xD;
      can be used on a patient-based basis until today. Conservative treatment options include&#xD;
      physical therapy modalities such as exercise, massage, laser, electrotherapy, therapeutic&#xD;
      ultrasound, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, the use of various splints, ice application,&#xD;
      activity modification, rest, NSAIDs, and taping methods. The two prominent bracing methods&#xD;
      are the lateral epicondylitis band and the wrist extension splint. Although these two methods&#xD;
      are frequently used in daily practice, the limitations of studies investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of orthoses and which orthosis are more effective draw attention. In&#xD;
      comparative studies, some factors may affect clinical results such as allowing patients to&#xD;
      use NSAIDs when necessary and organizing a home exercise program. Besides, none of them&#xD;
      included a control group and the patients were not evaluated by ultrasonography. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare the effects of the use of two different splints (lateral epicondylitis band&#xD;
      and wrist extension splint) on clinical and ultrasonographic parameters in patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is randomized and controlled. 158 patients will be included in to study who apply&#xD;
      to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of elbow pain, aged between 18-65 years and&#xD;
      diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis by clinical and ultrasonographic methods. These patients&#xD;
      will be divided into three groups randomly (group1 n:53, group 2 n:53, group 3 n:52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First group: A lateral epicondylitis bandage will be given to the patient for 6 weeks. The&#xD;
      bandage will be positioned 5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle to allow for elbow flexion.&#xD;
      After the application, patients will be asked to punch and the belt on the band will be&#xD;
      tightened. After the patients are asked to open the fist, the suitability of the pressure&#xD;
      applied to the forearm will be evaluated. Patients will also be asked to repeat this&#xD;
      application while wearing the band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second group: A wrist extension splint will be given to the patient for 6 weeks. The splint&#xD;
      will be used to keep the wrist at 15-20 degrees of extension and to wrap the distal wrist and&#xD;
      forearm without hindering finger movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third group: These patients will be monitored with a wait-and-see policy. No splint or band&#xD;
      will be given to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment, age, gender, occupation, body mass index, duration of symptoms, trauma&#xD;
      history, dominant hand, side of the symptom and previous similar complaint history will be&#xD;
      questioned in all three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be asked not to lift heavy for 6 weeks, to use their splints&#xD;
      throughout the day, and to remove them during bathing and sleeping. Throughout the study, all&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to take only paracetamol oral tablets as pain relief if needed and&#xD;
      will be asked to keep a medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated 3 times, before the treatment, in the 3rd week during the&#xD;
      treatment process, and in the 6th week after the treatment with a visual analog scale,&#xD;
      patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation questionnaire, hand dynamometer, and ultrasonographic&#xD;
      measurements. All evaluations will be done blindly by the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomized controlled single-blind study is to compare the effects of&#xD;
      lateral epicondylitis bandage and wrist extension splint treatment on ultrasonographic&#xD;
      changes in patients with lateral epicondylitis. Ultrasonographic evaluations will include&#xD;
      measurement of maximum tendon thickness and assessment of hypoechogenicity, heterogeneity,&#xD;
      neovascularity, and bone abnormality. The maximum tendon thickness in the capitellar and&#xD;
      radiocapitellar regions of the common extensor tendon will be measured for both upper&#xD;
      extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare the effects of these two different splint treatments on&#xD;
      clinical changes such as pain, functional disability, sensitivity, and handgrip strength.&#xD;
      Pain and functional disability will be measured by the Visual Analog Scale and Patient Rated&#xD;
      Tennis Elbow Evaluation questionnaire, the sensitivity will be measured by algometer, and&#xD;
      handgrip strength will be measured by hydraulic hand dynamometer for both hands.&#xD;
