      It was hypothesized that:&#xD;

      There is no statistical significant effects of a scapular vupward rotation exercise (SURE) on&#xD;
      scapular alignment in subjects with scapular downward rotation syndrome (SDRS).&#xD;

      mechanosensitivity of the upper limb peripheral nervous system in a depressed scapular&#xD;
      alignment subjects.&#xD;

      This study was conducted to investigate the effects of scapular upward rotation exercises on&#xD;
      strength duration curve and pressure pain threshold (PPT) in subjects with scapular downward&#xD;
      rotation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects with age range of 18 to 30 years with scapular downward rotation were&#xD;
      recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty subjects of both gender with scapular downward rotation were recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited subjects were examined to exclude defined pathological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were assessed by screening examination for downward rotation of scapula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain threshold was measured using pressure algometer. Mechanosensitivity of neural&#xD;
      tissue was measured using neurodynamic test. Pain was measured using strength-duration (SD)&#xD;
      curve. Treatment program consisted of 3 sessions/week, for 6 weeks. All measurements were&#xD;
      taken pre and post the treatment period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  University population were screened for subjects with scapular downward rotation,&#xD;
             those who met the following criteria was recruited in this study. The inclusion&#xD;
             criteria for subject selection in this study was based on the literature (Caldwell et&#xD;
             al., 2007; Ha et al., 2011) which included:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The scapula was downwardly rotated by visual appraisal.We examined the root of&#xD;
                  spine of scapulae (superior angle) and inferior angle of scapulae. If scapulae&#xD;
                  was downwardly rotated, inferior angle closer to spine than root of spine of&#xD;
                  scapulae (superior angle).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The clavicle appeared to be horizontal or the acromioclavicular joint was lower&#xD;
                  than the sternoclavicular joint by visual appraisal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The vertebral borders of the scapula was less than 3 inches from the spine by&#xD;
                  tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who has any of the following criteria was excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects with cervical spinal fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Neck-rotation ROM of &lt;20ยบ.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Radiating pain to an upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Leg length discrepancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. A history of unresolved cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Diabetes Miletus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Myofascial Pain Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Fibromyalgia.&#xD;
