      Purpose of the study is the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the&#xD;
      Laryngopharyngeal Measure of Perceived Sensation (T-LUMP) Questionnaire, so that it would be&#xD;
      used as an assessment tool for Turkish globus pharyngeus patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globus pharyngeus or sensation may be defined as a feeling of something a lump in the throat&#xD;
      without dysphagia. The study will assess the construct validity and reliability of the&#xD;
      Turkish version of Laryngopharyngeal Measure of Perceived Sensation (T-LUMP) Questionnaire.&#xD;
      The investigators developed the Turkish version of this questionnaire (T-LUMP), according to&#xD;
      the cross-cultural adaptation guidelines. Two translators translated the LUMP into Turkish&#xD;
      and a native English language speaker reverse-translated it into English. The back&#xD;
      translation was sent to the original author for proofreading. The final version of the LUMP&#xD;
      questionnaire consisted of 8 basic and understandable questions related with globus&#xD;
      pharyngeus symptoms.&#xD;
