      The purpose of this phase IV study is to identify innovative early imaging parameters as&#xD;
      predictors of the long-term clinical response to brolucizumab in terms of fluid resolution in&#xD;
      patients with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (wAMD) with the purpose to evaluate their&#xD;
      potential in supporting the treatment regimen choice (q12w or q8w).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate anxiety/depression in patients with wAMD treated with brolucizumab. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen-item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. This patient-reported outcome measure was specifically developed to avoid reliance on anxiety/depression aspects which are also common somatic symptoms of illness, such as fatigue and insomnia or hypersomnia. Calculations of scores: each item is rated on a 4-point scale. The HADS consists of two sub-scores: the HAD-A for anxiety and HAD-D for depression. Each sub-score ranges from 0 to 21 points: scores ≥11 indicate the presence of an anxious or depressive disorder, scores between 8-10 points are borderline abnormal, and scores ≤7 indicate that an anxious or depressive disorder is not present.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate quality of life in patients with wAMD treated with brolucizumab. CRTH258AIT04. The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized widely used instrument for measuring generic health status. It comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels. i.e. no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, corresponding to digit numbers ranging from 1 to 5. The EQ-5D-5L total score is determined through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicative of a better health status.</description>
