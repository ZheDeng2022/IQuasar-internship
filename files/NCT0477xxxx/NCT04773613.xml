  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges of modern neonatology is to identify the right and effective method&#xD;
      that can improve oral feeding. Optimal feeding position may contribute to improving the&#xD;
      quality and safety of bottle-feeding in premature infants.&#xD;

      PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the advantages of semi-elevated (SEP) with&#xD;
      side-lying positioning (SLP) during bottle-feeding of preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: The study included forty two neonates (n=42) born ≤34 weeks of gestational age. Four&#xD;
      bottle-feeding sessions were tested in each of the newborns: two in the SEP and two in the&#xD;
      SLP. The position for the first study was randomly assigned, then positioning changed after&#xD;
      each feeding session. In one day, only two consecutive feeding sessions which were included&#xD;
      to the study in order to minimize fatigability as a disrupting factor. The levels of&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured as the parameters indicative of the&#xD;
      newborn's physiological stability. The factors determining the qualitative aspect of feeding&#xD;
      included the total time of declines of SpO2 ≤85%, level of the newborn's alertness according&#xD;
      to the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), and the occurrence of choking episodes.&#xD;
      The proportion of milk consumed (volume of milk eaten relative to the expected volume) and&#xD;
      the duration of the feeding and feeding session were also recorded.&#xD;
