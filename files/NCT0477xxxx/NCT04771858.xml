  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the development of novel telemedical examination methods based on&#xD;
      sensor-based gait analysis in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In a first step, the&#xD;
      basic technical feasibility of measuring gait parameters in MS patients under standardized&#xD;
      conditions in the clinic and in the home environment of the study participants will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subsequent two-week study phase, gait parameters (real-life monitoring) and standardized&#xD;
      gait tests will be continuously recorded in the home environment of the study participants.&#xD;
      The comparability of the collected gait parameters from standardized gait tests and real-life&#xD;
      monitoring to clinical scales (e.g. EDSS) will investigate the medical applicability of gait&#xD;
      analysis as a target parameter in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New algorithms for detecting indication-specific gait patterns from gait analysis in&#xD;
      patients' daily lives and their possible changes over time (progression) will be explored and&#xD;
      implemented into the study system. In addition, a patient app annotates the standardized gait&#xD;
      tests and collects questionnaire-based data from the study participants during real-life&#xD;
      monitoring. Via a study tablet, the data of the gait analysis and the patient app are&#xD;
      transmitted to a study platform (Digital Patient Manager). The clinical assessment data&#xD;
      (neurological examination, questionnaires) can be entered via a web front-end of the study&#xD;
      platform and assigned to the patient via a pseudonym.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further aim of this study is to validate the technology used for its applicability in the&#xD;
      home environment. By means of structured interviews after the study phase, the study&#xD;
      participants will be asked about compliance and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following scientific questions will be investigated in this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) Is gait analysis a feasible and meaningful target parameter for MS centers? b) Are gait&#xD;
      parameters from real-life monitoring suitable biomarkers for the detection of MS symptoms? c)&#xD;
      Can gait parameters from standardized gait tests be compared with different testing&#xD;
      environments (clinic / home environment)? d) How do gait parameters from standardized gait&#xD;
      tests differ from gait data from real-life monitoring? e) How is the telemedical application&#xD;
      for the collection of gait parameters evaluated by the patients? f) Can disease progression&#xD;
      be detected using sensor-based gait parameters from the home environment?&#xD;
