  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) is an effective additional preventative measure for&#xD;
      reducing the risk of HIV transmission. To address low levels of uptake, there is a need for&#xD;
      public health interventions to increase target populations' awareness and willingness for&#xD;
      adopting PrEP. One potential solution may be to incorporate a network intervention, which&#xD;
      utilizes the connections between individuals to facilitate health behavior. This project&#xD;
      examines how online networks can influence PrEP adoption intentions among gay and bisexual&#xD;
      men through a mobile app-based experiment. In this study, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into a social support condition or information-only control. Both conditions will&#xD;
      involve an information component consisting messages aimed to address awareness, knowledge,&#xD;
      and perceived barriers of PrEP adoption. However, those in the social support condition will&#xD;
      also have an online chatting tool where they can discuss topics surrounding PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of the mobile app&#xD;
      intervention in increasing participants' knowledge/attitudes/intentions to initiate PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the mechanism of the intervention&#xD;
      through mediation analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Roughly 1.7 million people worldwide are infected with HIV each year (UNAIDS, 2017). HIV&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) refers to taking a daily oral medicine to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of contracting HIV. Known by the brand name Truvada or Descovy, PrEP is an effective&#xD;
      additional preventative measure for reducing the risk of HIV transmission. To address low&#xD;
      levels of uptake, there is a need for public health interventions to increase target&#xD;
      populations' awareness and willingness for adopting PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential solution may be to incorporate a network intervention, which utilizes the&#xD;
      connections between individuals to facilitate health behavior. In particular, online networks&#xD;
      can provide anonymous support that transcends geographical boundaries (DeAndrea, 2015).&#xD;
      Stigmatized behaviors, such as the adoption of PrEP, may greatly benefit from interventions&#xD;
      that utilize online networks. This project examines how online networks can influence PrEP&#xD;
      adoption intentions among gay and bisexual men through a mobile app-based experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways in which online networks may influence health; however, social support&#xD;
      may serve as the primary mechanism that influences PrEP adoption. In the context of HIV&#xD;
      prevention, social support has generally reduced HIV-related risky behaviors (Qiao, Li, &amp;&#xD;
      Stanton, 2014). Thus, it is important to consider social support as a factor than can&#xD;
      influence one's intention to adopt PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This field experiment will randomly assign participants into a social support condition or&#xD;
      information-only control, and then randomly assign them into homophilous, clustered&#xD;
      six-member peer networks. Both conditions will involve an information component consisting&#xD;
      messages aimed to address awareness, knowledge, and perceived barriers of PrEP adoption.&#xD;
      Social support will be operationalized through an online chatting tool where participants can&#xD;
      discuss topics surrounding PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of the mobile app&#xD;
      intervention in increasing participants' knowledge/attitudes/intentions to initiate PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the mechanism of the intervention&#xD;
      through mediation analyses.&#xD;
