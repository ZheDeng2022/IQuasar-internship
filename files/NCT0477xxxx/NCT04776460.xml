  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hong Kong, similar as other developed economic entities, has been faced big challenges from&#xD;
      increasing medical burden and aged population. Based on the updated estimates of domestic&#xD;
      health expenditure by Food and Health Bureau HKSAR, the total health expenditure amounted to&#xD;
      HK$112,144 million in 2012/13 with increasing approximate 4 times than 1992/93. According to&#xD;
      the data from Census and Statistics Department, in 2010, there was still 13% population aged&#xD;
      above 65 years, while in 2039, this percentage will be elevated to 28%&#xD;
      (http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/so20.jsp). In other words, every three individuals&#xD;
      will contain a person aged above 65 years in the future 30 years. Therefore, how to release&#xD;
      the medical burden resulted from aged tendency of population is the critical question in&#xD;
      optimizing the treatment expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aims in the cross-sectional study are to 1) estimate the number and percentage of nine&#xD;
      body constitutions among population aged 65 and over in Hong Kong 2) identify the&#xD;
      associations between nine body constitutions and other predetermined factors such as gender,&#xD;
      weight, diet, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, quality of life scale scores, et al.&#xD;

        The study will select the populations of aged 65 and over as subjects. We aims to cover&#xD;
        0.5% of these population and then 5,300 participants will be recruited from public. The&#xD;
        random core sample will be obtained using stratified random sampling, where residential&#xD;
        address will be randomly sampled in all 18 districts in Hong Kong with sample size&#xD;
        proportionate to each of the district populations. We will invite them to enroll in our&#xD;
        Chinese medicine preventive study and consent form will also be sent by mail, email and&#xD;
        Whatsapp Business.&#xD;
