    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working&#xD;
             Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be relapsed or refractory to established therapies with known&#xD;
             clinical benefit in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or be intolerant of&#xD;
             those established MM therapies, and a candidate for talquetamab treatment in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating physician. Prior lines of therapy must include a proteasome&#xD;
             inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and an anti-CD38 antibody in any order&#xD;
             during the course of treatment. Participants who could not tolerate a PI,&#xD;
             immunomodulatory drugs or anti-CD38 antibody are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status grade of 0 or 1 at&#xD;
             screening and immediately before the start of study treatment administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and&#xD;
             within 24 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment using highly sensitive&#xD;
             pregnancy test either serum (Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [Beta-hCG]) or urine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants (or a legally acceptable representative) must sign an informed consent&#xD;
             form (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the purpose of, and procedures&#xD;
             required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study. Consent is to be&#xD;
             obtained prior to the initiation of any study-related tests or procedures that are not&#xD;
             part of standard-of-care for the participant's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toxicities from previous anticancer therapies that have not resolved to baseline&#xD;
             levels or to Grade 1 or less except for alopecia or peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a cumulative dose of corticosteroids equivalent to &gt;=140 milligrams (mg) of&#xD;
             prednisone within the 14-day period before the first step-up dose of study treatment&#xD;
             (does not include pretreatment medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central nervous system involvement or clinical signs of meningeal involvement of&#xD;
             multiple myeloma. If either is suspected, whole brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             and lumbar cytology are required during screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary compromise requiring supplemental oxygen use to maintain adequate&#xD;
             oxygenation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to the excipients of talquetamab&#xD;
