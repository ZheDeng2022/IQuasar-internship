  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand the normal function of swallowing and&#xD;
      respiratory muscles in order to establish normal parameters. This will allow us to compare&#xD;
      normal physiology and function of swallowing and breathing muscles to people with a medical&#xD;
      history that would put them at risk for a swallowing problem. Our goal is to identify the&#xD;
      best tests that can be quickly and easily administered to accurately detect swallowing&#xD;
      impairment in adults. Involvement is limited to a single 2-hour evaluation.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to understand the normal function of swallowing and&#xD;
      respiratory muscles in order to establish normal parameters. It will take approximately&#xD;
      90-120 minutes to complete. During this examination, you will have respiratory testing, cough&#xD;
      testing, lingual testing, voice testing, and will be asked to fill out some surveys. We will&#xD;
      then complete the swallowing test that uses both a moving x-ray and a small camera will be&#xD;
      inserted into the open passage of your nose to the back of your throat to watch your swallow&#xD;
      and look at your vocal folds (voice box). This will allow us to compare normal physiology and&#xD;
      function of swallowing and breathing muscles to people with a medical history that would put&#xD;
      them at risk for a swallowing problem. Our goal is to identify the best tests that can be&#xD;
      quickly and easily administered to accurately detect swallowing impairment in adults. Your&#xD;
      involvement is limited to a single 2-hour evaluation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Penetration Aspiration Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Validated swallowing safety measurement that is an eight-point ordinal scale to indicate the depth of airway invasion during swallowing and the associated response. A minimum score of 1 would be no airway invasion, to a maximum score of 8 being airway invasion with no effort to expel the tracheal matter. Therefore, the lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Yale Residue Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Validated measure of swallowing efficiency using a validated anatomically defined and image-based assessment of post-swallow pharyngeal residue severity. Clinical uses include accurate classification of vallecula and pyriform sinus residue severity patterns as none, trace, mild, moderate, or severe for diagnostic purposes, determination of functional therapeutic change, and precise dissemination of shared information.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vocal Fold Mobility Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>During a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), the vocal folds will be visualized using a small camera passed through the open nasal passage. The patient will be asked to make a series of vocal tasks so that we can visualize their movement, any immobility will be notated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>5-point ordinal scale used to rate both the safety and efficiency of swallowing trials. For efficiency, the minimal score of 0 means residue is less than 10%, the maximal score of 4 means there is more than 90% of residue across trials. For safety a minimal score of 0 means no airway invasion, and a maximal score of 4 means there was chronic and gross amounts of food or liquids that were aspirated. Therefore, the lower the scores, the better the outcomes.</description>

Participants will be given the instruction &quot;cough if you need to&quot; prior to capsaicin delivery.The solution will be administered automatically upon detection of an inspired breath and there will be a minimum of one minute between each trial. This is to test the reflexive cough testing for upper airway sensitivity and motor thresholds.</description>
