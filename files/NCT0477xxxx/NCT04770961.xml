  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to study whether local anesthetic via the erector spinae plane&#xD;
      (ESP) block may be beneficial in minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial comparing a control group receiving&#xD;
      cryoablation and sham block with an intervention group receiving cryoablation and ESP&#xD;
      catheter. The primary outcome is total oral morphine equivalent (OME) consumption within the&#xD;
      first 48 hours of recovery including intra-operative usage. Secondary outcomes to be&#xD;
      evaluated would include pain scores, functional milestones like time to extubation, time to&#xD;
      first PO intake, time to ambulation, time to chest tube removal, length of ICU and total&#xD;
      hospital stay, complications, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
