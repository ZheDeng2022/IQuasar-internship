  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order for the diagnosis of digestive system tumors and their appropriate treatment&#xD;
      afterward, the type of these tumors should be determined by the pathologist. Pathology&#xD;
      doctors need sufficient tissue (a small part of the organ thought to be diseased) to make a&#xD;
      diagnosis. Tissue samples were taken from the patients by biopsy procedure. It is examined&#xD;
      with microscopes by performing various staining and occasionally it is reported that&#xD;
      sufficient tissue cannot be provided to make a diagnosis. In this case, patients may be&#xD;
      subjected to repeated biopsy procedures. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      biopsy material obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is sufficient for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of the pathology physician with the naked eye. Researchers will try to determine to what&#xD;
      extent the physician performing the biopsy procedure can predict whether the tissue he has&#xD;
      obtained is sufficient for the pathologist. In this way, researchers think that fewer biopsy&#xD;
      repetitions will be needed in the future.&#xD;

      This study was designed to improve the acquisition of sufficient tissue (EUS-FNA) with&#xD;
      endosonography-assisted fine needle aspiration biopsy, which has been approved and used&#xD;
      worldwide for the diagnosis of digestive system diseases. The procedure to be applied in the&#xD;
      study is to determine the visible tissue fragments in the sample to be taken after the&#xD;
      standard EUS-FNA procedure and to compare it with the diagnosis made by the pathologist.&#xD;
      Patients with a tumor detected in the digestive system and referred to the investigation unit&#xD;
      for tissue diagnosis will be included in this study. The data obtained in the study will be&#xD;
      collected prospectively and will be analyzed retrospectively.&#xD;

    <description>Macroscopic appearance of the tissue fragments obtained by 22G EUS-FNA needle will be assessed by the endoscopist immediately in the endoscopy room. Endoscopits will decide the tissue acquisition is adequate. The diagnostic yield of the specimens determined by a pathologist will be compared to the endoscopist's first decision according to the macroscopic appearance.</description>
