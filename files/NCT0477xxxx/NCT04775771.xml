  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the normal development stage, children become ill for various reasons and maybe&#xD;
      hospitalised. Illnesses and hospitalization are major sources of stress for any growing&#xD;
      child. In addition to being admitted to the hospital, unknown environment, unknown people in&#xD;
      this environment, unknown equipment, scary voices, thought of physical harm, fears such as&#xD;
      separation from the family, etc. Different degrees of stress occur for reasons. In addition&#xD;
      to these, children face many problems related to physical limitations caused by&#xD;
      hospitalization due to illness, and they experience negative emotions such as anxiety, fear,&#xD;
      and anxiety. On the day the child is admitted to the hospital, the child and his family&#xD;
      experience high levels of anxiety. Children's anxiety and fear may negatively affect their&#xD;
      ability to understand the explanations to be made correctly, to interpret events&#xD;
      realistically, to make appropriate decisions, and to participate in care. Various treatment&#xD;
      methods such as therapeutic games, art therapy, drawing, occupational therapy,&#xD;
      animal-assisted practices/activities (HDU) are applied in the hospital environment to improve&#xD;
      the child's coping skills and to reduce negative emotions such as pain, anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
      fear. The animal-assisted practice is activities that offer various opportunities to improve&#xD;
      the quality of life and provide entertainment and therapeutic benefits. Although the use of&#xD;
      animal-assisted applications is widespread abroad, its use in our country and the rate of&#xD;
      reflection on the results of the study is quite limited. In the researches, interaction with&#xD;
      such animals; has been determined to be psychologically, emotionally, socially, and&#xD;
      physically supportive in children. It is planned to use goldfish in this study. Aquarium fish&#xD;
      is one of the ornamental fish sold in more than 125 countries and more than 2500 species&#xD;
      globally. No study has been conducted on the effects of aquarium fish, which are reported to&#xD;
      have positive effects and provide calming when applied with adult age groups within the scope&#xD;
      of animal-assisted practices, on anxiety, fear, psychological and emotional well-being in&#xD;
      children treated in a clinical setting. This study will be conducted to examine the effects&#xD;
      of animal-assisted practice on anxiety, fear, the psychological and emotional well-being of&#xD;
      children hospitalised.&#xD;

    <description>The State Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-1): It consists of 20 items scored from 1 to 3 according to the severity and the scores to be obtained from the scale data range between 20 and 60. The Cronbach-Alpha value of the scale was found to be 0.82. Although the validity and reliability study of the scale has been conducted on children aged 9-12, it is also used in children between the ages of 7-17.</description>

    <description>The Child Fear Scale (CFS): It is a scale consisting of showing five drawn facial expressions ranging from neutral expression (0 points) to &quot;no fear&quot;, to a frightened face (4 points) &quot;severe fear&quot;.

    <description>Stirling Children's Emotional and Psychological Well-being Scale (SCWBS): It is a scale developed to measure the emotional and psychological well-being levels of children between the ages of 8-15 and is graded between &quot;never&quot; (1 point) and &quot;always&quot; (5 points), consisting of 12 question items, in accordance with the 5-point Likert model. There is no reverse item on the scale. High scores from the scale indicate a high level of emotional and psychological well-being for children. Item-total correlation coefficients of the scale were ranked between 0.57-0.73; the Cronbach-Alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as 0.90.</description>

    <description>The children, who were planned to be hospitalized for at least three days and were randomized to the experimental and control groups, were asked by the researcher using the face-to-face interview technique, and the questions in the patient information form were filled in on the form. Then, pre-test data were recorded by determining their anxiety levels with the State Anxiety Scale for Children, levels of fear with the Child Fear Scale, emotional and psychological well-being with the Stirling Children's Emotional and Psychological Well-being Scale. Unlike the other scales, the anxiety levels were assessed twice with one-hour intervals on the first day with the Children's State Anxiety Scale. On the third day, the anxiety levels were evaluated twice with one-hour intervals on the first day using the State Anxiety Scale for Children. The second group, the children in the control group, had the same procedure except for the intervention; but no intervention was made.</description>
