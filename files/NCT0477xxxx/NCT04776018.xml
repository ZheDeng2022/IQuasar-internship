  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TAK-981 is being tested in combination with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies to treat&#xD;
      participants who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAK-981 in combination&#xD;
      with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on this combination treatment for 28-day cycles. They will continue with&#xD;
      this treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 in combination with an&#xD;
      anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody is being tested to treat people who have RRMM. The study will&#xD;
      include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 81 patients, approximately 30 participants in the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase (Part 1) approximately 15 participants in (Part 2) and up to 36 participants&#xD;
      in dose expansion phase (Part 2). Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 in&#xD;
      combination of fixed doses as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1, Part 1 - Dose Escalation: Arm A - TAK-981 Twice Weekly (BIW) + Mezagitamab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1, Part 1 - Dose Escalation: Arm B - TAK-981 Weekly (QW) + Mezagitamab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1, Part 2 - Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once RP2D is determined in Phase 1, participants with RRMM will be enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Phase 2 - Dose Expansion: TAK-981 + Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj or Mezagitamab&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America. The overall time to participate&#xD;
      in this study is 48 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 1: Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), By Severity at Each Dose Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal investigational drug. The untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after administration of first dose of study drug and through 30 days after last dose of study drug or until start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy. The severity of TEAEs will be based on the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. TEAEs will be graded on a 5-point scale where 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = potentially life-threatening and 5 = death.</description>
