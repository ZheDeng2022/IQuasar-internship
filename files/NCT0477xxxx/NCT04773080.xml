  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy serves as an exemplar of major operative trauma, with well-known risk of&#xD;
      pulmonary, cardiac, anastomotic, and septic complications and the presence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications after esophagectomies for cancer is associated with a reduced long-term&#xD;
      survival. There is a paucity in the literature regarding postoperative renal outcomes after&#xD;
      esophageal surgery, with a wide range of incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a historical cohort study aiming to evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative acute kidney injury in patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary, the investigators will assess the progression of the acute injury and the&#xD;
      association with adverse pulmonary, cardiac, anastomotic, and septic events, as well as&#xD;
      increase in hospital stay and mortality. The investigators will also identify risk factors&#xD;
      associated with acute kidney injury occurrence.&#xD;
