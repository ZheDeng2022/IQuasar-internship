  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is one of the most common oral diseases of childhood and is considered as a&#xD;
      major public health problem especially in areas with poor access to dental care. In a recent&#xD;
      cross sectional study carried out in Egypt on 1000 child aged from 3-6 years, it was found&#xD;
      that 61.4% of these children had dental caries. In order to avoid serious complications of&#xD;
      untreated dental caries such as pain, infections, emergency visits and possibly&#xD;
      hospitalization , an effective low cost treatment should be identified particularly in areas&#xD;
      with poor dental access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have proven that silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a topical fluoride that has the&#xD;
      ability to effectively arrest and prevent dental caries.&#xD;

      It was concluded that fluoride uptake into dentine from conventional GI restorations was not&#xD;
      affected in the presence of SDF and KI. It was also mentioned that the results may be&#xD;
      different if conditioning is applied not etching and recommended this for future&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether carious primary molars treated&#xD;
      with SDF and Potassium iodide (KI) prior to placing resin modified glass ionomer (RMGI)&#xD;
      restorations will affect the fluoride uptake into primary dentine or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study was conducted in Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department&#xD;
           Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM/EDX) measurement&#xD;
           analysis was conducted at the National Research Center (NRC), Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freshly extracted discarded primary molars were collected from outpatient clinic of Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University at the end of every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth were then sectioned through the center of the carious lesion mesiodistally using a&#xD;
           slow-speed cutting saw with coolant (Isomet 4000, USA) forming two similar halves, so&#xD;
           that the 20 molars were sectioned to 40 halves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each tooth was placed in a separate container with its 2 halves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth containers were then randomly allocated either to the control or intervention&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: One half empty and the other half with Resin Modified Glass Ionmer (RMGI)&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group : One half empty and the other half SDF+KI+RMGI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After dehydration, teeth were mounted on stubs using double-sided carbon tape, and&#xD;
           sputter coated with gold for 20 s using a Turbo molecular pumped coater (QUORUM 150T ES,&#xD;
           Laughton, United Kingdom) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth were then placed in SEM/EDX for fluoride measurement by weight percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data showed parametric distribution so; it was represented by mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) values. Independent and paired t-tests were used for inter and intragroup comparisons&#xD;
      respectively. The significance level was set at p ≤0.05 within all tests. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed with R statistical analysis software version 4.0.3 for windows (R Core&#xD;
      Team, 2020).&#xD;
