    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of BXQ-350 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      in children with newly diagnosed DIPG or DMG. All patients will receive BXQ-350 by&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion and radiation therapy. The study is divided into two parts: Part 1&#xD;
      will enroll patients at increasing dose levels of BXQ-350 in order to determine the MTD. Part&#xD;
      2 will enroll patients requiring a biopsy in order to assess BXQ-350 concentrations in the&#xD;
      biopsied tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin&#xD;
      C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid&#xD;
      dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a cell membrane phospholipid (clinical formulation&#xD;
      BXQ-350). Given via intravenous IV, data indicate that the agent exhibits the propensity to&#xD;
      enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death. DIPG and DMG&#xD;
      present a treatment dilemma due to resistance to standard therapy (radiotherapy) and&#xD;
      aggressive clinical course. The use of BXQ-350 provides a novel approach to the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer through interaction with the cancer cell membrane. This drug appears to be well&#xD;
      tolerated in previous clinical trials, and in combination with the standard of care radiation&#xD;
      therapy, may help improve overall survival in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Dose Escalation and Safety - Sequential cohorts of patients 1-30 years of age with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed DIPG or DMG will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is&#xD;
      established, or in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose, the highest planned dose level&#xD;
      is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: BXQ-350 Tumor and Plasma Concentrations - Patients undergoing neurosurgical biopsy&#xD;
      prior to receiving radiation therapy will be enrolled and receive BXQ-350 at the MTD&#xD;
      determined in Part 1, or at the highest planned dose level, and radiation therapy. Excised&#xD;
      tumor tissue will be evaluated for SapC levels and pharmacodynamic effects.&#xD;
