    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to develop novel approaches to promote health and longevity&#xD;
      while enhancing quality of life among persons with Sickle cell disease (SCD). Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators are aiming to adapt an evidence-based exercise intervention for adults with SCD&#xD;
      informed by culturally- relevant and biologic factors and pre-test the adapted exercise&#xD;
      program in a small sample of adults with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major public health concern as it is the most common inherited&#xD;
      blood disorder in the US, affecting over 100,000 persons.(1) This disease predominantly&#xD;
      affects African Americans, occurring in 1 out 365 African American births. Sickle cell&#xD;
      disease causes intermittent extremely painful vaso-occlusion events, which lead to&#xD;
      multi-organ damage, significant morbidity and early mortality - and resulting in increased&#xD;
      healthcare utilization with estimated annual United States healthcare costs of 786&#xD;
      million.(2,3) To date, there are very few strategies for reducing pain, preventing organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, and improving quality of life for persons with SCD leading to a disproportionate&#xD;
      disparity in care. For this reason, there is a critical need to develop novel approaches to&#xD;
      promote health and longevity while enhancing quality of life among persons with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness are important predictors of cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes and overall survival; however, adults with SCD have severely reduced levels of&#xD;
      fitness, with less than 50% of expected compared to the general population. (4) Since&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary disease accounts for 40% of the mortality in adults with SCD, enhancing&#xD;
      physical activity with regular exercise is one potential method for improving survival,&#xD;
      reducing poor Cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, and improving quality of life for adults&#xD;
      with SCD.(5,6) Evidence-based exercise interventions in rheumatoid arthritis, an&#xD;
      inflammatory, chronic disease with similar sequelae to SCD, have shown that exercise&#xD;
      interventions can increase quality of life, reduce pain, and improve CVD outcomes.(7-9)&#xD;
      Currently, a paucity of research on the benefits of exercise for SCD exists and this is a&#xD;
      critical barrier to overcome to both understand the role of physical fitness SCD and to&#xD;
      develop evidence-based recommendations to guide exercise in SCD. Only one small study of an&#xD;
      exercise intervention program in France has reported exercise to be safe, effective, and&#xD;
      reverse SCD-related muscle vasculature damage but long term data in larger populations are&#xD;
      needed.(10) Therefore, there is a need to conduct more studies in the United States and to&#xD;
      develop an evidence-based exercise program for adults with SCD that integrates patient&#xD;
      perspectives, can be broadly implemented among different settings, and is physically safe. To&#xD;
      address this unmet need, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that an evidence-based&#xD;
      exercise intervention informed by the needs and preferences of adults with SCD will be&#xD;
      feasible, acceptable, and tolerable in a cohort of adults with SCD. Our long-term goal is to&#xD;
      develop a safe and effective exercise intervention to promote sustainable physical activity&#xD;
      in SCD and to guide exercise recommendations for SCD which currently do not exist. Therefore,&#xD;
      investigators propose to adapt an evidence-based exercise intervention for adults with SCD&#xD;
      informed by culturally- relevant and biologic factors and pre-test the adapted exercise&#xD;
      program in a small sample of adults with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be to collect preliminary data on feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and tolerability of the exercise intervention. Rates of recruitment and&#xD;
      retention will be measured to assess feasibility. Acceptability will be measured through&#xD;
      attendance, engagement, and qualitative feedback. Tolerability will be measured by the&#xD;
      ability for participants to complete the exercise program without adverse events.&#xD;
