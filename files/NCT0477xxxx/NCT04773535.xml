      This project is set to compare the wrist joint movement measurements of the DyCare® Lynx&#xD;
      System with optoelectronic motion analysis using a marker system and infrared cameras.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 healthy test persons will be subjected to both the DyCare® Lynx and the Vicon®&#xD;
      measurements during standard movements as well as during activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      wrist joint angles measured with both systems will be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accepted laboratory gold standards for human motion analysis are too over-elaborated for&#xD;
      clinical use. The DyCare® Lynx system is user-friendly and has been proven reliable for&#xD;
      motion evaluation of different joints, but not yet for the wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this project is set to compare the wrist joint movement measurements of the&#xD;
      DyCare® Lynx System with optoelectronic motion analysis using a marker system and infrared&#xD;
      cameras. DyCare® Lynx is based on two inertial sensors (DyTrack) capable of objectively&#xD;
      measuring three dimensional joint movements in real time. Each inertial sensor includes an&#xD;
      accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer and captures up to 1'000 samples per second.&#xD;
      DyCare® Lynx is certified for measurements on the human musculoskeletal apparatus (EN ISO&#xD;
      13485:2003 Certificate No. 15185 - M), is CE marked and will only be applied to each&#xD;
      participant for a few minutes during the measurements. The control measurements will be&#xD;
      conducted using a Vicon® motion capture system in the Motion Analysis Laboratory of the&#xD;
      Department of Plastic Surgery and Hand Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. The&#xD;
      Vicon® system is equipped with 11 infrared cameras. The system is made for 'Life science&#xD;
      application' and is approved as CE medical device. A total of 10 healthy test persons will be&#xD;
      subjected to both the DyCare® Lynx and the Vicon® measurements during standard movements as&#xD;
      well as during activities of daily living. The wrist joint angles measured with both systems&#xD;
      will be compared, therefore limits of agreement, maximum difference and root mean squared&#xD;
      difference will be calculated to quantify the deviation between methods. The standard error&#xD;
      of measurements will be calculated to determine repeatability of the systems.&#xD;
