  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase Ib/IIa study. Up to 25 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study (Part A: 2-18; Part B: 7-19). The study has been designed to allow an&#xD;
      investigation of the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst of Osimertinib plus&#xD;
      Anlotinib in patients with EGFRm+, treatment-naïve IIIb/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      ensuring the safety of patients with intensive safety monitoring. There are two main parts to&#xD;
      this study; Part A, Combination dose finding and Parts B, Dose expansion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A has been designed to identify the recommended dose of the combination of Osimertinib&#xD;
      plus Anlotinib for further clinical evaluation based upon assessment of the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability data collected during the first 21 days (cycle 1, 21 days per cycle). A cycle of&#xD;
      study treatment will be defined as 21 days. Dosing will begin at Osimertinib 80mg QD&#xD;
      continuously and Anlotinib 8mg QD from day1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle. In the first 6 patients,&#xD;
      a delay of at least 21 days (the first group of 3 patients) and a delay of at least 7 days&#xD;
      (the second group of 3 patients) will be mandatory between the administration of the first&#xD;
      dose to the first patient and administration of first dose to subsequent patients. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled to ensure a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 evaluable patients per cohort.&#xD;
      Dose escalation and de-escalation will follow the scheme below, according to the following&#xD;
      logic：If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed (for definition see Section 4.1.3) in a&#xD;
      cohort of 3 evaluable patients then dose escalation may occur. Dose increases will be&#xD;
      permitted after review of data from a minimum of 3 evaluable patients has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one patient experiences a DLT in a group of 3 evaluable patients then the cohort will&#xD;
           be expanded to include 6 evaluable patients. If only one DLT is observed in the complete&#xD;
           cohort of 6 evaluable patients then dose escalation may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 2 or more patients experience a DLT in a group of up to 6 patients, irrespective of&#xD;
           the number of patients enrolled, the dose will be considered not tolerated and&#xD;
           recruitment to the cohort and dose escalation will cease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be intensively monitored in part A. If RP2D was not reached in Part A, Part B&#xD;
      would not be initiated. If RP2D was reached in Part A, eligible patients in part B will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive Osimertinib (80mg QD, continuously) plus Anlotinib (RP2D, QD from day 1&#xD;
      to 14 of a 21-day cycle) till disease progression (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, with the aim&#xD;
      to further evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy in terms of ORR, DCR, DOR, PFS,&#xD;
      overall survival at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all eligible patients (Part A and Part B), tissue and/or blood samples at baseline and PD&#xD;
      will be collected to understand the resistance profile.&#xD;

    <description>RP2D is defined as the dose cohort as follows: (1). If 2 or more of 6 patients in cohort 1 experienced a DLT, the combination would not be considered tolerable. There would be no RP2D and no dose expansion. (2). If none of the first 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients in starting dose cohort 1 experienced a DLT, dose escalation to cohort 2 would be done in the next 3 to 6 patients. If 2 or more patients experienced a DLT in up to 6 patients in cohort 2, the RP2D will defined as Osimertinib 80mg and Anlotinib 8mg. (3).If none of the first 3 patients or 1 of 6 patients in cohort 2 experienced a DLT, dose escalation to cohort 3 would be done in the next 3 to 6 patients. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT in up to 6 patients in cohort 3, the RP2D will defined as Osimertinib 80mg and Anlotinib 10mg. (4). If none of the first 3 patients or 1 out of 6 patients experienced a DLT in cohort 3, the RP2D would be Osimertinib 80mg and Anlotinib 12mg.</description>
