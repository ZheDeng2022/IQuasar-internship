  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves an evaluation of whether providing small incentives weekly for dietary&#xD;
      self-monitoring and/or weight loss improves short- and long-term weight loss. Participants&#xD;
      can expect to be on study for 18 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this two-site, randomized, single-blinded, longitudinal 2x2 factorial study, called&#xD;
      Log2Lose, adults with obesity from Madison, WI and Durham, NC will be offered a 78 week,&#xD;
      evidence-based behavioral weight management program comprising an incentivized weight loss&#xD;
      intervention for 26 weeks (Phase I), an incentivized weight loss maintenance intervention for&#xD;
      26 weeks (Phase II), and a non-incentivized weight maintenance intervention for 26 weeks&#xD;
      (Phase III). Participants will be randomized in a 2x2 design to receive adjunctive incentives&#xD;
      for either weekly weight loss or dietary self-monitoring, both, or neither. The investigators&#xD;
      will assess the proportion of participants achieving clinically significant weight loss of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 5 percent at the end of each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will participate in an 18-month weight management program delivered via&#xD;
      videoconference.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>First, investigators will strip all data of personal identifiers (i.e., personal health information (PHI)) in accordance with the HIPAA privacy rule. Each consented and enrolled participant will be assigned a unique study ID, which will be the only participant-level identifier. Time information starting at baseline will be coded in units of study time, with baseline = '0' and termination of 18 months or dropout for all participants, regardless of the calendar date of their baseline visit. Proprietary software code will be shared in accordance with institutional policies and consent of the creators.</ipd_description>
