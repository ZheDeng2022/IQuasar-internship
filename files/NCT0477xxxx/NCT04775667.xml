    <textblock>
      There are limited studies examining kinesiophobia and factors associated with kinesophobia in&#xD;
      patients with lower limb amputation. The aim of this study is to illustrate the level of&#xD;
      kinesiophobia in patients with traumatic lower extremity amputation and to analyze the&#xD;
      correlation between kinesiophobia and associated factors (pain, prosthesis satisfaction, fear&#xD;
      of fall, quality of life). This cross-sectional study will involve 52 patients with traumatic&#xD;
      lower extremity amputation. Kinesiophobia level will be measured with the Tampa Scale for&#xD;
      Kinesiophobia (TSK). All patients will point the severity of sound limb pain, residual limb&#xD;
      pain, low back pain and the overall prosthesis, socket system and prosthetic foot&#xD;
      satisfaction on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)&#xD;
      will be used for evaluation of falls efficacy under different circumstances. The quality of&#xD;
      life (QoL) will be assessed with Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kinesiophobia is defined as an unreasonable, excessive, and debilitating fear of physical&#xD;
      activity and movement resulting from a feeling of susceptibility to painful injury or&#xD;
      re-injury. Kinesiophobia was demonstrated to be related to lower levels of physical activity&#xD;
      in people with chronic pain. As a result, there is an increased risk of sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
      Inactivity increases the risk of chronic pain as well as other health problems such as&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Kinesiophobia also is related to poor treatment outcomes. The&#xD;
      negative effects of kinesiophobia on rehabilitation processes including exercise programs and&#xD;
      thus its importance in the clinical course were illustrated in studies on various diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Kinesiophobia level will be measured with the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). The questionnaire contains 17 items that uses a 4-point Likert-type scale (from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree)). A score of 39 or above will be used in order to distinguish those with a high level of kinesophobia. The validity and reliability of the Turkish version of TKS has been demonstrated.</description>

    <description>Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) will be used for evaluation of falls efficacy under different circumstances. The FES-I is a self-report questionnaire, containing 16 items scored on a four-point scale (from 1 (no fear whatsoever) to 4 (very fearful)). The questionnaire provides information about the level of concern associated with falls during 16 various activities of daily living.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one and a half months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life (QoL) will be assessed with Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). NHP consists of 38 questions on six different subscales that include physical activity, pain, sleep, fatigue, social isolation and emotional reactions. Each subscale of NHP is scored between 0 and 100, and higher scores illustrate a decrease in QoL. It has been shown that NHP is a reliable scale for measuring health-related quality of life in patients with amputation.</description>
