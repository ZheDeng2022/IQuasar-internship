    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) for the&#xD;
      management of pain in various locations of the body. All subjects selected for participation&#xD;
      in the study will be assigned to a LLLT treatment group for a duration of 12 sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a treatment modality that is gaining popularity in the&#xD;
      field of physical therapy for its proposed mediation of pain. LLLT is typically used in&#xD;
      conjunction with other more conventional physical therapy treatment sessions; therefore, it&#xD;
      is not clear if the benefits are from the LLLT or the conventional treatment, or the&#xD;
      combination of them both. The research question: Does low-level laser therapy treatment with&#xD;
      a class 3B Laser decrease pain and improve function in persons with persistent or acute&#xD;
      joint/muscle discomfort as compared to before treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants presenting with pain will be interviewed regarding the location and&#xD;
      intensity of their primary pain complaints. Participants will also be asked to identify&#xD;
      functional limitations associated with their pain. Participants will undergo an initial&#xD;
      screening process to identify the presence of any exclusion factors and precautions&#xD;
      associated with the delivery of LLLT. Investigators will collect pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      information from participants regarding pain intensity and perceived functional limitations.&#xD;
      Investigators will also collect relevant joint range of motion and muscle strength data&#xD;
      during the first and last sessions. Treatment location for the study will vary within the&#xD;
      participant group and will be determined during the initial screening process. The&#xD;
      intervention will include LLLT treatment using a combination of LED and laser light delivered&#xD;
      by the Richmar TheraTouch LX2 device.&#xD;

    <description>The NPRS is an eleven point scale (0-10) where the subject is asked to provide a rating of their pain current, best and worst pain intensity over the past 24 hours. Subjects are asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;Worst Pain Imaginable&quot;.

    <description>The PSFS is a device used to quantify the extent of a subject's perceived functional limitations due to a particular problem or condition. The subject is asked to identify up to three activities in which they feel their performance is limited. For each of the activities identified, the subject will rate their perceived level of limitation using an eleven point scale (0-10) with 0 being &quot;Unable to perform activity&quot; and 10 being &quot;Able to perform activity at the same level as before injury or problem&quot;. Data will be collected at baseline during Visit 1.</description>

    <description>The TheraTouch LX2 device includes a 9-diode cluster probe which emits a combination of LED and laser light. The cluster probe includes four 650 nm LED diodes capable of delivering a total of 40 mW and five 850 nm laser diodes capable of delivering a total of 1000 mW of power. LLLT will the applied with the cluster probe directly in contact with the subject's skin. LLLT dosages will vary according to the location of the subject's pain and may require multiple applications during a session. Each individual application will typically range from 4-16 Joules.</description>
