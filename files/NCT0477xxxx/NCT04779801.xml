  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT), a&#xD;
      well-validated treatment for adolescents with depression and suicidality, is feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable for adolescents with binge eating and their families.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study involves a phone screen and baseline assessment to determine eligibility.&#xD;
      Participants who are eligible for the study will receive 16 weeks of ABFT treatment. The&#xD;
      treatment primarily focuses on improving communication and relationships within the family,&#xD;
      and will also address disordered eating behaviors (e.g., binge eating, laxative use,&#xD;
      self-induced vomiting). All participants enrolled in the study will receive the same&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will also complete research assessments throughout treatment, at the&#xD;
      end of treatment, and 3-months after the end of treatment. Research assessments include a&#xD;
      battery of questionnaires and interviews.&#xD;
