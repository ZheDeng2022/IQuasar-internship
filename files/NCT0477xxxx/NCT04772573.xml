  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A case of high-voltage pediatric electrical burn involving a fully conscious 13-year old boy&#xD;
      who was admitted to the emergency room after being electrocuted by high-voltage power cable,&#xD;
      with superficial partial thickness burn over right arm, trunk, and left leg (26% of total&#xD;
      body surface area) with cardiac abnormality e.g. tachycardia and non-specific ST depression.&#xD;
      Treatments were based on Australian New Zealand Burns Association algorithm with several&#xD;
      modifications, i.e. administering lower concentration of oxygen with nasal cannula instead of&#xD;
      non-rebreathing mask and intravenous Ketorolac and Metamizole as analgesic instead of&#xD;
      morphine due to limitation in infrastructure and knowledge. The patient underwent surgical&#xD;
      debridement and strict observation with no signs of abnormality found during hospital stay.&#xD;
      Wound dressing consisted of silver sulfadiazine, Sofra-tulleÂ® and dry sterile gauze were used&#xD;
      until epithelialization. After the wound healed, the patient resumed wearing elastic bandage&#xD;
      and moisturizer on the wound area. The patient was observed daily through 7 days of&#xD;
      hospitalization and followed-up for 1 year, achieving normal physiologic function of the&#xD;
      affected area but unsatisfactory esthetic result. This case report showed that there is still&#xD;
      a lack of burn prevention programs in the rural area, resulted in inadequate first aid&#xD;
      application for electrical burn. There is a need for acknowledging and maximizing the&#xD;
      implementation of available standardized guidelines e.g. Australian New Zealand Burns&#xD;
      Association by giving homogenized training to personnel as well as providing feasible&#xD;
      equipment, and then followed by strict monitoring for the patient. The focus of the burn&#xD;
      program should also include burn rehabilitation, psychosocial needs and any complaints&#xD;
      needing expert opinion in an outpatient setting in addition to adequate burn management for&#xD;
      life saving and good wound healing.&#xD;
