  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is stated that abnormal lower extremity posture and biomechanics are effective in the&#xD;
      development and progression of Low Back Pain (LBP). Exercise, electrotherapy, insoles, and&#xD;
      orthoses are used for the prevention and treatment of low back pain.The use of orthosis,&#xD;
      insoles, and taping techniques stands out in the correction of foot posture and dysfunctions,&#xD;
      which are stated to cause LBP. In studies examining the application of taping to improve foot&#xD;
      posture and biomechanics, it is stated that taping is effective in improving foot posture and&#xD;
      biomechanics in the short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical taping has been used in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders in recent&#xD;
      years. It is aimed to correct the impaired joint biomechanics by reducing the load on the&#xD;
      joint, supporting strength, and providing movement modification.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it is assumed that correction of &quot;increased foot pronation&quot; with dynamic&#xD;
      taping will result in the recovery of increased internal rotation and decreased shock&#xD;
      absorption during weight-bearing, which is stated to cause pain. The study aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of biomechanical tapping in combination with a home exercise program&#xD;
      on LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of LBP and bilateral increased flexible foot pronation will&#xD;
      divide into two groups (Biomechanical Taping (BT) group or Placebo Taping (PT) group). Tape&#xD;
      applications will repeat twice per week, for 4 weeks. And also a home-based exercise program&#xD;
      will apply to both groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Foot Posture Index (FPI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>FPI-6 examines foot posture under 6 headings: talar head palpation, supra and infra lateral malleoli curvature, calcaneal frontal plane position, prominence in region of talonavicular joint, congruence of medial longitudinal arch, abduction/adduction of forefoot on rearfoot. Each measure is scored from -2 to 2. A total score of 0 is considered a neutral foot; a positive score is for pronated foot, whereas a supinated foot is given a negative score.</description>

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT provides an indirect assessment of physical performance and endurance capacity.the person is asked to walk for 6 minutes as fast as possible in the 30-meter straight corridor, the patient does not speak during walking, but is supported with motivating sentences at the end of every 1 minute. After 6 minutes, the distance traveled (meters-m) is recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Step-On-Stool Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The person tested is asked to step up onto and down from a stool at a self-selected speed. The step height is 0.40 meters for women, 0.44 meters for men. The number of steps managed will be record.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PILE Lumbar Lifting Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The lumbar Spine is tested by asking to lift the box with a weight of 76 cm shelf from the ground to waist level. The test starts with weights of 3.6 kg for women and 5.9 kg for men. It is asked to lift the box containing weight 4 times in 20 seconds. For each completed round, a weight of 2.25 kg for women and 4.5 kg for men are added to the box. If the patient reaches 85% of the maximum heart rate, lifts 55-60% of his body weight, shows pain or fatigue after a 20-second interval, and cannot complete 4 repetitions within 20 seconds, the test is terminated. The maximum weight lifted &amp; the number of repetitions multiplied so total work done will calculate and record.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>; It is a self-administered questionnaire and consists of 10 sections. Each section is scored between 1 and 5 (the highest score for the last question is 6), test scores range from 0 to 51. An increase in the score is interpreted as an increase in disability</description>
