    <textblock>
      This study will help determine the tolerability and efficacy of the mood-stabilizing&#xD;
      anticonvulsant lamotrigine in youth with alcohol use disorder. It will also help establish&#xD;
      whether and how lamotrigine improves outcomes related to alcohol use. The results of this&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study will inform whether a future larger clinical trial is warranted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent alcohol use is a leading public health concern worldwide. Clinical trials have&#xD;
      tested a variety of psychosocial interventions with youth that yield only modest short-term&#xD;
      benefits. One potential way to improve treatments is to augment psychosocial interventions&#xD;
      with pharmacotherapy. The National Institutes of Health has mounted a concerted effort to&#xD;
      identify medications that reduce drinking for nearly three decades. Although this effort&#xD;
      improved treatment for adults, no medication is indicated for adolescent use and randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials with teenagers are almost nonexistent. This gap raises key questions about&#xD;
      whether and how medications could benefit youth. Optimizing treatment options for youth&#xD;
      requires closing this important gap. Lamotrigine is safe with adolescents and does not&#xD;
      adversely interact with alcohol. Lamotrigine targets brain mechanisms implicated in alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder, and it has shown to help treat adults with alcohol problems. Yet, despite its&#xD;
      widespread use with children and adolescents, no published double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      studies have examined the effects of lamotrigine on drinking-related behavior in youth. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine how well teenagers accept lamotrigine plus alcohol&#xD;
      education to reduce adolescent alcohol use. This study will also tell us whether teenagers'&#xD;
      alcohol use, craving, and enjoyment of drinking are reduced by lamotrigine.&#xD;
