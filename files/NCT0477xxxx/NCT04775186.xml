  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as&#xD;
      an involuntary loss of urine on physical exertion, sneezing, or coughing (1). It occurs&#xD;
      primarily in multiparous women (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of UI among Egyptian women is high (55%). Aging, low educational level,&#xD;
      menopause, higher parity (&gt;3), vaginal delivery, and previous multiple abortions (&gt;3) are&#xD;
      significant risk factors for UI(3) Mid-urethral slings (TVT and TOT) are now the recognized&#xD;
      worldwide standard of care for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence(4) (5)&#xD;
      Mid-Urethral Slings have a very high satisfaction rate (85-90 %) (4) (6), with durability of&#xD;
      satisfaction recently demonstrated out to 5-years (79-85 %) as well as a modest 5-year&#xD;
      treatment success (43-51 %) (4, 7) Burch colposuspension is a well-accepted technique for&#xD;
      surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI), especially when it is associated&#xD;
      with urethral hypermobility. it first description in 1961 (8) (9) Originally performed as an&#xD;
      open surgical procedure and then Over time, Burch colposuspension has been adapted for&#xD;
      laparoscopy, it was long considered as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the treatment of SUI before&#xD;
      emergent of midurethral slings (9) The cure rates for laparoscopic colposuspention is as high&#xD;
      as 68.9% to 88.0% whereas recurrence rates remain low, however, it has been reported that the&#xD;
      cure rate of retropubic suspension techniques in general decreases steadily from 90% at 1&#xD;
      year to about70% by 10 years postoperatively. After a decline, it seems to reach a plateau at&#xD;
      65-70% at a 20 year follow-up (9) After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a&#xD;
      warning about the use of transvaginal meshes for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in 2011, there&#xD;
      has been much debate about the use of mesh in the MUS continence procedures. Concern is&#xD;
      increasing that the use of transvaginal mesh devices to treat SUI and POP have exposed women&#xD;
      to avoidable harms following complications such as infection, tissue extrusion, mesh exposure&#xD;
      ,mesh shrinkage, and side effects such as severe pain, sexual dysfunction, and repeat&#xD;
      surgical interventions (5).&#xD;
