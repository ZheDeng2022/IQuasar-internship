  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various imaging modalities are used in medical diagnosis such as MRI, CT and PET. The images&#xD;
      are sometimes acquired at different times and in different body positions, and thus need to&#xD;
      be aligned for precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Different image modalities provide&#xD;
      complementary information about the anatomical structure under study. Image registration&#xD;
      techniques enable multimodality images to be projected onto a common coordinate system, so&#xD;
      that these images can be aligned and spatial correspondences can be established between the&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to investigate the information provided by functional PET and CT&#xD;
      images about the tumour environment in lung cancer patients by registering functional PET and&#xD;
      CT images with the pathology images acquired from the same patient. On identification of&#xD;
      specific region of interest on the functional imaging the investigators will then be able to&#xD;
      interrogate the tumour biology. In many cancers, the tumour environment is usually composed&#xD;
      of a heterogeneous mass of tissue. The discrimination and classification of the carcinoma&#xD;
      substructures is of paramount importance in the radiotherapy planning stage, as a given&#xD;
      treatment may be more or less suitable depending on the local characteristics of the tumour.&#xD;
      For instance, in hypoxic regions (areas inside the tumour with very low oxygen supply),&#xD;
      radiotherapy performs poorly and strategies to intensify treatment to those areas could be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop a framework for automatic registration of pathology images, which&#xD;
      are taken from a surgically extracted lung tumour, with the corresponding PET/CT scan&#xD;
      acquired from the patient before surgery. The registration of these images is essential for&#xD;
      the evaluation of the performance of different PET radiotracers.&#xD;
