    <textblock>
      Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), caused by ventricular depositions of misfolded&#xD;
      transthyretin, results in an infiltrative cardiomyopathy, progressing from pronounced&#xD;
      myocardial wall thickening, diastolic and systolic dysfunction to the development of terminal&#xD;
      heart failure. Recently, treatment options for TTR amyloidosis have become available. However&#xD;
      costs for therapy are enormous and previous trials were not able to differentiate between&#xD;
      patients that might benefit from treatment and those without a need for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators study aims to determine markers, as assessed by cardiac magnet resonance&#xD;
      imaging (CMR) feature tracking (FT) and T1- and T2- mapping, that might reliably indicate&#xD;
      disease severity and could help to identify patients that might benefit from (ongoing) TTR&#xD;
      stabilization treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), the most common amyloidosis form with cardiac&#xD;
      involvement, is caused by tissue deposition of misfolded TTR, a transport Protein for&#xD;
      thyroxine and retinol. Ventricular depositions of amyloid fibrils results in an infiltrative&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, progressing from pronounced myocardial wall thickening, to diastolic and&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction and finally chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While treatment options are now available, it remains unclear how to monitor therapy response&#xD;
      and disease progression. No makers have been identified that predict outcome prior to&#xD;
      initiation of therapy, thus patient selection for therapy remains challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study will address these issues and will provide systematically assessed&#xD;
      CMR data before and over the course of 18 months after therapy initiation. Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory follow-up will be performed every 3-6 months. The investigators study is based on&#xD;
      an open, uncontrolled, structured collection of retrospective and prospective data from all&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with amyloidosis at the Inselspital Bern with the aim to follow patients&#xD;
      undergoing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that CMR feature tracking (FT) and measures of T1- and T2-&#xD;
      mapping, such as extracellular volume (ECV) may better correlate with disease severity and&#xD;
      help to identify patients likely to benefit from (ongoing) TTR stabilizing therapy. Beside&#xD;
      standard CMR assessments, the investigators will use CMR feature tracking to quantify global&#xD;
      and regional myocardial function. FT has proven to be an excellent predictor in various&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the potential of CMR to identify patients likely to benefit&#xD;
      from therapy, monitor treatment response and balance individual patient benefit and health&#xD;
      care cost.&#xD;

      Genetic testing is a part of the routine diagnostic work-up of TTR amyloidosis patients.&#xD;
      Current knowledge suggests that therapy response and clinical outcome may differ in TTR&#xD;
      patients suffering from wt-TTR and h-/m-TTR-amyloidosis, respectively. Therefore, the genetic&#xD;
      background should also be assessed as part of the registry.&#xD;
