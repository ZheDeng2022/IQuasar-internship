  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects a Glucagon Receptor Antagonist (GRA), has on Insulin&#xD;
      Sensitivity, Cardiovascular risks (CVD), and Ketone body formation in participants with Type&#xD;
      1 diabetes. The participants will complete blood tests, tests to measure energy expenditure,&#xD;
      CVD risks, and insulin resistance. These tests will be performed prior to start of treatment&#xD;
      and again after 12-weeks of treatment with the GRA (called REMD-477).&#xD;

      This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of glucagon antagonism on insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
      ketogenesis in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes. To accomplish the specific aims proposed, a&#xD;
      single clinical trial will be conducted in which a maximum of 30 subjects with T1D, who are&#xD;
      otherwise healthy, will be treated with REMD-477 or matching placebo for up to 12 weeks at a&#xD;
      dose of 70mg (administered subcutaneously each week) with assessments done pre- and&#xD;
      post-therapy. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the REMD-477 group or&#xD;
      placebo group and all subjects will remain on their standard of care insulin therapy&#xD;
      throughout the study. There will be 19 study visits as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening - Complete consenting process, complete medical history and physical exam,&#xD;
           review of current medications, collect height/weight, vital signs, and fasting&#xD;
           laboratory (blood and urine) tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline Visit 1 - Participants that meet screening criteria will complete&#xD;
           cardiovascular tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat, complete vital signs,&#xD;
           weight and laboratory tests for safety and CVD markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline Visit 2 - Participants will complete a 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp&#xD;
           with tracer, Indirect Calorimetry, muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Baseline Visit 3 - Insulin withdrawal challenge and injection #1 of REMD-477 or placebo.&#xD;
           Participants will suspend insulin delivery and remove insulin pump. Blood sugars and&#xD;
           ketones will be monitored for up to 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Visit 4 - Injection #2 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.&#xD;

       15. Visit 14 - Injection #12 of REMD-477 or placebo and blood collection for safety labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Visit 15 - Repeat cardiovascular tests including flow mediated dilation and EndoPat,&#xD;
           complete vital signs, weight and laboratory tests for safety and CVD markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Visit 16 - Repeat 2-Step Hyperinsulinemic/Euglycemic clamp with tracer, Indirect&#xD;
           Calorimetry, muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Visit 17 - Repeat Insulin withdrawal challenge. Participants will suspend insulin&#xD;
           delivery and remove insulin pump. Blood sugars and ketones will be monitored for up to 8&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. Visit 18 - Safety follow-up visit that includes physical exam, vitals, blood and urine&#xD;
