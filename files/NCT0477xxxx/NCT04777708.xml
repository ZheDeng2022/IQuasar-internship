      This early phase I trial evaluates the side effects of BO-112 and pembrolizumab and how well&#xD;
      they work in treating patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C liver&#xD;
      cancer. Immunotherapy with BO-112, may induce changes in body's immune system and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving BO-112 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may help treat patients with liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the early efficacy and safety for the combination of intratumoral nanoplexed&#xD;
      poly I:C BO-112 (BO-112) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have progressed on prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further elucidate efficacy endpoints of the combination the combination of BO-112 with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To demonstrate the efficacy of BO-112 from its hypothesized mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Peripheral blood will be collected to assess changes in circulating cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4+), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+), natural killer (NK), and&#xD;
      dendritic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Peripheral blood will be collected to assess leukocyte expression of interferon beta&#xD;
      induced genes in conjunction with intratumoral studies to demonstrate increased intratumoral&#xD;
      interferon beta and other hypothesized biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. A baseline biopsy will be collected on cycle 1 day 1 and at cycle 2 day 15 (done at the&#xD;
      same time as intratumoral injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. From these biopsies, intratumoral CD4+, CD8+ expression and cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      56 (CD56+) expression (NK cells) will be measured by immunohistochemistry on the baseline&#xD;
      biopsy and the biopsy on cycle 2 day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Myeloid dendritic cells will be assessed by flow cytometry, as their activity&#xD;
      correlates with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. Percentage of cells with apoptosis and necrosis will be assessed. IIId. The tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment will be assessed by ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression profiling with&#xD;
      nCounter Pancancer Immune Profiling Panel given its extensive validation to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the potential of immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) (iRECIST) to determine disease control as compared to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of odd number&#xD;
      cycles. Patients also receive BO-112 by intratumoral injection on day 1, 8, and 15 of cycle&#xD;
      1, and day 15 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 17 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 1&#xD;
      year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of a second malignancy, unless potentially curative treatment has been&#xD;
             completed with no evidence of malignancy for 1 year. Note: The time requirement does&#xD;
             not apply to participants who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, prostate cancer, or other in-situ cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically&#xD;
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening and at each&#xD;
             tumor assessment), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for&#xD;
             at least 14 days prior to first dose of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has severe hypersensitivity (&gt;= grade 3) to pembrolizumab/BO-112 and/or any of its&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1/2&#xD;
             antibodies). Note: No HIV testing is required unless mandated by local health&#xD;
             authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including&#xD;
             dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had an allogenic tissue/solid organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed&#xD;
