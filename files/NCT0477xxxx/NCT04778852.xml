      The ability to walk independently is a primary goal when rehabilitating an individual with&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease (PD). Indeed, PD patients display a flexed posture that coupled with an&#xD;
      excessive joint stiffness lead to a poor walking mechanics that increase their risk of falls.&#xD;
      Although studies have already shown the many benefits of robotic-assisted gait training in PD&#xD;
      patients, research focusing on optimal rehabilitation methods has been directed towards&#xD;
      powered lower-limb exoskeleton. Combining the advantages delivered from the grounded devices&#xD;
      with the ability to train in a real-world environment, these systems provide a greater level&#xD;
      of subject participation and increase subject's functional abilities while the wearable&#xD;
      robotic system guarantees less support. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of an Over-ground Wearable Exoskeleton Training (OWET) on gait impairments in&#xD;
      comparison with a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment. As gait is a complex&#xD;
      task that involves both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), targeted&#xD;
      rehabilitation must restore not only gait mechanics (ST parameters) but also physiological&#xD;
      gait pattern (joint kinematics and dynamics). To this aim the impact of OWET on both CNS and&#xD;
      PNS will be evaluated. Thus, a quantitative assessment of an individual's gait and&#xD;
      neuromuscular function to robustly evaluate recovery of altered sensorimotor function at both&#xD;
      the PNS and CNS is proposed. To this aim, comprehensive GA (spatiotemporal (ST) parameter,&#xD;
      joint kinematics, joint stiffness) and electromyography (EMG) will be combined to determine&#xD;
      PNS improvements, and fMRI with EEG will be used to assess CNS improvements.&#xD;

      Full Title: QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF TRAINING EFFECTS USING A WEARABLE EXOSKELETON IN&#xD;
      PARKINSON DISEASE PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to walk independently is a primary goal when rehabilitating an individual with&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease (PD). Indeed, PD patients display a flexed posture that coupled with an&#xD;
      excessive joint stiffness lead to a poor walking mechanics that increase their risk of falls.&#xD;
      Although studies have already shown the many benefits of robotic-assisted gait training in PD&#xD;
      patients, research focusing on optimal rehabilitation methods has been directed towards&#xD;
      powered lower-limb exoskeleton. Combining the advantages delivered from the grounded devices&#xD;
      with the ability to train in a real-world environment, these systems provide a greater level&#xD;
      of subject participation and increase subject's functional abilities while the wearable&#xD;
      robotic system guarantees less support. The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of an Over-ground Wearable Exoskeleton Training (OWET) on gait impairments in&#xD;
      comparison with a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment. As gait is a complex&#xD;
      task that involves both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), targeted&#xD;
      rehabilitation must restore not only gait mechanics (ST parameters) but also physiological&#xD;
      gait pattern (joint kinematics and dynamics). To this aim the impact of OWET on both CNS and&#xD;
      PNS will be evaluated. Human movement analysis quantitatively assesses the neuromuscular and&#xD;
      biomechanical features of movement. Recent literature has highlighted the benefit of coupling&#xD;
      gait analysis (GA) and neuromusculoskeletal modeling (NMSM) for treatment planning and&#xD;
      supplementing this approach with robotic rehabilitation. Another stalwart of PD research has&#xD;
      been electroencephalography (EEG), which is widely used to evaluate executive dysfunction&#xD;
      while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can detect cortical changes in motor&#xD;
      activations during motor tasks. Thus, a quantitative assessment of an individual's gait and&#xD;
      neuromuscular function to robustly evaluate recovery of altered sensorimotor function at both&#xD;
      the PNS and CNS is proposed. To this aim, comprehensive GA (spatiotemporal (ST) parameter,&#xD;
      joint kinematics, joint stiffness) and electromyography (EMG) will be combined to determine&#xD;
      PNS improvements, and fMRI with EEG will be used to assess CNS improvements. As health care&#xD;
      professionals and researchers need objective, reliable, and valid tools to plan&#xD;
      subject-specific interventions, quantify therapeutic outcomes, and monitor change over time,&#xD;
      the proposed study includes estimation of neutrally-informed muscle forces and joint&#xD;
      stiffness, which is expected to provide sensitive determinants of PD movement control that&#xD;
      could be crucial to inform treatment planning/assessment. Preliminary data are available and&#xD;
      showed feasibility of the proposed measurement set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background OWET: Although studies have already shown the many benefits of robotic-assisted&#xD;
      gait training in PD patients (i.e. body weight supported treadmill training) as improving&#xD;
      gait efficiency modifying spatiotemporal (ST) parameters, these strategies create an&#xD;
      environment where the patient has less control over the gait initiation and lacks in&#xD;
      variability of visuospatial flow. Therefore, research focusing on optimal rehabilitation&#xD;
      methods has been directed towards powered lower-limb exoskeleton, as in post-stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, where the effect of such a treatment dramatically enhanced potential for&#xD;
      patient-specific rehabilitation, showing improvement in ST parameters. Combining the&#xD;
      advantages delivered from the grounded robotic devices with the ability to train the patient&#xD;
      in a real-world environment, these systems provide a greater level of subject participation&#xD;
      for maintaining trunk and balance control, as well as navigating their path over different&#xD;
      surfaces and increase subject's functional abilities while the wearable robotic system&#xD;
      guarantees less support. Furthermore, the stability the exoskeleton addresses to the patient,&#xD;
      allows a hands-free walking trial (with no clutches) which represents an integral part for a&#xD;
      physiological locomotion restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As gait involves both CNS and PNS, targeted rehabilitation must restore not only mechanics&#xD;
      (speed, stride time and length) but also physiological gait pattern. This requires&#xD;
      improvements at the level of both balance and lower limb joint motion. In this direction,&#xD;
      wearable lower-limb powered exoskeletons promote functional training in a realistic&#xD;
      walking-environment combined with a greater patient's engagement than in grounded devices.&#xD;
      Human movement analysis quantitatively assesses the neuromuscular and biomechanical features&#xD;
      of movement. Recent literature has highlighted the benefit of coupling GA and NMSM for&#xD;
      treatment planning and supplementing this approach with robotic rehabilitation, however there&#xD;
      is no study investigating gait effects from an OWET in those with PD, and no assessment that&#xD;
      uses comprehensive GA and NMSM to reveal mechanistic changes as a result of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiology of PD: A stalwart of PD research has been EEG, which is widely used to&#xD;
      evaluate executive dysfunction while fMRI can detect cortical changes in motor activations&#xD;
      during motor tasks. The protocol to use GA in combination with fMRI has already been adopted&#xD;
      by the investigators in order to display the impacts of the rehabilitation process on the&#xD;
      reorganization of the neural network, describing and quantifying the neural activity and the&#xD;
      recovery after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion analysis in PD: Gait in people with PD has been thoroughly studied with 3D GA systems&#xD;
      in recent years, documenting a typical hypokinetic gait reduction of the stride-length with&#xD;
      asymmetry between the strides, an increment of the cadence, the stance and double support&#xD;
      phases, which compensates for the reduced stride length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMSM: Combining GA and NMSM enables one to track disease progression with enhanced precision.&#xD;
      This has been demonstrated across a range of neuromuscular pathologies and healthy&#xD;
      individuals. Critically, for each individual a neuromusculoskeletal model is created, driven&#xD;
      by the individual's own EMG signals, and tracking their biomechanics, as has recently applied&#xD;
      in neurologically impaired individuals. This creates a novel model that links in vivo&#xD;
      neuromuscular functions to the individual, thus providing new biomarkers to assess and track&#xD;
      PD motor impairment. Furthermore, since joint stiffness depends both on neural recruitment&#xD;
      and mechanical properties, it is likely to provide a potent representation of neural and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal PD impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and potential impact This project addresses the potential for OWET to restore&#xD;
      normal gait in PD patients. OWET aims to improve overall body motion and lower joint&#xD;
      stiffness in those with PD, thereby improving function, quality of life, and reducing risk of&#xD;
      injurious falls. The proposed robotic device (Ekso GT™, EksoBionics, Richmond, CA, USA)&#xD;
      relies functions by providing passive assistance to the ankle joint, which affects the rest&#xD;
      of the body through mechanical coupling. Currently, the amount of device assistance is&#xD;
      estimated based on a therapist experience and expertise. Modern motion analysis methods&#xD;
      enable us to objectively assess the required assistance providing a means to tailor the&#xD;
      assistance to each individual and remove the risks of clinical guesswork. Robotic devices&#xD;
      assist the physical therapist by providing task-specific repeatable mechanical action to&#xD;
      support therapies and enable higher intensity of training. OWET aims to reduce lower limb&#xD;
      joint stiffness, which is a recognized biomarker of PD, thereby enhancing rehabilitation for&#xD;
      PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings linked with the proposed study will likely give substantial solutions to the&#xD;
      management of gait and postural disorders (posture, balance, and gait) in PD where valid&#xD;
      interventions (pharmacological, neurosurgery, traditional physiotherapy) are lacking.&#xD;
      Moreover, a NMSM that identifies patient-specific variables for therapy could be used to&#xD;
      assess treatment outcomes but also to conduct on-line rehabilitation therapy by means remote&#xD;
      control of the assistive device. This will provide a number of advantages over conventional&#xD;
      approaches proposing an active treatment that is personalized and scalable to large&#xD;
      populations and including a standardized training environment and an adaptable support that&#xD;
      has the ability to increase the treatment intensity and dose, without being a burden on&#xD;
      therapists. OWET is thus an ideal means to complete conventional therapy in clinic, while&#xD;
      rehabilitation robots bear the potential for continued home therapy using simpler devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will be carried out over 36 months. Patients with clinically&#xD;
      established diagnosis of PD according to the U.K. Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria will be recruited. The diagnosis will be reviewed by a neurologist&#xD;
      specialized on movement disorders. Briefly, 50 patients with mild to moderate disease&#xD;
      severity, will be enrolled according to the inclusion\exclusion criteria included in the&#xD;
      dedicated section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activities will be organized into 4 work packages (WP), each with measurable outputs&#xD;
      verified by scheduled deliverables/milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP1: Clinical Trial. The sample size has been defined based on published data of gait&#xD;
           velocity in PD subjects, and a target sample of fifty PD individuals (divided in two&#xD;
           separate cohorts) has been selected to achieve a power of at least 80% for detecting a&#xD;
           mean group differences in mean gait velocity (p = 0.05). One cohort (n=25) will undergo&#xD;
           a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment, and the other will be treated&#xD;
           with OWET. At baseline (T0) subjects will undergo neurophysiological evaluation&#xD;
           (EEG-fMRI) and GA. Participants will then undergo an 8-weeks OWET. After the therapy&#xD;
           (T1), the subjects will be evaluated, with the same protocol as at T0. After another 2&#xD;
           months, a follow-up (T2) will be conducted using the same protocol as T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP2: Motion analysis. State-of-the-art posture and GA will be performed pre- and&#xD;
           post-rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP3: NMSM. Using the data collected in WP1 and WP2, NMSM will be performed to obtain&#xD;
           muscular force and joint stiffness. This NMSM will be used to assess PD neuromuscular&#xD;
           function pre- and post-rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WP4: Neurophysiological assessment. A 256 channel High Density EEG (HD-EEG) recordings&#xD;
           and analysis will be used to assess brain oscillation activity changes before and after&#xD;
           the treatment. Multimodal brain imaging will be performed by simultaneous acquisition&#xD;
           and analysis of neurophysiological signals (EEG/EMG) and fMRI data to assess the resting&#xD;
           state connectivity and activation differences between pre- and post-treatment and to&#xD;
           identify if the changes in the cortical activity is linked with the changes detected in&#xD;
           WP3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results Locomotor functions are positively recovered by a functional gait&#xD;
      training. Indeed, in post-stroke subjects, patients who underwent this therapy have already&#xD;
      shown to be more likely to achieve an independent walking than people who did not receive the&#xD;
      same treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OWET will improve quality of gait and balance. Effects with OWET will impact the quality of&#xD;
      life. The results with OWET will provide innovative information for rehabilitative programs.&#xD;
      The impact of the intervention will be assessed by measurable outcomes listed in the&#xD;
      dedicated section below.&#xD;
