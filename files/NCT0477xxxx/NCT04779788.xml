  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant biliary obstruction usually arise in patients suffering from primary or metastatic&#xD;
      hepatobiliary tumors. Approximately 80% of malignant biliary obstruction patients are not&#xD;
      eligible for surgical resection, and as such palliative stent insertion is the only treatment&#xD;
      option available for most patients. At present, I-125 seeds loaded stent has been developed&#xD;
      to improve the stent patency and patients' survival. Hilar malignant biliary obstruction is&#xD;
      an important part of malignant biliary obstruction. Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the most&#xD;
      common disease which causes hilar malignant biliary obstruction. Herein, we assessed the&#xD;
      clinical and long-term efficacy of I-125 seeds loaded stent insertion for hilar&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma patients.&#xD;

      Malignant biliary obstruction usually arise in patients suffering from primary or metastatic&#xD;
      hepatobiliary tumors. Approximately 80% of malignant biliary obstruction patients are not&#xD;
      eligible for surgical resection, and as such palliative interventions are the only treatment&#xD;
      option available for most patients. Of the available palliative treatments, percutaneous or&#xD;
      endoscopic stent insertion is the most frequently used to treat malignant biliary obstruction&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although stent insertion can achieve the good short-term outcomes for patients with malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction, stent dysfunction remains a common outcome in these treated patients,&#xD;
      limiting the long-term efficacy of this treatment strategy. In order to overcome this&#xD;
      shortcoming of the normal stent insertion, many researchers have developed a novel biliary&#xD;
      I-125 seeds loaded stent. The I-125 seeds loaded stents not only can effectively relieve the&#xD;
      jaundice, but also can provide the brachytherapy to the tumor. Previous meta-analyses also&#xD;
      indicated that showed that relative to normal stent insertion, I-125 seeds loaded stent&#xD;
      insertion was associated with longer survival and stent patency in inoperable malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction patients. However, most previous studies included malignant biliary&#xD;
      obstruction patients with different cancer types and malignant biliary obstruction sites, and&#xD;
      therefore, the risk of bias did exist. Therefore, there is a clear need for a study comparing&#xD;
      these two stent types in patients with a single type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hilar malignant biliary obstruction is an important part of malignant biliary obstruction.&#xD;
      Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the most common disease which causes hilar malignant biliary&#xD;
      obstruction. Herein, we assessed the clinical and long-term efficacy of I-125 seeds loaded&#xD;
      stent insertion for hilar cholangiocarcinoma patients.&#xD;
