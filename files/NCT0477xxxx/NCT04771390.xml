  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers will compare 2 new tablet forms of BAY2731954 with liquid oral&#xD;
      forms of BAY2731954. A maximum of 61 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 will be asked to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have 2 parts. In part 1 researchers want to gather information how the body&#xD;
      absorbs, distributes and excretes the drug BAY2731954 given as two different tablet&#xD;
      formulations. Participants will take the study drugs on 3 days separated by breaks of at&#xD;
      least 3 days between each intake. The duration of this study part will be in total of up to 6&#xD;
      weeks from first screening visit to follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part 2 of the study researchers want to study how the body absorbs, distributes and&#xD;
      excretes the drug BAY2731954 given as two different tablet formulations with or without food&#xD;
      or as 2 liquid oral formulations. Participants will take the study drugs on 4 days separated&#xD;
      by breaks of at least 3 days between each intake. The duration of the second part of study&#xD;
      part will be in total of up to 7 weeks from first screening visit to follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, researchers will collect blood and urine samples. In addition, doctors will&#xD;
      check the participants' overall health. They will also ask the participants if they have any&#xD;
      medical problems.&#xD;
