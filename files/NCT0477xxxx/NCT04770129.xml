      This study is planned as a secondary data use (SDU) study and the data collection will be&#xD;
      performed retrospectively. Patients who presented to the participating sites with metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer will be defined and patients' data will be recorded into a database. The study&#xD;
      will be performed at clinical centers located in the populated cities with high clinical and&#xD;
      diagnostic standards including patients presented with metastatic disease will be recorded.&#xD;
      It is also planned to collect data on the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in line with&#xD;
      institutional guidelines at academic and private centers which has implemented high quality&#xD;
      clinical and pathologic standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study is designed to record, define and evaluate the changes in the&#xD;
      presentation patterns, pathological subtypes and outcomes of metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      patients in relation with the evolution of overall and progression-free survival rates&#xD;
      following the changes in treatment approaches over the last decade based on the&#xD;
      evolving/different treatment regimens of metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will shed light on how changes in metastatic patterns have influenced practice&#xD;
      patterns, as well as the generalizability of this data to the current knowledge and&#xD;
      physician's adherence to adopt contemporary treatment options which have been integrated&#xD;
      within standard treatment algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics of metastatic breast cancer patients, diagnosis of disease and&#xD;
      treatments initiated for all patients receiving first line (1L) and second line (2L)&#xD;
      treatment who were admitted to the clinical centers starting from year 2010 will be&#xD;
      retrospectively collected for this study. Data of patients who previously consented for&#xD;
      institutional data sharing will be retrieved from patient charts and recorded in a secure&#xD;
      electronic registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be categorized on two different patient characteristics: Metastatic&#xD;
      pattern at presentation [recurrent metastatic breast cancer (rMBC) or de-novo metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (dnMBC)] of patient and date of initial presentation for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment. The study is planning to analyze patients with follow-up data of minimum 3 years&#xD;
      and the data recording will eventually plan to construct two cohorts based on the initial&#xD;
      diagnosis date; patient diagnosed during Jan 2010-Dec 2014 and Jan 2015-Dec 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to define whether if any changes in the treatment practices&#xD;
      occurred during the period of data record in line changes occurred with the availability of&#xD;
      novel diagnostic methods and treatments for metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
