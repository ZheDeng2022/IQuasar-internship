  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present longitudinal study aims at (i) identifying neurobiological mechanisms associated&#xD;
      with successful social integration during the treatment of inpatients with Borderline&#xD;
      Personality Disorder (BPD) and (ii) improving biomarker-based predictions of treatment&#xD;
      response by incorporating core metrics of social integration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social connections have a strong impact on mental and physical health. Surprisingly, however,&#xD;
      there is a paucity of studies probing the predictive validity of perceived social connections&#xD;
      such as subjective social support and loneliness for the outcomes of inpatient treatment of&#xD;
      BPD. Although social impairments are key features of BPD psychopathology, social integration&#xD;
      has been largely neglected, which may therefore explain the minimal translation of predictive&#xD;
      molecular or imaging-based biomarkers into the clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      assessment of negative cognitive biases at baseline will help to identify BPD patients who&#xD;
      will experience less social support and more loneliness during inpatient treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, an inclusion of social integration indices may increase the incremental validity&#xD;
      for the biomarker-based prediction of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal, observational study, 60 BPD patients will be recruited to assess&#xD;
      negative cognitive biases and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms with behavioral,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine, psychophysiological, and neural readouts before and after a four-week&#xD;
      inpatient treatment. To evaluate pathological biases, the patients' data will be compared&#xD;
      with a control group of 30 healthy participants, who will also be tested twice. Neural&#xD;
      readouts include structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements.&#xD;
      The fMRI tasks will probe the processing of social touch, interpersonal trust, and&#xD;
      interoception. To further investigate pathological distortions of social touch and&#xD;
      interoception, interoceptive accuracy and comfort zones of social touch will be assessed.&#xD;
      Further, patients and healthy participants will perform a positive social interaction task,&#xD;
      accompanied by psychophysiological and neuroendocrinological measures. Psychometric&#xD;
      questionnaires and semi-structured interviews will be used to monitor symptom load and social&#xD;
      indices before, during, and after the inpatient treatment. Long-term effects will be assessed&#xD;
      by questionnaires and interviews 8 and 20 weeks after inpatient treatment/waiting time&#xD;
      (follow-ups). The investigators plan to conduct uni- and multivariate analyses of the&#xD;
      baseline measurements to predict patients' social integration and treatment response during&#xD;
      the inpatient therapy and examine treatment-related changes. The findings of this project may&#xD;
      help identify vulnerable patients that benefit from adjunct therapies targeting negative&#xD;
      social biases and improve biomarker-based models of treatment prediction.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in neural responses to interpersonal touch</measure>
    <time_frame>The fMRI task (duration approx. 15 minutes) will be performed one week before and after 4-weeks DBT treatment/waiting time.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal will be assessed while participants undergo a social touch task. Conditions consist of four types of touch trials with combinations of slow (~ 5 cm/s) and fast touch (~ 20 cm/s), as well as social (administered by hand) and non-social (administered with a brush) touch and a control (no touch) condition. An experimenter, who cannot be seen by the participant, will administer the touch across 20 cm of the shins. After each trial, participants will be asked to rate how comforting the touch was perceived. The neural responses to interpersonal touch will be compared before and after DBT-treatment and the treatment-induced changes will be compared with changes in the healthy control group.</description>
