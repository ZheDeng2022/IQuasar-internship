  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the BIS values and electroencephalographic patterns&#xD;
      during total intravenous anesthesia with propofol-remifentanyl, in patients from 18 to 85&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is an anesthetic drug regularly used in elderly patients requiring anesthesia. The&#xD;
      electroencephalographic pattern recognized when propofol is administered is different from&#xD;
      the pattern obtained in younger patients. Both groups present alpha and slow delta bands, but&#xD;
      younger patients present more intense electroencephalographic bands than older patients (1).&#xD;
      The correlation between BIS values and the power of electroencephalographic frequency bands&#xD;
      during propofol-remifentanyl anesthesia has not been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will describe the changes in BIS values and electroencephalographic&#xD;
      patterns in young and elderly patients receiving propofol-remifentanyl anesthesia for&#xD;
      elective surgery, at different propofol concentration levels. Formal characterization of the&#xD;
      dynamic relationship between propofol concentrations at the effect site (Ce), spectral power,&#xD;
      and BIS values may provide clinically relevant information to design propofol dose schemes in&#xD;
      elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out a prospective observational clinical study at the Clinical&#xD;
      Hospital of the Catholic University of Chile. 30 patients, aged 18-85 years, scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo elective surgery will be recruited. Standard monitoring and 2 frontal EEG monitors&#xD;
      will be installed: Sedline® and BIS®. The electroencephalographic signal from these monitors&#xD;
      will be recorded simultaneously from anesthesia induction until extubation. Propofol will be&#xD;
      started at a rate of 15-20 mg/kg/hr in patients &gt;65 years and 20-25 mg/kg/hr in younger&#xD;
      patients (&lt;65 years) until a suppression rate (SR) &gt;1% appears in the BIS® EEG monitor. If&#xD;
      the SR is not achieved, the infusion rate can be increased by 5 mg/kg/hr every 5 minutes&#xD;
      until 25 mg/kg/hr in the elderly group and 30 mg/kg/hr in the younger group. When the SR&#xD;
      appears, propofol infusion will be stopped. The induction phase will be considered completed&#xD;
      at this point. Loss of response (LOR), defined as the timepoint when patients became&#xD;
      unresponsive to verbal commands, soft shaking, and eyelash reflex, will be assessed every 30&#xD;
      seconds. When patients become apneic, positive pressure mask ventilation will be started&#xD;
      gently at a rate of 10 breaths per minute. After induction of anesthesia, opioids and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking drugs will be given to facilitate tracheal intubation. When BIS values&#xD;
      increase to recommended hypnotic levels for surgery (40-60), the propofol infusion rate will&#xD;
      be started again at half of the induction rate. This rate will be adjusted to maintain the&#xD;
      alpha band present in the Sedline spectrogram and SEF95 between 8-12 Hz. BIS monitor will be&#xD;
      covered and hidden from the attending anesthesiologist during the maintenance phase. After&#xD;
      surgery ends, EEG monitoring will continue until the patient's extubation. One hour after&#xD;
      extubation, the Brice questionnaire will be performed to detect intraoperative awakening.&#xD;
      Propofol concentration will be estimated using the Schnider model.&#xD;
