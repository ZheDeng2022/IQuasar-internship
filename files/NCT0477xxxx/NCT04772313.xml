  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label trial of pegloticase with MTX (methotrexate) in&#xD;
      adult participants with uncontrolled gout who were previously treated with pegloticase&#xD;
      without a concomitant immunomodulator and stopped pegloticase due to failure to maintain sUA&#xD;
      (serum uric acid) response and/or a clinically mild IR (infusion reaction). Approximately 30&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. Pegloticase + MTX will be administered for approximately 24&#xD;
      weeks, with an optional extension up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial design will include 5 distinct components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Period, lasting up to 42 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 6-week MTX Tolerability Assessment Period (hereafter referred to as the MTX Run-in&#xD;
           Period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24-week Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period, which will include a Week 24/End of&#xD;
           Trial/Early Termination Visit (subjects that end MTX and pegloticase treatment prior to&#xD;
           the Week 24 will remain on trial for follow up until the Week 24 visit);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Optional Pegloticase + MTX Extension Period up to 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 30-Day Post Treatment Follow -up&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will begin once-weekly&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) MTX Run-in period. Participants must be able to tolerate MTX at a minimum&#xD;
      dose of 15 mg during the 6-week MTX Run-in Period to be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete the MTX Run-in Period&#xD;
      will be considered enrolled participants. During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period,&#xD;
      pegloticase 8 mg will be administered IV every 2 weeks and MTX SC weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sequential cohorts of participants will be enrolled in this trial. Cohort 1 is targeted&#xD;
      to enroll 10 participants who previously failed to maintain sUA (serum uric acid) response&#xD;
      with pegloticase monotherapy and stopped pegloticase treatment without a history of&#xD;
      pegloticase-related infusion reaction. If the safety assessment during Cohort 1 indicates&#xD;
      that the pegloticase infusions are well tolerated, then the trial can begin enrolling Cohort&#xD;
      2. 20 participants with a history pegloticase-related infusion reaction.&#xD;
