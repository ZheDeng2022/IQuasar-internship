      The ergonomic design and setup of an operating/procedure room have long been a studied topic&#xD;
      of interest. Back in 1999, an article (1) reviewed the ongoing research into the effects that&#xD;
      operator posture, the operating room environment, and visualization of screens have on the&#xD;
      ergonomics of surgery. They made the observation that 'future efforts to create a more user-&#xD;
      friendly operating room environment will require the rethinking of traditional concepts of&#xD;
      architecture, asepsis, and staffing (1). As technology rapidly advances, we are increasingly&#xD;
      able to reassess and enhance the current ergonomic structure and setup of operating rooms and&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional radiology (IR) refers to a variety of minimally invasive procedures using&#xD;
      small- caliber catheters under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance for the treatment of&#xD;
      vascular and urologic, gastrointestinal conditions without the need for open surgery (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology has the unique ergonomic consideration of the placement of the&#xD;
      intraoperative viewing monitors (3). To perform any Interventional Radiology procedure,&#xD;
      radiologists currently use a ceiling mounted or floor mounted image intensifier, a ceiling&#xD;
      mounted screen and a small floor mounted monitor. In many procedures (usually those requiring&#xD;
      downstream access into the vessel, arm or neck vascular access) the Radiologist has to move&#xD;
      their own position to visualize all the screens, as it is impossible to rotate the screens&#xD;
      adequately so that they are in a direct line with the Radiologists vision. Previous studies&#xD;
      of office video terminal display (VDT) users demonstrate that the preferred viewing angle for&#xD;
      VDTs is between 10° to 25° below the line of sight(4). The monitors are placed in such a way&#xD;
      that the Interventional radiologist cannot possibly maintain the correct line of sight&#xD;
      without some neck movement and craning. Inevitably, long periods of time standing in this&#xD;
      awkward position can lead to musculoskeletal issues for the radiologist, as well as the&#xD;
      stress of performing a procedure safely without the best line of vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Interventional Radiologist is also wearing a heavy lead apron during the procedure, which&#xD;
      adds to the ergonomic challenges. The incidence of neck and back pain increases with hours of&#xD;
      apron use and years of practice, and may be the result of a combination of axial load (ie,&#xD;
      prolonged standing in protective garments), awkward or poor posture (necessitated by leaning&#xD;
      or bending to accomplish procedures), and repetitive injury accumulated over years of&#xD;
      practice. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there are multiple other screens monitoring patient parameters which are outside&#xD;
      of the Interventional radiologist's field of view during the procedure, creating further&#xD;
      safety concerns. Of note, other current concerns in the Interventional suite are costly&#xD;
      screen breakage during manoeuvre of the screens during suite setup, and sterility issues that&#xD;
      arise when the monitor is brought too close to the operating field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intention is that the new device will project a hologram of all the screens which can be&#xD;
      positioned exactly in front of the operator at all times, irrespective of the patient&#xD;
      position. Because it is mixed reality, the operator can still see their surroundings and&#xD;
      perform the procedure exactly as normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this technology, multiple screens of different modalities can be added, such as CT&#xD;
      scans, MRI scans and 3D rendered holograms. Specific device instructions can also be&#xD;
      visualized if necessary, without the requirement for the radiologist to leave the sterile&#xD;
      procedure site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device can also be used to stream fluoroscopic and 3D images to a remote hololens or&#xD;
      computer screen. This can be utilized for remote assistance and mentoring purposes. It will&#xD;
      also be especially useful in the context of COVID-19, where reducing the clinical exposure of&#xD;
      health care workers is of vital importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main intention of the pilot study is to assess whether the hypothesis that the VSI&#xD;
      streamer and HMD will indeed improve the ergonomics of the interventional suite sufficiently&#xD;
      enough that the Interventional radiologist can perform the procedures more comfortably and&#xD;
      safely. The practicalities of adding the VSI Streamer and HMD to the interventional suite&#xD;
      setup will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this initial pilot study, a practical assessment will be performed of the usability of&#xD;
      the VSI streamer during commonly performed elective angiographic procedures. This will&#xD;
      identify which procedures are particularly suited to this technology.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Methodology:&#xD;
Single center randomized controlled pilot feasibility study. Firstly, VSI streamer software will be used for real time streaming of input from the fluoroscopy unit to a Head mounted display (Hololens 2) worn by the operator. This will be utilized to perform angiographic procedures on a 3D vascular model. Mock benchtop&#xD;
angiographic catheterization procedures will be performed in order to ensure practicality, safety and initial usability.&#xD;
Subsequently, appropriate patients undergoing elective Interventional Radiology procedures will be screened and enrolled. After performing these procedures on the first two patients, procedural parameters will be reviewed and subsequent patients will be enrolled if no safety concerns have arisen in the first two patients. Patients will be enrolled until a total of 60 procedures have been performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>1.1 Description of VSI streamer device and software The VSI Streamer is a box that can be connected to ultrasound, endoscope, microscope, laparoscope and other devices via HDMI connection. The view of the imaging devices, which is conventionally displayed on a monitor, is transmitted wirelessly and in real time to the Mixed Reality HoloLens 2 (Microsoft Inc.) and appears as a virtual monitor that can be flexibly moved and positioned in space. Since this is Mixed Reality, the real environment remains visible. If required, several virtual monitors can be streamed into the Mixed Reality glasses at the same time</description>
