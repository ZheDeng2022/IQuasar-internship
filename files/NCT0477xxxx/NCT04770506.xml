  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In industrialized countries, it is estimated that around 10% of the population suffers from&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis (NL). Numerous recent epidemiological studies report that the prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of NL continue to increase, with a prevalence that has nearly doubled over the past&#xD;
      two decades. A patient who presented with a first episode of renal lithiasis has an estimated&#xD;
      recurrence rate of nearly 50% at 5 years in adults. It is therefore wiser to consider NL as a&#xD;
      chronic pathology and not as a simple isolated attack of painful crisis. NL therefore&#xD;
      represents a real public health problem with a significant impact on the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients, with considerable socio-economic repercussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, calcium lithiasis is the most common and occurs in 90% of cases.The&#xD;
      stones mainly consist of calcium oxalate (whewellite, weddellite) but also calcium phosphate&#xD;
      (carbapatite, brushite).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the risk factors for calcium lithiasis is the over-saturation of urine with calcium,&#xD;
      which can lead to crystal formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common metabolic abnormality found in patients with NL is hypercalciuria.It is&#xD;
      defined as an increased excretion of urinary calcium.We can first distinguish hypercalciuria&#xD;
      secondary to another pathology such as primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, distal&#xD;
      tubular acidosis, hypervitaminosis D, immobilization... from idiopathic hypercalciuria (HI),&#xD;
      at the origin of so-called primary calcium lithiasis.HI is estimated to affect 30-60% of&#xD;
      adults with NL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic hypercalciuria is associated with low bone mineral density. Patients with NL have&#xD;
      significantly lower T-score values in the vertebrae, hips, and femoral necks.Patients with NL&#xD;
      have an increased risk of fractures and are 4 times more likely to develop osteoporosis. It&#xD;
      is currently proposed that idiopathic hypercalciuria may be the cause of the decrease in bone&#xD;
      mineral density in lithiasis patients.This bone demineralization appears to be associated&#xD;
      with an increase in vascular calcifications.These, like NL, are believed to be linked to&#xD;
      extra-osia calcium deposits.There is an inverse relationship between bone mineral density and&#xD;
      arterial wall thickness (partly due to vascular calcifications) suggesting a relationship&#xD;
      between arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis. This relationship would be much more pronounced in&#xD;
      lithiasis women. In addition, several observations report an increase in cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity in people with NL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NL should therefore be seen as a systemic disease and is also associated with several&#xD;
      pathologies such as: metabolic syndrome, arterial hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the knowledge of the investigators, no statistical data concerning the prevalence of&#xD;
      vascular calcifications and bone demineralization in the population of lithiasis patients in&#xD;
      Belgium has been published to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of vascular calcifications&#xD;
      (early state of arteriosclerosis) as well as the bone mineral density in the lithiasis&#xD;
      population followed at the Brugmann University Hospital and with idiopathic hypercalciuria.&#xD;
