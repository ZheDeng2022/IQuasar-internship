  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Paticipants undergoing cataract surgery find postoperative medication management&#xD;
      difficult and are anxious about this issue. Differences in the number of medications and&#xD;
      frequency of administration can be lead to confusion in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives: The aim of this randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of using SMS, which reminds about the intake of medication, on reducing postoperative anxiety&#xD;
      in participants undergoing cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study was conducted with the participation of 82 patients in the&#xD;
      ophthalmology clinic of a private hospital between July 2020 and February 2021. Participants&#xD;
      who underwent cataract surgery in a private hospital constituted the population of the study.&#xD;
      Based on the findings in the literature (Karaman Özlü et al., 2016) (mean score of the State&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory 27.54±3.25), the minimum number of participants to be included in the&#xD;
      sample was determined to be 82 (41 subjects-41 controls), each group consisting of 41 people&#xD;
      by predicting a confidence interval of 99.9%, an error rate of 5%, and a power of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who were adults, volunteered to participate in the study, accepted&#xD;
      randomization, could communicate in Turkish, had a personal cell phone, could read text&#xD;
      messages or were illiterate and had a relative to help participants at home after discharge&#xD;
      were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools The study data were collected using the Patient Identification Form and&#xD;
      Patient Satisfaction Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Identification Form: The form prepared by the investigater with the help of the&#xD;
      literature (Gülşen &amp; Akansel, 2020; &amp; Lim et al., 2018) consisted of 8 questions examining&#xD;
      the individual variables (age, gender, education level, marital status, comorbidity, working&#xD;
      status and the patient's state of living alone, and the experience of cataract).&#xD;
&#xD;
      State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) In 1970, Spielberg et al. developed the State Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory, and Oner and Le Compte carried out its reliability and validity studies. According&#xD;
      to 20 expressions with inventory, the individual may determine his or her feelings at a&#xD;
      specific location and time. The State Anxiety Inventory are scored between 20 and 80. A&#xD;
      higher score suggests a high anxiety level. The Cronbach alpha for Turkish version of the SAI&#xD;
      was 0.94 to 0.96 (Öner &amp; Le Compte, 1983; Öner, 2008). In this study, the coefficient of&#xD;
      Cronbach alpha was calculated to be 0.93 for the inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Satisfaction Form The form consisted of one question about participants' satisfaction&#xD;
      with receiving an SMS reminder. The satisfaction level of participants was classified into&#xD;
      four levels. The value &quot;0&quot; was determined as &quot;Not satisfied at all,&quot; and the value &quot;3&quot; was&#xD;
      determined as &quot;Very satisfied.&quot; Postoperative Medication Reference Chart It is a &quot;chart&quot;&#xD;
      including the dosage and application time of all eye drops until postoperative day seven,&#xD;
      which is the second control of the participant according to the doctor's directive.&#xD;
      Medications were individualized for each participant by the investigater clinical nurse&#xD;
      according to the doctor's directive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Before starting the data collection, 82 participants who met the sampling&#xD;
      acceptance criteria were prospectively identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigater provided information about the study, the aim and significance of the study,&#xD;
      and the investigater to the individuals hospitalized in the ophthalmology service for&#xD;
      cataract surgery, and then informed consent was obtained in writing from the individuals.&#xD;
      Randomization was done by coin tossing (those who came up tails were included in the SMS&#xD;
      group, and those who came up heads were included in the control group), and according to the&#xD;
      results, the Patient Identification Form and SAI were applied to all participants in the&#xD;
      control and SMS groups on the day of surgery (postoperative day 0). Routine discharge&#xD;
      education was provided to all participants by clinical nurses. During the discharge of the&#xD;
      participants in the control group, they were informed about the change of dressing on the&#xD;
      next day (postoperative day one) and control in the outpatient clinic on postoperative day&#xD;
      seven. The participants were given an individualized written Postoperative Medication&#xD;
      Reference Chart indicating the dosage and application time of eye drops participants must&#xD;
      follow for seven days at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMS group After postoperative standard discharge education was provided to the participants&#xD;
      in the SMS group, participants were given an individualized written Postoperative Medication&#xD;
      Reference Chart indicating the dosage and application time of eye drops participants must&#xD;
      follow for seven days at home. The participants/relative, whose contact information was&#xD;
      received, was informed that they would be reminded via SMS. SMS reminders such as &quot;Dear x, do&#xD;
      not forget to apply your eye drop called X as 5 drops three times a day and your eye drop&#xD;
      called X as 2 drops three times a day. Investigater hope you get well soon,&quot; which were&#xD;
      individualized according to the participant based on the doctor's directive, were sent to the&#xD;
      participants in the SMS group by the investigater clinical nurse (A. Ş). SMS sending started&#xD;
      on postoperative day 1 and ended on day seven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAI was applied again to all participants who came to the outpatient clinic for control on&#xD;
      postoperative day seven. Unlike the control group, the &quot;Patient Satisfaction Form,&quot; which was&#xD;
      prepared for the use of SMS reminders, was applied to the participants in the SMS group.&#xD;
      Confirmation was obtained from the participants and their relatives that SMS reminders were&#xD;
      received every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization (1:1 allocation ratio) was determined by the simple randomization&#xD;
      method (coin tossing). As a result of coin tossing, participants who came up tails were&#xD;
      allocated to the SMS group (n = 41), and participants who came up heads were allocated to the&#xD;
      control group (n = 41), (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and the investigaters could&#xD;
      not be blinded to the intervention (SMS sending) since open participation was required.&#xD;
