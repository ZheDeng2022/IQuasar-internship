  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is a significant problem among Latinxs and immigration-related stress increases&#xD;
      risk for substance use. A theoretically-based cultural adaptation of motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (CAMI) that specifically integrated discussion of immigration-related stressors&#xD;
      (e.g., stigma, social isolation) resulted in significant reductions in alcohol-related harms&#xD;
      for those Latinx heavy drinkers with high discrimination compared to standard MI, and reduced&#xD;
      anxiety and depressive symptoms one year later compared to MI. Rigorous tests that examine&#xD;
      theoretically-informed adaptation of efficacious addiction interventions are not common, yet&#xD;
      are needed to advance implementation science. This Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation&#xD;
      study will investigate the feasibility of implementing CAMI in a real-world clinical setting.&#xD;
      The key questions are: Would CAMI have positive effects among individuals who use both drugs&#xD;
      and alcohol? How do providers view this intervention? The investigators will collaborate with&#xD;
      a primary care center that serves a mainly Latinx client population to train their Community&#xD;
      Wellness Advocates (CWAs) to deliver CAMI to patients who are heavy drinkers. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a concurrent investigation on the process of implementing CAMI in&#xD;
      primary care - a two-arm randomized clinical effectiveness trial will enroll Latinx heavy&#xD;
      drinkers (18 years or older) in primary care who use alcohol (and may use other drugs) - and&#xD;
      follow them for 12 months after the intervention. Specific Aims are: (1) To examine the&#xD;
      impact of CAMI plus a booster session (vs. assessment only) on outcomes: % heavy drinking&#xD;
      days, frequency of alcohol-related consequences, depressive/anxiety symptoms, and number of&#xD;
      illicit drug use days, using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation design and (2) To&#xD;
      gather indicators of implementation outcome from multiple stakeholders using a mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach. The investigators will follow Curran's framework to evaluate the process of&#xD;
      implementation and Proctor's framework to measure implementation outcomes. This study, a&#xD;
      first to examine the acceptability of culturally-adapted addiction treatments in primary care&#xD;
      settings, will answer essential questions on implementing evidence-based care for Latinxs&#xD;
      that can improve health disparities related to substance use. Long term goals are to&#xD;
      translate the lessons from this Hybrid study to the broader community to focus on population&#xD;
      health for all primary care patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is a significant problem among Latinxs because of the disproportionate burden of&#xD;
      physical harms and negative consequences associated with substance use relative to other&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups. Factors associated with the stress related to being an immigrant&#xD;
      increase risk for substance use. A theoretically-based cultural adaptation of motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (CAMI) that specifically integrated discussion of stressors related to&#xD;
      immigration (e.g., discrimination, stigma, social isolation) resulted in significant&#xD;
      reductions in harms related to alcohol for those Latinx heavy drinkers with high&#xD;
      discrimination compared to standard MI, and reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms one year&#xD;
      later compared to MI. Rigorous tests that examine theoretically-informed adaptation of&#xD;
      efficacious interventions for addictions are not common, yet are needed to advance&#xD;
      implementation science because they address questions that are the basis for successful&#xD;
      implementation. The proposed Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation study is an important&#xD;
      next step in this line of research, which is to investigate the feasibility of implementing&#xD;
      the CAMI intervention in a real-world clinical setting. The key questions are: Would CAMI&#xD;
      have positive effects among individuals who use both drugs and alcohol? How do providers view&#xD;
      this intervention? The investigators will collaborate with a primary care center that serves&#xD;
      a mainly Latinx client population to train their Community Wellness Advocates (CWAs) to&#xD;
      deliver the CAMI to patients who are heavy drinkers. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      concurrent investigation on the process of implementing the CAMI in primary care - a two-arm&#xD;
      randomized clinical effectiveness trial will enroll Latinx heavy drinkers (18 years or older)&#xD;
      in primary care who use alcohol (and may use other drugs) - and follow them for 12 months&#xD;
      after the intervention. Specific Aims are: (1) To examine the impact of CAMI plus an in-&#xD;
      person booster session (vs. assessment only) on outcomes: % heavy drinking days, frequency of&#xD;
      alcohol- related consequences, depressive/anxiety symptoms, and number of illicit drug use&#xD;
      days, using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation design and (2) To gather indicators&#xD;
      of implementation outcome from multiple stakeholders using a mixed-methods approach. The&#xD;
      investigators will follow Curran's framework to evaluate the process of implementation and&#xD;
      Proctor's framework to measure implementation outcomes: acceptability, adoption, intervention&#xD;
      appropriateness, feasibility, overall cost (i.e., CAMI vs. assessment only), and treatment&#xD;
      fidelity. This study, a first to examine the acceptability of culturally-adapted addiction&#xD;
      treatments in primary care settings, will answer essential questions on implementing&#xD;
      evidence-based care for Latinxs that can improve health disparities related to substance use.&#xD;
      Long term goals are to translate the lessons from the proposed Hybrid study to the broader&#xD;
      community to focus on population health for all primary care patients.&#xD;
