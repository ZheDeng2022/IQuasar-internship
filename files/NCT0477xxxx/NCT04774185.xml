  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonova Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early&#xD;
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then&#xD;
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a&#xD;
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Sonova Hearing&#xD;
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a confirmatory&#xD;
      study, investigating benefits of a modified hearing aid loudspeaker. This will be a clinical&#xD;
      investigation which will be conducted mono centric at National Acoustic Laboratories a well&#xD;
      known institution with exceptional experience (Australia).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study a comparison with two Phonak Receiver in Canal (RIC) devices is done. The&#xD;
      experimental device with a modified hearing aid loudspeaker concept and the active comparator&#xD;
      with the existing technology will be compared regarding speech intelligibility, listening&#xD;
      effort and sound quality in speech in noise, quiet situations for people with mild to&#xD;
      moderate hearing losses.&#xD;

    <description>The Primary Outcome measure of this study is the comparison of the standard hearing aid loudspeaker with the modified one in regard to speech intelligibility in a noisy environment and sound quality in a quiet situation.&#xD;
The speech intelligibility will be measured using a speech test in dB SRT and the sound quality will be assessed by subjective rating, using percentage of satisfaction from &quot;very satisfied (100)&quot; to &quot;very unsatisfied (0)&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Secondary Outcome measure of this study is the comparison of the standard hearing aid loudspeaker with the modified one in regard to listening effort in a noisy environment.&#xD;
The listening effort of speech will be assessed by subjective rating, within 13 steps, from &quot;not effortful at all&quot; to &quot;only noise&quot;.</description>
