  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PBKR03 is a gene therapy for Krabbe Disease (Globoid cell leukodystrophy) intended to deliver&#xD;
      a functional copy of the GALC gene to the brain and peripheral tissues. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of this treatment by first evaluating two&#xD;
      different doses in two different age groups, then confirming the optimal dose to be used for&#xD;
      confirmation of safety and efficacy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PBKR03 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype Hu68 carrying the gene encoding for human&#xD;
      galactosylceramidase, GALC, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a global interventional, multicenter, single-arm, dose escalation, study of PBKR03&#xD;
      delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna of subjects with early&#xD;
      infantile Krabbe Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-ranging portion of the study will enroll independent dose escalation cohorts in two&#xD;
      age groups of subjects with early infantile Krabbe disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 3 subjects aged ≥4 to &lt;9 months will receive the low dose (Dose I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 3 subjects aged ≥4 to &lt;9 months will receive the high dose (Dose II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 3 subjects aged ≥1 to &lt;4 months will receive the low dose (Dose I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 3 subjects aged ≥1 to &lt;4 months will receive the high dose (Dose II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study will enroll a total of four cohorts, enrolled sequentially with separate&#xD;
      age-based dose-escalation cohorts. Enrollment will initiate in Cohort 1. Following completion&#xD;
      of Cohort 1, simultaneous enrollment in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will occur. Cohort 4 will&#xD;
      follow completion of cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confirmatory cohort, Part 2, will enroll subjects with early infantile Krabbe Disease,&#xD;
      aged &gt;1 to &lt;9 months. These subjects will receive a dose chosen based on the data obtained in&#xD;
      part 1 of the study This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.&#xD;

             and/or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any condition (e.g., history of any disease, evidence of any current disease, any&#xD;
             finding upon physical examination, or any laboratory abnormality) that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, would put the subject at undue risk during the administration&#xD;
             procedure or would interfere with evaluation of PBKR01 or interpretation of subject&#xD;
             safety or study results.&#xD;
