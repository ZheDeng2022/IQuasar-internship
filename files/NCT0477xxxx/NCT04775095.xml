      BLaDE cohort will evaluate overall survival (OS), real world progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      best response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced, metastatic Non-Small Cell&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) harboring BRAF V600E or non E mutation who received&#xD;
      dabrafeninb-trametinib combination or not. Subsequent or previous treatments (treatments&#xD;
      delivered after or before dabrafeninb-trametinib combination will be recorded). Those&#xD;
      outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological characteristics of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The braf gene (V Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, long arm of chromosome 7q3) codes&#xD;
      for a protein (serine / threonine kinase) which regulates the signaling pathway RAS - RAF -&#xD;
      MEK - ERK playing an important role in the proliferation processes, cell survival,&#xD;
      angiogenesis, cell invasion and migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When activated by mutations, BRAF phosphorylates MEK to promote cell growth, proliferation&#xD;
      and survival. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRAF mutations are found in 1-2% of&#xD;
      cases. BRAF mutations are distinguished by kinase activity and their signaling via the&#xD;
      mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway. BRAF V600 mutations, class I, signal as monomers&#xD;
      with or without activated RAS. BRAF non-V600 are classified as either class II that signal as&#xD;
      dimmers when RAS as activated or class III with impaired kinase activity but increased MAPK&#xD;
      pathway signaling. The most frequent mutation in NSCLC (50% of cases) is the V600E mutation&#xD;
      (glutamate / valine substitution, codon 600 of exon 15) which is activating (others&#xD;
      mutations: G469A and D594G, respectively 39% and 11% of cases). One phase II trial&#xD;
      demonstrated that the dabrafenib-trametinib combination had significant anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      in terms of response rate, PFS in patients with a NSCLC with the BRAF V600E mutation,&#xD;
      pretreated or not. In this multicentre non-randomized phase II open label study, a&#xD;
      dabrafenib-trametinib combination was tested in 59 previously treated patients with&#xD;
      metastatic stage IV BRAF V600E mutated NSCLC with documented progression after at least one&#xD;
      prior platinum based chemotherapy. Overall response rate (ORR) was 63.2% (95% CI: 49.3 to&#xD;
      75.6%), median PFS was 9.7 months (95%CI 6.9-19.6). In the cohort of patients previously&#xD;
      untreated (n=36) and treated with first line dabrafenib-trametinib combination, the&#xD;
      investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 64% (95% CI 46-79 %), the median investigator&#xD;
      assessed PFS was 10.9 months (95CI:7-16.6) and the 6 month-PFS was 72% (53-84%) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the last ASCO conference 2020, the data have been updated. In cohorts of untreated and&#xD;
      previously treated patients, the ORR was 63.9% (95CI 46.2-79.2) and 68.4% (95CI 54.8, 80.1),&#xD;
      median PFS 10.8 months (95CI 7.0-14.5) and 10.2 months (95CI: 6.9-16.7). Median OS was 17.3&#xD;
      months (95% CI: 12.3-40.2; 3 years OS: 40%) and 18.2 months (95% CI: 14.3-28.6; 3 years OS:&#xD;
      33%) with 14/36 and 11/57 patients alive in treatment naïve and pretreated patients&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dabrafenib-trametinib combination had European authorization since 2017. In January 2020,&#xD;
      the French Transparency Committee validated its possible use in second line in current&#xD;
      practice, after failure of a first therapeutic line (whatever its nature) but only for BRAF&#xD;
      V600E mutations. Clinical outcomes data on BRAF-mutated V600 NSCLC patients treated in&#xD;
      routine practice by dabrafenib-trametinib combination is limited with only retrospective&#xD;
      studies including few patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this retrospective multicenter observational study is to describe,&#xD;
      in real world, the characteristics and evolution of NSCLC patients with a BRAF V600 E&#xD;
      mutation treated with the dabrafenib-trametinib combination regardless of the line of&#xD;
      treatment. Also, this retrospective multicenter observational will describe in real world,&#xD;
      the characteristics, treatment and evolution of NSCLC patients with a BRAF V600 non E&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
