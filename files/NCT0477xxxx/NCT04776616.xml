  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial evaluating anxiety reduction for women with opioid use disorder&#xD;
      affecting pregnancy. It is well documented that anxiety increases as pregnancy progresses. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that women who undergo green light therapy (experimental arm) will have a smaller&#xD;
      increase in anxiety scores compared to the women who undergo white light therapy (control&#xD;
      arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also look at how much opiate replacement therapy increases women require during the&#xD;
      study period, and how much opiate they require during admission for delivery. We think this a&#xD;
      is a low risk intervention in a pregnant population that has higher levels of anxiety when&#xD;
      compared to the general population. We believe based on animal studies that this could be&#xD;
      effective, and change the way we treat and support individuals with substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The opioid epidemic has negatively impacted our society at many levels. Finding&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic ways to support patients while in recovery/sustained sobriety that are&#xD;
      simple and low cost would be a step forward in providing compassionate and comprehensive&#xD;
      treatment to individuals affected by Opioid Use Disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At time of enrollment, participants will be administered a States-Traits Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI) questionnaire, undergo screening for ACE score (adverse childhood experiences), and&#xD;
      will be asked about basic demographic data. After they complete the initial surveys, the&#xD;
      patient will be assigned to either the control group or the experimental group. They will be&#xD;
      sent home with the light, along with instructions to use their light every night for 1-2&#xD;
      hours as ambient lighting. We hope to enroll a maximum of 26 patients in this study with 1:1&#xD;
      randomization (13 control, 13 experiment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At approximately halfway through the intervention, the PI will call the patient and ask how&#xD;
      often she has been using the light, how long she uses the light for every night, and whether&#xD;
      she has noticed any effects (either positive or negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the prenatal visit around 36 weeks gestation or at time of delivery, whichever is sooner,&#xD;
      patients will be asked by the PI to turn in their light and also fill out the STAI once&#xD;
      again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, the PI will review the medical record and record any change in opioid&#xD;
      replacement therapy during pregnancy as well as the total dose of opiate required during the&#xD;
      inpatient admission for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to enroll a maximum of 26 patients in this study with 1:1 randomization (13 control,&#xD;
      13 experiment)&#xD;
