  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial that will be conducted in adolescents&#xD;
      (10 through 14 years of age) receiving at least one recommended intramuscularly administered&#xD;
      vaccine to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of using two different, simultaneously&#xD;
      administered interventions that might prevent post-vaccination presyncope, and by extension&#xD;
      syncope. The two interventions to be evaluated together are Buzzy®, which is a medical device&#xD;
      designed to reduce vaccination pain, and an electronic game. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      both interventions when administered simultaneously (Buzzy® and electronic game). The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll approximately 340 subjects into this study. Eligible adolescents&#xD;
      will be randomized (1:1) to either the intervention or control group: 1) intervention (Buzzy®&#xD;
      and electronic game); or 2) control (usual care) to assess for acceptability and efficacy.&#xD;
      Detailed data will be collected and described from study participants including demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, baseline anxiety, and needle phobia. Participants will be observed for 20&#xD;
      minutes following receipt of vaccines and reassessed for post-vaccination anxiety, immediate&#xD;
      and subsequent post-vaccination pain (within 1 minute and at 10 minutes), and the occurrence&#xD;
      of witnessed syncope or presyncope, and presyncopal symptoms as rated by the modified Blood&#xD;
      Donation Reactions Inventory (BDRI). Participants will also be asked to assess their&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;
