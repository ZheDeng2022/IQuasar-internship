      Background: The investigators aimed to compare the oncological results of patients with early&#xD;
      stage laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) treated with Transoral Laryngeal Surgery&#xD;
      (TOLS) and Radiotheraphy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The patients were divided into two groups as TOLS (Group 1) and RT (Group 2)&#xD;
      according to the treatment method. Both groups were compared with each other in terms of&#xD;
      local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, 3 and 5-year overall survival,&#xD;
      disease-free survival, disease-specific survival and laryngectomy-free survival rates.&#xD;
      Survival analyses was made by Kaplan Meier product limit estimation. A p-value of less than&#xD;
      0.05 was considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

      Laryngeal cancers are one of the most common head and neck cancers (HNC). According to the&#xD;
      2018 cancer statistics, the estimated number of new laryngeal cancer cases annually is&#xD;
      177.000, and approximately half of these cases died due to the laryngeal cancer. While the&#xD;
      most common HNC in the world is oral cavity cancer, in Turkey the most common HNC is&#xD;
      laryngeal cancer. In Turkey, laryngeal cancers are showed 6.6/ 100.000 in men, 0.5/ 100.000&#xD;
      in women, and it ranked eighth in cancer deaths in men. Every year in Turkey, more than 3500&#xD;
      cases of new laryngeal cancer are expected, and its incidence has increased significantly in&#xD;
      the last ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main treatment of early stage laryngeal cancers, surgery (transoral laryngeal surgery&#xD;
      (TOLS) - open partial laryngeal surgery (OPLS)) and radiotherapy (RT) are used. Although the&#xD;
      oncological results of all of three treatment strategies are similar, TOLS performed with&#xD;
      laser is preferred mostly because of short hospital stay, low cost, good functional result,&#xD;
      low morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are quite different studies in the literature on whether surgical and non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment methods used in the treatment of early stage laryngeal cancers are superior to each&#xD;
      other in terms of oncological results. In a randomized controlled study with a large patient&#xD;
      series comparing surgery and radiotherapy, 5-year overall survival (OS) in T1 tumors (91.7%&#xD;
      in the RT group, 100% in the surgery group) and in T2 tumors (88.8% in the RT group, 97.4% in&#xD;
      the surgery group) was similar. 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in T2 tumors (60.1% in RT&#xD;
      group, 78.7% in surgery group) was higher in favor of surgery. Studies comparing TOLS and&#xD;
      radiotheraphy in the treatment of early stage laryngeal cancer within the last 20 years have&#xD;
      reported comparable oncologic outcomes; two recent meta-analyses have reported better overall&#xD;
      survival after TOLS than radiotheraphy, despite being able to show any difference in local&#xD;
      control. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of TOLS and RT on local control,&#xD;
      regional control, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific&#xD;
      survival (DSS) and larynjectomy-free survival (LFS) in early stage laryngeal cancers in our&#xD;
      own series of patients with high patient volume and long follow-up.&#xD;
