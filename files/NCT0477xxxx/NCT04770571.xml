  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of&#xD;
      occipito-cervico-thoracic spine surgery using posterior fixation as measured by reported&#xD;
      complications, radiographic outcomes, and patients reported outcomes (PROs).This study is&#xD;
      being undertaken to identify possible residual risks and to clarify mid-to long-term clinical&#xD;
      performance that may affect the benefit/risk ratio of posterior fixation systems.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      performance of select occipito-cervico-thoracic posterior fixation systems in patients who&#xD;
      undergo posterior fixation fusion surgery. Consecutive patients at a given site who meet&#xD;
      eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to participate in the study. These patients&#xD;
      will present with traumatic, reconstructive, and/or tumor conditions in the craniocervical,&#xD;
      cervical, and/or upper thoracic spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be&#xD;
      screened prior to study enrollment. Once enrolled in the study, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      posterior occipito-cervico-thoracic fixation surgery using one of the NuVasive posterior&#xD;
      fixation systems (Vuepoint II OCT or Reline-C) based on the surgeon's standard of care. At&#xD;
      least 150 subjects (a minimum of 75 in each implant arm) will be enrolled and will be&#xD;
      followed for 24 months after the surgery.&#xD;
