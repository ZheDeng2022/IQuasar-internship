      Study Group Universe The universe of the study consists of couples living in Ankara who have&#xD;
      decided to get married and applied to Çankaya Municipality Marriage Office and / or Altındağ&#xD;
      Municipality Marriage Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample of the Study Group With type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, the minimum number of&#xD;
      individuals required to determine the difference in numerical values for the groups at d =&#xD;
      0.50 effect width (medium effect width was taken in the absence of a priori information) was&#xD;
      determined as 128 in total. This number will be equally distributed among the groups.&#xD;
      Considering the losses that may occur, it is planned to work with at least 50 pairs in the&#xD;
      groups. (The sample size and power calculation required for the study was done using the&#xD;
      program G * Power, Ver. 3.0.10, Universität Kiel, Germany,&#xD;
      http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower/)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent of couples who apply for marriage will be obtained with an informed voluntary consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples who meet the sampling criteria at least 2 months before the wedding / wedding day&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be made in determining the training and control groups in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, an introductory information form and sexual health-reproductive health&#xD;
      knowledge test will be applied face to face to the control group. The introductory&#xD;
      information form includes socio-demographic characteristics, characteristics related to&#xD;
      marital life, characteristics of sexual and reproductive health and sexual&#xD;
      health-reproductive health education.An introductory brochure will be given to the&#xD;
      intervention group and the WEB site will be introduced. Introductory information form and&#xD;
      sexual health-reproductive health information test will be applied to the intervention group&#xD;
      based on WEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, WEB-based marriage preparation training will be given to the&#xD;
      intervention group. The training program is planned in two modules. The first module will&#xD;
      include communication and problem solving, while the second module will include sexual&#xD;
      health, reproductive health, contraception methods, sexually transmitted infections and&#xD;
      domestic violence. Each training topic will be in the form of a 20-minute video narration and&#xD;
      will be planned for 2 weeks in total. Participants will be able to benefit from the trainings&#xD;
      24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It will be ensured that the trainings are completed before the&#xD;
      wedding. In the second stage, no intervention is applied to the control group. One month&#xD;
      after the intervention group got married, the sexual and reproductive health knowledge test&#xD;
      will be applied again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third stage, 4 months after marriage, sexual health-reproductive health knowledge&#xD;
      test, marital adjustment scale, sexual satisfaction scale and sexual self-efficacy scale will&#xD;
      be applied to the intervention group. 4 months after marriage, the data of the marital&#xD;
      adjustment scale, sexual satisfaction scale and sexual self-efficacy scale will be obtained&#xD;
      from the control group via e-mail or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compatibility of the continuous variables to be obtained within the scope of the study to&#xD;
      the normal distribution will be examined with the Shapiro-Wilk test. While mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation is used in the representation of descriptive statistics related to the variables&#xD;
      that conform to the normal distribution, the median (Interquartile Width - MPI; minimum;&#xD;
      maximum) will be given for distorted data, and the number and percentage will be given for&#xD;
      the representation of categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the comparison of numerical variables in the study groups, the appropriate method from the&#xD;
      independent two-sample t-test and the Mann Whitney U test will be used by examining the&#xD;
      necessary assumptions, and the Chi-square test for the comparison of categorical variables.&#xD;
      Comparison of knowledge score before and after will be done with paired two-sample t-test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version&#xD;
      21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) program will be used for statistical analysis and calculations.&#xD;
      The statistical significance level will be accepted as p &lt;0.05 for the hypotheses to be&#xD;
      established bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected with the data collection form. The data colection form consist of five&#xD;
      parts. 1. Introductory Information Form; 2. Sexual and Reproductive Health Knowledge Test; 3.&#xD;
      Marriage Adjustment Scale; 4. The New Sexual Satisfaction Scale: The New Sexual Satisfaction&#xD;
      Scale; 5. Sexual Self-Efficacy Scale:&#xD;
