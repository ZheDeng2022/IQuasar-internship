      The investigators will evaluate the difference between a commonly accepted paradigm of&#xD;
      balance training (BT) and a more dynamic and task specific form of balance training,&#xD;
      perturbation-based training (PBT) in older adults. BT is a key evidenced based strategy for&#xD;
      preventing falls in older adults, however it needs to be regular (2hours/week) and long term&#xD;
      (&gt;6moths) while the average effect is only moderate (24%). The reason for the moderate effect&#xD;
      on falls is like to be the non-specific stimulus presented during BT. That is, training tends&#xD;
      to be quasi-static and slow and largely based on movements described as strength training.&#xD;
      However, when an individual loses balance, they are most often required to implement a rapid&#xD;
      and dynamic response. Furthermore, while older adults who are unable to recover balance well&#xD;
      have generally lower strength, our recent work has demonstrated that it is not their force&#xD;
      producing capability that limits them. Rather it is the ability to access moderate levels of&#xD;
      muscular force very rapidly and early in the recovery step that differentiates successful&#xD;
      versus unsuccessful recovery of balance. Importantly, the ability to produce an effective and&#xD;
      rapid recovery step is predicative of avoiding future real world falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emerging fall prevention training regimen is perturbation-based training (PBT). PBT&#xD;
      involves rapidly disrupting balance requiring the participant to take rapid steps to recover&#xD;
      balance. This is commonly achieved on a laboratory treadmill equipped with a safety harness&#xD;
      to prevent actual falls during training. By simulating &quot;real-world&quot; balance challenges such&#xD;
      as slips and trips, PBT provides a direct means for learning how to recover balance and avoid&#xD;
      falls. It has been demonstrated that with only a few PBT sessions, older adults make rapid&#xD;
      and dramatic improvements in balance recovery performance, retain the skills long-term and&#xD;
      potentially suffer fewer falls over extended periods. This study builds on the previous&#xD;
      published work of the PI that describes the key factors related to differences in balance&#xD;
      recovery performance, the neuro-motor coordination strategies used during successful and&#xD;
      unsuccessful recovery, and currently unpublished pilot studies indicating the efficacy of&#xD;
      PBT. To date studies have not directly compared BT regimes recommended by the American&#xD;
      College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) against PBT, nor have they evaluated the influence of&#xD;
      training on the incidence of real-world falls. In part this may be because PBT currently&#xD;
      requires the use of expensive, laboratory treadmills and as such is not accessible by the&#xD;
      average independent, community dwelling older adults. A specific randomized study is required&#xD;
      and our overall purpose for this study is to compare the balance recovery performance of&#xD;
      older adults following either BT or PBT, evaluate differences in the incidence of real-world&#xD;
      falls, and develop a safe, effective and portable device for use in future community PBT&#xD;
      training studies. The short-term goals are to determine the effect of PBT versus BT and the&#xD;
      neuro-motor mechanism of improved recovery behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate differences in balance recovery behavior in older adults following either&#xD;
      balance training (BT) and perturbation-based training (PBT) and the incidence on real-world&#xD;
      falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Balance recovery performance will improve in both BT and PBT groups but will be&#xD;
      significantly better in those completing PBT when compared to BT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Improvements in balance recovery behavior will be related to improved coordination and&#xD;
      neuro-motor control strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Real world loss of balance events will be similar in both BT and PBT but incidence of&#xD;
      resulting falls will be lower in the PBT group.&#xD;

      APPROACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The main study The main study to investigate the difference between BT and PBT is a&#xD;
      parallel-group randomized controlled trial with 6 months follow-up from baseline to determine&#xD;
      the effect of PBT program on stepping behavior and fall incidence in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      people. The study has been designed in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, recruitment and screening Participants will consist of community-dwelling&#xD;
      adults aged over 65 years without a recent history of falls (one or more falls in the past 12&#xD;
      months). All participants will be required to obtain medical clearance from their general&#xD;
      practitioner prior to participation in the study. Exclusion criteria will be neurological,&#xD;
      cardiovascular or musculoskeletal impairment that adversely affect balance or limit&#xD;
      involvement in the intervention, diagnosis of dementia, cognitive impairment (score&lt;24 on&#xD;
      Mini Mental State Examination after adjustment for age and years of education49), functional&#xD;
      disability/limitation in activities of daily living (Score&gt;3 on Bayer Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living Scale50), osteoporosis, use of medication that affects balance or causes dizziness&#xD;
      (e.g. psychotropics) and participation in supervised exercise one or more times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random allocation and concealment Randomization will be performed following baseline&#xD;
      assessment by personnel not involved in recruitment, training or assessments. Participants&#xD;
      will be informed that they will receive one of two treatments. Due to the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention, research personnel administering the treatments cannot be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation. However, the personnel that perform the prospective falls evaluation will be&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention BT group. This group will undertake 12 weeks of twice weekly BT in accordance&#xD;
      with ACSM guidelines. Training will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of a&#xD;
      trainer. Training will involve mobility, resistance and balance training components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBT group. The PBT protocol uses multi-directional surface translations to provoke rapid&#xD;
      compensatory stepping responses to recover balance. The protocol is a modified version of the&#xD;
      stepping (but not grasping) component of the PBT program described by Mansfield et al., which&#xD;
      was designed to improve rapid stepping reactions and minimize foot collisions in accordance&#xD;
      with well-established principles of motor learning including individualization, specificity,&#xD;
      progressive overload, and variability of training. At each session the PBT group will&#xD;
      experience multi- directional disturbances to standing posture (forwards, backwards, left,&#xD;
      right) delivered via translations of a motorized treadmill. 24 perturbations will be&#xD;
      administered in a random sequence (with variation in timing, magnitude and direction) and&#xD;
      interspersed with 30 s treadmill walking. Successful recoveries during training will be&#xD;
      followed by an increase in the degree of difficulty, whereas consecutive failures will result&#xD;
      in a return to the perturbation intensity that had previously been performed successfully.&#xD;
      Our pilot testing indicates that the prescribed peak accelerations on our motorized treadmill&#xD;
      to within Â±3% can be achieved. The occurrence of actual falls will be prevented via the use&#xD;
      of a custom safety harness attached to an overhead cable instrumented with a force transducer&#xD;
      used previously. One familiarization trial in each perturbation direction will be performed&#xD;
      at 50% intensity at the beginning of the first training session. Training sessions will be&#xD;
      terminated when the participant completes the planned number of trials or if the participant&#xD;
      elects not to continue (e.g. feels tired, uncomfortable or unwell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures The tether-release54 test will be used to determine whether training&#xD;
      effects generalize to balance recovery reactions that are not part of the intervention. Loss&#xD;
      of balance will be induced by releasing participants from static forward lean postures&#xD;
      corresponding to 15%, 20% and 25% of their body weight on a horizontal restraining tether in&#xD;
      accordance with the PI's previous work groups published procedures. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to attempt to regain balance by taking a single, rapid step. Full body kinematics&#xD;
      and ground reaction forces will be recorded during all balance recovery tasks using a 3D&#xD;
      motion capture system (12-camera Motion Analysis) and force platforms embedded in the ground&#xD;
      (AMTI, Watertown, USA). Outcome measures will be margin of stability at touchdown of the&#xD;
      stepping leg, step leg kinematics (step length and velocity) and trunk kinematics (trunk&#xD;
      angle and trunk angular velocity). All analysis will be performed using OpenSim57 in&#xD;
      accordance with the PI's and his previous research units published methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes measures Falls frequency will be monitored over the 3 months of the&#xD;
      intervention and following 3 months of follow up with monthly falls diaries. Participants&#xD;
      will return monthly falls diaries (daily entries) to determine frequency, time, location and&#xD;
      cause of falls and related injuries as per consensus recommendations for falls trials52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed investigation forms the basis of improved understanding of balance recovery&#xD;
      training methods and are important steps for ongoing research into the efficacy of balance&#xD;
      recovery training modes relative to reducing the incidence of falls. In particular, the&#xD;
      proposed study is the necessary precursor to a large prospective study to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of balance recovery training on health and wellbeing of rural Montanans.&#xD;
