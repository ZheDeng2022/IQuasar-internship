  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposed randomized, crossover study is to determine the effect&#xD;
      of 12 weeks of almond consumption, ingested as a snack twice daily, on energy expenditure,&#xD;
      performance and functional related outcomes, in active, overweight, older adults, in&#xD;
      comparison to 12 weeks of an isocaloric matched control snack. The central hypothesis of this&#xD;
      study is, due to the nutritionally beneficial composition of almonds, that daily consumption&#xD;
      of an almond snack for 12 weeks will contribute to improvements in energy expenditure,&#xD;
      physical and functional performance, vascular function, inflammation/oxidative stress, sleep&#xD;
      quality, mood status, and body composition in active, overweight and obese older adults&#xD;
      compared to an isocaloric commercially available snack.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By 2030 it estimated that 20% of individuals in the United States (U.S.) will be 65 years of&#xD;
      age or older, indicating a shift in demographics over the past century. The aging process is&#xD;
      strongly associated with reduced aerobic capacity and functional performance as well as&#xD;
      increases in inflammation and oxidative stress. With differences in the demographic profile,&#xD;
      eating patterns have also changed for Americans within the past 30 years, with a majority of&#xD;
      Americans consuming at least one snack/day; with the types of snacks consumed being processed&#xD;
      foods that are high in refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, and low in fiber. Additionally,&#xD;
      the aging process contributes to decreases in RMR, which can promote alterations in body&#xD;
      composition. Lifestyle modifications have been shown to contribute to beneficial outcomes&#xD;
      associated with aging. Therefore, healthy, nutrient-dense foods are of primary importance for&#xD;
      enhancing functional performance, aerobic capacity, and physical activity as well as&#xD;
      improving vascular function, body composition, and markers of inflammation/oxidative stress&#xD;
      within this growing population. Tree nuts are a nutrient- and energy dense food, which may&#xD;
      contribute to increases in RMR due to their high amounts of poly- and monounsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids affecting diet-induced thermogenesis. Almonds (Prunus dulcis) are an excellent source&#xD;
      of Î±-tocopherol and a good source of monounsaturated fat, magnesium, fiber, and protein. When&#xD;
      compared to other nuts almonds have the greatest amount of fiber and protein. Almond&#xD;
      supplementation has been shown to attenuate age-related decline in aerobic fitness and&#xD;
      physical performance measures. Few studies have assessed how almonds alone affect fitness and&#xD;
      physical function. However, Yi et al. found that in young healthy, endurance trained&#xD;
      individuals, consumption of almonds elevated serum arginine, nitric oxide and TAC, all of&#xD;
      which contributed to improved exercise performance. Constituents of almonds including&#xD;
      L-arginine and magnesium have been shown to increase anaerobic threshold and physical&#xD;
      performance in healthy active older adults respectively . Studies have found that the&#xD;
      incorporation of almonds in a diet can decrease oxidative stress and improve vascular&#xD;
      function. Improvements in both FMD and systolic blood pressure were shown after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      almond consumption in healthy old and young men. L-arginine, an amino acid vital for&#xD;
      synthesis of nitric oxide, which controls vascular tone, is also found in almonds. Almonds&#xD;
      are often cited as a healthy, protein-boosting snack, beneficial for sustaining muscle mass&#xD;
      and metabolism, without increasing fat mass or total energy intake. Additionally, studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that body weight and body mass index (BMI) remain unchanged during almond&#xD;
      supplementation interventions. Almond consumption has also been shown to decrease visceral&#xD;
      fat and body fat percentage. The extent to which daily almond consumption affects functional&#xD;
      performance, aerobic capacity, energy expenditure, vascular function, body composition and&#xD;
      inflammation/oxidative stress in active overweight and obese older adults needs to be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, fifty men and postmenopausal women will follow a randomized-controlled&#xD;
      crossover design. If individuals qualify for participation after the screening visit, they&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a 3-day food record and wear an ActiGraph to track physical&#xD;
      activity and sleeping patterns for the next seven days, to be returned at their Baseline&#xD;
      Study Visit #1. During the Baseline Study Visit #1 assessments of: RMR, body composition&#xD;
      (DXA), vascular assessments (FMD, PWV, PWA, blood pressure), heart rate, anthropometrics&#xD;
      (height, weight, and waist/hip circumference), venous blood draw, POMS, and sleep quality&#xD;
      (PSQI) will be collected. The following day, participants will return for their Baseline&#xD;
      Physical Performance Visit #1 to complete assessments of submaximal aerobic capacity and the&#xD;
      CS-PFP. Following this visit, participants will be provided with 12 weeks of almonds or the&#xD;
      isocaloric snack. Participants will be asked to come in after 6 weeks to receive the rest of&#xD;
      their dietary regimen and to monitor compliance. During week 11, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to come to the study site to be given a 3-day food record and the ActiGraph to be retuned at&#xD;
      the Post-Test Study Visit #1. After 12 weeks, participants will return to FSU to complete&#xD;
      their Post-Test Study Visit #1, which will involve all the same assessments from the baseline&#xD;
      study visit, as well as their Post-Test Physical Performance Visit #1, the next day. After&#xD;
      the 4-week washout period, participants will similarly be asked to complete a 3-day food&#xD;
      record and wear an ActiGraph for the following 7 days, to be returned upon the participants'&#xD;
      Baseline Study Visit #2, where participants will crossover into receiving the corresponding&#xD;
      dietary regimen and will follow the same procedures for the following 12 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      will be compensated a total of $200 if the entire study is completed.&#xD;
