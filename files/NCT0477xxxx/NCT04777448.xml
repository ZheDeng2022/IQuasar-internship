    <textblock>
      Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a new method of treatment for inoperable chronic&#xD;
      thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or persistent CTEPH after surgery. BPA improves&#xD;
      or even normalises hemodynamic parameters measured during a right heart catheterization.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients retain dyspnea and impaired exercise capacity&#xD;
      despite considerable hemodynamic improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (RHB) can improve symptoms, quality of life and exercise capacity in&#xD;
      patients with CTEPH. Unfortunately, access to RHB remains a concern in many countries.&#xD;
      Tele-rehabilitation (tRHB) has been shown feasible and effective some cardiac or pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study aims at comparing the effects of tRHB with the effects of&#xD;
      simple advices regarding exercising in CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamics after BPA treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a complication of pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      leading to dyspnea, effort limitation and sometimes right heart failure and death. Balloon&#xD;
      pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a new method of treatment for inoperable CTEPH or persistent&#xD;
      CTEPH after surgery. BPA restores blood flow in the treated areas and improves or even&#xD;
      normalises hemodynamic parameters measured during a right heart catheterization.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients retain dyspnea and impaired exercise capacity&#xD;
      after angioplasty procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training has been demonstrated to alleviate exercise dyspnea and to improve exercise&#xD;
      capacity in many chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Pulmonary rehabilitation (RHB) can&#xD;
      improve symptoms, quality of life and exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      disease of different etiologies including CTEPH. Furthermore, RHB does not present any&#xD;
      particular risk for CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized pulmonary hemodynamics.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, access to RHB remains a concern in many countries. Tele-rehabilitation (tRHB)&#xD;
      has been shown feasible and effective some cardiac or pulmonary diseases. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that tRHB may also be effective in CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamics after BPA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study aims at comparing the effects of tRHB with the effects of&#xD;
      simple advices regarding exercising in CTEPH patients with normalized or near-normalized&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamics after BPA treatment.&#xD;
