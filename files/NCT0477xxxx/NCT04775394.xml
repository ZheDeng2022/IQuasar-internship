  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to understand whether activation of receptors involved in clearance of apoptotic&#xD;
      cells will improve efferocytosis in COPD patients in vitro and whether generation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines can be decreased in COPD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess pathway activation in COPD macrophages, alveolar macrophages will be&#xD;
      isolated from BAL of COPD patients and healthy controls. Alveolar macrophages will be&#xD;
      co-cultured in vitro with apoptotic cells and treated with compounds. In addition, BAL fluid&#xD;
      will be frozen for later testing of soluble mediators.&#xD;
