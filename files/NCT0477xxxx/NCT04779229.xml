    <textblock>
      The juvenile justice (JJ) system serves over a million cases every year and represents the&#xD;
      primary referral source for treatment of substance use and antisocial behavior in youth.&#xD;
      However, engagement of the JJ population in treatment is alarmingly low; further, rural&#xD;
      communities have neither access to evidence-based practices (EBPs) nor the finances and&#xD;
      treatment infrastructure to support their delivery. However, using an innovation called&#xD;
      task-shifting, juvenile probation/parole officers in rural communities might be able to&#xD;
      deliver a central change mechanism for EBPs (parent activation), with the ultimate goal of&#xD;
      improving JJ youth outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile justice (JJ) is the public service system most impacted by alcohol and other drug&#xD;
      (AOD) use in youth, and outcomes for these youth, their families, and society are grave.&#xD;
      Thus, delivery of effective interventions with JJ youth is of considerable importance. The&#xD;
      evidence-based practices (EBPs) with the strongest outcomes for JJ youth are family-based,&#xD;
      but many communities do not have the resources to support their delivery. This is&#xD;
      particularly true in rural areas where AOD treatment resources are scarce. Further, even when&#xD;
      communities can support a family-based EBP, JJ youth face barriers to treatment&#xD;
      participation. Indeed, JJ youth are routinely referred for treatment, but data indicate less&#xD;
      than 1 in 5 actually receive treatment. Juvenile probation/parole officers (JPOs) are on the&#xD;
      front line of this crisis. This workforce is in every community across the nation and&#xD;
      routinely interfaces with JJ youth to try to achieve positive outcomes. However, JPOs often&#xD;
      face limited options for treatment referrals; further, they do not have the time or training&#xD;
      to deliver one of the full-scale, family-based EBPs. As a consequence, JPOs try to manage the&#xD;
      behavior of their probationers with a small menu of youth-based interventions that have&#xD;
      limited success (e.g., structured sanctions). One strategy for achieving better outcomes in&#xD;
      low-resourced, rural settings that cannot deploy a full-scale EBP, called task-shifting,&#xD;
      involves redistribution of tasks downstream to an indigenous workforce that has less&#xD;
      training. Importantly, reviews indicate that the leading EBPs for JJ youth share a common&#xD;
      change mechanism: activation of parents. Thus, while the family-based EBPs cannot be&#xD;
      task-shifted, perhaps the central change mechanism of these EBPs (parent activation) can be&#xD;
      shifted downstream to enhance JPO practice. JJ leaders already cite improved parent&#xD;
      engagement as a top priority, but it is also one of the most challenging problems facing the&#xD;
      JJ system. Fortuitously, within pediatric healthcare services, there is an effective&#xD;
      intervention called parent activation (PA) comprised of concrete tasks by healthcare service&#xD;
      providers to better engage and motivate parents of at-risk youth. PA has been delivered by&#xD;
      clinicians and also by paraprofessionals. Thus, this healthcare service advance might be&#xD;
      primed for use by JPOs to activate parents and achieve more positive JJ youth outcomes. The&#xD;
      proposed stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial investigates the use and impact of PA by JPOs&#xD;
      across 32+ rural counties. Aims are to: (1) determine the capacity of JPOs to deliver PA&#xD;
      within JJ services, (2) examine impact of PA delivery on de-identified family outcomes, and&#xD;
      (3) examine implementation outcomes, assessed via the Stages of Implementation Completion,&#xD;
      for PA in the JJ service system, including JPO inner context variables that might impact&#xD;
      implementation. In a context where the nation's behavioral healthcare service system is&#xD;
      struggling to meet the needs of JJ youth, JPOs across the nation, and particularly in rural&#xD;
      communities, are positioned to make a large impact via use of an advance from pediatric&#xD;
      healthcare services.&#xD;
