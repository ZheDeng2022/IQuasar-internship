  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is intended to adapt and refine an intervention grounded in the principles&#xD;
      of Dialectical Behavior Therapy, for the treatment of repeat criminal offenders with&#xD;
      antisocial personality disorder. This study will be open to individuals participating in an&#xD;
      intensive supervision program operated by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of&#xD;
      New York (the RISE Court program).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is among the most damaging and costly mental&#xD;
      disorders, yet little research has sought to address the root causes of this disorder.&#xD;
      Indeed, many clinicians consider ASPD to be &quot;untreatable&quot;, and have largely relegated the&#xD;
      management of this challenging disorder to the criminal justice system, effectively&#xD;
      relinquishing responsibility for understanding and treating ASPD. Although a number of&#xD;
      interventions are utilized by the criminal justice system, these interventions have typically&#xD;
      focused on specific problem behaviors, such as anger management and substance abuse. These&#xD;
      interventions, along with the more broad-based approaches occasionally studied (e.g.,&#xD;
      criminal cognitions) focus primarily on cognitive processing, effectively ignoring core&#xD;
      elements of ASPD such as impulsivity and emotion dysregulation. Recently, however, growing&#xD;
      interest has centered on Dialectical Behavior Therapy as a potential intervention approach,&#xD;
      particularly given the emphasis on tangible behaviors and the acquisition of skills to&#xD;
      address the core elements of APSD. The proposed study builds upon an innovative&#xD;
      rehabilitative program developed by the U.S. District Court in New York. Beginning in 2020,&#xD;
      the Fordham Community Mental Health Clinic has provided a DBT-based intervention to&#xD;
      participants in this rehabilitation program. This population is comprised of repeat criminal&#xD;
      offenders who are deemed at high risk for reoffending by the Probation Department, the vast&#xD;
      majority of whom meet diagnostic criteria for ASPD. This intervention, which builds on the&#xD;
      researcher team's past work treating offenders with a history of stalking and intimate&#xD;
      partner violence, has the potential to advance the utility of DBT for treatment of this&#xD;
      challenging population. The present application proposes to advance this goal, by adapting&#xD;
      DBT to target core symptoms of ASPD, including impulsivity, difficulties in emotional&#xD;
      processing, and problem solving deficits. By adapting traditional DBT, this intervention&#xD;
      hopes to demonstrate increased success in retaining and engaging this challenging population&#xD;
      in treatment, decreasing the extent of problematic behaviors, and reducing the rates of&#xD;
      violent and criminal reoffense. Most importantly, this application takes an experimental&#xD;
      therapeutics approach, by identifying potential mediators of successful change in ASPD and&#xD;
      quantifying the extent to which DBT impacts these traits and behaviors. Although DBT is not&#xD;
      expected to &quot;cure&quot; ASPD, even modest improvements in the treatability of this challenging&#xD;
      population would translate into substantial benefits given the high social, economic and&#xD;
      health care costs associated with this disorder. Given these goals, the present application&#xD;
      seeks to a) demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention, b) reduce&#xD;
      problematic character traits and behaviors (e.g., decreased impulsivity, increased emotion&#xD;
      recognition), and c) reduce the rates of re-offending.&#xD;
