  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, dose-escalation, phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of JS004 injection in the patients with advanced solid tumors who have failure&#xD;
      in standard of care and are unable to tolerate standard of care and/or have no available&#xD;
      standard of care. The study is divided into screening period, treatment period, and follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period: Subjects will be included in the screening period after signing the&#xD;
           informed consent form (ICF). The screening period is up to 28 days, subjects will enter&#xD;
           the study treatment period if they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of exclusion&#xD;
           criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period: Subjects will be allocated to the designated dose group to receive&#xD;
           corresponding treatment in accordance with the progress of study. Subjects in dose&#xD;
           escalation phase will receive DLT observation at first, and upon completion of DLT&#xD;
           observation, the subjects will continue their administration at the original dose if&#xD;
           they are tolerated as judged by investigator, until progression of disease, intolerable&#xD;
           toxicity or other reasons specified in the protocol. Subjects in the dose extension&#xD;
           phase receive appropriate study treatment until disease progression, intolerance of&#xD;
           toxicity, or other causes specified in the protocol occur. Response evaluation criteria&#xD;
           in solid tumors (RECIST v1.1) will be used for efficacy evaluation every 9 weeks (±7&#xD;
           days) in the first year and every 12 weeks (±7 days) in the 2nd year and thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period: A safety follow-up visit is required 30 days (±7 days) after the last&#xD;
           dose of study drug or before the initiation of new antitumor therapy. If the new&#xD;
           antitumor therapy has not been initiated, additional safety follow-up should be&#xD;
           completed 90 days (±7 days) after the last dose as far as possible.&#xD;
