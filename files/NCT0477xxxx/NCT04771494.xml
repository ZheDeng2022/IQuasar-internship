  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the speed and power parameters in bench&#xD;
      press training in different degrees of instability: 1) stable (PBE), 2) with asymmetric load&#xD;
      (PBA), 3) with oscillating load (PBO), 4) on fitball (PBF) and 5) on bosu (PBB). For this&#xD;
      purpose, 20 male subjects (10 trained and 10 untrained) with specific experience in training&#xD;
      under unstable conditions were evaluated with respect to mean propulsive velocity (MPV),&#xD;
      maximum velocity (MV) and power (POT) with different types of external load: low load (40% of&#xD;
      1RM), medium load (60% of 1RM) and high load (80% of 1RM) in each condition.&#xD;

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effect of different degrees of&#xD;
      instability on power and speed of execution in the bench press exercise. For the design of&#xD;
      this quasi-experimental research, with an ad hoc protocol, an intersubject comparison was&#xD;
      used in 5 different conditions. 20 male participants were grouped into two groups based on&#xD;
      their previous experience with unstable training and volunteered for this study. Expert group&#xD;
      (n= 10; 23.70 ± 4.30 years; 81.40 ± 9.67 kg; 179.50 ± 8.95 cm; 3.5 ± 4.10 years of strength&#xD;
      training experience; 9 ± 10.60 months of unstable training experience) Novice group (n= 10;&#xD;
      25.60 ± 6.50 years; 77.80 ± 4.44 kg; 176.40 ± 2.80 cm; 3.40 ± 1.96 years of strength training&#xD;
      experience; 0.90 ± 0.99 months of unstable training experience). Subjects with no experience&#xD;
      in training with unstable loads (having implemented unstable loads in their training at some&#xD;
      point) or current or recent injuries (within the last 6 months) that caused them to alter&#xD;
      their normal physical activity were excluded from this study. This study was in accordance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All participants gave written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects performed the bench press exercise by assessing mean propulsive velocity and power&#xD;
      with 3 different loads for each of the unstable situations: light (40% of 1RM), moderate (60%&#xD;
      of 1RM) and high (80% of 1RM). In a familiarisation session, subjects performed the relative&#xD;
      loads with each condition to determine their strength-velocity profiles and their optimal&#xD;
      work percentages. In addition, an incremental load test was performed to determine the 1RM of&#xD;
      each of the participants to determine the external load for each load percentage in each of&#xD;
      the subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Each subject performed 3 repetitions for the light load (40% RM; VMP &gt; 1.0 m/s), with 1 minute rest; 2 repetitions for the medium load (60% RM; 0.65 m/s ≤ VMP ≤ 1.0 m/s) with 2 minutes rest and 1 repetition for the heavy load (80% RM; VMP &lt; 0.65 m/s) with 4 minutes rest. A metronome was used for the start countdown and to time the eccentric and concentric portions of the exercise.&#xD;
Subjects began the bench press with their elbows fully extended, maintaining a grip distance slightly greater than shoulder width. The bar was then lowered to their chest and then applying as much thrust as possible until full elbow extension on a 2-1-0 count. The timing sequence involved 2 seconds for the eccentric phase, a 1 second hold (to minimise the contribution of the rebound effect and allow for more reproducible and consistent measurements) and for the concentric &quot;up&quot; phase the highest possible execution speed, until the bar returned to the starting position.</description>
