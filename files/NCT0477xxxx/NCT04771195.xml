  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central goal of this project is to produce a novel, precise, and comprehensive account of&#xD;
      social factors in young adult mental health - using a novel combination of network&#xD;
      nominations, ecological momentary assessment, and neuroimaging methods. To that end, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect data from two successive classes of college undergraduates (i.e.,&#xD;
      classes of 2023 and 2024) over the course of their collegiate tenure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed work will consist of four key components. The investigators will collect data&#xD;
      from the class of 2023 in each of their remaining years at college, producing (i)&#xD;
      longitudinal data that will allow them to probe the long-term mental health effects of&#xD;
      connections made during the transition to college, as well as mental health issues and&#xD;
      resilience in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as a function of social connectedness. The&#xD;
      investigators will leverage this rich dataset to build (ii) prospective quantitative models&#xD;
      to predict mental health outcomes later in college based on a range of social factors&#xD;
      measured early in college. They will further collect (iii) a longitudinal replication cohort,&#xD;
      the class of 2024, allowing to establish the robustness of their initial findings across&#xD;
      samples. Finally, the investigators will add (iv) a neuroimaging component to this dataset in&#xD;
      a subset of the class of 2024. This will allow them to examine brain &quot;markers&quot; of&#xD;
      connectedness, and add them to a prospective model, providing a novel integration across&#xD;
      brain, behavior, and community levels of analysis, and a synthetic assessment of social&#xD;
      factors in long-term mental health.&#xD;
