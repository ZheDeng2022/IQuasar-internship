    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what amount of physical therapy is beneficial in&#xD;
      the hospital setting after suffering a stroke. This study involves research. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to enroll 150 individuals with acute stroke admitted to MUSC over the&#xD;
      next 12 months and randomize them into increased frequency and usual care PT treatment&#xD;
      groups. This study will be designed as a randomized control trial. If a patient agrees to&#xD;
      participate, they will be assigned (at random) to either a treatment group which will receive&#xD;
      more frequent therapy services or to the control group which will receive the &quot;standard&quot;&#xD;
      amount of therapy services currently provided in the hospital setting (~3-5 times per week).&#xD;
      By studying the balance, walking and success of patients in the treatment group compared with&#xD;
      the control group- the researchers hope to better understand the effect of more frequent&#xD;
      physical therapy services on your independence post stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early mobilization is a widely accepted pillar of acute hospital therapy services. In most&#xD;
      populations, early mobility is regarded as safe, feasible, and yields positive results. A&#xD;
      considerable amount of clinical and scientific literature has evaluated and upheld the&#xD;
      positive effect of early mobility on patient safety, ICU delirium, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, hospital length of stay, functional mobility, ambulation ability, and mortality.&#xD;
      However, most of the research in the field of early mobilization has focused on intensive&#xD;
      care patients with multiple medical comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consideration of an acute stroke diagnosis in relation to the approach of acute care PT&#xD;
      and &quot;early mobility&quot; is limited. The AVERT trial was novel in opening the doors to&#xD;
      considering physical therapy's approach to acute stroke care on these dedicated stroke units,&#xD;
      critical since earlier research surmised that complications of immobility could be estimated&#xD;
      to account for as many as 51% of death in the first 30 days post stroke. The results of the&#xD;
      AVERT trial, however, raised concern that very early mobilization may cause changes in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow and blood pressure leading to worsened stroke outcomes, increased&#xD;
      mortality and increased rate of falls during early mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the publication of the AVERT trial, there has been a rise in clinical interest regarding&#xD;
      the correlation of early mobility and improved functional outcomes post stroke. The majority&#xD;
      of physical therapy studies in the acute stroke population have only examined the optimal&#xD;
      time to begin mobilization post admission to the hospital. This project proposes the idea&#xD;
      that patients with acute stroke may not be able to tolerate an extensive early mobility&#xD;
      program. Instead, patients may benefit from shorter more frequent bouts of therapy early in&#xD;
      their recovery to focus on specific areas such as seated postural control, motor recruitment&#xD;
      strategies, and transfer training delivered in separate sessions. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the approach of shorter, more frequent bouts of quality therapy services&#xD;
      will negate the post stroke fatigue factor. Thus, allowing patients to progress functional&#xD;
      mobility with improved tolerance to therapy sessions, frequent repetition, as well as&#xD;
      implementation of motor learning principles to ensure carryover by providing distributed over&#xD;
      massed practice. The research in the field of neuroplasticity and neuro rehabilitation&#xD;
      illustrates the importance of high intensity, repetitive and aggressive approaches for motor&#xD;
      recovery, however, most of this research has been performed in the subacute stroke&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rather than decreasing the time to upright mobility, it may be beneficial to examine the&#xD;
      effect of short bouts of more frequent mobilization in these patients, within the early&#xD;
      stages of their hospitalization. If, as assumed, a prolonged duration of upright sitting&#xD;
      posture has a negative effect on cerebral blood flow10 it may be possible to gain the&#xD;
      positive effects of early mobility by continuing to provide PT services while combating the&#xD;
      negative effects of cerebral perfusion by returning all patients to a supine position in bed&#xD;
      following therapy services within the first 24 hours of acute stroke. This study aims to&#xD;
      examine the approach of increased frequency of physical therapy services as a way to gain the&#xD;
      benefits of the publicized early mobility approach, while weighing the concerns raised by&#xD;
      previous trials and decreasing amount of time left upright to combat negative effects of&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion on the ischemic penumbra. As part of this study, there will be an&#xD;
      experimental group of participants who will receive PT sessions twice a day for the first&#xD;
      three out of five days of admission, followed by daily treatment sessions at an intensity of&#xD;
      at least 20-50-minute bouts. This group will be compared to a group of control participants&#xD;
      who will receive standard PT services 3-5x/wk (on average 8-23 minutes/session) while in the&#xD;
      acute hospital setting. Outcomes of interest include average length of stay, discharge&#xD;
      disposition, Postural Assessment Stroke Scale &amp; Modified Rankin Scale scores, and rate of&#xD;
      readmission at 30 days. There is a critical need to evaluate how the mobilization approach of&#xD;
      patients with acute stroke during their hospitalization impacts their discharge disposition,&#xD;
      length of stay, and future functional outcomes&#xD;
