  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the ratio between 24h C-peptide urinary excretion rate and&#xD;
      average 24h circulating glucose represent a good correlate of what is measured by the gold&#xD;
      standard, i.e. M (glucose disposal rate) from a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be admitted to the research clinic for a 24-hour stay in a metabolic chamber. During the chamber stay, all urine excreted will be collected to assess C-peptide urinary excretion rate and interstitial glucose will be measured by a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Participants will consume a eucaloric diet (50% carbohydrates, 30% fat and 20% protein).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-65 y&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI between 20 kg/m2 and 35 kg/m2 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are willing to consume pre-prepared meals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have completed a high-dose (≥80 mIU/m2/min) euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp during&#xD;
             the last five years at Pennington Biomedical. The data from the previous PBRC clamp&#xD;
             will be pulled and used in conjunction with data from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to have blood and urine stored for future use&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major lifestyle changes since the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed&#xD;
             (i.e. gain/lost weight, stopped smoking, began/stop exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable weight in the last 3 months [gain or loss &gt;10 lb (or 4.5 kg)]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated hypertension and average screening blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous bariatric surgery (or other surgeries) for obesity or weight loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use of medications affecting metabolism or sleep*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of neurological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiovascular disease, or other chronic diseases, that might affect&#xD;
             pancreatic or glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adherence to special restrained diets (e.g., low-CHO, low-fat, or vegetarian/vegan&#xD;
             diets) over the last 3 months. *Sporadic use of these medications is fine (however,&#xD;
             enrollment will depend on a case-by-case basis). If taking sporadically, participants&#xD;
             should not be taking the medication for 1-month prior to the first visit.&#xD;
