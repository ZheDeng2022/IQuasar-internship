  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess correlations between muscle tone, stabilization of the trunk and&#xD;
      the upper extremity, and parameters of hand/wrist motor coordination in post-stroke patients&#xD;
      and neurologically healthy subjects with lower back pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Luna electromyography (EMG) (EGZOTech) was used to measure muscle tension, and a manual&#xD;
      electronic dynamometer (EH 101) was used for grip strength measurement (error of measurement,&#xD;
      0.5 kg/lb). A Hand Tutor device (composed of a safe and comfortable glove equipped with&#xD;
      position and motion sensors, and the Medi Tutor (TM) software was used to measure the range&#xD;
      of passive and active movement, as well as the speed/frequency of movement. The Hand Tutor&#xD;
      glove was worn on the hand of the directly affected side in stroke patients and on the&#xD;
      dominant extremity in patients with pain syndrome. Surface electrodes (single-use 55' and '40&#xD;
      mm; ECG Electrodes; limited liability company and limited partnership (Sorimex), Poland were&#xD;
      affixed to the subject's body according to the SENIAM (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the&#xD;
      Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) procedure on the transverse abdominal, multifidus, and&#xD;
      supraspinal muscles (on the side directly affected in stroke patients, and on the dominant&#xD;
      side in patients with back pain syndrome). Before each exercise, the subject was instructed&#xD;
      on how the exercise should be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination consisted of two motor tasks, carried out in two different starting&#xD;
      positions: sitting and lying down (supine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first examination, the subject sat on the therapeutic table (without back&#xD;
      support), feet resting on the floor. The upper limb was examined in adduction of the humeral&#xD;
      joint, with the elbow bent in the intermediate position between pronation and supination of&#xD;
      the forearm, with free wrist and the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the supine position, the upper limb was stabilized at the subject's body (adduction in the&#xD;
      humeral joint, elbow flexion in the intermediate position, wrist and hand free).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the starting positions, after putting the glove on, the range of passive movement&#xD;
      in the radial-carpal joint (flexion and extension) and fingers (global flexion and extension)&#xD;
      was measured. Then the subject made active movement in the same order. Finally, the subject&#xD;
      was asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible. Finally, the&#xD;
      measurement of grip strength with a dynamometer was performed in both analyzed starting&#xD;
      positions, after completing the range of motion and speed or frequency tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the range of passive movement in the radial-carpal joint (flexion and extension) and&#xD;
      fingers (global flexion and extension) was measured in each position (sitting or supine)&#xD;
      using the Hand Tutor Device. Then the subject made active movements in the same order.&#xD;
      Finally, the subject was asked to make moves as quickly and in as full a range as possible.&#xD;
      The measurement of grip strength with a dynamometer was performed in both positions (sitting&#xD;
      or supine) after the range of motion and speed/frequency tests. The reaction of the examined&#xD;
      multifidus, transverse abdominal, and supraspinatus muscles (tension values reported in&#xD;
      microvolts (ÂµV) was also assessed during each of the exercise tasks using the surface&#xD;
      electrodes (i.e., during movement of the wrist and during movement of the fingers).&#xD;
