  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almonertinib is a three-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor(EGFR-TKI), which has shown competitive potential in the second-line treatment&#xD;
      against first-generation TKIs. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      different doses of almonertinib in the first-line and second-line treatment of brain&#xD;
      metastases/meningeal metastases in NSCLC patients.&#xD;
