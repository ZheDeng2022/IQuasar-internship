      POEM (per oral endoscopic myotomy) is effective for the treatment of swallowing disorders but&#xD;
      can induce acid reflux. If acid reflux remains untreated in this situation, it can lead to&#xD;
      significant problems. Thus, minimizing abnormal acid exposure after POEM is very important.&#xD;
      Typically, this is done with acid suppression medications such as Prilosec or Nexium.&#xD;
      However, long term acid suppression medication has been linked to possible long-term&#xD;
      complications. Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) has been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of reflux, but its use in reflux after POEM has not been investigated in detail. We&#xD;
      hypothesize TIF will be able to decrease the amount of acid reflux in to the esophagus,&#xD;
      thereby allowing patients to remain off of acid suppression medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled into the study, you will undergo the POEM procedure. 3 months after the&#xD;
      procedure we will assess for abnormal reflux via questionnaires and diagnostic testing as&#xD;
      part of the standard management post POEM. If there is evidence of abnormal reflux, the TIF&#xD;
      procedure will be performed. 3 months after the TIF, you will have similar testing again to&#xD;
      document resolution in abnormal acid reflux.You will be followed for 12 months as part of the&#xD;
      study. If at the 3 month mark, there is no evidence of abnormal reflux, you will neither be&#xD;
      placed on PPI nor undergo TIF and will be followed for 12 months to assess for abnormal&#xD;
      reflux&#xD;

      EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is a safe procedure used extensively to evaluate the&#xD;
      esophagus, stomach and small intestine. With the assistance of the anesthesiology team, we&#xD;
      will put you to sleep partially to minimize discomfort during the insertion of the endoscopy.&#xD;
      This is normally how this procedure is performed and deemed very safe. Potential&#xD;
      complications include breathing problems, holes in the intestine, and bleeding. These occur&#xD;
      very infrequently. In our study, EGD will be used at three checkpoints (all of which are part&#xD;
      of standard of care):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. at the time of POEM to rule out other unusual structural abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at 3 months during measurement of acid exposure in the esophagus via Bravo pH&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3 months after TIF placement (6 months after enrollment and POEM) to document resolution&#xD;
           in acid reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal manometry is a non-endoscopic procedure that involves using a safe numbing cream&#xD;
      to allow passage of the manometry catheter from the nose down to the end of the esophagus.&#xD;
      Different measurements are taken from the catheter and the catheter is then removed. This is&#xD;
      a standard of care procedure in the evaluation of patients with esophageal&#xD;
      motility/swallowing disorders. It will be used in the following settings and all are part of&#xD;
      standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 3 months after POEM as part of standard of care to assess improvement in the swallowing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 3 months after TIF (6 months post POEM) only if swallowing issues reappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bravo pH study is used to assess abnormal acid reflux and is considered gold standard in&#xD;
      identifying the degree of acid reflux. It is standard of care for this procedure to be&#xD;
      performed in patients with suspected acid reflux and post-POEM to assess need for long term&#xD;
      acid suppression. It involves performing an endoscopy first, followed by deployment and&#xD;
      implantation of the Bravo pH capsule into the end of the esophagus. Risks include bleeding,&#xD;
      injury to the esophagus or dislodgment of the capsule. However, these are rare instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POEM Those enrolled into the study will undergo a diagnostic endoscopy at the same allotted&#xD;
      time as the POEM. It will be explained to you in detail but involves endoscopically cutting&#xD;
      the muscle at the end of the esophagus, called a myotomy. It is less invasive than its&#xD;
      surgical equivalent Heller's myotomy, but equally effective. Two endoscopist (one with&#xD;
      extensive experience in POEM and the other with formal training in POEM) will be performing&#xD;
      the actual POEM procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIF The TIF procedure is performed using the FDA approved EsophyX-Z device&#xD;
      (EndoGastricSolutions, Redmond, Wash, USA). It has been shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      management of acid reflux in patients who fail acid suppression therapy or in patients who&#xD;
      would like to avoid long term acid suppression with acid suppression therapy due to the&#xD;
      potential side effects. It involves the use of a flexible suturing apparatus that fits over&#xD;
      the endoscope and is used to create an artificial wrap around the end of the esophagus,&#xD;
      thereby mimicking the effects of the typical surgical wrap. In the right setting it is as&#xD;
      effective as its surgical counterpart but less invasive. Due to the incisionless approach,&#xD;
      patients undergoing TIF experience less discomfort and faster recovery than those undergoing&#xD;
      traditional anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;

        Patients with confirmed indications for POEM (achalasia, jackhammer esophagus, EGJOO,&#xD;
        diffuse esophageal spasm) will be identified as potential study patients. These patients&#xD;
        will undergo objective testing and will be required to complete subjective questionnaires&#xD;
        for achalasia and GERD as part of the standard work up (off of PPI therapy). Additionally,&#xD;
        chart review of their medical records will be conducted for clinical outcomes. These&#xD;
        include: - pre-POEM esophageal manometry and pH testing - GERD-HRQL (separate heartburn and&#xD;
        regurgitation scores) - Eckardt scores - EGD pre-POEM (patients will be assessed for hiatal&#xD;
        hernia as documented by length, diameter, and Hill grade)&#xD;
