  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has increased dramatically in the last&#xD;
      decade. The increasing occurrence of ASD creates an imperative need to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      and efficacy mechanisms of appropriate interventions. Hippotherapy (HPOT) is a treatment&#xD;
      option that has been show beneficial for children with ASD as well as other children with&#xD;
      developmental disorders. The current projects focuses on understanding the mechanisms of HPOT&#xD;
      efficacy and evaluating a short-term HPOT program for children with ASD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has increased dramatically in the last&#xD;
      decade. The latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that 1 in&#xD;
      59 children are being diagnosed with ASD and it is four times more prevalent in boys than&#xD;
      girls. Common treatments for children with ASD are applied behavioral therapy, occupational&#xD;
      and speech therapy, which are used solely or in combination. Hippotherapy (HPOT) is another&#xD;
      treatment option that has been shown to positively impact various aspects of behavior. This&#xD;
      pilot project aims to determine the effects of a 6-week HPOT program on movement and social&#xD;
      behavior of children with ASD and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of why HPOT is&#xD;
      successful for ASD through the coupling of physiological and temperamental responses between&#xD;
      horse and rider. The approach involves examining these skills pre, during, and post HPOT&#xD;
      intervention in children diagnosed with ASD. A group of aged matched children with typical&#xD;
      development will serve as the control group. Innovative measures of physiological coupling&#xD;
      and temperament between horse and rider as well as objective and quantitative measures of&#xD;
      movement and social behavior and caregiver perception will be collected. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that following completion of the proposed study, they will provide the necessary&#xD;
      foundation to understand the mechanisms of HPOT, and thus provide a new framework to test&#xD;
      clinical trials of HPOT and human-animal interaction, and ultimately improve the lives of&#xD;
      those diagnosed with ASD and their families.&#xD;

    <description>Both children with autism spectrum disorder and with typical development will receive a 6 week (once per week) hippotherapy protocol. During the hippotherapy session, the researchers will monitor the heart rate variability of the horse and the rider. Both horse and rider will wear an electrode strap around the upper thorax. Heart rate recordings will be started simultaneously at the beginning of the HPOT session. To assess movement coupling between the horse and rider, five tri-axial inertial sensors (OPAL, APDM, Inc, Portland, OR) will be used. The sensors will collect actively synchronized tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscope data. One inertial sensor will be placed dorsal at the rider's pelvis, one frontal at the top of the forehead, and one frontal at the top of the sternum. The sensors on the horse will be fixed on the back of the horse on the spine level between T8 and T10 and on the head.</description>
