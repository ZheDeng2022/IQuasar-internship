  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to increase patients' knowledge about advance care planning&#xD;
      (ACP) discussions and hospice care for patients with serious illness receiving home-based&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ACP is a process that allows patients to communicate their wishes and preferences or medical&#xD;
      care, when they are seriously ill, to their medical providers. The study investigators would&#xD;
      like to assess whether a home-ACP video can improve patient-clinician communication about&#xD;
      patients wishes for their medical care and lead to more patient-centered care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of a Home-ACP intervention among 500 adult patients&#xD;
      with serious illness receiving medical care at home with the Clover Health House Calls&#xD;
      Program. Study participants will be assigned to one of two groups. In one group, participants&#xD;
      will continue to receive usual care with their home-based care team. In the second group,&#xD;
      participants will continue to receive their usual care with their home-based care team and&#xD;
      also view an ACP video that helps them understand ACP and provides education about ACP and&#xD;
      hospice care.&#xD;
