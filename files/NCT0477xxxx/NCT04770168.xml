    <textblock>
      School-based mental health literacy interventions have been shown to reduce and/or prevent&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and attempts. Most programs to date include an adapted version of Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - the gold standard treatment for youth and adult mood and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. CBT teaches youth about the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and&#xD;
      behaviours, and provides strategies for managing distress. However, there is no established&#xD;
      standard mental health literacy curriculum in Ontario. The investigators developed a&#xD;
      school-based mental health literacy program that uses the third book in the Harry Potter&#xD;
      series ('Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban') to teach students how to cope with&#xD;
      distress through CBT skills. This study will determine whether the Harry Potter-based mental&#xD;
      health literacy curriculum diminishes suicidality in students. The study will also determine&#xD;
      whether the curriculum decreases depression and anxiety symptoms and improves well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-month intervention is a manual-based curriculum which teaches CBT skills in English&#xD;
      class. The website includes video and text-based onboarding to train teachers on all the&#xD;
      lessons. Youth complete online exercises for each unit and teachers follow a manual with&#xD;
      checklists to preserve high fidelity and standardization of core learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating classes will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive the curriculum in the fall&#xD;
      (~Oct-Dec) or the winter (~Feb-Apr). The study will use a stepped-wedge design to introduce&#xD;
      the curriculum to classes sequentially testing whether students who receive it in fall will&#xD;
      improve at mid-year and those in winter will catch up by year-end. The winter group is&#xD;
      included as a &quot;maturational&quot; control to account for changes over the school year that are&#xD;
      independent of the intervention and so that order effects of curriculum delivery can be&#xD;
      tested. For this design, questionnaires will be administered four times throughout the school&#xD;
      year (once before and after each semester), and once more the following year to measure&#xD;
      duration of response. At each timepoint, subjects will complete validated questionnaires&#xD;
      about suicide attempts and self-harm, anxiety, depression, well-being, and health services&#xD;
      usage. Students may also choose to participate in focus groups to collect qualitative data on&#xD;
      their experience with the curriculum. With additional consent (Ontario youth only), we will&#xD;
      also collect aggregate lists of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) numbers for&#xD;
      participating students. These will be provided to the Institute of Clinical Evaluative&#xD;
      Sciences (ICES) who will identify sex, age and pre-existing healthcare utilization matched&#xD;
      controls from regions that do not adopt the curriculum.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence demonstrates that mental health literacy is a critical avenue for primary&#xD;
      prevention of mental disorders as it increases awareness and recognition, decreases stigma,&#xD;
      and encourages help-seeking. The largest mental health literacy study was conducted in&#xD;
      Scandinavia and found that the combination of two lectures, three hours of role-play and an&#xD;
      informational booklet reduced suicidal ideation and attempts after one year by approximately&#xD;
      half in a cohort of more than 2,000 teenagers. The mental health literacy curriculum was the&#xD;
      only intervention that was significantly better than a control group. The intervention has&#xD;
      been piloted in more than 2,000 students in Ontario. The intervention is a 'literature study'&#xD;
      taught over approximately 3 months in which a class reads the book and learns how distress&#xD;
      and depression can manifest. The investigators have conducted two studies - a simple before&#xD;
      and after design with 78 participants and a controlled trial with 200 participants who&#xD;
      received the intervention and 230 wait list controls. Both indicated an intervention effect&#xD;
      on suicide scores as well as improvements on a scale of symptoms of borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder (e.g. emotional dysregulation), and depression and anxiety scores). These early&#xD;
      findings suggest that this intervention may be a unique way of preventing suicidal ideation&#xD;
      and attempts, and improving the mental health of youth across Canada and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether the Harry Potter-based cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy curriculum diminishes suicidality (ideation and attempts) in students who&#xD;
      receive it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that students receiving the curriculum will have a clinically and&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction in rates (≥50%) on a composite measure of a)&#xD;
      self-reported suicidal ideation, and b) self-reported suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the secondary objectives for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether the Harry Potter-based cognitive behavioural therapy curriculum&#xD;
           decreases depression and anxiety symptoms and improves wellbeing immediately following&#xD;
           the curriculum and approximately 6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine student and teacher satisfaction with the Harry Potter-based cognitive&#xD;
           behavioural therapy curriculum&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To create a website which achieves sufficient youth and teacher acceptability and 'youth&#xD;
           friendliness' for widespread implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Students receiving the curriculum will have a clinically and statistically significant&#xD;
           reduction (≥50%) in their presentation to emergency services for self-harm/suicide&#xD;
           attempts according to Ontario health administrative data (held in the Institute for&#xD;
           Clinical Evaluative Services (ICES) repository). This is only applicable to research&#xD;
           participants in Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Students receiving the curriculum will have clinically meaningful, significantly lower&#xD;
           scores (≥25%) on validated instruments for youth depression and anxiety (the Revised&#xD;
           Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale - RCADS), and wellbeing (the Life Problems&#xD;
           Inventory - LPI) immediately after receiving it. Moreover, students will report a&#xD;
           significant improvement (≥25%) on the Coping Scale for Children and Youth (CSCY)&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Students in the first cohort (students who receive the curriculum in the fall semester)&#xD;
           will have clinically meaningful, significantly lower scores (≥25%) on validated&#xD;
           instruments for youth depression and anxiety (the Revised Children's Anxiety and&#xD;
           Depression Scale - RCADS) and wellbeing (the Life Problems Inventory - LPI; Coping Scale&#xD;
           for Children and Youth - CSCY) than the second cohort (students who receive the&#xD;
           curriculum in the winter semester) at the mid-year point, but the two groups will not&#xD;
           differ statistically at year end (i.e. the second cohort will catch up to the first).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There will be no significant difference between mid-year and year-end measures for the&#xD;
           first cohort (i.e., gains will persist at approximately 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Student and teacher scores will both be high (mean ≥6 on 7-point Likert scales) on&#xD;
           satisfaction questionnaires asking the degree to which they think they/their students&#xD;
           benefited from the intervention, enjoyed the intervention, and would recommend it to&#xD;
           others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Student focus group data will reflect that students have experienced a qualitative&#xD;
           improvement in wellbeing, knowledge of mental disorders and resilience following the&#xD;
           curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Teacher interview data will reflect that teachers found the curriculum easy to implement&#xD;
           and useful for imparting both mental health and general literacy to their students.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Students and teachers receiving the curriculum will achieve a mean score of ≥4 per&#xD;
           question on a 5-point Likert-based questionnaire assessing acceptability and&#xD;
           satisfaction as well as positive qualitative feedback.&#xD;
