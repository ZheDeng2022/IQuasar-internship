  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common and harmful chronic liver&#xD;
      disease. NAFLD accounts for 49.3% of the total number of chronic liver disease patients in&#xD;
      China. It is important to effectively prevent and control NAFLD and its related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies show the level of serum uric acid is significantly elevated in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD. Xanthine oxidase is a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism. It is a new therapeutic&#xD;
      target for NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to further confirm that hyperuricemia is a new risk factor for NAFLD&#xD;
      through a large sample prospective study. Furthermore, this study explore whether Xanthine&#xD;
      oxidase (XO), a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism, plays an important role in regulating&#xD;
      NAFLD.&#xD;

      Previous studies show the level of serum uric acid is significantly elevated in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD. In a large cross-sectional study, the researcher were the first to confirm that serum&#xD;
      uric acid level was significantly increased in patients with NAFLD. The results were&#xD;
      published in J Hepatol. Xanthine oxidase is a key enzyme in uric acid metabolism. It is a new&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 200 subjects are enrolled in this study. After the initial screening, the subjects were randomly divided into the control group and the drug treatment group. The control group was given lifestyle intervention at 0-24 weeks, and the experimental group was given febuxostat oral therapy on the basis of lifestyle intervention. If the results showed that the reduction of liver fat content of subjects in the lifestyle intervention combined with febuxostat treatment group was significantly better than that in the lifestyle intervention group alone, the original intervention was continued in the drug treatment group, and the control group was given febuxostat orally on the basis of the lifestyle intervention at 24-48 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
