    <textblock>
      Cervical dysplasia is the precursor of cervical cancer. LEEP and LLETZ are standard surgical&#xD;
      procedures to treat cervical dysplasia. There is no direct head-to-head comparison between&#xD;
      LEEP and LLETZ in the literature regarding oncologic safety, for which complete resection of&#xD;
      the dysplastic lesion (so-called 'in-sano resection') is the most appropriate postoperative&#xD;
      surrogate parameter. Further clinical studies are therefore useful to optimize surgical&#xD;
      therapy for cervical dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study is to compare LLETZ (resection of the dysplastic&#xD;
      lesion including the transformation zone) with targeted resection of the colposcopically&#xD;
      conspicuous lesion only (LEEP) and to compare it with regard to oncological safety (defined&#xD;
      as non-in-sano rate).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      death in women worldwide. Pre-cancerous lesions (dysplasias) are detected by the preventive&#xD;
      smear test at the gynecologist and can thus contribute to a 100% chance of cure if they are&#xD;
      clarified by a colposcopic examination as part of the dysplasia consultation and dysplastic&#xD;
      lesions are then surgically removed if necessary (conization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, there are four different methods by which conization can be performed: Knife&#xD;
      Conization, Laser Conization, Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ) and Loop&#xD;
      Electrical Excision Procedure (LEEP). The first three methods have in common that they aim to&#xD;
      remove the entire transformation zone. The rationale for this is that both the precancerous&#xD;
      lesions and the cervical carcinoma itself originate in the transformation zone of the cervix.&#xD;
      This thesis would support the idea of resecting the lesion while taking the remaining healthy&#xD;
      transformation zone along as a precaution. However, it is clear that with the removal of the&#xD;
      entire transformation zone, healthy tissue is removed in addition to the lesion itself. Any&#xD;
      increase in radicality may increase the complication rate of the procedure, especially with&#xD;
      regard to the most feared long-term complication of preterm birth, because the more cervical&#xD;
      tissue is removed, the higher the risk of subsequent preterm birth. This connection speaks in&#xD;
      favor of the use of LEEP, in which only the visible dysplastic tissue in healthy tissue is&#xD;
      removed in the sense of a radical resection, without at the same time also removing the&#xD;
      entire transformation zone, especially in women who still wish to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the aim of conization is on the one hand to achieve a high level of oncological&#xD;
      safety (low recurrence rate, high R0 resection rate) by resecting sufficient dysplastic&#xD;
      tissue, and on the other hand to avoid excessive tissue resection, because this would&#xD;
      increase the risk of premature birth in a subsequent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct head-to-head comparison between LEEP and LLETZ in the literature regarding&#xD;
      oncologic safety, for which complete resection of the dysplastic lesion (so-called 'in-sano&#xD;
      resection') is the most appropriate postoperative surrogate parameter. In a Pubmed literature&#xD;
      search (search date: February 10, 2021, search terms: conization, LEEP, LLETZ, resection&#xD;
      margin, randomized), no prospective randomized study on this topic was found. Further&#xD;
      clinical studies are therefore useful to optimize surgical therapy for cervical dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study is to compare LLETZ (resection of the dysplastic&#xD;
      lesion including the transformation zone) with targeted resection of the colposcopically&#xD;
      conspicuous lesion only (LEEP) and to compare it with regard to oncological safety (defined&#xD;
      as non-in-sano rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, patients with histologically confirmed CIN II/III will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the two surgical methods. In order to exclude an unwanted influence by&#xD;
      unconsciously different behavior of the patients, the patient will only learn about the&#xD;
      surgical method performed on her after the control examination 6 months postoperatively&#xD;
      (unilateral blinding). The surgeon is not blinded for obvious technical reasons. However, in&#xD;
      case of complications, access to the surgical report and the chosen method is possible at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately postoperatively, the specimen is examined histologically and evaluated with&#xD;
      regard to the depth of the conus and the degree of dysplasia as well as the resection margins&#xD;
      (R0= free resection margin; R1= dysplasia extends to the resection margin) by a pathology&#xD;
      specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an interval of 6-8 months, the first follow-up examination (the so-called &quot;test of&#xD;
      cure&quot;) with PAP smear and HPV test is performed in accordance with the guidelines. The two&#xD;
      groups are compared with regard to normalization of the Pap smear, HPV status and colposcopic&#xD;
      findings (including histology in the case of colposcopic abnormalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with negative HPV test, unremarkable cytology, histology and colposcopy, the&#xD;
      study is terminated. These patients are considered cured and discharged to regular screening&#xD;
      with their established gynecologist. In case of abnormalities, the further procedure is&#xD;
      determined according to the usual clinical criteria in conformity with the guidelines:&#xD;
      clinical control after 3 and/or 6 months or re-conization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary target criteria of the study are, in addition to the intra- and postoperative&#xD;
      complication rate, the pain perception of the patients and the intraoperative blood loss,&#xD;
      also the rate of negative high risk HPV tests after 6-8 months, since a negative HPV test is&#xD;
      generally regarded as evidence of successful treatment. Thus, the negative predictive value&#xD;
      for a negative HPV test after conization ranges from 92% to 100%. Successful therapy usually&#xD;
      results in elimination of the HP virus. Accordingly, a negative HPV test excludes CIN&#xD;
      persistence or recurrence with a high probability. In contrast, a persistently positive HPV&#xD;
      test may be taken as an indication of persistence of dysplasia or as an indicator of&#xD;
      recurrent dysplasia.&#xD;
