  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to reveal the relationship between dietary intake, blood total antioxidant capacity&#xD;
      and disease activity in individuals with AS. This study will include patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      AS who applied to Ankara City Hospital Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital, and a&#xD;
      control group that does not have AS. The sociodemographic characteristics and nutritional&#xD;
      habits and 1-day physical activity status of individuals with AS and healthy persons will be&#xD;
      recorded. Anthropometric measurements of all individuals (such as height length (cm) and body&#xD;
      weight) will be taken. From the height and body weight measurements, the individuals body&#xD;
      mass indexes will be calculated. All parts of the questionnaire for individuals included in&#xD;
      the research will be filled in by the researcher through face-to-face interview technique.&#xD;
      The disease activity score of the individuals in the case group will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      physician. Serum biochemical parameters will be taken from the patient files. In the patient&#xD;
      information system of the control group, above mentioned blood tests will be recorded from&#xD;
      the examinations performed in the last 1 month. Serum total antioxidant and oxidant levels&#xD;
      will be measured in a private laboratory with a tube (5 ml) of blood from all individuals.&#xD;
      The parameters to be examined in blood samples are specific to the study and their cost will&#xD;
      be covered by the researchers.&#xD;

      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that progresses with&#xD;
      inflammation of synovial membranes. The aim of this study is to reveal the relationship&#xD;
      between total dietary phytochemical intake, blood total antioxidant capacity and disease&#xD;
      activity in individuals with AS. This study will include patients diagnosed with AS who&#xD;
      applied to Ankara City Hospital Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Hospital, and a control&#xD;
      group that does not have AS and that meet exclusion criteria. The sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics and nutritional habits, one-day food consumption records and 1-day physical&#xD;
      activity status of AS diagnosed and healthy individuals included in the study will be&#xD;
      recorded with a questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements of all individuals (case and&#xD;
      control) such as height length (cm) and body weight (kg) will be taken. From the height and&#xD;
      body weight measurements, the students' body mass indexes will be calculated from the formula&#xD;
      [weight (kg) / height (mÂ²)]. Waist circumference; The perimeter passing through the middle of&#xD;
      the distance between the lowest costa and crista iliaca superior will be measured by tape&#xD;
      measure. All parts of the questionnaire for individuals included in the research will be&#xD;
      filled in by the researcher through face-to-face interview technique. The disease activity&#xD;
      score (ASDAS) of the individuals in the case group will be evaluated by the physician. Serum&#xD;
      biochemical parameters (complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, liver function tests,&#xD;
      urea, creatinine, lipid profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein) will be&#xD;
      taken from the patient files. In the patient information system of the control group,&#xD;
      complete blood count, fasting blood sugar, liver function tests, urea, creatinine, lipid&#xD;
      profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and c-reactive protein levels will be recorded from&#xD;
      the examinations performed in the last 1 month. Serum total antioxidant and oxidant levels&#xD;
      will be measured in a private laboratory with a tube (5 ml) of blood from all individuals.&#xD;
      After the blood samples are centrifuged, 0.5 ml will be separated into eppendorfs. Samples&#xD;
      will be stored in a -80 degree refrigerator in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital. Total antioxidant and oxidant capacity measurement will be done in a private&#xD;
      laboratory in Ankara in the form of service procurement by Erel method. Samples for total&#xD;
      antioxidant and oxidant analysis will be sent to the relevant laboratories in dry ice. The&#xD;
      parameters to be examined in blood samples are specific to the study and their cost will be&#xD;
      covered by the researchers.&#xD;
