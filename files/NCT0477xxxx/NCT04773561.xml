  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been known that a pregnant women undergoes significant anatomical and physiological&#xD;
      changes that mainly caused by hormonal and hematologic changes during pregnancy. Due to&#xD;
      advance in reproductive medicine, the incidence of multifetal pregnancy was increased to 3%&#xD;
      of livebirth. Multifetal pregnancies produce much more physiological changes in the body&#xD;
      compared to the singleton pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic ocular changes during pregnancy are the followings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanogenesis of eyelid and facial skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cellular alteration of lacrimal and meibomian gland&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased corneal thickness and corneal curvature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased lens thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased retinal vascular density&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased choroidal thickness Decreased intraocular pressure -&#xD;

      From the literature review, there was only on study of ocular changes in twin pregnancies.&#xD;
      Alim et al evaluated the choroidal and retinal thickness in singleton versus twin&#xD;
      pregnancies. They included 20 single and 20 twin pregnant women in their 3rd trimester with&#xD;
      20-age-matched healthy non-pregnant women as a control group. They found that there was an&#xD;
      increase in choroidal thickness in the 3rd trimester of pregnancies and it was prominent in&#xD;
      twin pregnancies. There was a statistically significant difference in choroidal thickness&#xD;
      between pregnant and non-pregnant women, but not significant difference between singleton and&#xD;
      twin pregnancies. The mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was significantly higher in&#xD;
      the twin pregnancy group than in the singleton pregnancy group. However, no study of retinal&#xD;
      vascular density in twin pregnancies has been published before.&#xD;
