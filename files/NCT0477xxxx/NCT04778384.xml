  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric, uncontrolled before / after study to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient&#xD;
      education for oncological patients by nursing staff to promote self-management in pain&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structured patient education (in the form of a micro-training) is intended to&#xD;
      specifically promote pain self-management in oncological patients. In contrast to&#xD;
      conventional training courses, this requires the patient to be actively involved in the&#xD;
      process so that the skills learned can be used to optimally adapt the therapy on an&#xD;
      individual level. Through the intervention, we postulate the advantage that the increased&#xD;
      self-management of pain therapy improves the everyday functions of the patient, and by&#xD;
      breaking down patient-related barriers and checking the accessibility of pain medication, the&#xD;
      safety in dealing with pain therapy and thus patient satisfaction increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected in two time series. First, data of patients with sham intervention (control&#xD;
      intervention) is collected, then data is collected from patients with a structured&#xD;
      micro-training (study intervention). Patients do not know which training series they belong&#xD;
      to.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing staff is trained to conduct the micro-training. The sham intervention is unstructured&#xD;
      at the discretion of the respective nurse. They are only informed about the purpose of the&#xD;
      sham intervention, the expected time frame and the course of a sample sham intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the data collection of the group with control intervention is started until the&#xD;
      required number of patients is recorded. As soon as these data are complete, the group with&#xD;
      study intervention is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are recruited from the oncological outpatient clinics. After the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics before a parenteral therapy, they have a waiting period, during which the patient's&#xD;
      consent is obtained. The patients are then taken to the intervention room for parenteral&#xD;
      therapy. Here, the questionnaire is filled out before, during or after the therapy, and then&#xD;
      the intervention with the nurse takes place. This process with a short reflection period must&#xD;
      be designed in such a way because the indication for escalation of the opioid pain treatment&#xD;
      is made during the oncological consultation which is the only possibility to recruit patients&#xD;
      for this pilot study. The way the clinic runs today, the nursing staff is timewise only&#xD;
      available for training patients with parenteral therapy. If the patients needed more time to&#xD;
      think about it, they would have to be trained separately at a later point in time, which&#xD;
      would only be established if the effectiveness of the patient training could be proven.&#xD;
      Because the patients are not exposed to any risk from the planned interventions, this&#xD;
      procedure is reasonable in our view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In micro-training (study intervention), patients are taught structured knowledge based on the&#xD;
      content of a checklist. In addition to pain recording, patients are trained in the use of&#xD;
      basic and reserve pain medication and co-analgesics, the most common opioid side effects are&#xD;
      discussed and how to react to them. It is also checked that the necessary prescriptions or&#xD;
      medication have been given. Furthermore, after completing the BQII Barriers Questionnaire&#xD;
      (second part of the questionnaire), patient-related barriers, i.e. concerns or fears of the&#xD;
      patient with regard to pain therapy, become apparent. With a factual discussion and a&#xD;
      professional weighing of advantages and disadvantages, the nurse tries to break down these&#xD;
      barriers and thus promotes the patient's motivation for a well-adapted pain therapy. In the&#xD;
      case of sham intervention (control intervention), there is only a conversation between the&#xD;
      nurse and the patient. In this conversation the patient is picked up with his current&#xD;
      knowledge about his pain therapy and any questions are answered correctly. However, there is&#xD;
      no structured transfer of knowledge in the sense of patient training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is recorded using a three-part questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire&#xD;
      contains questions regarding pain-related restrictions in everyday activities (using the&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory as the standard for pain assessment of oncological patients as used by&#xD;
      the Swiss Cancer League). The second part of the questionnaire deals with patient-related&#xD;
      barriers using the BQII Barriers Questionnaire. The third part of the questionnaire consists&#xD;
      of global questions: confidence in dealing with pain medication, satisfaction with pain&#xD;
      therapy, restriction of the most important activities in everyday life and satisfaction with&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks after the intervention, patients are asked to fill in the same three-part&#xD;
      questionnaire again. At that time, the questionnaire is sent to them by mail with a reply&#xD;
      envelope.&#xD;
