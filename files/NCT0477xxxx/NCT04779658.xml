    <textblock>
      In recent years, several symptoms have been attributed to Essure, including pelvic pain and&#xD;
      other general symptoms. Consequently, an increasing number of patients request Essure removal&#xD;
      for alleged adverse reactions to the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: To evaluate the quality of life of patients who underwent Essure_ device&#xD;
      removal and morbidity of this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Setting: Academic hospitals of La Conception,&#xD;
      Marseille, and Arnaud-de-Villeneuve, Montpellier, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Women who underwent Essure_ device removal by salpingectomy, between February 2017&#xD;
      and August 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : The following information have been collected during preoperative clinics:&#xD;
      demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms attributed to the Essure device, time&#xD;
      between Essure sterilization and early symptoms, time between the beginning of symptoms and&#xD;
      surgical removal. Follow-up visits have benne scheduled at one month and three months&#xD;
      post-operation. The evolution of symptoms was collected during the follow-up visit at three&#xD;
      months based on clinical reports and a dedicated questionnaire. Evaluation of Quality of life&#xD;
      have been evaluated thanks to SF36 and HAD questionnaires. Alle these patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone call to assess to evolution of symptoms and to complete SF 36 and HAD&#xD;
