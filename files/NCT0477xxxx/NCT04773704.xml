  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with infectious pneumonitis, the FILMARRAY® Pneumonia Plus Panel technique&#xD;
      (multiplex PCR) on a respiratory sample makes it possible to identify the responsible&#xD;
      pathogen and its resistance to antibiotics in less than an hour and therefore to quickly&#xD;
      adapt the anti- infectious. FILMARRAY® Pneumonia Plus has been validated on two types of&#xD;
      specimens from adult intubated patients, tracheal aspirations and bronchoalveolar lavage. It&#xD;
      has not been validated on protected distal samples which are nevertheless used in current&#xD;
      practice. This project will study the diagnostic validity of this technique performed on this&#xD;
      type of sample. If the validity is demonstrated, this will allow this technique to be used on&#xD;
      the protected distal sample which is a reliable sample and used in the context of respiratory&#xD;
      infections, in particular acquired under ventilation in children (bronchoalveolar lavage is&#xD;
      less easy and little used in practice in children).&#xD;

      In patients with infectious pneumonitis, the FILMARRAY® Pneumonia Plus Panel technique&#xD;
      (multiplex PCR) on a respiratory sample makes it possible to identify the responsible&#xD;
      pathogen and its resistance to antibiotics in less than an hour and therefore to quickly&#xD;
      adapt the anti- infectious. FILMARRAY® Pneumonia Plus has been validated on two types of&#xD;
      specimens from adult intubated patients, tracheal aspirations and bronchoalveolar lavage. It&#xD;
      has not been validated on protected distal samples which are nevertheless used in current&#xD;
      practice. This project will study the diagnostic validity of this technique performed on this&#xD;
      type of sample. If the validity is demonstrated, this will allow this technique to be used on&#xD;
      the protected distal sample which is a reliable sample and used in the context of respiratory&#xD;
      infections, in particular acquired under ventilation in children (bronchoalveolar lavage is&#xD;
      less easy and little used in practice in children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, this will allow a faster etiological diagnosis and adapted antibiotic therapy,&#xD;
      guaranteeing better efficacy and a fairer antibiotic prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently no studies concerning the FILMARRAY® Pneumonia Plus Panel are ongoing or have been&#xD;
      performed with the protected distal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be innovative and unique in looking at its feasibility and validity on a&#xD;
      type of sample used in current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the use of a PCR-based technique allows a rapid microbiological diagnosis of&#xD;
      lower respiratory infections under invasive mechanical ventilation, compared to the reference&#xD;
      technique requiring 48 to 72 hours to give a definitive result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This much shorter period allows for an appropriate antibiotic therapy early in the treatment,&#xD;
      and potentially a reduction in ventilation and hospitalization times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it detects antibiotic resistance genes allowing rapid identification of&#xD;
      multi-resistant bacteria (resistant Staphylococcus aureus meticillin, enterobacteria&#xD;
      producing ESBLs or carbapenemases) and thus adapting antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will assess its diagnostic validity for the identification of the microorganisms&#xD;
      responsible for pneumonia in intensive care and their resistance to antibiotics.&#xD;
