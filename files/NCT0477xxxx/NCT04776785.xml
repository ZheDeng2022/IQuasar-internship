  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled, double-blinded, split-mouth clinical trial was to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of self-assembling peptide P11-4 solution (Curodont™ Repair) with&#xD;
      fluoride varnish on the progression of non-cavitated proximal caries compared to casein&#xD;
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) with fluoride varnish (MI Varnish™)&#xD;
      sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish (Profluorid® Varnish).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 300 permanent molars belonging to 150 children, aged between 7 to 13 years&#xD;
      old, who had two non-cavitated proximal carious lesions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the subjects were randomly allocated to three main groups with 50 individuals in each.&#xD;
      Then the carious lesions belonging to each subject were randomly assigned to two subgroups&#xD;
      based on different treatment agents used: Group 1; P11-4+NaF/NaF, Group 2;&#xD;
      P11-4+NaF/CPP-ACP+NaF, Group 3; CPP-ACP+NaF/NaF. Accordingly, test 1 lesions received&#xD;
      P11-4+NaF combination, test 2 lesions received CPP-ACP+NaF varnish, and control lesions&#xD;
      received NaF varnish alone. At the 6th and 12th months after the clinical applications,&#xD;
      Profluorid® Varnish application was repeated for test 1 and control lesions, and MI Varnish™&#xD;
      application was repeated for test 2 lesions. At the end of the 12 months, carious lesion&#xD;
      progression status was evaluated radiographically, by using independent visual reading,&#xD;
      pair-wise visual reading, and digital subtraction radiography (DSR) methods.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Curodont™ Repair</intervention_name>
    <description>It is a product used in biomimetic remineralization of initial carious lesions. The product consists of &quot;smart&quot; P11-4 peptide molecules (CUROLOX® TECHNOLOGY) that within the lesion the molecules self-assemble to a 3D matrix. This bio-matrix enables the regeneration of the tooth tissue.&#xD;
Test 1 lesions will be cleaned with a prophylaxis paste and isolated with cotton rolls. Then, the pellicle will be removed using 2% sodium hypochlorite (20 sec) and the inorganic deposits will be removed using 35% phosphoric acid (20 sec). The tooth surface will be rinsed with water and dried. Thereafter, Curodont™ Repair will be applied in compliance with the manufacturers' instructions and left for 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>MI Varnish™ is a 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish that has a desensitizing action when applied to tooth surfaces. The product also contains RECALDENT™ (CPP-ACP): Casein Phosphopeptide-Amorphous Calcium Phosphate. The application leaves a film of varnish on tooth surfaces and also facilitates the tooth remineralization.&#xD;
Test 2 lesions will be isolated with cotton rolls. Then, MI Varnish ™ will be applied as a thin layer in equal thickness with a disposable brush in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions. Thereafter, the tooth surface will be moistened with water or saliva to ensure that the material adheres to the applied area.</description>

    <description>Profluorid® Varnish is a 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish for surface application to enamel and dentin. The product will adhere to wet surfaces and is tolerant to moisture and saliva. Profluorid® Varnish is an ethanolic suspension of colophony with artificial flavors and sweetened with xylitol. It is also used in the remineralization of initial caries.&#xD;
Control lesions will be isolated with cotton rolls. Then, Profluorid® Varnish will be applied as a thin layer in equal thickness with a disposable brush in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.
