      Objectives: The aim of this study is; detection of peptidyl arginine deiminase4 (PAD4),&#xD;
      galectin-3 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)&#xD;
      samples of periodontally healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis patients and the possible&#xD;
      correlation between these values and clinical parameters of periodontal diseases. Materials&#xD;
      and methods: Samples of GCF were obtained from 60systemically healthy non-smoker individuals&#xD;
      with periodontitis (P, n=20), gingivitis(G, n=20) and healthy periodontium (S, n=20).&#xD;
      Full-mouth clinical periodontal measurements including probing depth (PD), clinical&#xD;
      attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI)&#xD;
      were also recorded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine PAD4,&#xD;
      galectin-3 and TNF-α levels in the biological samples.&#xD;
