  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a positive sign of upper motor neuron syndrome. The frequency of spasticity&#xD;
      development in patients with stroke is 38%. Spasticity is one of the important factors that&#xD;
      negatively affect the rehabilitation potential and functional recovery of the patient. In the&#xD;
      treatment of spasticity, oral antispasticide drugs, phenol, ethyl alcohol, botulinum toxin,&#xD;
      and chemical nerve and motor point blocks, physical therapy, and rehabilitation, surgical&#xD;
      methods are used. In the physical therapy rehabilitation program of spasticity, stretching&#xD;
      and strengthening exercises, cold application, warm application, ultrasound therapy,&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, biofeedback, extracorporeal shock therapy are used. Stretching&#xD;
      exercises are the cornerstone of spasticity treatment. In many clinical and experimental&#xD;
      studies, a decrease in spasticity has been noted after stretching exercises. It has been&#xD;
      stated that the application of cold or hot applications before stretching may increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of spasticity treatment. The study comparing the effectiveness of hot and cold&#xD;
      treatment applied before stretching exercises clinically and ultrasonographically has not&#xD;
      been found in the literature. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of clinical and&#xD;
      ultrasonographic comparison of the effect of hot and cold treatment on spasticity before&#xD;
      stretching exercises in patients with stroke. This study is unique because it is the first&#xD;
      study that evaluates the effect of hot and cold applications on spasticity before the&#xD;
      stretching.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized and controlled study. 30 patients will be included to study who&#xD;
      apply to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of spasticity after stroke, aged between 18-75&#xD;
      years. These patients will be divided in three groups randomly (group1 n:10, group 2 n:10,&#xD;
      group 3 n:10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First group: 20 minutes of hot pack application to the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Then the&#xD;
      patient will do stretching exercises to the gastrocnemius muscle, which will be done for 20&#xD;
      minutes. In hot pack for hot application; While the patient is lying in a prone position, a&#xD;
      warm package, a towel between the skin and the skin will be applied on the gastrocnemius&#xD;
      muscle and applied for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second group: 20 minutes to apply a cold pack to the medial gastrocnemius muscle, followed by&#xD;
      stretching the patient for 20 minutes to the gastrocnemius muscle. The cold pack is available&#xD;
      for cold application; While the patient is lying in a prone position, a cold pack will be&#xD;
      placed on the gastrocnemius muscle, and a towel will be applied for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third group: 20 minutes of stretching and stretching exercises will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stretching exercises, stretching will be done for 30 seconds. The stretching exercise will&#xD;
      be performed by the same physiotherapist with maximal tension to the ankle in the supine&#xD;
      position of the patient in the hip and knee extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These applications will continue as 5 sessions. Evaluations will be made before treatment,&#xD;
      immediately after the first session and at the end of the 5th session. All patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated for 3 times, before and after treatment and 5 session after the treatment with&#xD;
      ultrasonographic measurements, ankle range of motion and spasticity degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hotpack and cold pack applicatios on&#xD;
      Madial gastrokinemius ultrasonographic changes. For this purpose, medial muscle fascicule&#xD;
      length, pennat angle and achilles tendon length with ultrasonographic measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim is evaluating the effect of hot and cold pack on spastisity and ankle range of&#xD;
      motion. Spastisity will be measured by Aschwort scale and range of motion will be measured by&#xD;
      goniomertry.&#xD;
