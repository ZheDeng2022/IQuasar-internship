  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to estimate the efficacy and safety of systemic therapy sequenced radical&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with synchronous isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with synchrnous isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      receiving systemtic therapy (at most two lines), radiologically assessed efficacious, and&#xD;
      assessed by MDT that are potential to reach no evidence of disease (NED) were included in our&#xD;
      trial. All included patients receive para-aortic lymph node dissection.&#xD;

             bone were presen and in instances when the renal vein was in the upward spread path of&#xD;
             the LN metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
