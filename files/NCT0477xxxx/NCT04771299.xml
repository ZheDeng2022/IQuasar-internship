  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with bipolar disorder show broad cognitive impairments (e.g. difficulty with&#xD;
      concentration, problem solving, memory etc.) that persist during euthymia (no symptoms of&#xD;
      depression or mania) despite remission of mood symptoms. Cognitive deficits (significant&#xD;
      cognitive impairments) in bipolar disorder are associated with impairments in everyday&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life. Thus, improving cognitive functioning is an important&#xD;
      treatment goal in people with bipolar disorder. In a recent study, investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated that lurasidone; an atypical antipsychotic was more effective than treatment as&#xD;
      usual in improving cognition. The study will examine the efficacy of Cariprazine (VRAYLAR®)&#xD;
      in improving cognition in patients with bipolar disorder. Cariprazine is a novel atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia, manic or mixed, and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder. This study is a randomized (like the flip of a coin), double-blind (participant and&#xD;
      the study team will not know which treatment arm participant will receive) study in which 30&#xD;
      participants will be randomized across two sites in Canada.&#xD;

      Specific Procedures: If participant agrees to take part in this study, the procedures and&#xD;
      visits include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: (approximately 3.0 hours):Prior to any procedures being conducted, the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form will be reviewed with participant in detail and participant will have&#xD;
      the opportunity to decide if s/he wish to participate in the study or not. If participant&#xD;
      meets all the requirements and all of participants questions have been answered, participant&#xD;
      will be asked to sign the consent form. A clinical assessment will take place, where&#xD;
      participant will be asked questions about participants medical and psychiatric history&#xD;
      including family psychiatric history and prior treatments. Participants medical records may&#xD;
      be reviewed to confirm diagnosis and treatment history. The study doctor will complete rating&#xD;
      scales to determine the current status of participants mood. Participant may choose not to&#xD;
      answer any questions that participant is uncomfortable with. Neurocognitive tests (i.e.,&#xD;
      paper and pencil tests of memory, problem solving etc. as well as a computer component) will&#xD;
      be conducted to determine if cognitive impairment exists. If there is no cognitive impairment&#xD;
      no further procedures will be conducted. The information that is collected from the&#xD;
      participant will not be used for any purpose other than stating how many people were screened&#xD;
      for study participation. If cognitive impairment does exist, participant will be scheduled to&#xD;
      return to the clinic within 4 weeks and a baseline visit will be completed. In addition to&#xD;
      the above procedures, participant will also have a physical examination, which includes&#xD;
      measurement of participants height, weight and blood pressure. To ensure safety of&#xD;
      participation in the study, participant will be asked to have routine clinical blood work,&#xD;
      including a pregnancy test for female participants of childbearing age, and a urine test for&#xD;
      a drug screen. If participant has a personal or family history of significant cardiac&#xD;
      problems or show cardiac abnormalities on the physical exam an EKG will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit (approximately 3-3.5 hours): At baseline, rating scales and clinical&#xD;
      assessment will be completed to determine the current status of participants mood.&#xD;
      Information about participants current medications and any side effects will be obtained. If&#xD;
      participant is not eligible, participants will not be randomized into the study and no&#xD;
      further procedures will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is eligible, participant will be randomized to receive either cariprazine or&#xD;
      placebo in addition to participants current medications, and instructed on dosing.&#xD;
      Participant will complete more neurocognitive testings. The use of benzodiazepines (Ativan,&#xD;
      Lorazepam etc.) within 4 hours or caffeine intake 2 hours prior to neurocognitive testing is&#xD;
      not allowed. Participant will be asked to complete questionnaires about participants&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life. Vital signs and weight measurements will be obtained. Study&#xD;
      medication will be dispensed to last until the next clinic visit. Participant must bring the&#xD;
      remaining unused medication to the next appointment. Participant is asked to give 1.5&#xD;
      tablespoons (20 ml) of blood to analyze markers which may be predictive of bipolar disorder&#xD;
      (biomarkers). Biomarkers are substances (like proteins, protein particles, or chemicals that&#xD;
      make body function) that may be altered in those with bipolar disorder or may provide&#xD;
      information about treatment response. These samples will be labelled with a unique study&#xD;
      number and will not contain any identifying information. The samples will be stored at the&#xD;
      study site until they are sent for analysis at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2 and 4: (approximately 15 minutes each): Participant will be contacted by telephone&#xD;
      to review any changes to participants medications and any side effects that may be&#xD;
      experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 3 Clinic appointment: (approximately 1 hour) : A clinical assessment will take place,&#xD;
      where participant is asked questions about their mood. Information about participants current&#xD;
      medications and any side effects will be obtained. Vital signs and weight measurements will&#xD;
      be obtained. Bottle-1 of the study medication will be collected and bottle-2 of study&#xD;
      medication will be dispensed. Participant will be asked to bring the remaining unused study&#xD;
      medication from bottle-2 to the next clinic appointment. Participant will be asked to give a&#xD;
      tablespoon (15 ml) of blood to test for levels of study medication. The samples will be&#xD;
      labelled with a unique study number and will not contain any identifying information. The&#xD;
      samples will be stored at study site until they are sent for analysis at the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6/ Early Termination Visit: (approximately 3 hours): A clinical assessment will take&#xD;
      place where participant will be asked questions about their mood. Neurocognitive testing will&#xD;
      be administered to all participants who have had a minimum of 3 weeks of double- blind&#xD;
      treatment. Participant is asked to complete some questionnaires about participants&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life. Information about participants current medications and any&#xD;
      side effects will be obtained. Vital signs and weight measurements will be obtained.&#xD;
      Participant will have a physical examination and will be asked to complete routine laboratory&#xD;
      tests including a pregnancy test for female participants of childbearing age, and a urine&#xD;
      drug screen. In addition, participant is asked to give 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of blood to&#xD;
      measure levels of study medication, and biomarkers. These samples will be labelled with a&#xD;
      unique study number and will not contain any identifying information. The samples will be&#xD;
      stored at study site until they are sent for analysis at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Telephone Assessment (2 weeks after study completion; approximately 15 minutes):&#xD;
      Participant will be contacted by telephone to assess any side effects or issues post&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
