  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults diagnosed with metastatic cancer commonly experience depression and anxiety symptoms,&#xD;
      which can interfere with advance care planning. This randomized clinical trial evaluates a&#xD;
      novel, piloted, primary palliative care intervention that addresses advance care planning and&#xD;
      psychosocial needs of patients with metastatic cancer. The intervention focuses on patients&#xD;
      with elevated anxiety and depression (anx/dep) symptoms-those with highest psychosocial needs&#xD;
      who may be at greatest risk for advance care planning non-completion. The intervention is&#xD;
      founded on an evidence-based intervention approach known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) that reduces distress and promotes behavior change through theory-driven mechanisms. In&#xD;
      the proposed randomized trial, M-ACT will be compared to a usual care control condition. The&#xD;
      study will also assess the association between advance care planning and anx/dep symptoms,&#xD;
      thereby informing the critical practice question of whether anx/dep symptoms should be&#xD;
      addressed concurrently with advance care planning. The study will enroll patients with Stage&#xD;
      IV solid tumor cancer (N=240) within Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers, randomized 1:1 to M-ACT&#xD;
      or usual care. The study aims to: 1) Evaluate the hypothesis that M-ACT will increase advance&#xD;
      care planning completion (primary outcome) and sense of life meaning, and reduce anx/dep&#xD;
      symptoms and fear of dying relative to usual care control. 2) Assess the association between&#xD;
      anx/dep symptoms and advance care planning at baseline and over time, testing the hypothesis&#xD;
      that decreases in anx/dep symptoms at post- intervention will be associated with increases in&#xD;
      advance care planning at follow-up. 3) Assess M-ACT's hypothesized mechanisms to specify how&#xD;
      the intervention works (exploratory aim). Given their advance care planning and psychosocial&#xD;
      needs, and poor access to palliative care, rigorously investigating M-ACT has the potential&#xD;
      to benefit community patients with metastatic cancer and to advance palliative care science&#xD;
      by addressing gaps in novel approaches, foundational knowledge, and the scalable delivery of&#xD;
      palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the in-person group component of M-ACT has currently&#xD;
      been shifted to an online group format.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an innovative, multi-modal palliative care intervention that&#xD;
      addresses the lack of advance care planning (ACP) and unmet psychosocial needs commonly&#xD;
      experienced by patients with metastatic cancer. Up to half of adults with metastatic cancer&#xD;
      report elevated anxiety or depression symptoms, which can cause withdrawal from daily&#xD;
      activities and future planning and have been linked to non-adherent health behaviors in other&#xD;
      disease populations. However, little is known about the extent to which anxiety or depression&#xD;
      influence ACP completion in palliative care. In addition, metastatic cancer triggers&#xD;
      patients' fear of dying and threatens their sense of meaning. The current approach aims to&#xD;
      optimize two core palliative care outcomes - ACP and psychosocial well being - in outpatient&#xD;
      oncology settings and to build the evidence base for primary palliative care interventions.&#xD;
      This new multimodal intervention, which is based on extensive pilot data, uses a primary&#xD;
      palliative care approach and focuses on patients with elevated anxiety or depression&#xD;
      (anx/dep) symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based&#xD;
      approach to reduce distress and promote behavior change through theorized mechanisms that&#xD;
      include cultivating acceptance of internal experience and aligning behavior with personal&#xD;
      values. A pilot study for adults with metastatic cancer and elevated anx/dep symptoms&#xD;
      conducted by the current research team, leveraged ACT to design and refine the multi-modal&#xD;
      ACT intervention (M-ACT) in response to patient and provider feedback. M-ACT helps metastatic&#xD;
      cancer patients to live meaningfully and face the future no matter what their health status,&#xD;
      supports their engagement in ACP and addresses their psychosocial needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate future scalability, M-ACT uses a novel multi-modal delivery structure&#xD;
      comprising both in-person group sessions led by existing on-site clinical social workers and&#xD;
      self-paced, personalized online sessions completed at home, which efficiently increase&#xD;
      intervention dose without increasing patient travel or provider demands. The current&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will rigorously evaluate the ability of M-ACT to increase ACP&#xD;
      (primary outcome) and improve psychosocial outcomes (secondary). This study also will&#xD;
      evaluate the relationship between anx/dep symptoms and ACP to inform the critical clinical&#xD;
      question of whether anx/dep symptoms should be addressed concurrently with ACP. Finally, the&#xD;
      study will explore mechanisms that may explain how M-ACT influences ACP and the targeted&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients with stage IV solid tumor cancer (N = 240), randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to M-ACT or usual care for a 4-week intervention period. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, mid-intervention (to assess mechanisms), 1-week post-intervention, and 2-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the in-person group component of M-ACT has currently&#xD;
      been shifted to an online group format.&#xD;
