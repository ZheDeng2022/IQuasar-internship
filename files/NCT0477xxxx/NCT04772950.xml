  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first propose of the study is to understand the contraction of deep and superficial&#xD;
      multifidus in patients with non-specific low back pain and the elderly. The second purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to understand the relationship between the multifidus and the functional&#xD;
      performance in patients with non-specific low back pain and the elderly. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the patients with non-specific low back pain and the elderly have less ability to&#xD;
      contract the deep multifidus then asymptomatic adults and younger adults. Besides, the&#xD;
      multifidus is correlated to the functional performance.&#xD;
