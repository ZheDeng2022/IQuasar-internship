  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At-home use of Natalizumab in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has been temporarily granted&#xD;
      by French security agency of medicines and Health products (ANSM). The main objective of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the safety of natalizumab administration at home vs at hospital based on&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective data collection. Quality of life, patient perception of at-home&#xD;
      natalizumab administration are also evaluated as secondary objectives as well as&#xD;
      medico-economic assessment of the method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for a 12-month retrospective period and a 12-month prospective period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the Covid-19 pandemic, some neurologists have alerted the French authorities&#xD;
      (ANSM: National Medicines Safety Agency) to the interruption of natalizumab treatment by some&#xD;
      MS patients. The ANSM has granted temporary home use of natalizumab within the framework of a&#xD;
      &quot;at-home hospitalization&quot; (HAD) program. The study purpose is to assess at-home natalizumab&#xD;
      administration regarding safety, disease activity, quality of life, patient's perception and&#xD;
      costs by comparing outcomes before and after &quot;At Home&quot; natalizumab treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two periods of observation: a retrospective one corresponding to the&#xD;
      year prior the study entry and a prospective one corresponding to patient follow-up for one&#xD;
      year from the date of the patient inclusion. The date of the inclusion corresponds to the&#xD;
      natalizumab-infusion conducted at hospital just before infusions hospital at-home started.&#xD;
      Retrospective data are collected from medical record and a minimal dataset is needed to&#xD;
      enroll the patient regarding MRI activity and safety data (i.e., nature and number of SAE and&#xD;
      selected AE of grade 2 the year prior study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective period consists of 10 at-home natalizumab infusions (months 1-5 and 7-11) and&#xD;
      3 at-hospital natalizumab infusions (inclusion, months 6 and 12) according to standard care.&#xD;
      In addition to clinical, MRI and safety (SAE and selected AE of grade 2) data collected as&#xD;
      part of standard medical care from medical record over all the study period, Quality of life&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5L, MusiQol) and patient's preference (Musicare) questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      at inclusion and months 6 and 12 and clinical global impression of change will be recorded at&#xD;
      month 6 and 12. Patients will be asked to notify any adverse events that may occur between&#xD;
      each at-home infusion and to record each month his/her healthcare resource consumption in a&#xD;
      diary. Patients will be contacted each month after at-home infusion to record safety and&#xD;
      healthcare resource consumption data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a sub-group of 15 patients qualitative interview will be performed between month 3 and 8&#xD;
      as part of patient preference assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-costing dedicated forms and experts' statements will be used to assess resource&#xD;
      utilization associated to natalizumab infusion during each period for medico-analyze purpose.&#xD;
