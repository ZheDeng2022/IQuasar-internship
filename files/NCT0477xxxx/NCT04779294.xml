  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to compare the clinical performance of two adjunctive methods to&#xD;
      CTG in intrapartum fetal monitoring: FBS with measurement of scalp lactate and ST analysis of&#xD;
      the fetal ECG.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We use Lactate as a standard adjunctive method in our hospital but we have STAN software&#xD;
      available ( is demasked) in our CTG monitors. We will include all women in labour with an&#xD;
      intern scalp monitoring and analyse the CTG, the lactate samples and the STAN signals in the&#xD;
      same patient and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the relationship between the decision-to-delivery interval and neonatal morbidity&#xD;
           in deliveries monitored by scalp lactate measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the diagnostic capability of both methods to identify fetuses at risk of hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the false negative alerts from both methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the temporal and quantitative relation between fetal lactate metabolism and ST&#xD;
           interval changes of the fetal ECG&#xD;

    <description>To assess the effect of increasing time interval from the objective warning of intrapartum fetal hypoxia with fetal scalp lactate ≥ 4.8mmol/l to the end of operative delivery on the percentage of moderate cord-blood acidosis at birth (i.e., umbilical artery blood pH ≤ 7.1)</description>

        Women in labour who are monitored with CTG and FBS with measurement of scalp lactate. CTG&#xD;
        monitoring in the study is achieved by an internal spiral scalp electrode combined with a&#xD;
        pressure-sensitive external contraction transducer. FBS is performed at the decision of the&#xD;
        attending obstetrician. Capillary blood is obtained from the fetal head via a stab wound&#xD;
        and analyzed with a bed-side test (Lactate Pro). The monitoring procedures described above&#xD;
        are identical with the current clinical routine at the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The department utilizes S31 fetal monitors (Neoventa Medical AB©, Sweden), which are&#xD;
        equipped with the hard and software tool for ST analysis. Once the scalp electrode is&#xD;
        attached, ST analysis will be performed and recorded continuously. ST information is&#xD;
        blinded throughout labor, i.e. clinical management will only be based on CTG and FBS if&#xD;
        indicated. No additional technical equipment is necessary for the project.&#xD;
