  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip Surgery is a very common form of surgery carried out across many hospitals within the UK&#xD;
      in emergency and elective form. There is a variation between amongst surgeons with regard to&#xD;
      the initial surgical incision required for the operation. It is fairly common practice to&#xD;
      anaesthetise the Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of the thigh for analgesic reasons prior to the&#xD;
      start of surgery, however due to the variation in surgical practice (and evolving surgical&#xD;
      practices) this may not cover the entire surgical incision site. Another group of nerves&#xD;
      termed the subcostal nerves has been described in the texts to perhaps cover the area of&#xD;
      surgical incision along with blockade of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. On healthy&#xD;
      volunteers the investigators plan to anaesthetise the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh,&#xD;
      and the subcostal nerve on healthy participants to ascertain and map out the area of&#xD;
      anaesthesia to see whether this could be a viable technique for analgesia for hip surgery in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip replacement and hemiarthroplasty of the hip for neck of femur fracture are common&#xD;
      orthopaedic procedures. The National Joint Registry in 2017 reported that 96.3% of hip&#xD;
      replacements were performed using the anterolateral and posterior approach. NICE guidelines&#xD;
      have suggested to utilise the anterolateral approach for hip fracture hemiarthroplasty due to&#xD;
      decrease dislocation rates and thus, cost savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these two commonly use approaches, the traditional incisions have, in the&#xD;
      investigators experience, been modified. This is to accommodate the increasing evidence and&#xD;
      emphasis on the acetabular components. Besides that, in hemiarthroplasty, various incisions&#xD;
      have been described for the 'anterolateral' approach, such as direct lateral, curved&#xD;
      posteriorly. 'Mini' and 'micro' incisions of the posterior approach has also been described&#xD;
      all with the aim as tissue-sparing procedures, improving outcomes and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to describe the 'traditionally' described posterior and&#xD;
      anterolateral incisions to the hip by Moore and Hardinge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Posterior - 5cm distally from the greater trochanter along the femoral diaphysis,&#xD;
           curving the incision proximally 3-8cm towards the PSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anterolateral - 3cm distally from the greater trochanter along the femoral diaphysis,&#xD;
           continuing proximally 3-8cm along the femoral diaphysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cutaneous innervation for this area is largely supplied by the lateral femoral cutaneous&#xD;
      nerve of the thigh; however some anatomical texts also describe contribution to this area&#xD;
      from the subcostal nerve, or the lateral branches of the iliohypogastric nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can be readily identified using ultrasound, and has&#xD;
      recently been categorised into 3 distinct types; the 'Sartorius', Posterior' and the 'Fan'&#xD;
      types. The Sartorius type, accounting for roughly one-third, describes a dominant anterior&#xD;
      branch running along the border of the Sartorius muscle, with no or few posterior branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The posterior type, accounting for roughly one-third, describes a strong posterior branch,&#xD;
      equal in thickness to, or thicker than, the anterior branch running laterally and crossing&#xD;
      the medial border of the tensor fasciae latae muscle immediately distal to the ASIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fan type, accounting for roughly one-third, describes multiple nerve branches of equal&#xD;
      thickness spreading over the anterolateral region of the proximal aspect of the thigh,&#xD;
      crossing over the tensor fasciae latae muscle and the lateral border of the sartorius.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can readily be identified using ultrasound and is readily&#xD;
      blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subcostal nerve describes the distal continuation of the twelfth intercostal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its lateral cutaneous branch perforates the obliquus internus and externus, descends over the&#xD;
      iliac crest in front of the lateral cutaneous branch of the iliohypogastric, and is&#xD;
      distributed to the skin of the front part of the gluteal region, extending as low as the&#xD;
      greater trochanter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iliohypogastric nerve is usually a branch of the lumbar plexus originating from the L1&#xD;
      ventral ramus. Above the iliac crest, it enters the posterior part of the transversus&#xD;
      abdominis. Between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique it divides into lateral and&#xD;
      anterior cutaneous branches. The lateral cutaneous branch runs through the internal and&#xD;
      external oblique above the iliac crest, a little behind the iliac branch of the T12 spinal&#xD;
      nerve. It is distributed to the posterolateral gluteal skin. The iliohypogastric nerve&#xD;
      usually gives communicating branches to the subcostal and ilioinguinal nerves. The iliac&#xD;
      branch of the iliohypogastric nerve can be absent, replaced by the lateral cutaneous branch&#xD;
      of the subcostal nerve. The iliohypogastric nerve is sometimes derived from the twelfth&#xD;
      thoracic nerve and can also receive a root from the eleventh. Anloague and Huijbregts (2009)&#xD;
      demonstrated the absence of the iliohypogastric nerve in 20.6% of the lumbar plexuses they&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia for this incision can therefore only partly be achieved by a lateral femoral&#xD;
      cutaneous nerve block; however this is not always complete for the territory of the incision,&#xD;
      particularly if the incision is longer and extending more proximally. Due to the variation&#xD;
      and sharing between the subcostal and iliohypogastric nerves, and their similar course, we&#xD;
      will consider sonographically identified descending nerves to the gluteal region as a single&#xD;
      entity, referred to as the subcostal nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators have identified the subcostal nerve using ultrasound on volunteers and&#xD;
      found it to lie above the superficial fascia directly above gluteus medius at the cranial&#xD;
      aspect of the buttock, originating from the lateral abdominal wall musculature, where it can&#xD;
      be tracked proximally to visualise its descent through the muscle layers of the lateral&#xD;
      abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block alone will not&#xD;
      reliably provide cutaneous anaesthesia to the territory of our commonly observed incisions&#xD;
      for hip arthroplasty. Our secondary hypothesis is that a blockade of the subcostal nerve will&#xD;
      extend the cutaneous anaesthesia to reliably cover that area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to be conducted in three parts. Firstly, surgeons within the investigators&#xD;
      department will be canvassed to mark out their likely line of incision for a routine elective&#xD;
      primary hip arthroplasty. Pictorial evidence and variation will be gathered for overlay.&#xD;
      Secondly, on volunteers, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve will be identified using&#xD;
      ultrasound in its course distal to the inguinal ligament, and the relevant type will be&#xD;
      ascertained. The nerve will then be blocked using a short-acting local anaesthetic, and the&#xD;
      area of numbness demarcated. Pictorial evidence will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, the subcostal nerve will be identified, and blocked using a short-acting local&#xD;
      anaesthetic. The resulting area of numbness will be further demarcated, and further pictorial&#xD;
      evidence gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevant demarcated areas and incisions will be then be compared for analysis.&#xD;

Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block and evaluation:&#xD;
Routine ECG, pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring will be available. Using a sterile technique, the lateral femoral nerve will be approached using an in-plane ultrasound-guided technique, using a Stimuplex Ultra 360 50mm needle (B Braun, UK). Following negative aspiration, a one off STAT injection of 5mls lidocaine 1% will be administered subcutaneously.&#xD;
After 10 minutes, any altered sensation will be assessed using ice to differentiate normal and altered sensation. This area will be marked on the skin using a black marker pen. Photographs will be taken and images of the procedure will be recorded.&#xD;
The above will then be repeated for the subcostal nerve block.&#xD;
The total area of anaesthesia will then be compared to the standard surgical incision for hip surgery to assess whether the subcostal nerve block will offer any further analgesia.</description>
