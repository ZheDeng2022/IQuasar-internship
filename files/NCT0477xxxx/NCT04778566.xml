  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aiming to enroll 90 patients with genetically confirmed Lynch Syndrome (LS)&#xD;
      from Geisinger's High Risk Colorectal Cancer Clinic (HRC). Upon enrollment in the study, a&#xD;
      Cologuard test will be ordered and the results will be blinded until data analysis. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will also undergo a colonoscopy as part of their routine HRC visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to perform a pilot study to gain information toward the implementation of&#xD;
      a larger prospective study that will compare the performance of Cologuard with the&#xD;
      gold-standard colonoscopy in identifying advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in LS. Data&#xD;
      regarding rate of consent, and adherence to the protocol will be recorded. Since patients&#xD;
      with known genetic predisposition to cancers tend to view screening tests more positively&#xD;
      than the general population, a second aim of the study is to evaluate patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with bowel preparation, colonoscopies, and Cologuard testing. Up to 90 individuals with&#xD;
      genetically confirmed LS will be recruited via Geisinger's HRC to complete a goal of 90&#xD;
      Cologuard studies. Upon enrollment, Cologuard will be ordered by the study team at no cost to&#xD;
      the subject and will be completed according to the standard instructions for use. Results&#xD;
      will be securely obtained and blinded until the time of data analysis. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      colonoscopy as part of their routine HRC visit. Results from the colonoscopy (and biopsy as&#xD;
      indicated) will be retrieved from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and documented in a&#xD;
      research-associated spreadsheet. If repeat colonoscopy is clinically indicated, repeat&#xD;
      Cologuard may be completed if the subject meets inclusion criteria.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Recent discovery of a novel assay that is more likely to be beneficial for patients with Lynch&#xD;
    Syndrome. Investing into current version of Cologuard test would provide little clinical&#xD;
    benefit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the feasibility of Cologuard in a high-risk population, a summary report of the enrollment/consent rate and adherence to the protocol will be provided. Additional analyses comparing the results (given as positive/negative) Cologuard with the gold standard of colonoscopy will be performed using diagnostic tests including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate patient satisfaction with Cologuard</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate patient satisfaction of Cologuard the responses to the Geisinger Cologuard Satisfaction Questionnaire will be summarized. The questionnaire is composed of 15 questions. There are two primary questions are &quot;How satisfied are you with the process of using Cologuard which uses a 5 point Likert Scale (Very satisfied to Very Dissatisfied) and &quot;would you recommend Cologuard using a 10 point Likert scale (Not at all likely to Extremely Likely). Other categorical questions are either yes no response or an ordinal response with 4 categories. There are 6 questions that are open text responses to give more details as to why the selected their categorical response. The information gathered in the open responses is qualitative and will be used to provide guidance of approach and protocol for a future study.</description>
