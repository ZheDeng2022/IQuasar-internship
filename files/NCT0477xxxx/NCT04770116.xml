  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents is around 30%&#xD;
      with 70-90% being classified as mild (concussion). Because the brain of a child is still&#xD;
      developing, a TBI can have devastating effects and possibly creates lifetime challenges.&#xD;
      Sleep seems to play an important role in the post-concussion recovery process. Auditory&#xD;
      stimulation during sleep has been shown to reliably boost slow waves, a solid marker for the&#xD;
      depth of sleep, and can thus be used to deepen sleep. This study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of sleep enhancement via auditory stimulation on recovery after a concussion in&#xD;
      children and adolescents in their home. Therefore, half of the patients receive one week of&#xD;
      auditory stimulation during deep sleep at their home using a mobile device. The other half&#xD;
      follows the same study protocol, but no tones are administered (sham). Cognitive tests as&#xD;
      well as symptom questionnaires are used to assess the recovery process. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the patients in the intervention group will recover better than the ones who haven't&#xD;
      received the intervention. Additionally, a group of children and adolescents who never&#xD;
      sustained a concussion is included as a control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 120 participants are planned: 60 patients (30 intervention, 30 sham) and 60&#xD;
      controls (30 intervention, 30 sham). This was estimated from a power analysis and based on&#xD;
      previous results. Patients are recruited from the University Children's Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, the participants will complete a baseline assessment of neuropsychological measures&#xD;
      (cognitive tests and questionnaires). After completion of the baseline assessment, the&#xD;
      participants receive deep sleep enhancement with auditory stimulation for seven nights, but&#xD;
      half of them will only receive sham stimulation (device application, but no stimulation).&#xD;
      Additionally, they wear an actigraph throughout the whole week. Afterwards, they fill in&#xD;
      again some questionnaires (intermediate assessment). One month after study inclusion, the&#xD;
      first follow-up will take place where neuropsychological and (optionally) neurological&#xD;
      measures will be collected. The second follow-up takes place six months after study inclusion&#xD;
      and involves again filling in questionnaires about post-concussive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored regularly in terms of data validation and source data&#xD;
      verification. Adverse events and device deficiencies are carefully documented and reported&#xD;
      according to the guidelines of swissmedic and the responsible ethics committee.&#xD;
