  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of dementia and is associated&#xD;
      with parkinsonism, hallucinations, and cognitive fluctuations. Diagnosis is often either&#xD;
      missed or delayed due to physician lack of familiarity with characteristic features, the&#xD;
      inability of structural MRI to detect a pathological signature for this condition, and the&#xD;
      lack of healthcare provider access to &quot;indicative biomarkers&quot; that are either unavailable at&#xD;
      community clinics or costly due to lack of insurance coverage. The role of resting state&#xD;
      function MRI (rs-fMRI) as a diagnostic biomarker has been underexplored in this disease. We&#xD;
      propose using a novel cloud-based automated imaging software processing program that&#xD;
      identifies abnormal brain networks or connectomes using resting state functional MRI&#xD;
      (rs-fMRI) and data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Furthermore, the imaging protocol&#xD;
      to capture this data is relatively short (15 minutes) and can be performed at most imaging&#xD;
      centers, lending potential clinical applicability to this study. We intend to study&#xD;
      dysfunctional large scale brain networks (LSBNs) in DLB by comparing rs-fMRI imaging data in&#xD;
      this population with cognitively normal (CN) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects from&#xD;
      the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2/3 database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Omniscient, a for-profit, Sydney, Australia-based company, created the cloud-based software&#xD;
      Infinitome, a program that utilizes data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) together&#xD;
      with machine learning to analyze diffusion tensor and resting-state fMRI imaging data from&#xD;
      remote sites. The foundation for this imaging tool is based upon the HCP atlas, which has&#xD;
      also informed prior publications from our group, including the Connectomic Atlas of the Human&#xD;
      Cerebrum (Baker, Burks, Briggs, Conner, et al. 2018). The Infinitome program creates a&#xD;
      subject specific version of the Human Connectome Project Multimodal Parcellation (HCP-MMP1)&#xD;
      atlas using diffusion tractography. Analytics are performed on both diffusion tensor imaging&#xD;
      and rs-fMRI. Outlier detection using a tangent space connectivity matrix is performed by&#xD;
      comparing results with a subset of 300 normal HCP subject fMRI samples to determine the range&#xD;
      of normal correlations for each regions of interest in a large scale brain network which&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Locus coeruleus vs. Nucleus basalis of Meynert&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Locus coeruelus vs. Intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nucleus basalis of Meynert vs. Intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FST in the vs. Area PH in the lateral occipital lobe&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Substantia nigra vs. Caudate nucleus Clinical Measures will be correlated with&#xD;
           functional connectivity scores to identify relationship between clinical symptoms and&#xD;
           large scale brain networks in DLB&#xD;
