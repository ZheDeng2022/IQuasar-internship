    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between preterm birth, glucose level&#xD;
      in the first two hours of life and health related quality of life in the age of 8 months and&#xD;
      7 years&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All premature infants treated from August 2013-August 2014 in two Neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      units (NICUs) are included in this study. Glucose levels was analyzed two hours after birth.&#xD;
      In the age of 8 months parents completed the questionnaire Pediatric Quality of Life - Infant&#xD;
      scale. The questionnaire Quality of life for children 5-7 years and for their parents will be&#xD;
      offered to them in the next 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate if there is a correlation between glucose levels and quality of life in&#xD;
      premature infants, and if quality of life changes over years.&#xD;

    <measure>Comparison of glucose levels in prematures after birth and Quality of life in the age of 7 years</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose level was measured two hours after birth in all premature infants. In the age of 8 months and 7 years Quality of life was measured using the questionnaire Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) - Infant scale (6-12 months). The PedsQL Young Child report (5-7 years) and Parent report for Young children (5-7 years) will be offered to one parent/caregiver. In both scales minimum value is zero and maximum is 100; Higher score means better quality of life. The correlation between glucose levels in premature infants and quality of life will be investigated.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Quality of life in premature infants in the age of 8 months and 7 years</measure>
    <time_frame>6,5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) - Infant scale (6-12 months) was completed by a parent/caregiver of premature infants in the age of 8 months. In the age of 7 years the questionnaire PedsQL Young Child report (5-7 years) and Parent report for Young children (5-7 years) will be offered to parents/caregivers. The quality of life will be compared in these two intervals to investigate the changes in quality of life over time.</description>
