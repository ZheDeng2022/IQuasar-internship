  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When it comes to acute stroke, everyone deserves the best care. Today, more patients can&#xD;
      benefit from endovascular treatment (EVT) in a comprehensive stroke center. With the&#xD;
      significant advances in C-arm Cone Beam CT (CBCT) imagings directly in the neuro angio-suite&#xD;
      (NAS), the investigators are now able to identify, plan and treat stroke patients in the NAS,&#xD;
      without the need for a separate CT scan. This provides valuable, time-saving support for&#xD;
      critical patients in acute need of EVT. The main objective is to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      confidence of this optimized C-arm Cone Beam CT, named in french ASO, in the NAS for the&#xD;
      detection of brain abnormalities and hemorrhagic complications for critical patients with&#xD;
      acute stroke. The secondary objectives are to study the variability of the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy concerning the staging of the stroke, the analysis of the brain vessel, the&#xD;
      relevance of artefact reduction post treatment and the amount of dose for this ASO.&#xD;

      Design: ASO-AVC is a french academic pilot study by exploring the diagnostic confidence of&#xD;
      optimized C-arm Cone Beam CT (ASO) realized directly in the neuro angio-suite (NAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effectiveness and safety of ASO diagnostic, the variability of the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy concerning the staging of the stroke, the analysis of the brain vessel, the&#xD;
      relevance of artefact reduction post treatment and the amount of delivered dose, the&#xD;
      investigator proposed to assess clinical usefulness of ASO in the diagnostic process of&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: No modification of patient care will be required by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in the study will undergo standard diagnostic, procedural and&#xD;
      control imagings, which consist of : diagnostic imaging studies (MRI or CT scan), usual C-arm&#xD;
      Cone Beam CT in the NAS during EVT to insure no procedural complication and control imaging&#xD;
      studies (MRI or CT scan) at 24 hours ; decisions concerning further diagnostics will be made&#xD;
      by the physician in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from theses standard imagings, patients will undergo the ASO. The ASO imagings will be&#xD;
      anonymized and recorded in a centralized database called PACS (Picture Archiving and&#xD;
      Communication System), in order to a centralized radiological reading by the Imaging Core&#xD;
      Lab. They will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality through a&#xD;
      questionnaire, and in a second time the data will be included in a comparative evaluation&#xD;
      with the diagnostic and control imagings.&#xD;
