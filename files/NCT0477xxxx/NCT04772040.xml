  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 5-month study, we will track the incorporation and washout of n-3 PUFA into different&#xD;
      tissues following two different dosing strategies in healthy young and older volunteers. All&#xD;
      groups will be followed for washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data gathered from this study will be used to establish novel dosing strategies and provide&#xD;
      insights into the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs in different tissues and their washout in young&#xD;
      and older participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle is crucial for health and accounts for approximately 40% of total body mass.&#xD;
      A loss of skeletal muscle mass is seen in the process of ageing, with reductions between&#xD;
      0.2%-0.5% of muscle mass per year starting in the fifth decade. Accelerated loss of muscle&#xD;
      and function above a certain threshold is characterized as sarcopenia. Age-related sarcopenia&#xD;
      is prevalent in the UK; it is estimated to affect 4.6% men and 7.9% women with an average age&#xD;
      of 67 years. Older people have an impaired capacity to increase muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      (MPS) rates in response to protein intake; this is thought to be a key contributor to&#xD;
      age-related sarcopenia. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate new strategies to prevent and&#xD;
      treat the accelerated loss of muscle mass and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omega (ω)-polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) derived from fish oil have possible&#xD;
      beneficial effects on health. Evidence suggests potential therapeutic effects of n-3 PUFAs in&#xD;
      maintenance/prevention of loss of skeletal muscle mass. N-3 PUFAs probably exert their&#xD;
      effects by incorporation into tissue membranes. However, the relation between dose and&#xD;
      incorporation into tissue membranes is unclear. Interestingly, a higher dose ingested over 4&#xD;
      weeks seen by McGlory et al. induced similar omega-3 incorporation in the tissue compared to&#xD;
      the low doses over 8 weeks studied by Smith et al. If higher doses change tissue composition&#xD;
      earlier, then there will be earlier benefits for muscle health and function. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      need to examine whether an initial loading dose incorporation into tissues can be sustained&#xD;
      by moving to a lower maintenance feeding dose. Furthermore, the exact molecular mechanisms of&#xD;
      how n-3 PUFAs act on skeletal muscle are unclear. Several metabolic and molecular responses&#xD;
      are affected, but wherein these pathways n-3 PUFAs act remain largely unknown and requires&#xD;
      more investigation, with a focus on long-term settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to tackle these problems by executing a 5-month study where we will track the&#xD;
      incorporation and washout of n-3 PUFAs into different tissues following two different dosing&#xD;
      strategies in healthy young and older volunteers. Data gathered from this study will be used&#xD;
      to establish novel dosing strategies and provide insights into the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs&#xD;
      in different tissues and their washout in young and older participants. Ultimately, these&#xD;
      insights will help targeting, prevention, and treatment of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating in this study requires approximately 30 hours of commitment, of which 12 hours&#xD;
      will be spent in the lab.&#xD;
