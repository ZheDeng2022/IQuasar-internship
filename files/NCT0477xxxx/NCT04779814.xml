  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a UK, multi-center, non-interventional study based on the use of health service&#xD;
      administrative and medical records (paper-based and/or electronic, as applicable) along with&#xD;
      the use of prospectively collected subject-reported outcomes on experience with use of VNS&#xD;
      therapy using validated and bespoke self-completion questionnaires. Data for hospital&#xD;
      resource utilisation will be extracted from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failure to control seizures in subjects with treatment resistant epilepsy can have a&#xD;
      significant burden on the healthcare system. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment for patients with drug resistant epilepsy and is reported to reduce the frequency&#xD;
      of seizures in adults and children. However, real-world data on healthcare resource&#xD;
      utilization by patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their clinical outcomes prior&#xD;
      to and post VNS device implantation in the UK are limited. The current study aims to describe&#xD;
      the resource utilization and clinical outcomes prior to and following the implantation of&#xD;
      different VNS devices (Demipulse®/Aspire HC®, Aspire SR® and SenTiva®) in subjects with drug&#xD;
      resistant epilepsy&#xD;

        Male and female adult (aged ≥16 years at VNS implantation) and paediatric (aged 1-15 years&#xD;
        at VNS implantation) subjects with epilepsy who have had a VNS device Demipulse®/Aspire&#xD;
        HC®, Aspire SR® or SenTiva® implanted will be involved in this study.&#xD;
