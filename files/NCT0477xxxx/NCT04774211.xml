  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric delirium (PD) is a poorly investigated clinical problem that needs to be further&#xD;
      explored in a Danish context. Children are at risk of discomfort and suffering if they&#xD;
      experience delirium. The condition is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      longer hospital stay, increased mortality, and risk of long-term cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to assess critically ill children with a validated tool to enable&#xD;
      early detection and management of the condition. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of pediatric intensive care delirium. To this end, the investigators&#xD;
      will validate the Sophia Observation withdrawal Symptoms - Pediatric delirium scale (SOS-PD)&#xD;
      for patient assessment and involve the parents of the patients in the delirium detection.&#xD;

      Prospective prevalence and validation study of pediatric intensive care delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the prevalence and duration of delirium in children aged 3 months-18&#xD;
      years of age using parent involvement in assessment of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Translation of the SOS-PD tool according to principles of good practice for the&#xD;
           translation and cultural adaptation process for patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Training healthcare professionals to use SOS-PD at five hospital units. To ensure the&#xD;
           understanding of SOS-PD short interviews will be performed in a random sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation of SOS-PD bedside assessments comparing the Danish SOS-PD scale with a Child&#xD;
           Psychiatrist using DSM-V as the reference standard (n=140)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Training parents in delirium screening using the SOS-PD at three hospital units (5021,&#xD;
           5061, 4144). To ensure the understanding of SOS-PD short interviews will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and power calculation: With 140 patients, the accuracy estimate in this study&#xD;
      will have a 95% confidence interval of +/- 5%. Accuracy defined as (true positive + true&#xD;
      negative) / all x 100 is expected to be 90%. The validity of the SOS-PD assessment tool is&#xD;
      calculated from standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value&#xD;
      and negative predictive value. Interrater reliability between the nurse / parent, the nurse /&#xD;
      reference standard, and the parents / reference standard's SOS-PD score will be calculated&#xD;
      with linearly weighted Cohen kappa value. Cohen's kappa value&gt; 0.65 is considered&#xD;
      satisfactory. To compare the mean values of the SOS-PD score between parents and nurses, the&#xD;
      student's t-test is used. P. value of &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. The&#xD;
      prevalence is calculated in percent. All data will be entered and encoded in RedCap and&#xD;
      exported to SPSS for statistical analysis of data.&#xD;

    <description>Delirium prevalence is determined by the proportion of patients that had at least one positive delirium score with patients that never had a positive delirium score determined by Sophia Observation Withdrawal Symptoms - Pediatric Delirium scale (SOS-PD). The minimum score of SOS-PD is 0 and maximum score is 17. The score ≥4 indicates delirium.</description>
