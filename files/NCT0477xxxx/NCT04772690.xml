  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Advanced cancer may cause functional limitations, subsequently leading to&#xD;
      decreased ability to perform and engage in everyday activities, such as self-care, household,&#xD;
      leisure and civic life. In addition, people with advanced cancer need alleviation from the&#xD;
      pain and sorrow following limited life expectancy wherefore they prefer to focus on everyday&#xD;
      life function and activities, lightness and enjoyment. The overall aim of the Balance,&#xD;
      Activity and quality of Life (BAL) project is to develop, test and evaluate effectiveness and&#xD;
      process of a resource-oriented intervention which coordinates rehabilitation and palliative&#xD;
      care to enhance quality of life (QoL), balance and enjoyment in everyday activities and&#xD;
      functioning. The development of the intervention is guided by the British Medical Research&#xD;
      Council's guidance (MRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study consists of a resource-oriented intervention, which will be feasibility&#xD;
      tested in the research clinic of REHPA, the Danish Knowledge Centre for Rehabilitation and&#xD;
      Palliative Care. The study will inform the development of a resource-oriented program for&#xD;
      people with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: A feasibility study designed as a one-armed, pre-post study with&#xD;
      follow-up after five days and again after 6 and 12 weeks. The study will recruit 20-25&#xD;
      home-living adults (â©¾18 years) with chronic or advanced cancer reporting needs in everyday&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes are quality of life, physical function and fatigue assessed using the European&#xD;
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ C-30). Furthermore, balance in everyday activities will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Occupational Balance Questionnaire 11 (OBQ-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides outcomes, process data will also be collected regarding: 1) fidelity, 2) adherence,&#xD;
      3) dose and 4) reach and mechanisms of impact with attention to participant's experiences of&#xD;
      and interactions with the intervention. These data will be collected using registration&#xD;
      forms, questionnaires, participant-observations and focus-group interviews.&#xD;
