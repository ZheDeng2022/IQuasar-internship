      This project will investigate the Gottman 7 principle couple course (G7P) in the Norwegian&#xD;
      setting offered at different sites and for different groups of the population, including a&#xD;
      sample of clients from the specialist health services. A control group of couples will serve&#xD;
      as a baseline. The study will bring knowledge about the participants experiences with the G7P&#xD;
      and the effectiveness of the course on improving the couple relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G7P couple enhancement program is translated to Norwegian and 200 trainers were licensed&#xD;
      in 2017. Some of these trainers are professionals, such as psychologists and couple and&#xD;
      family therapists and some are non-professionals. The courses are offered in communities all&#xD;
      over the country and also for clients in specialized health care at Sorlandet hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has a mixed-method design and will explore these research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do Gottman 7 principles courses lead to better couple functioning from start to end of&#xD;
           program and at 6 months follow up? And if so, for whom?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do different populations benefit equally from the course?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Who join Gottman 7p courses?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Why do they join a Gottman 7p course?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there any difference in the experience of the course and the effectiveness of the&#xD;
           course when a professional or a non-professional is the trainer?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How do the participants experience the course and the usefulness of it?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer our research questions we want to obtain data through questionnaires and&#xD;
      interviews, thus a mixed-method study. The project is a cohort study with three measurement&#xD;
      points for the quantitative part and two for the qualitative part of the study. A control&#xD;
      group of couples will serve as a baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants at G7P courses in Norway will be asked to participate in the quantitative part&#xD;
      of the study. The participants are asked to answer some questions at the start and at the end&#xD;
      of the course (t1, and t2) and six months after the course (t3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional, a control group will participate in the study. They will be asked to participate&#xD;
      through a) the Solide Samliv webpage and b) the Solide Samliv facebook page. c) advertizement&#xD;
      on social media. The control group will answer to questions equal to t1 and t3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyzes will be performed in SPSS, Jasp and R and both frequentist and Bayesian approaches&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sub-study amnswers to research question 6: How do the participants experience the&#xD;
      Gottman 7 principles course and the usefulness of it? Recruitment will take place through the&#xD;
      G7P courses. The sample is recruited from those who signed the consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study at the start of each course. The selection of participants will be based on variation&#xD;
      in terms of informants' background (e.g. gender, age, length of the relationship,&#xD;
      urban/rural), to illuminate the breadth of bereaved individuals' experiences. We are aiming&#xD;
      at 18 participants. The sample shall consist of 6 men, 6 women, and 6 couples. Qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted at two times: approximately at the end of the course and six&#xD;
      months after the end of the course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and method of collection: In-depth interviews will take place in part individually and&#xD;
      in part as couples in a place chosen by the participants. The interview will be recorded by&#xD;
      the researcher and then transcribed by external assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: Thematic analysis of qualitative data (Clarke &amp; Braun, 2014).&#xD;

    <description>The Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS - (Busby et al., 1995) is a self-report questionnaire with 14 items.&#xD;
The three sub-scales (Consensus, Satisfaction and Cohesion) and the Total-scale will be used as outcome measures&#xD;
The min and max values are:&#xD;
Consensus [0-30] Satisfaction [0-20] Cohesion [0-19] Total scale [0-69]&#xD;
Higher values indicate better adjustment and clinical cut-off has been identified at 47.31 for the total scale, indicating a level of severity equal to what is found in clinical samples (persons seeking couple therapy).</description>

    <time_frame>Before the course start (t0) and within one week after the last day of the course (t1)</time_frame>
    <description>Before the course start the participants assess their couple satisfaction on a single scale from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). At the end of the course they are asked the same question.&#xD;
Additionally, at the end of the course, they are asked how they now, after participating in the course, would rate their couple satisfaction at the start (1-5). This provide us with a response shift perspective.&#xD;
Change will be assessed by comparing the change in the scores from start (t0) to end (t1), and by assessing the response shift (t0r).I.e. difference in perception from t0 and t0r and change in score from t0r to t1.&#xD;
Higher values are better, indicating a more satisfied relationship</description>
