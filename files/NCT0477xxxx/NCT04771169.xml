      There is paucity of literature in studying the comparative effects of Vestibular&#xD;
      Rehabilitation and Virtual Reality. This study will determine the effects of these&#xD;
      interventions on dizziness, balance and gait. This study will also deduce the role of&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation and Virtual reality in subacute stroke patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal disturbance of cerebral&#xD;
      function that lasts more than 24 hours or leading to death. It arises from vascular causes&#xD;
      such as cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stroke&#xD;
      refers to any damage to the brain due to abnormality of blood supply. Stroke patients have&#xD;
      difficulty in maintaining balance and postural control because they have asymmetric posture,&#xD;
      abnormal body imbalance and difficulty in weight transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance is required to maintain posture, to respond to voluntary movements and react to&#xD;
      external perturbations. Because of the balance disorders, compensatory movements occur in&#xD;
      stroke patients which causes them to consume more energy compared to healthy subjects and&#xD;
      causes the development of inefficient walking pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait function determines the degree of physical ability of post-stroke patients and their&#xD;
      ability to perform independent mobility during activities of daily living (ADL). Stroke&#xD;
      patients acquire compensatory abnormal walking pattern as a result of muscular weakness and&#xD;
      inability to maintain balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality rehabilitation systems provide direct sensorial feedback to which a person&#xD;
      can respond and interact with environment. VR environments are commonly used in treating,&#xD;
      training, and rehabilitation of stroke patients. In virtual reality rehabilitation, the&#xD;
      patient moves and performs predetermined tasks as if he is performing the actions in reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a study conducted by Hyung Young Lee, Virtual reality-based training has been&#xD;
      used as therapeutic intervention for functional recovery of stroke patients. It provides a&#xD;
      variety of environments based on the requirements of patients that can be selected for&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a study conducted by Yurong Mao, Virtual reality balance training provides more&#xD;
      realistic proprioceptive and visual input and improves balance and gait function effectively.&#xD;
      Virtual reality balance games can be used as an effective tool to train patients with balance&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature describes Virtual Reality training is effective in improving dynamic balance&#xD;
      control and preventing falls in subacute stroke patients. Virtual reality training provides&#xD;
      stroke patients with planned and consistent exercises to improve balance and gait by giving&#xD;
      visual feedback to directly adjust their wrong weight center and shift visually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its reported that Vestibular rehabilitation is frequently used treatment for dizziness and&#xD;
      balance problems. Vestibular Rehabilitation is a combination of different exercise components&#xD;
      with an aim to improve gaze stability, balance and gait and facilitate somatosensory&#xD;
      integration. It is used in treatment of stroke patients to improve dynamic balance by acting&#xD;
      on the vestibular system, thus facilitating recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study indicated that, the main components of vestibular rehabilitation are gaze&#xD;
      stabilization exercises to help adapt the VOR function and balance exercises to retrain the&#xD;
      vestibulospinal reflex function. Thus, simultaneously measuring changes in the VOR function&#xD;
      and gait performance before and after intervention will provide valuable information for&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular system plays a phase dependent role in gait and is active at certain points in the&#xD;
      gait cycle including double support, changing direction, and step termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRT is patient dependent and progression of the exercises depends upon individual patient's&#xD;
      sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional aspects.&#xD;
