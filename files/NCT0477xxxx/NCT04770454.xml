      Approximately 20 sites in Korea including the Catholic University of Korea, Yeouido St.&#xD;
      Mary's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Depressive disorders taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)&#xD;
      antidepressant or Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), who additionally&#xD;
      administered Buspar® Tab (Buspirone) to control symptom of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of treating the symptoms of anxiety at 12 weeks&#xD;
      from the baseline after the administration of Buspar® Tab (Buspirone) to patients with&#xD;
      depression by using the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A). Approximately 400 participants (including&#xD;
      10% dropouts) Rating Scale&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, necessary data will be collected by history taking and medical record review&#xD;
      of patients who are taking an SSRI or SNRI antidepressant in the clinical practice and at the&#xD;
      same time being additionally administered Buspar® Tab (Buspirone) for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encourage outpatients with depression accompanied by symptoms of anxiety visiting medical&#xD;
      centers in Korea to participate in this study and obtain voluntary consent from them. Have&#xD;
      the patients sign the instruction and informed consent form for the use of personal&#xD;
      information and enroll them if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Collect the&#xD;
      following data in the case report form (CRF) during the 12-week follow-up observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HAM-A, HAM-D, and CGI-S are measured at the baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The CGI-I&#xD;
      is measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and the SDS and WHO-5 are measured at the baseline and at&#xD;
      12 weeks. The following data regarding all the subjects enrolled in this study are collected&#xD;
      in the CRF during the 12-week follow-up observation period.&#xD;

    <description>change from baseline in HAM-A score at week 12 The scale consists of 14 items designed to assess the severity of a patient's anxiety. Each of the 14 items contains a number of symptoms, and each group of symptoms is rated on a scale of zero to four, with four being the most severe. All of these scores are used to compute an overarching score that indicates a person's anxiety severity.</description>
