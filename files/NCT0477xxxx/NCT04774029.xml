      The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of lidocaine basivertebral nerve block as&#xD;
      intraprocedural anesthesia during vertebral augmentation procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis can be treated with vertebral&#xD;
      augmentation. Since intraprocedural pain is common during vertebral body endplate&#xD;
      manipulation, these procedures are often carried out using conscious sedation or general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Research has shown that the vertebral endplates are innervated by the&#xD;
      basivertebral nerve, which has been successfully targeted via radiofrequency ablation to&#xD;
      treat chronic vertebrogenic lower back pain. With this physiology in mind, the investigators&#xD;
      will attempt to treated participants with vertebral compression using lidocaine-induced&#xD;
      intraosseous basivertebral nerve block as the primary intraprocedural analgesia.&#xD;

    <measure>Intraprocedural pain during balloon augmentation</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraprocedural</time_frame>
    <description>Special attention to patient pain will be assessed during intraprocedural balloon augmentation, as this is often the most painful part of the procedure. Subjective pain as measured using a standard Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-10, where 0 represents no pain, and 10 indicates the worst pain of the patient's life. Additional routine monitoring of pain will take place during the procedure as carried out by the circulating nurse and by the interventional radiologist performing the procedure.</description>
