  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, evaluator blinded, intra-comparative, randomized, non-inferiority&#xD;
      investigation prior to CE mark to confirm safety and performance of the SWIS device when used&#xD;
      as intended, i.e. as an irrigation solution for mechanical rinsing of breached or compromised&#xD;
      skin as a result from acute wounds.&#xD;
