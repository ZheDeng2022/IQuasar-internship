      20 patients admitted to the ICU department and receiving isavuconazole as part of standard&#xD;
      care for the treatment of fungal infections will be included in the study. Between day 3 and&#xD;
      7, 8 samples will be collected at t = 0 (pre-dose), and t = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours&#xD;
      after end of infusion to obtain a PK curve. An optional, additional sample can be collected&#xD;
      after discontinuation of isavuconazole therapy if possible. Total and free isavuconazole&#xD;
      concentrations will be determined. A pharmacokinetic model will be fitted to the data from&#xD;
      all individuals simultaneously. Data will be analysed using non-linear mixed effects&#xD;
      modelling (NONMEM).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fungal infections are a serious threat to immunocompromised patients and represent a major&#xD;
      burden in the critical care setting. The azole antifungal drugs are the most important drugs&#xD;
      for managing infections caused by Aspergillus moulds and the prevention of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections in general. Azoles are currently used as first line prophylaxis and treatment of&#xD;
      invasive aspergillosis and their use has substantially improved the survival of the overall&#xD;
      population. Recently, there has been increased awareness for invasive aspergillosis cases in&#xD;
      critically ill patients, including patients with severe influenza (influenza associated&#xD;
      pulmonary aspergillosis, IAPA), and recently COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;
      (CAPA). These patients require azole-based therapy, for which voriconazole and isavuconazole&#xD;
      are recommended first choice drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isavuconazole is a relatively novel azole drug with promising efficacy, a broad antifungal&#xD;
      spectrum, favourable side effect profile and limited drug-drug interactions compared to other&#xD;
      azole agents. Isavuconazole is registered for the primary treatment of adults with invasive&#xD;
      aspergillosis, and patients with mucormycosis where amphotericin B is not suitable. Efficacy&#xD;
      and safety information in the isavuconazole label is mostly derived from clinical studies in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. However, the pharmacokinetics in some specific patient populations may&#xD;
      differ greatly from those in the healthy population. Changes in pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      isavuconazole in ICU patients are to be expected due to a wide variety of factors, e.g.&#xD;
      changes in protein binding and changes in fluid distribution. Therefore, it is likely that&#xD;
      the present standard dosing regimens of isavuconazole lead to suboptimal outcomes for ICU&#xD;
      patients, similar to observations made for fluconazole and echinocandins. Optimizing dosing&#xD;
      regimens in ICU patients for existing antifungal agents such as isavuconazole is important to&#xD;
      improve clinical outcome rates. To date, limited information on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      isavuconazole in critically ill patients is available and optimal dosing regimens remain&#xD;
      uncertain. With this study we aim to describe isavuconazole pharmacokinetics in ICU admitted&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients admitted to the ICU department and receiving isavuconazole as part of standard&#xD;
      care for the treatment of fungal infections will be included in the study. Between day 3 and&#xD;
      7, 8 samples will be collected at t = 0 (pre-dose), and t = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours&#xD;
      after end of infusion to obtain a PK curve. An optional, additional sample can be collected&#xD;
      after discontinuation of isavuconazole therapy if possible. Total and free isavuconazole&#xD;
      concentrations will be determined. A pharmacokinetic model will be fitted to the data from&#xD;
      all individuals simultaneously. Data will be analysed using non-linear mixed effects&#xD;
      modelling (NONMEM). NONMEM is a one-stage analysis that simultaneously estimates mean&#xD;
      parameters, fixed effect parameters, interindividual variability, and residual random&#xD;
      effects. Since allowance can be made for individual differences, this method can be used with&#xD;
      both intensive sampling and sparse data (and in the occasion of missing values: an unbalanced&#xD;
      number of data points per patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole given as treatment of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections in ICU patients as part of standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the protein binding of isavuconazole in ICU patients and the variability&#xD;
           in protein binding between patients in the ICU population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore if unbound isavuconazole concentrations can be predicted from total&#xD;
           isavuconazole concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment in the ICU patient&#xD;
           population.&#xD;

        Twenty ICU patients treated with isavuconazole for a fungal infection are eligible for&#xD;
        inclusion. These patients are admitted to the ICU of Radboudumc and UZ Leuven. Since the&#xD;
        objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole in a real-life cohort of&#xD;
        patients admitted to the ICU, exclusion criteria are minimal on purpose, to give a good&#xD;
        reflection of this heterogenic cohort. The possible inclusion of patients with for example&#xD;
        hepatic insufficiencies, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal&#xD;
        membrane oxygenation (ECMO) et cetera, is considered. High variability between subjects in&#xD;
        this highly heterogenetic patient population is expected and will be considered in the&#xD;
        analyses.&#xD;
