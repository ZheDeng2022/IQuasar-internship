  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the subject matter from a neurobiological and a neuropsychological&#xD;
      vantage point to ascertain whether the e-cigarette is potentially as addictive as the&#xD;
      traditional tobacco cigarette.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine the addictive potential of e-cigarettes through three different&#xD;
      lenses, combining neurobiological, sociological and epidemiological research methods and&#xD;
      levels of observation. The neurobiological perspective will investigate the rewarding effects&#xD;
      of vaping, using neurobiological and neuropsychological measurements on e-cigarette users, as&#xD;
      compared to nicotine-naïve participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use established fMRI paradigms to measure the reward potential of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes: First, craving will be investigated in an experimental approach by presenting&#xD;
      conditioned stimuli to participants; and second, motivation for e-cigarettes compared to&#xD;
      combustible cigarettes or money will be measured in an experimental work task. In addition, a&#xD;
      dot-probe-task will be used in combination with eye-tracking to measure the attentional bias&#xD;
      for e-cigarette stimuli. As part of the neuropsychological assessment outside the fMRI, the&#xD;
      approach bias for smoking cues will also be investigated. The aim is to examine whether&#xD;
      chronic use of e-cigarettes leads to similar conditioning processes and comparable aspects of&#xD;
      motivation as that of traditional tobacco cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine the punishment potential of e-cigarettes in a secondary&#xD;
      research question, using questionnaires on withdrawal and on the consequences of smoking,&#xD;
      both for traditional tobacco and for e-cigarettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this project are relevant for the development of preventive healthcare and new&#xD;
      treatment options. The neurobiological approach will also provide implications for&#xD;
      individualized therapy by identifying consumer groups with different neuronal patterns.&#xD;
