      The second primary molar (SPM) development start at the same time as development of the first&#xD;
      permanent molars (FPM) and permanent incisors so any systemic disturbance - causing stunted&#xD;
      growth -occur , will result in hypo-mineralization of SPM as well as FPM and permanent&#xD;
      incisors (Butler 1967, Weerheijm and Mejàre 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature shows no previous studies that discuss the association between hypo-&#xD;
      mineralized second primary molar (HSPM), MIH and the stunted growth in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aim: Estimate Prevalence of HSPM and MIH in stunted children.Evaluate the association between&#xD;
      HSPM, MIH and the stunted growth in a group of Egyptian children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The diagnostic criteria for MIH established based on the European Academy of Pediatric&#xD;

      HSPM, MIH and the stunted growth in a group of Egyptian children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Methods of selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stunted children aged from 5 to 8 years attending outpatient clinic in Pediatric&#xD;
           Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University will be included in this&#xD;
           study according to eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained from children parents or guardians accepting to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Medical and sociodemographic data will be recorded in patient&#xD;
           chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children will be examined clinically on dental units using artificial light. Wet cotton&#xD;
           swabs will be used to prior to examination to remove excess plaque or saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnostic criteria for MIH established based on the European Academy of Pediatric&#xD;
           Dentistry criteria (Weerheijm and Mejàre 2003) while diagnostic criteria for HSPM was&#xD;
           established by (Elfrink et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained through clinical examination on participant children for MIH and HSPM&#xD;
      according to the diagnosis criteria that we selected and the result will be collected in form&#xD;
      of percentage for both conditions and the data will be analysis to show the relation between&#xD;
      those conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of numerical/ quantitative variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerical data will be explored for normality by checking the data distribution, calculating&#xD;
      the mean and median values and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro- Wilk tests. If the data&#xD;
      was found to be normally distributed, it will be presented as mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      values. If the assumption of normality was found to be violated, the data will be presented&#xD;
      as median and range values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of categorical/ qualitative variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data will be represented as frequency (n) and percentage (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data will be represented as frequency (n) and percentage (%) and will be analyzed&#xD;
      using chi square test. Numerical data will be explored for normality by checking the data&#xD;
      distribution, calculating the mean and median values and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk tests. If the data was found to be normally distributed, it will be presented as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation values and independent t-test will be used for the analysis. The&#xD;
      significance level will be set at P ≤0.05 for all tests. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with IBM® SPSS® Statistics Version 26 for Windows.&#xD;
