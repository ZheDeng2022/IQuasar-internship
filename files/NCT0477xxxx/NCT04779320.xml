  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab is a medicine that helps to reduce inflammation and pain in the digestive system.&#xD;
      In this study, children and teenagers with moderate to severe Crohn's disease will be treated&#xD;
      with vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to check if participants achieve remission after treatment with&#xD;
      the vedolizumab. Remission means symptoms improve or disappear and an endoscopy shows no&#xD;
      signs of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 3 infusions of vedolizumab over 6 weeks. Then, those who have a&#xD;
      clinical response will receive either a high dose or low dose of vedolizumab once every 8&#xD;
      weeks. They will receive the same dose every time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to&#xD;
      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 3 doses of vedolizumab IV infusion at Day 1, Week 2, and Week 6&#xD;
      based on their baseline weight in the Induction Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 14, participants who achieve clinical response will be randomized in the 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      2 double-blind dose groups (high dose and low dose) within each of the 3 weight groups and&#xD;
      will receive respective treatment up to Week 46 in the Maintenance Period as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the discretion of the investigator, participants receiving the low dose (150 or 100 mg) of&#xD;
      vedolizumab IV may be escalated to the high dose (300, 200 or 150 mg) or receive rescue&#xD;
      therapy with corticosteroids, if the participants demonstrate disease worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is 54 weeks and 2 years of long term follow-up (up to 104 weeks). After the Week 54,&#xD;
      participants may be eligible to participate in extension Study. Participants will make&#xD;
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone after receiving their last&#xD;
      dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical remission is defined by PCDAI score ≤ 10. The PCDAI was specifically designed for use in children. The PCDAI includes a child-specific item: the height velocity variable as well as three laboratory parameters: HCT (adjusted for age and sex), ESR, and albumin level. The PCDAI score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more active disease. A score of &lt;10 will be consistent with inactive disease, 11 to 30 will indicate mild disease, and &gt;30 will indicate moderate to severe disease.</description>

SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, leads to congenital anomaly/birth defect and/or is important medical event. An AESI (serious or non-serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to compound or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by investigator.
