      The aim of the project is to experimentally determine the effect of the choice of finger for&#xD;
      the placement of a pulse oximeter sensor on the results of measuring peripheral blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) in a healthy person with short-term hypoxia and hypercapnia.&#xD;

      The aim of the project is to experimentally determine the effect of the choice of finger for&#xD;
      the placement of a pulse oximeter sensor on the results of measuring peripheral blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) in a healthy person with short-term hypoxia and hypercapnia. This is an&#xD;
      intervention prospective study that will take place at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering,&#xD;
      especially on FBMI students. The experiment consists of two phases, in which in the first&#xD;
      phase, the volunteers will inhale the hypoxic mixture for five minutes after the&#xD;
      stabilization phase. In the second phase, volunteers inhale a hypoxic and hypercapnic&#xD;
      mixture. During the experiment, non-invasive SpO2 measurements will be performed continuously&#xD;
      on individual fingers of both volunteer hands.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The experiment can help determine if it depends on which finger the finger sensor will be placed to measure SpO2. Appropriate finger selection for SpO2 measurements could help to better interpret the measured values and possibly increase the success in diagnosing health events.</description>

    <description>The experiment consists of two separate phases. In one phase, the volunteers inhale one of the mixtures for five minutes. After enough time of recovery, the volunteers undergo the other phase in which they inhale the other mixture of gases. Both phases of the measurement will begin with a two-minute stabilization phase, during which the physiological values of the volunteer will be checked. During the experiment, non-invasive SpO2 measurements will be performed continuously on the individual fingers of both volunteer hands throughout the experiment.</description>
