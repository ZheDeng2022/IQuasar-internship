      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized in a group recieiving a Mediterranean diet (3 mediterranean meals a day)&#xD;
      and dietary coaching (1 session per week for 4 weeks) or a group with conventional hospital&#xD;
      food and psychoeducation on depression (1 session per week for 4 weeks).&#xD;
