    <textblock>
      Treatment will consist of a PARP inhibitor (niraparib) monotherapy priming period (cycle 0;&#xD;
      21 days); an anti-PD-1 antibody (Dostarlimab ; TSR-042) will then be added from C1D1 every 21&#xD;
      days in combination for the first 4 cycles, and then every 42 days. Disease will be assessed&#xD;
      every 2 cycles (6 weeks) from C3D1 by CT-scan (or MRI or bone scan, if relevant). Patients&#xD;
      still under treatment after 1 year may have tumor evaluation spaced out every 3 cycles&#xD;
