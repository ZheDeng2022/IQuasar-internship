    <textblock>
      Background: Open repair remains the gold standard for fit patients with complex AAA. In the&#xD;
      past decade, an evolution of devices, design, components, and delivery systems expanded the&#xD;
      application of EVAR in these challenging anatomies. Fenestrated stent-grafts are now&#xD;
      commercially available for the repair of complex AAA in the United States and Europe. Initial&#xD;
      reports have demonstrated a high technical success rate, low renal dysfunction rate, and low&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, with promising short- and long-term results. Other reports have&#xD;
      shown excessive morbidity and mortality with fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR). Studies comparing&#xD;
      endovascular and open repair are sparse, especially when it concerns long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      There are till nowadays only two propensity score-matched studies, one showing worse&#xD;
      short-term and another long-term clinical outcome for fenestrated-branched EVAR (F/BEVAR)&#xD;
      over open surgical repair (OSR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study will be to compare F/BEVAR versus open AAA repair on short- and&#xD;
      long-term clinical outcomes for the treatment of juxta- and pararenal AAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a prospective cohort study from the four high-volume AAA repair centers:&#xD;
      Belgrade/Serbia, Bologna/Italy, Milan/Italy, Dijklander/Netherland, Amsterdam/Netherland, and&#xD;
      Helsinki/Finland. Data will be collected on demographics, baseline comorbidities, AAA&#xD;
      parameters (diameter and localization), laboratory values, intra-, and postoperative data.&#xD;
      Follow-up examinations (clinical visits and color duplex ultrasonography, CT scans) will be&#xD;
      performed 1, 6, and 12 months after the intervention, and annually thereafter. Propensity&#xD;
      score analysis will be performed by matching open repair patients to endovascularly treated&#xD;
      controlling for demographics and baseline comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary endpoints are all-cause mortality and the freedom from aortic-related&#xD;
      reintervention. The secondary endpoint is the 30-day complication rate, especially acute&#xD;
      kidney injury according to the RIFLE criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gained widespread&#xD;
      acceptance in the treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Prospective&#xD;
      randomized trials (RCTs) have demonstrated several short-term advantages over open repair&#xD;
      such as less blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. The&#xD;
      applicability of EVAR is limited by the presence of inadequate neck or involvement of the&#xD;
      visceral arteries. Thus consequently open AAA repair is now being performed primarily for&#xD;
      complex aortic anatomies, such as juxtarenal and pararenal aneurysms. Open repair remains the&#xD;
      gold standard for fit patients with complex AAA. In the past decade, an evolution of devices,&#xD;
      design, components and delivery systems expanded the application of EVAR in these challenging&#xD;
      anatomies. Fenestrated stent-grafts are now commercially available for the repair of complex&#xD;
      AAA in the United States and Europe. Initial reports have demonstrated a high technical&#xD;
      success rate, low renal dysfunction rate and low morbidity and mortality with promising&#xD;
      short- and long-term results. Other reports have shown excessive morbidity and mortality with&#xD;
      fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR). Studies comparing endovascular and open repair are sparse,&#xD;
      especially when it concerns long-term outcomes. There are till nowadays only two propensity&#xD;
      score-matched studies, one showing worse short-term and another long-term clinical outcome&#xD;
      for fenestrated-branched EVAR (F/BEVAR) over open surgical repair (OSR). Vascular surgeons&#xD;
      are therefore left with a paucity of data to guide decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary aim: Compare Kaplan-Meier freedom from aortic related reintervention and&#xD;
           all-cause mortality rate between endovascular and open repair group Primary endpoint:&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier survival rate and Kaplan-Meier aortic related reintervention rate after the&#xD;
           patient recruitment ends&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary aim: compare short term outcomes in terms of 30-day complications rate,&#xD;
           especially acute kidney injury according to the RIFLE criteria Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
           30-day complications rate, especially acute kidney injury according to the RIFLE&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients (over 18 years of age) with a history of juxta- and pararenal AAA repair&#xD;
           from January 2011 to January 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All management strategies will be included (endovascular and open)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are under 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have ruptured AAA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (ThAAA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have a mycotic AAA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with connective tissue disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To ensure sufficient statistical power to answer hypothetical questions,&#xD;
      approximately 700 subjects will be entered into the database. Aortic-related reintervention&#xD;
      rate is the primary endpoint being used to calculate the sample size. Assuming a difference&#xD;
      of 7% in the late reintervention rate between endovascular and open repair, 221 patients&#xD;
      would be required in each arm to achieve a statistical power of 85% at p=0.05. With two arms&#xD;
      (endovascular versus open), assuming a 20% rate of missing data, a total N of 550 patients is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study including patients treated for juxta- and pararenal AAA from 2011&#xD;
      through 2021 treated at six different vascular surgery centers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Belgrade, Serbia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Department of Vascular Surgery, Policlinico S. Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Department of Vascular Surgery, San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Department of Vascular Surgery, Dijklander Ziekenhuis, Hoorn, Netherlands&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Department of Vascular Surgery, Amsterdam University Hospital, Amsterdam, Netherlands&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Department of Vascular Surgery, Helsinki Unversity Hospital, Helsinki, Finland&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Involved The study does not involve any patient contact and will not impact the&#xD;
      care that patients receive. Data regarding the patients will be compiled and analyzed to&#xD;
      accomplish the proposed study objectives. Data collection will include demographic&#xD;
      information, patient-related factors, and comorbidities, diagnostic imaging information,&#xD;
      laboratory data, surgical procedure information, complications of the surgery, and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-Institutional research After the data has been collected at a participating&#xD;
      institution, the data will be transmitted to a central analytic center located at the Clinic&#xD;
      for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery/Clinical Center of Serbia/Medical Faculty, University&#xD;
      of Belgrade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to Subjects As this is a prospective observational study, there is no potential for&#xD;
      physical risks to subjects. There is a minimal risk of breach of confidentiality that could&#xD;
      occur when patient information is collected and analyzed for the proposed study. However,&#xD;
      appropriate measures will be taken to minimize the risk as much as possible. All information&#xD;
      recorded will be de-identified. This study will abide by all regulations related to&#xD;
      protecting human subjects and protected health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits to Subjects There is no direct benefit to the subjects. However, future&#xD;
      patients with juxta- and pararenal AAA may benefit from improved care as a result of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Data Analysis Continuous variables will be described using the median and&#xD;
      interquartile range or mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables will be described&#xD;
      using frequencies and percentages. Group comparisons will be performed by using the Student&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Categorical data will be expressed as&#xD;
      percentages and were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Propensity&#xD;
      score analysis will be performed by matching endovascular to open surgery group in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio controlling for demographics, baseline comorbidities, and AAA parameters. Differences&#xD;
      will be considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05. The cumulative incidences of&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and aortic-related complications will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method. Differences between curves will be tested using the log-rank test. Analyses will be&#xD;
      done with SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of Interest The investigators have no conflict of interest to report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding Source There are no plans to apply for grants or additional funding. No funding is&#xD;
      required for the completion of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Plan All research personnel listed on this protocol will be eligible for&#xD;
      authorship in any resulting abstracts and publications in accordance with the qualifications&#xD;
      outlined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The order of authors will&#xD;
      be determined prior to manuscript development and depend on each individual's contribution to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
