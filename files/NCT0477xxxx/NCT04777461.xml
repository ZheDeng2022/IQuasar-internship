  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and pilot an evidence-based structured education program that&#xD;
      can be run in groups to enable women with PCOS to make lifestyle changes, which will help&#xD;
      them improve their PCOS and reduce the risk of future PCOS-related complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this project is to develop an evidence-based structured education programme&#xD;
      for women with PCOS. According to the Medical Research Council framework for complex&#xD;
      interventions, robust patient-education programmes should have an evidence-based structured&#xD;
      written curriculum, which is delivered by trained educators and is regularly assessed and&#xD;
      audited. To meet these standards, the investigators first aim to develop a written curriculum&#xD;
      for the structured education programme, written presentation material for the educational&#xD;
      sessions and participants' handouts, but also material for training for the educators who&#xD;
      will deliver the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The philosophy of the programme is based on patient empowerment. The structured group&#xD;
      education programme will be based on psychological theories of learning including the&#xD;
      Leventhal's common-sense theory, the dual-process theory, and the social learning theory.&#xD;
      Similar to previous successful programmes in diabetes education and based on the experience&#xD;
      gained by conducting the education programme &quot;Living with type 2 diabetes&quot; in our centre, the&#xD;
      programme will be designed as a six-hour of education programme with a formal and informed&#xD;
      curriculum. It will be offered in two three-hour sessions of teaching for 8-12 PCOS women at&#xD;
      a time. Attendees will be encouraged to be accompanied by a person of their choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial thoughts on the curriculum and the format of the written material have been already&#xD;
      discussed within our clinical and research team (Dr Papageorgiou, Professor Sathyapalan, Mrs&#xD;
      Baldwin consultant endocrinologists, general practitioners and dietitian&#xD;
      specialists/educators delivering the &quot;Living with Diabetes&quot; education programme for patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes) based on their experience and views expressed to them by women with&#xD;
      PCOS. As such, the areas that will be covered in the structured education programme include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoughts and feelings of the participants around PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding PCOS pathophysiology: what happens in the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding the risk factors (e.g., obesity) and health risks associated with PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emotional wellbeing and PCOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of PCOS symptoms -how to take control:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pharmacological options (i.e., hormonal contraceptives, anti-androgens, and insulin&#xD;
                sensitisers)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lifestyle changes (i.e., basics of energy balance, healthy eating based on Eat well&#xD;
                Plate, mindful eating, physical activity recommendations, practical advice).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning for the future (e.g., family planning, screening for long-term conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, the investigators are also going to conduct a patients' survey to find out what&#xD;
      women with PCOS expect to gain from an educational programme addressing several aspects of&#xD;
      PCOS. The investigators will use the collected data to further refine the aspects of PCOS&#xD;
      that will be included in the final curriculum of the programme.&#xD;
