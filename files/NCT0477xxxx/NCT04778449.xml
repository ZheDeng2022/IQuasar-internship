    <textblock>
      This study investigates the extent to which lifestyle factors including mental health, social&#xD;
      support, diet, and exercise are associated with quality of life and melanoma patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Knowledge gained from this study may be used to guide the design of prospective&#xD;
      clinical trials of lifestyle interventions to improve the outcomes of melanoma patients and&#xD;
      assist doctors in counseling their patients.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collect systematic data on mental health, quality of life (QOL), social support, diet, and&#xD;
      exercise behaviors in melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with clinical outcomes&#xD;
      in melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Examine the association between lifestyle and psychosocial factors and tissue and blood&#xD;
      biomarkers in melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Examine whether psychosocial factors and lifestyle are associated with QOL adjustment in&#xD;
      melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a maximum of 3 paper or electronic questionnaires over 30 minutes within 2&#xD;
      weeks of presentation to MD Anderson, new diagnosis of melanoma, and/or initiating a new&#xD;
      treatment, within 2 weeks of first restaging, and within 2 weeks of the end of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients may complete an additional paper or electronic dietary questionnaire over 10 minutes&#xD;
      for 3 days (30 minutes total) or a phone-based dietary recall. Patients who start a new&#xD;
      treatment of interest may repeat the questionnaires at the same time points. Patients'&#xD;
      medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
