      Introduction: Suicide is one of the leading public health issues worldwide. Mobile health can&#xD;
      help us to combat suicide through monitoring and treatment. The SmartCrisis 2.0 randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Intervention to prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: The SmartCrisis 2.0 study is a randomized clinical trial with two&#xD;
      parallel groups, conducted among patients with a history of suicidal behaviour treated at the&#xD;
      University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz. The intervention group will be monitored using&#xD;
      Ecological Momentary Assessment and will receive an Ecological Momentary Intervention called&#xD;
      'SmartSafe' in addition to their treatment as usual (TAU). TAU will consist of psychiatric&#xD;
      follow-up of the patient (scheduled appointments with a psychiatrist) in our outpatient&#xD;
      Suicide Prevention clinic, with predetermined clinical appointments according to the Brief&#xD;
      Intervention Contact recommendations (1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 weeks, and 4, 6, 9 and 12 months).&#xD;
      The control group would receive TAU and be monitored using EMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz. It is expected that, in the near future, the&#xD;
      mobile applications MEmind and eB2 can be implemented in routine clinical practice. Results&#xD;
      will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and psychiatric congresses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Over 800,000 die every year by suicide, while suicide attempts are estimated to&#xD;
      be 20 times more frequent. Suicidal ideation (SI) is estimated to affect 2% of the&#xD;
      population. Suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) increase the risk of death by suicide,&#xD;
      impair people's quality of life and result in high healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies can help us in the management and prevention of STB. Among other advantages,&#xD;
      these devices open the possibility of implementing smartphone-based real-time monitoring.&#xD;
      There are two main types of smartphone-based monitoring: active and passive. The active mode&#xD;
      is also known as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). EMA involves asking daily questions,&#xD;
      resulting in real-time responses in the patient's usual environment. EMA provides a more&#xD;
      accurate picture of the emotional and cognitive context in which SI appears, offering us the&#xD;
      opportunity to identify its immediate predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive monitoring -also called passive EMA- involves using the mobile phone's native sensors&#xD;
      to collect information such as physical activity, mobility or sleep, which can be useful as&#xD;
      proxy factors for mental state. The combination of active and passive monitoring produces&#xD;
      valuable information to characterize people's behaviour, giving rise to what is known as an&#xD;
      individual's digital phenotype (Barrigón et al., 2019). As it does not require patient&#xD;
      effort, passive EMA can increase the acceptability of monitoring and counteract the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;EMA fatigue&quot;, which occurs when patients stop answering EMA questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A considerable number of studies have applied EMA technology to suicide research. In&#xD;
      contrast, passive EMA has been used scarcely in suicidology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further step is to exploit EMA's potential to design digital therapeutic tools, providing&#xD;
      continuous support in the patient's usual environment. This is known as Ecological Momentary&#xD;
      Intervention (EMI). EMIs can be a useful add-on to traditional treatment, thanks to their&#xD;
      24-hour availability, low cost, and the possibility of continuing follow-up in a&#xD;
      non-presential manner. Some studies have explored the effectiveness of EMI on suicidal&#xD;
      behaviour, showing good acceptability and a reduction in SI after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an up-and-coming area that may contribute to suicide prevention, which has not yet&#xD;
      received sufficient attention in the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SmartCrisis 2.0 randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) combined with smartphone-based monitoring for the&#xD;
      prevention of STB in patients at high risk of suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before/after comparison: In the intervention group, there will be a significant&#xD;
           reduction in STB and an improvement in functionality and quality of life after the&#xD;
           follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison with control group: The intervention group will have a greater reduction in&#xD;
           STB and a greater improvement in functioning and quality of life than the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Feasibility and acceptability: The use of the eB2 and MEmind mobile applications will be&#xD;
           feasible and well accepted by psychiatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Our sample will consist of patients with a history of recent STB&#xD;
      treated at either one of these five locations: University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz&#xD;
      (Madrid, Spain), Rey Juan Carlos Hospital (Móstoles, Spain), and General Hospital of Villalba&#xD;
      (Villalba, Spain), Centre hospitalier universitaire Montpellier (Montpellier, France) or&#xD;
      Nîmes University Hospital (Nîmes, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed using G*Power software, version 3.1. Based on previous&#xD;
      clinical trials exploring the ability of crisis management interventions to reduce SI in the&#xD;
      mid-term (Ducasse et al., 2018), the investigators estimated a target sample size enough to&#xD;
      have 80% power to detect between-group differences of 6-7 points on the Columbia Suicide&#xD;
      Severity Rating Scale (25% decrease in the intensity of SI in the intervention group). The&#xD;
      alpha error was set at 5% and the power at 80%. A dropout rate of 20% and a randomization&#xD;
      imbalance of 10% were assummed. With these settings, the investigators estimated that a total&#xD;
      of 220 participants, 110 in each arm, were needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the clinical trial, a pilot will be conducted, in approximately 40 patients&#xD;
      will be recruited. All of them will receive the SmartSafe EMI and be monitored using active&#xD;
      and passive EMA. These patients will not be part of the final analysis. After three months of&#xD;
      follow-up, when all participants have had time to try out the application, a focus group will&#xD;
      be held between the research team, the attending clinicians and the patients in order to get&#xD;
      their opinion on the intervention and to identify possible technical and human failures that&#xD;
      could be improved before starting the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the clinical trial recruitment starts, attending psychiatrists will check their&#xD;
      patients' eligibility during their regular appointment, explain the project in detail and&#xD;
      invite them to participate. If patients agree to participate, they will be asked to sign the&#xD;
      informed consent, after which they will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (EMI +&#xD;
      EMA + TAU) or the control group (EMA + TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline interview, a psychiatrist will assess the characteristics of the last&#xD;
      suicidal event using the Brief Suicide Protocol, which has been previously published, and&#xD;
      they will set up the SmartSafe intervention according to the patient's preferences. Next, a&#xD;
      trained research assistant, blind to the patient's assigned arm, will administer the&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for one year, with face-to-face visits at six months and one year.&#xD;
      The attending psychiatrist will also check for STB using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale (CSSRS) at the 4th week, 11th week and 9th-month appointments. If participants cannot&#xD;
      attend the follow-up visits, the assessments will be performed by phone. All questionnaires&#xD;
      will be completed via the MEmind website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The piloting is expected to take place between June and December 2021. Recruitment is&#xD;
      expected to commence in January 2022 and to be completed by June 2023. Data collection will&#xD;
      take place from 2022 to 2024. Data analysis will take place from 2022 to 2024. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to publish partial results by the end of 2022 and final results by early&#xD;
      2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital monitoring will be performed using EMA. Two EMA modalities will be used: active using&#xD;
      the MEmind app, and passive using the eB2 app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MEmind app asks short daily questions that appear on the mobile screen. Each day, 2-4&#xD;
      random questions will be asked at random times (respecting sleep hours) from the pool of 34&#xD;
      questions that make up the questionnaire based on the Salzburg Suicide Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMA questions belong to 6 categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suicidality (5 questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-suicidal self injury (2 questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affect (9 questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interpersonal experiences (11 questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep (4 questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eating (3 questions) The eB2 app runs in the background and does not require user&#xD;
           intervention. It collects real-time information from the patient's mobile phone&#xD;
           (location, mobility, smartphone usage and sleep), stores it and downloads it to a&#xD;
           server. All the information collected from the phone is transformed with a hash&#xD;
           function. This hash function makes it impossible to know the original data but allows&#xD;
           the analysis of behavioral patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the smartphone-based monitoring, another digital assessment will be carried&#xD;
      out: a neuropsychological assessment using a previously validated Virtual Reality&#xD;
      environment, the &quot;Spheres &amp; Shield Maze Task&quot;. This tool recreates a maze with different&#xD;
      tasks to assess decision-making, impulsivity, attention and cognitive inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-digital assessments will be carried out by attending psychiatrists and research&#xD;
      assistants, all of them previously trained. All questionnaires will be completed on the&#xD;
      MEmind website, which allows for easy completion and immediate uploading to databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the main tools used will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Brief Suicide Questionnaire (BSQ) will be used to characterize the index event that&#xD;
           motivated inclusion in the study (suicide attempt or emergency referral for SI). It&#xD;
           includes questions on lethality, method and surrounding circumstances of the attempt,&#xD;
           and lifetime history of suicidal behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CSSRS scale will be used to measure STB, both at baseline and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will verify suicide attempts and deaths by suicide through our&#xD;
           organization's digital medical records, called the Casiopea software, which integrates&#xD;
           information on ER visits, hospitalizations, and visits to specialist consultations. If a&#xD;
           patient cannot be located, and there is no information in their record, the&#xD;
           investigators will contact the patient's family telephone number. The investigators will&#xD;
           also request access to the Spanish register of deaths and causes of death of the&#xD;
           &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística&quot; [National Statistics Institute].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the six-month follow-up visit, patients will complete a qualitative satisfaction survey&#xD;
      with the following questions referring to each of the applications used (MEmind and eB2) and&#xD;
      the face-to-face assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 24.0 statistical software. To&#xD;
      compare SI at baseline with SI at the end of follow-up (CSSRS score), paired samples t-tests&#xD;
      will be used. To compare the improvement in SI after follow-up between the intervention group&#xD;
      and the control group, an independent samples t-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival curves (time to a new suicidal event) will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      test. The intervention group's survival curves and the control group will be compared using&#xD;
      the log rank test. To assess the project's feasibility, participation rate, retention and&#xD;
      percentage of EMA questions answered will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Binary logistic regression will be used to explore the correlation between the study&#xD;
      variables, obtaining crude and age- and sex-adjusted ORs. A multivariate regression model&#xD;
      will also be built to assess the unique strength of the association of the variables. Cox&#xD;
      regression analysis will be performed to explore variables associated with survival time&#xD;
      (time until next event). All tests will be two-tailed, with a significance level of p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      and 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the traditional analyses, with the Signal Theory Department of the Carlos III&#xD;
      University's support, unsupervised analyses will be carried out using machine learning&#xD;
      techniques to create behavioral models and patient activity profiles.&#xD;

    <description>The SmartSafe Ecological Momentary Intervention is contained in the MEmind smartphone application and consists of a Safety plan, an Enhanced contact via app (app-EC) intervention, and a &quot;mental toolbox&quot;. The Safety plan is a set of personalized coping strategies that the patient can use in a suicidal crisis. Our safety plan was adapted to a digital environment, including the possibility to activate pre-recorded messages, lead to websites with health resources, or put the patient in contact with the emergency services. The Enhanced contact via app (app-EC) intervention is inspired by the SIAM project and consists in messages that will be sent via the MEmind app inquiring patients about their mental well-being and informing them of the means to request preferential or urgent care. The mental toolbox contains videos relaxation techniques videos and behavioral activation and mentalization exercises.</description>
