  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) represents a diagnostic tool concerning&#xD;
      patients with Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). Application of such a tool&#xD;
      in the Greek clinical praxis requires validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation consists of three stages: translation, reverse translation, and patient&#xD;
      application. 100 oncologic patients were assessed by comparing the PNQ to the NCI-CTCAE at&#xD;
      the chemotherapy onset and 2nd, 4th, and 6th sessions. Specific requirements of the&#xD;
      diagnostic tool (compliance, validity, concordance, sensitivity, specificity, reliability)&#xD;
      were statistically evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between translated texts and between the reverse translation and the original&#xD;
      were considered negligible. At the 2nd, 4th and 6th session compliance was 98%, 95% and 93%&#xD;
      while Cronbach's α was 0,57 0,69 and 0,81 respectively. Cohen's weighted κ was 0,67 and 0,58,&#xD;
      Spearman's ρ was 0,7 and 0,98 while AUC of the ROC was 1 and 0,9 for the sensory and the&#xD;
      motor part respectively. The variance's linear regression analysis confirmed CIPN worsening&#xD;
      over time (p-value&lt;0,0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Greek version remains close to the original. Compliance rates reflect easy PNQ&#xD;
      application. Cohen's κ values highlight the physicians' tension to underestimate the&#xD;
      patients' condition. Spearman's ρ, Cronbach's α and AUC values reflect good validity,&#xD;
      reliability and specificity of the PNQ respectively. Finally, the linear analysis confirmed&#xD;
      the PNQ sensitivity over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PNQ validation in Greek adds a crucial tool in the physicians' armory. It can now draw&#xD;
      the necessary information to modify the chemotherapy and analgesic treatment schemes at both&#xD;
      preventive and acute levels.&#xD;
