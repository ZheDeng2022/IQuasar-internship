    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for patients with end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease. Short-term survival has improved due to improved surgical techniques and greater&#xD;
      efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs. At present, the 10-year survival after liver&#xD;
      transplantation is 60%, but long-term survival has not improved to the same extent the&#xD;
      short-term survival. In addition to liver- and transplant-related causes, comorbidities such&#xD;
      as cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and metabolic diseases have emerged as leading causes of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess the burden of comorbidities and identify both liver-&#xD;
      and transplant-related risk factors as well as traditional risk factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of comorbidity in liver transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DACOLT study is an observational, longitudinal study. The investigators aim to include&#xD;
      all adult liver transplant recipients in Denmark. Participants will be matched by sex and age&#xD;
      to controls from the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) and the Copenhagen City Heart&#xD;
      Study (CCHS). Physical and biological measures including blood pressure, ancle-brachial&#xD;
      index, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide, electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) angiography of the heart, unenhanced CT of chest and abdomen and&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected using uniform protocols in participants in CGPS, CCHS and&#xD;
      DACOLT. Blood samples will be collected and stored in a research biobank. Follow-up&#xD;
      examinations at regular intervals up to 10 years of follow-up are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no international consensus standard for optimal clinical care or monitoring of liver&#xD;
      transplant recipients. The study will determine prevalence, incidence and risk factors for&#xD;
      comorbidity in liver transplant recipients and may be used to provide evidence for guidelines&#xD;
      on screening and long-term treatment and thereby contribute to improvement of the long-term&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

    <description>Major Depression Inventory (MDI): A depression questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of the ten symptoms contained in the World Health Organization WHO's depression demarcation. The patient's completed questionnaire is scored using a scoring key.&#xD;

    <description>The Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) is an ongoing observational population study with more than 110.000 participants from the greater Copenhagen area. All residents in the greater Copenhagen area &gt; 40 years and 25% of 20-40 years old are invited to participate in the study and in follow-up examinations every decade. A random sample of 10.000 participants aged ≥ 40 years had a contrast enhanced CT of the chest including CT angiography of the heart performed. Of these, 6500 had a contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen.</description>
