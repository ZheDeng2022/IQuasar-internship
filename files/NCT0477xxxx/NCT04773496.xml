  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is known to increase the risk of fall and posturographic stabilometry, both static and&#xD;
      dynamic, are useful tools to assess postural stability. To our knowledge, no published&#xD;
      normative data for a healthy elderly population are available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of fall rise with ageing and is huge after 85yrs becoming one of the major problems&#xD;
      associated with aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computed dynamic posturographic EquiTest® System and Smart BalanceMaster by NeuroCom®&#xD;
      International, Inc, Clackamas, OR, USA) provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of&#xD;
      the balance function through the description of the subject's center of gravity (COG) sway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory Organization Test and Sensory Analysis norms are provided for age groups (20-59;&#xD;
      60-69; 70-79) up to 79yrs, whilst they lack in the international literature for subjects&#xD;
      80+yrs, nonetheless being necessary in the understanding of balance performance from a&#xD;
      quantitative point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 80+yrs are evaluated with EquiTest® System and Smart BalanceMaster to provide mean&#xD;
      values and normative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the reliability of the instrumental evaluation was repeated (T1) two weeks&#xD;
      later (±2 days).&#xD;
