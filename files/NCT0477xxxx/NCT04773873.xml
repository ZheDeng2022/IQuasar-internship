  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly available ceramic CAD-CAM blocs containing a screw channel for chairside-made crowns to&#xD;
      be adhesively cemented to a TiBase abutment and screw-retained to an implant are appealing to&#xD;
      the clinician, considering the time efficiency (one appointment) and overall lower costs as&#xD;
      no dental laboratory is involved. The hypotheses are that the biological (BOP, PD, PCR,&#xD;
      implant bone level) and mechanical outcomes (fracture, loss of retention, wear) are&#xD;
      equivalent to implant screw-retained Porcelain-Fused-to-Metal (PFM) crowns over a 5 year&#xD;
      observation time.This RCT will provide key information as to the cost/benefit, suitability&#xD;
      and/or limitations of these chair-side hybrid-abutment crowns in the posterior region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This RCT involves the University of Geneva Dental School and four private practices for which&#xD;
      the Geneva Hospital Ethic Committee's approval is required. Patients in need for replacement&#xD;
      of single unit posterior teeth will be recruited at the Dental School as well as in the 5&#xD;
      private practices based on specific selection criteria. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      a restorative group using a computer-generated random number table for allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAD-CAM blocs containing a screw channel for implant-retained chairside-made single-unit&#xD;
      hybrid-abutment crowns are 1) Lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (e.max CAD) (G1) and 2)&#xD;
      feldspath-ceramic infiltrated by polymer (Enamic) (G2). The CAD-CAM crowns are adhesively&#xD;
      cemented to titanium base abutments (Ti-base) and screw-retained to Titanium implants&#xD;
      (Straumann Standard Plus) in the premolar (RN) and molar region (WN). Controls are&#xD;
      screw-retained PFM crowns (G3). The number of crowns in each group is N=30 (15 molars and 15&#xD;
      premolars) which gives a total of 90 crowns for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recalled after 1 week-10 days after crown insertion (baseline, T0) and then&#xD;
      yearly during 5 years (T1-T5). Digital X-Rays are taken at T0, T1, T3 and T5 with&#xD;
      repositionable individual resin bite registrations.&#xD;

    <description>The primary aim is to monitor and compare the survival of the two CAD-CAM hybrid abutment crown materials with that of PFM implant screw-retained crowns in the posterior region over a period of 5 years. The survival data is subdivided into &quot;absolute failures&quot; needing replacement of the restoration and &quot;relative failures&quot; which include complications that could be repaired.</description>

    <measure>Occlusal surface wear</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Surface wear generated at occlusal contacts from antagonist teeth will be monitored using silicone replicas of the crowns poured with epoxy resin and gold-cotaed for scanning electron microscopy. The contact wear surface will be expressed in mm^2. The average roughness in Ra values.</description>
