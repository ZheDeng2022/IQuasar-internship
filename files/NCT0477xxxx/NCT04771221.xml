  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will issue a Patient Information Consent for the participant in the study.&#xD;
      1.Patients will be asked to complete the Reflux Symptom Index questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical survey, medical history 2. Objective methods for assessing the patient's condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - examination of ENT organs: rhinoscopy, otoscopy, pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy 3.&#xD;
      Laboratory and instrumental research methods - Endoscopic laryngoscopy and video&#xD;
      laryngoscopy. pH-metry: The collection of mucus from the laryngopharynx for the determination&#xD;
      of acid-base values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Sociological method: determination of lifestyle, nutrition, the presence or absence of bad&#xD;
      habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Subjective methods for assessing the condition of the larynx - Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. –ênalysis of the received data&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete the Reflux Symptom Index questionnaire. An analysis of the results of the effectiveness of this method in patients with complaints of sore throat, coughing, burning sensation in the throat, cough, frequent sore throat, difficulty swallowing, lump in the throat, feeling of a foreign body in the throat, voice change, heartburn, belching will be carried out. The severity of the problem is calculated as the summation of all points. The problem is absent if the summation of points is 0. The problem is serious if the summation of points is 5.</description>
