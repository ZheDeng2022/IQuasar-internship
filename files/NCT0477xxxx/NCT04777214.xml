  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke often causes substantial problems in speaking or understanding speech. Treatments for&#xD;
      these problems are currently very limited. Limited studies to date suggest that repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the side of the brain opposite to the side on&#xD;
      which the stroke occurred may improve language function. The investigators are testing this&#xD;
      hypothesis by giving daily 20 minute sessions of repeated TMS to the right (unaffected) side&#xD;
      of the brain; the investigators test language function with a variety of tests both before&#xD;
      and after the treatment with TMS and subjects are required to undergo functional MRI scans&#xD;
      before and after treatment. TMS is a procedure in which a coil is placed next to the head of&#xD;
      the subject and an electrical current passes through the coil causing a magnetic field that,&#xD;
      in turn, causes a small electric current in the portion of the brain underneath the coil.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study involves two arms. The study involves a sham treatment control for half of the patients; all patients randomized to the sham treatment will be enrolled in the treatment phase after completing the sham treatment. Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm or the sham treatment arm of the study. There are 3 phases: a pre-treatment evaluation phase in which baseline language and imaging data are obtained and the optimal site for stimulation is determined; a treatment phase during which TMS is delivered on 10 occasions; and a post-treatment phase during which effects of the treatment will be assessed using behavioral measures as well as fMRI at 2 and 6-months. Participants in the sham arm will undergo the same behavioral testing, MRI, and fMRI that will be administered in the treatment protocol. After the 2-month follow up visit, patients in the sham arm will be told that they did not receive real TMS and will be offered the opportunity to enter the treatment arm.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aphasic patients will have had single, unilateral left hemisphere ischemic stroke,&#xD;
             which spared the supplementary motor area (SMA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With the exception of lacunar infarcts less than â‰¤ 1.5 cm (as measured by&#xD;
             neuroimaging), the stroke causing the patients' impairments must be the only stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aphasic patients will be at least 6 months post-stroke and have mild-severe,&#xD;
             non-fluent speech&#xD;
