  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, there are few studies on the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients at high altitude area, and there are no studies on the relationship between oxygen&#xD;
      inhalation and fatigue after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients at high altitude. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to explore whether oxygen inhalation can improve fatigue at high&#xD;
      altitude through this prospective randomized study. In our study, a single center,&#xD;
      open-label, randomized phase 2 clinical trial will conduct to investigate whether oxygen&#xD;
      inhalation during chemotherapy can improve chemotherapy-related fatigue in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer. The effects of oxygen inhalation on side effects of chemotherapy such as&#xD;
      Cancer related fatigue (CRF) were observed. The investigators intend to explore whether&#xD;
      oxygen therapy can improve fatigue at high altitude through this prospective randomized&#xD;
      study. The investigators enrolled breast cancer patients before chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the checklist individual strength(CIS) and the brief fatigue inventory&#xD;
      (BFI) to evaluate the fatigue status of patients, and extract the blood of patients for&#xD;
      evaluate blood pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 β, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      transforming growth factor (TGF-β), soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor II&#xD;
      (sTNF-RII), inducible factor-1(HIF-1), Hypoxia inducible factor-2(HIF-2)in the plasma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common symptom experienced by patients from cancer diagnosis to the end&#xD;
      of life. CRF is different from other types of fatigue. It is severe, persistent and can not&#xD;
      be alleviated by rest or sleep. CRF affects nearly 65% of cancer patients, more than&#xD;
      two-thirds believe that severe CRF lasts at least 6 months, and one-third report that fatigue&#xD;
      persists for several years after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of CRF has not been fully elucidated, although it may involve several&#xD;
      physiological and biochemical systems, which may vary with tumor type, disease stage and&#xD;
      treatment. Recently, several cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators produced in&#xD;
      tryptophan degradation and cancer response are associated with fatigue; however, their direct&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of fatigue remains controversial. Cytokines may play a role at a&#xD;
      variety of levels, including mood, muscle mass, strength and metabolic status, and thus are&#xD;
      associated with the pathophysiology of fatigue. Recent studies have shown that fatigue is&#xD;
      positively correlated with circulating levels of inflammatory markers, especially IL-6, IL-1&#xD;
      and neopterin, which are significantly correlated with CRF. CRF is also common in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients, and the incidence rate of CRF is increasing as the incidence of breast&#xD;
      cancer increases. In the treatment of breast cancer patients， chemotherapy can cause some&#xD;
      patients' non hematological side effects such as fatigue. During the chemotherapy of breast&#xD;
      cancer at high altitude area, clinical observation showed that the incidence rate of side&#xD;
      effects after chemotherapy was higher in plateau area. Retrospectively analyzed the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of epirubicin combined with taxanes chemotherapy in the treatment of 48 cases of&#xD;
      breast cancer in high altitude areas of Tibet. It was found that 89.5% of the patients with&#xD;
      neutropenia after chemotherapy were significantly higher than those in low altitude areas,&#xD;
      which also confirmed this phenomenon. The increased side effects of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy in cancer patients at high altitude are closely related to hypoxia. The oxygen&#xD;
      content and oxygen partial pressure in the atmosphere of plateau area also decrease with the&#xD;
      increase of altitude, and the oxygen partial pressure in human alveoli also decreases, so the&#xD;
      arterial oxygen partial pressure and saturation also decrease. A number of studies have shown&#xD;
      that the special hypoxia environment at high altitude will have a lot of effects on the human&#xD;
      body. In terms of cardiovascular system, it will make pulmonary hypertension and heart rate&#xD;
      increase, and make the heart bear a heavy pressure load, leading to the occurrence of high&#xD;
      altitude heart disease. In terms of nervous system, chronic hypoxia environment is prone to&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing at night, which seriously affects the brain nerve function and&#xD;
      leads to heart failure sleep structure disorder. On the other hand, in order to adapt to the&#xD;
      outside world, the human body in the plateau environment, within a certain limit, through the&#xD;
      regulation of the nervous system and body fluid mechanism, carries out a series of&#xD;
      adjustments and stress reactions, It makes a series of physiological changes in body fluid,&#xD;
      hemorheology, blood biochemistry, blood gas and organ function, and some pathological&#xD;
      changes, resulting in changes in physiological indexes, drug plasma protein binding rate,&#xD;
      drug metabolic enzyme activity and expression, and inflammatory factors in blood. The&#xD;
      investigators speculate that the above factors lead to the increase of side effects after&#xD;
      chemotherapy at high altitude, especially the influence of inflammatory cytokines in the&#xD;
      blood, leading to the occurrence of CRF.&#xD;

    <description>We use the Checklist for Individual Strength（CIS）fatigue scale to compare the fatigue degree of the experimental group and the control group before and after chemotherapy. In our study, we selected 8 questions in the CIS scale, each patient should answer these 8 questions, and then record the score according to the patients' answers.
