  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in intensive care. About 50% of patients with&#xD;
      septic shock die after 1 year; and 50% of survivors suffer from cognitive decline. The&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of serious complications of sepsis are now well known. In fact,&#xD;
      the systemic inflammation related to sepsis amplifies the release of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and neurotoxic mediators, hence an increase in deleterious phenomena such as&#xD;
      oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial activation, disruption of the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier, neuroinflammation (astrocytic and microglial activation) leading to&#xD;
      multi-organ failure which compromises the patient's vital and functional prognosis. Although&#xD;
      there has been progress in the understanding of its pathophysiology, the management of sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock in intensive care relies mainly on anti-infective treatments and the&#xD;
      restoration of cardiovascular and respiratory functions. There is virtually no adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy for the management of sepsis, apart from a few hormonal therapies such as insulin to&#xD;
      maintain blood glucose levels below 180 mg / dL and low doses of corticosteroids and&#xD;
      vasopressin. There is therefore a pressing need to develop innovative treatments targeting&#xD;
      inflammatory and immunological processes in order to reduce the complications of sepsis and&#xD;
      improve patient prognosis. Some recent work has shown that electrical vagus nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (SNV), a technique used for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, can modulate&#xD;
      inflammatory and immune responses and control inflammation syndrome in animal models of&#xD;
      sepsis, arthritis and rheumatism in humans. In this pilot study the investigators plan to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of transcutaneous (non-invasive) SNV as an adjuvant treatment in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis in intensive care.&#xD;
