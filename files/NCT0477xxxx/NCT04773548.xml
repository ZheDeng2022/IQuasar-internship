  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project involves the application of a VR job training software. We propose to use&#xD;
      an interactive VR job interview practice system, Virtual Reality Job Interview Training&#xD;
      (VR-JIT), in youths with ASD at the highschool level. This system was developed to bolster&#xD;
      job interview practice skills and to help reduce anxiety in adults with ASD. However, it has&#xD;
      never before been used in individuals under the age of 18. Our hope is that if this program&#xD;
      is utilized in individuals while they are still in highschool, we can target those persons&#xD;
      before the window for which risk of unemployment appears to be highest for ASD youths,&#xD;
      immediately after high school graduation.&#xD;
