  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The co-primary objectives of this study are: 1) to investigate the effect adding a synbiotic&#xD;
      (combination of a pre-and probiotic) to iron-fortified follow-up formula (FUF) on iron&#xD;
      bioavailability, and 2) to investigate the effect adding Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs)&#xD;
      to iron-fortified FUF on iron bioavailability in 10-14 month-old Thai children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron stores of healthy, full-term neonates are supposed to cover iron needs for the first 4-6&#xD;
      months of life. After 6 months of age, requirements for absorbed iron are high, as infants&#xD;
      need to build body iron stores and triple their body weight before the first year of life.&#xD;
      Iron concentrations in mature breastmilk are low (~0.3 mg/L) and cannot adequately cover the&#xD;
      high iron requirements of children between 6 and 24 months of age. Follow-up formulas (FUF)&#xD;
      are fortified milk-based products intended for infants above 6 months of age and young&#xD;
      children aged 1-3 years, and are widely used as a liquid part of the weaning diet to&#xD;
      supplement the diet of young children with macro- and micronutrients. Prebiotics and&#xD;
      probiotics are increasingly added to foods for infants and young children due to emerging&#xD;
      evidence on possible health benefits. We recently showed that the addition of prebiotic&#xD;
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) to an iron-containing micronutrient powder increased iron&#xD;
      absorption in Kenyan infants. To our knowledge, the effect of the combination of pre- and&#xD;
      probiotics (synbiotic) or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) on iron absorption from an&#xD;
      iron-fortified FUF has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thai children (10-14 months old) will be assigned to receive FUF fortified with isotopically&#xD;
      labelled iron as FeSO4 1) with synbiotic, 2) HMO, and 3) without added prebiotics as a&#xD;
      reference, in random order. Besides the iron source and synbiotic or HMO, the test FUF will&#xD;
      be identical in terms of macro- and micronutrient composition. For the secondary objectives&#xD;
      of this study, which will have a single-group, before-after design, each infant will receive&#xD;
      the test FUF with added synbiotic for 25 days on gut comfort and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
