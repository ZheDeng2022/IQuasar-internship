      Investigators will conduct a pilot efficacy test of a decision aid about contact sport&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial portion of this study will enroll 40 adolescents and their&#xD;
      parent/caregiver who are seen in the Sports Medicine clinic with a diagnosis of concussion.&#xD;
      20 will receive usual care, and 20 will receive a decision aid to facilitate the decision&#xD;
      making process about sport participation post-concussion. Adolescents and their&#xD;
      parent/caregiver will complete separate surveys at a minimum of three timepoints: before&#xD;
      their initial clinic visit, after each clinic visit (up until a decision regarding sports&#xD;
      participation post-concussion is made), and three months after their first clinic visit. The&#xD;
      study team will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians about their experiences&#xD;
      with implementation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months after initial Sports Medicine visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 5-item Decisional Regret Scale to measure personal perceptions of regret when considering the decision previously made about sports participation post-concussion. Responses are on a 5-point Likert scale, from (1) strongly agree to (5) strongly disagree.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before Sports Medicine visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 12-item Decision Self-Efficacy Scale to measure parent and adolescent perceptions that they are informed about options, risks, and benefits in making the decision to return to sport post-concussion.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Parent-Provider Engagement</measure>

    <measure>Change in Adolescent Psychosocial Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week before Sports Medicine visit, Immediately after Sports Medicine visit, 3 months after initial Sports Medicine visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Physical and Psychosocial subscales (PEDS-QL) to measure adolescent physical, emotional, social, and school functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in Adolescent Physical Activity</measure>
