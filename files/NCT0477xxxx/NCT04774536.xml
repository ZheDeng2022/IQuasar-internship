      This is an open label, non-randomized, 2-center, phase 1/2 trial of a single infusion of&#xD;
      sickle allele modified cluster of differentiation (CD34+) hematopoietic stem progenitor cells&#xD;
      (HSPCs) in subjects with in subjects ≥12 years old to 35 years old severe Sickle Cell Disease&#xD;
      (SCD). The study will evaluate the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using&#xD;
      CRISPR/Cas9 edited red blood cells (known as CRISPR_SCD001 Drug Product).&#xD;

      This is an open label, non-randomized, 2-center, phase 1/2 trial of a single infusion of&#xD;
      sickle allele modified CD34+ HSPCs in subjects with severe SCD. The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      trial will determine the safety of CRISPR_SCD001 through a 3+3 design with staggered&#xD;
      enrollment and a pause in enrollment for safety review after each of the first 3 patients has&#xD;
      had drug product infused. After safety is assessed in the 3rd patient, enrollment of the next&#xD;
      3 patients will not be staggered. The first six subjects will be adults. If CRISPR_SCD001 is&#xD;
      determined to be safe in the first six subjects, the trial will continue to enroll 3&#xD;
      adolescents 12 - 18 years of age to evaluate the safety in younger patients. The younger age&#xD;
      cohort also will follow staggered enrollment.&#xD;
