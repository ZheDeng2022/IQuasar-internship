  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is often associated with secondary complications such as nutritional and metabolic&#xD;
      disorders, endocrine dysfunction, mental problems, and cardiopulmonary disorders caused by&#xD;
      neurological and musculoskeletal deficits. The absence of the paretic side muscles and the&#xD;
      difficulty of movement together with restrictive pulmonary disorders trigger a secondary&#xD;
      decrease in cardiopulmonary function and expose insufficient energy associated with gait&#xD;
      resulting in a decrease in asymmetric trunk exercise endurance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that these patients have muscle weakness and delayed activity of trunk&#xD;
      muscles, significant loss of trunk position sense, insufficient pressure control center while&#xD;
      sitting, decreased trunk performance, and trunk asymmetry during walking. It has been&#xD;
      reported that trunk function with balance and walking ability in stroke patients is a useful&#xD;
      determinant of daily life activities, balance and walking ability. Balance disorders may be&#xD;
      the result of changes in the sensory and integrative aspects of motor control. In the&#xD;
      subacute phase, more than 80% of the subjects who have had stroke for the first time have an&#xD;
      imbalance in their balance. After a stroke, upper motor neuron damage can cause&#xD;
      unconditioned. This results in physical inactivity and decreased cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle weakness and changes in thoraco-abdominal motion may be associated with a&#xD;
      decrease in tidal volume and lower exercise tolerance.&#xD;

    <measure>Postural Evaluation Scale for Patients with Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>3 min</time_frame>
    <description>Postural Evaluation Scale for Patients with Stroke (PASS) It is specially designed for paralyzed patients. PASS contains a total of 12 items to assess balance. It contains 5 items to evaluate posture (static PASS) and 7 items to evaluate changes in posture (dynamic PASS). PASS can be used to evaluate functional balance that requires both static and dynamic balance. Each PASS item is rated from 0 to 3 for a 36-point survey. At this scale, the higher the score, the more positive the balance in stroke patients.</description>

    <measure>Peak Cough Flow Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 min</time_frame>
    <description>In the study, the highest cough flow rate will be measured with a portable PEF meter. All measurements will be made by a trained physiotherapist using the technique described by Fiore et al. Subjects will be asked to &quot;take a deep breath and cough as hard as possible&quot; in a semi-sitting position (60 degrees).</description>

    <measure>Tinetti Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Rating scale is a scale of 0 to 2 rows. 0 points represent the most disorder and 2 points represent independence. Individual points are then combined to form three subsections; overall gait assessment score, overall balance assessment score, and combined gait and balance score. The maximum score for the walking component is 12. The maximum score for the balance component is 16. The maximum total score is 28. In general, participants who score below 19 have a high risk of falling. It indicates that the participants who scored between 19-24 are at risk of falling medium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 min</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the time it takes for a person to stand up from a seat, walk a distance of 3 m, turn, sit back on the chair. It is a scale originally developed as a clinical measure of balance in the elderly and scored between 1 and 5 on the basis of an observer's perception of the participant's risk of falling during the test. Podsiadlo and Richardson timed the test and changed the original test and suggested using it as a short test of basic mobility skills for the elderly living in the weak community.</description>

    <description>An adaptation of a pre-designed protocol will be used for the application of the Normocular Electrical Stimulation in the diaphragm. Current to be applied; Synchronous impulse at 30 Hz frequency, 1 sec beat increase time, 1 sec &quot;on&quot; (muscle contraction), 1 sec beat reduction time and 20 sec &quot;off&quot; (no warning) time. Two channels, each with two electrodes, will be placed in the seventh and eighth anterior intercostal space above and below the right and left sides of the xiphoid protrusion. The other two channels, each with two electrodes, will be placed on the right and left midaxillary line of the seventh and eighth anterior intercostal space. The application will be carried out for 6 weeks, 3 days a week, for 30 minutes daily.</description>

    <arm_group_label>group 3, kinesiotape</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For anterior diaphragm banding, the patient will stand with arms raised. Next, the central part of the tape will be applied to the xiphoid protrusion with a tension of 50% to 70% after the maximum inhalation. While the patient is breathing, the ends of the tape will be pulled with 10 to 15% tension towards the lower ribs. To tape the rear diaphragm, the patient's body will bend forward, and the arms will be joined crosswise over the chest. After the maximum inhalation, the central part of the tape will be applied over the T10 with a tension of 50% to 70%. As the patient exhales and stretches the trunk, the ends of the tape will be attached to the lower ribs with a tension of 10 to 15%.&#xD;
The supine position will be used in the Kinesiological taping of the right and left external oblique and internal oblique muscles. The application will be carried out for 6 weeks, 3 days a week, for 30 minutes daily.</description>

    <intervention_name>core stabilization exercises</intervention_name>
    <description>Core is at the center of almost all kinetic chains in the body. Core force, balance, and motion control maximize all kinetic chains of upper and lower limb function. A stable and strong core can contribute to more efficient use of the lower extremities. Core stability is defined as the ability of the lumbo-pelvic hip complex to prevent bending of the vertebral column and return to balance after perturbation.&#xD;
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique in which muscle contraction is electrically stimulated in the area where the surface electrodes are connected. It improves secondary muscle atrophy and weakness in immobilization by preventing a decrease in muscle protein synthesis.&#xD;
Kinesiological banding (CT) is a treatment method used in the treatment of various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular deficits. The mechanism of action of CT is to facilitate muscle activation, increase blood and lymph circulation and reduce pain due to neurological suppression.</description>
