      This expanded access protocol applies to patients with gMG who are not enrolled in an ongoing&#xD;
      clinical trial. The aim of the trial is to provide patients with generalized myasthenia&#xD;
      gravis (gMG), who are ineligible to participate in a clinical trial, access to efgartigimod&#xD;
      treatment before regulatory approval.&#xD;
