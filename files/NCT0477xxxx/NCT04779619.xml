  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Emotion regulation has been established as an important concept in mental health&#xD;
      research across a range of different diagnoses. There are numerous questionnaires used to&#xD;
      measure emotion regulation but only one (the Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory -&#xD;
      PERCI) is based on the most recent and widely accepted model of emotion regulation (Gross'&#xD;
      extended process model of emotion regulation). This recently developed measure has not yet&#xD;
      been extensively used or psychometrically tested in clinical populations. However, it may be&#xD;
      more theoretically and psychometrically sound than other measures widely used in the research&#xD;
      literature to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: An online survey including this new measure with other relevant&#xD;
      questionnaires will sample non-clinical and two specific clinical populations in order to&#xD;
      explore the reliability, validity and utility of this measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This will inform the ways in which emotion regulation competency is measured in&#xD;
      future research and clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the term 'emotion' being commonly used in day-to-day language, within the research&#xD;
      literature on emotion regulation (both within the health field and more broadly) there is&#xD;
      great variety in the terminology and scales of measurement used. So much so that Buck&#xD;
      describes the field as &quot;conceptual and definitional chaos&quot; (Buck 1990, p.330). However Gross&#xD;
      has recently renewed his extended process model of emotion regulation and this is now a&#xD;
      widely established model although used more frequently in cognition research than in health&#xD;
      research (see Gross 2015 for a full description of the model)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1998 Gross described emotion regulation as &quot;shaping which emotions one has, when one has&#xD;
      them, and how one experiences or expresses those emotions&quot; (Gross 1998). One of the key&#xD;
      points which this model suggests is that each of the 5 steps offer potential for emotion&#xD;
      regulation and that there is no limit as to the number or type of activities which might&#xD;
      serve this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is this ability to regulate emotions (i.e. a person's capacity to successfully modify the&#xD;
      trajectory of their emotions), which has been established as an important but complex concept&#xD;
      in health research. A number of systematic reviews have explored what is known about emotion&#xD;
      regulation across a variety of mental health diagnoses (e.g. Sloan et al 2017, Hu et al&#xD;
      2014). Fernandez et al 2014 argue that it is a key transdiagnostic concept using the Research&#xD;
      Domain Criteria framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As poor emotion regulation has therefore been implicated in the onset and maintenance of a&#xD;
      range of mental health conditions, it has subsequently been the target of a number of&#xD;
      psychological interventions. Given that affective instability and reactivity, and the use of&#xD;
      problematic regulation strategies, are some of the core criteria for EUPD, many of the&#xD;
      treatment approaches for this clinical group address emotion regulation. It remains unclear&#xD;
      what the mediating or moderating role of emotion regulation is in influencing treatment&#xD;
      outcome. A comprehensive, theoretically and psychometrically sound instrument to measure&#xD;
      emotion regulation is therefore vital for the development or adaptation of these types of&#xD;
      interventions and the subsequent research examining mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous self-report questionnaires which are used to quantify emotion regulation.&#xD;
      However many of these have psychometric and/or theoretical weaknesses which could potentially&#xD;
      impact on the quality of research and the conclusions drawn from this research. Preece and&#xD;
      colleagues (2018) describe and evaluate the existing 13 self-report measures relevant to the&#xD;
      concept of emotion regulation. In summary they argue that none of these scales :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. measure emotion regulation across both negative and positive emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. measure across all four components of emotion regulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. clearly distinguish between emotion recognition/description (alexithymia) and emotion&#xD;
           regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preece and colleagues therefore developed the PERCI on the basis of Gross' model in order to&#xD;
      overcome these deficits. Preece and colleagues (2018) published research outlining the&#xD;
      process of scale development and reported good indices of reliability and validity for this&#xD;
      measure in a non-clinical population. They recommend replication of reliability and validity&#xD;
      research in clinical populations. Factor structure was examined through the use of a series&#xD;
      of confirmatory factor analyses. They found the factor structure to be replicable and&#xD;
      consistent with the theoretical basis of the Gross model. In the non-clinical population (N =&#xD;
      1175) the PERCI total score had an excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha α) of&#xD;
      0.95. They also reported excellent internal reliability of the four subscales of the PERCI:&#xD;
      Negative emotion regulation (α 0.93), Positive emotion regulation (α 0.92), General&#xD;
      facilitating hedonic goals (α 0.94) and Positive containing emotions (α 0.93). Concurrent and&#xD;
      criterion validity analyses were also reported and confirmed the hypotheses of the&#xD;
      researchers in that higher reporting of emotion regulation difficulties on the PERCI was&#xD;
      associated with measures of maladaptive regulation strategies, higher levels of alexithymia,&#xD;
      more insecure attachments and higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will be a cross-sectional survey using online self-report questionnaires.&#xD;
      The study seeks to test the psychometric properties of the scale in mental health&#xD;
      populations, as poor emotion regulation is particularly pertinent yet the psychometric&#xD;
      properties of the scale are unknown in this population. It is possible that the factor&#xD;
      structure and other psychometric properties of the scale are different between clinical and&#xD;
      non-clinical populations and this could have important implications for theory, research and&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical group will be separated in to people with low and high 'EUPD' traits to allow&#xD;
      comparison. The diagnosis of EUPD is controversial and frequently stigmatised. Some people&#xD;
      using mental health services will meet criteria for EUPD but not have been told this directly&#xD;
      by clinicians, others may have been told they have EUPD informally or after insufficient&#xD;
      assessment. This complexity and heterogeneity has led to the decision not to rely on reported&#xD;
      diagnosis but to measure current EUPD symptomatology and allocate people to two clinical&#xD;
      groups on the basis of clinical cut-offs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population accessing the NHS talking therapies service, Improving Access to Psychological&#xD;
      Therapy (IAPT), has been found to have high rates of people meeting diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      EUPD (Hepgel and colleagues 2016) and even higher levels of people with traits of personality&#xD;
      disorder. As this is a large and relatively accessible group of people this is the population&#xD;
      the researchers will target for recruitment for the clinical group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will initially recruit a non-clinical group from NHS staff members as they&#xD;
      may be more representative of the general population in terms of broad demographics than a&#xD;
      student sample.&#xD;
