  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national-wide online survey, which aims to investigate the nutritional status and&#xD;
      dietary intakes in Chinese discharged patients with cancer. It will provide relevant data for&#xD;
      the &quot;White Paper on Nutritional Diet of Cancer Patients in China&quot;, and also provide reference&#xD;
      for the relevant work of nutrition support for cancer patients in clinical practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional status has significant impact on clinical outcome and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with cancer. Current surveys show that about 30-80% of patients with cancer have nutritional&#xD;
      risk and/or malnutrition, and about 20% of the patients' death are directly caused by&#xD;
      malnutrition. Appropriate and standardized nutrition therapy might not only improve the&#xD;
      nutritional status, but also the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer, and improve their&#xD;
      life quality and dignity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is still lack of large-scale investigation and research on nutritional&#xD;
      status and dietary intakes in discharged patients with cancer in China, and thus affects the&#xD;
      overall level of nutritional management for cancer patients, as well as the formation of&#xD;
      related guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we will conduct a national-wide cross-sectional online survey, which aim to&#xD;
      investigate relevant data of nutritional status and dietary intakes among discharged patients&#xD;
      with cancer. Data will be collected through an online semi-structured questionnaire using&#xD;
      WeChat forms with a consent form. The link to the questionnaire was sent through emails,&#xD;
      WeChat App groups, and other social media. The participants were encouraged to roll out the&#xD;
      survey, and send the link to more patients as they could. On receiving and clicking the link,&#xD;
      the participants will be directed to the information about the study and informed consent.&#xD;
      After they accept to take the survey, they will fill up the demographic details and answer a&#xD;
      set of questions related to nutritional status and dietary intake investigation.&#xD;
