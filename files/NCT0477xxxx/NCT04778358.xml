      Higher numbers of oocytes have not been shown to increase implantation or live newborn rates,&#xD;
      but higher numbers of oocytes are likely to be beneficial in certain treatments. These&#xD;
      clinical cases where a high ovarian response can be IVF cycles with genetic diagnosis,&#xD;
      patients who need more than one pregnancy or, as in our case, oocyte donation. For this&#xD;
      reason, and based on previous studies, investigators intend to increase the ovarian response&#xD;
      by increasing the dose of follitropin. This clinical trial aims to evaluate high doses of&#xD;
      Rekovelle (follitropin delta) to obtain an average of 17 oocytes in a population of oocyte&#xD;
      donors, without affecting the health of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IVF ovarian stimulation cycles has been shown that the individualization of the medication&#xD;
      doses provides clinical results comparable to conventional ovarian stimulation regimens, but&#xD;
      also it results in greater treatment safety by significantly reducing the percentage of&#xD;
      patients with responses extreme ovaries, and cycle cancellations. These studies have been&#xD;
      carried out with the premise that an optimal ovarian response results in obtaining 8-14&#xD;
      oocytes per puncture. Although it has also been shown that larger numbers of oocytes do not&#xD;
      increase clinical variables such as implantation rates or live newborn per cycle, it is&#xD;
      possible that these numbers of oocytes are insufficient in specific circumstances, for&#xD;
      example, patients with a desire to have more pregnancy, patients undergoing IVF cycles with&#xD;
      PGT-A, or gamete donors. For these reasons, and thanks to the improvements in&#xD;
      cryopreservation programs and the induction of oocyte maturation with GnRH agonists, it is&#xD;
      necessary to design protocols for the individualization of doses of medication aimed at&#xD;
      obtaining greater quantities of oocytes. The objective of this pilot study is the evaluation&#xD;
      of higher doses of Rekovelle (follitropin delta) aimed at obtaining 17 oocytes in voluntary&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;
