  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not clear whether depresssion can predispose, or precipitate stroke recurrence in&#xD;
      patients with stroke. We sought the relationship of post stroke depression with stroke&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large body of evidence suggests that depression is associated with a increased risk of many&#xD;
      chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, stroke and particularly coronary heart&#xD;
      disease. Post stroke depression (PSD) may develop as a result of vascular disease. A previous&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed that depression significantly increased the risk of development of&#xD;
      stroke, and this increase was probably independent of other risk factors, including&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarifying this issue has important implications; if depression increases the risk of&#xD;
      development of recurrent stroke, so treating PSD might decrease the occurrence of recurrent&#xD;
      stroke. To our knowledge there is no study attempting to clarify the relationship between PSD&#xD;
      treatment and stroke recurrence. To fill these gap, we systematically conducted a study to&#xD;
      assess whether PSD is associated with recurrent stroke, cardiovascular events or death. Thus,&#xD;
      in the current study, three different arms of follow-up of patients with first-ever stroke,&#xD;
      were used to predict the outcome over 52 weeks.&#xD;
