  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diacutaneous fibrolysis is a physiotherapeutic instrumental technique, used to treat&#xD;
      musculoskeletal conditions causing pain and/or movement restriction . It is applied by means&#xD;
      of metallic hooks, ending in a spatula with beveled edges, that seems to allow a better&#xD;
      pressure distribution on the skin and a deeper and more precise application, compared to the&#xD;
      manual approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies indicate positive responses regrading pain intensity decrease in sports people&#xD;
      suffering anterior knee pain, improving range of motion in subacromial impingement syndrome,&#xD;
      improving sensory conductivity in symptomatic patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, decreased&#xD;
      pain in patients with chronic epicondialgia or improveing function athletes with anterior&#xD;
      knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the specific action mechanism, have not been investigated in depth yet. Clinical&#xD;
      studies show improvements in strength, pain intensity, range of motion, or function. But&#xD;
      whether if this effect is produced by changes in tissue tension or by reflexes effects, as&#xD;
      has been suggested before, still unclear. There are no studies evaluating its effects on&#xD;
      posterior muscular chain of lower extremity in athletes, where FD effects on neuromuscular&#xD;
      response could be more evident due to the overload involved on this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the immediate, and after 30 minutes, effects of a&#xD;
      single diacutaneous fibrolysis session on contractile and viscoelastic muscle properties and&#xD;
      mechanosensitibity by means of tensiomyography, myotonometry and algometry on posterior&#xD;
      muscular chain of lower limb in athletes.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Design. A randomized controlled trial with blind evaluator. Randomization. Between lower&#xD;
      extremities of each subject (Random.org). Regardless of its own dominance, diacutaneous&#xD;
      fibrolysis will be applied to de following muscles and intermuscular septums: gluteus&#xD;
      maixmus, biceps femoris and semitendinosus to de lower experimental limb. The other extremity&#xD;
      will not be treat (control limb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample recruitment. Athletes from UIC university community, who compete officially or&#xD;
      institutionally, whether they are federated or recorded in a sport official register where&#xD;
      the predominant activity focuses on the lower train (athletics, cycling, football, rugby...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. The anthropometric data will be collected at the beginning of the study. The&#xD;
      outcome assessment will be performed by a blinded evaluator at the baseline, immediately&#xD;
      after the technique application and 30 minutes after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experienced physiotherapist in the diacutaneous fibrolysis technique will apply the&#xD;
      treatment to the lower limb, previously randomized, in the following musculature and&#xD;
      intermuscular septums: quadratus lumbar, gluteus maixum, biceps femoris and semitendinosus.&#xD;
      Intervention procedure will last about 10-15 minutes&#xD;
