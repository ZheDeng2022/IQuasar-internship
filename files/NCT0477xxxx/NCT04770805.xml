      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and the maternal, fetal and postnatal&#xD;
      outcomes of sacral myelomeningocele (MMC) and Myelic Limited Dorsal Myeloschisis (MyeLDM)&#xD;
      fetoscopic repair at Trousseau Hospital (Paris, France).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myelomeningocele and Myelic limited dorsal myeloschisis (MyeLDM) correspond to neural tube&#xD;
      defects which lead to lifelong disabilities including lower extremity paralysis, sphincters&#xD;
      deficiency, and cerebral complications (Chiari 2 malformation and hydrocephalus). It is&#xD;
      demonstrated that fetal surgery repair of MMC with upper limit between the first thoracic&#xD;
      vertebra (T1) and the first sacral vertebra (S1) improves motor and cerebral prognosis.&#xD;
      Nowadays, this fetal surgery is performed either after maternal laparotomy and hysterotomy&#xD;
      (open fetal surgery) or using fetoscopy. the investigators, at Trousseau Hospital (APHP,&#xD;
      Paris), initiated an open fetal surgery of MMC program called PRIUM1 and 16 fetuses has been&#xD;
      currently operated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetoscopic repair of MMC is proposed by several international groups in order to prevent from&#xD;
      maternal and obstetric morbidity related to the hysterotomy and improve the mother's&#xD;
      obstetrical prognosis by allowing vaginal delivery. Results of fetoscopic MMC repair are very&#xD;
      satisfying, both in terms of repair surgery efficacy and in terms of obstetrical prognosis.&#xD;
      The research team believe that it is justified to propose this minimally invasive repair&#xD;
      technique using fetoscopy, for represented by sacral MMC (level S1 and lower) as well as for&#xD;
      intermediate forms between open and closed dysgraphisms, represented by MyeLDM. Indeed, these&#xD;
      dysraphism are associated with the same cerebral complications than MMC with upper limit&#xD;
      between T1 and S1 which could be corrected with prenatal repair. In addition, the spinal cord&#xD;
      protection offered by prenatal surgery could prevent from the neuroepithelium destruction&#xD;
      observed during pregnancy, with a potential motor benefit for the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of PRIUM 2 is to evaluate the success of fetoscopic surgical repair of&#xD;
      sacral MMC or MyeLDM with a birth after 32 weeks of gestation and without severe perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of PRIUM 2 are to evaluate the complications of pregnancy related to&#xD;
      fetoscopic surgery as well as to evaluate the prenatal and postnatal evolution of the&#xD;
      cerebral complications (Chiari 2 malformation and hydrocephalus) after fetoscopic repair&#xD;
      surgery of the dysraphism (up to 12 months of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, fetal sacral MMC/ MyeLDM repair surgery will be performed using gas&#xD;
      fetoscopy before 26 weeks. After an exteriorization of the uterus through a laparotomy,&#xD;
      humidified and warmed gas will be insufflated with low pressure (6 to 8mmHg mmHg). Fetoscopic&#xD;
      repair surgery will be performed by a multidisciplinary team (maternal fetal medicine&#xD;
      specialists, pediatric neurosurgeons, pediatric surgeons).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, patients will be followed weekly by a midwife and every two weeks by a&#xD;
      referring obstetrician who will perform a clinical examination and a fetal ultrasound.A post&#xD;
      procedure MRI will be performed 4 weeks after the surgery. If there is no obstetrical&#xD;
      contraindication, vaginal delivery will be authorized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be followed according to the conventional management of children with&#xD;
      dysraphisms and consultations at 8 weeks of life and 12 months of life will be scheduled at&#xD;
      Trousseau Hospital, with the multidisciplinary team (pediatric neurosurgeons, physical&#xD;
      medicine and rehabilitation specialists, pediatric orthopedic surgeons). During these two&#xD;
      consultations, the children will have a complete clinical examination, a cerebral and spinal&#xD;
      MRI and an ultrasound of the urinary tract.&#xD;

    <description>After an exteriorization of the uterus through a laparotomy, humidified and warmed gas will be insufflated with low pressure (6 to 8mmHg mmHg). Fetoscopic repair surgery will consist in a dissection of the placode, its reintegration into the spinal canal and the closure of the lesion, through a three ports access. After fetal surgery, the gas will be exsufflated and the trocar ports will be closed. The uterus will be reintegrated before suturing the maternal abdominal wall.</description>
