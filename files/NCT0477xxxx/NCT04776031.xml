      This clinical study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label, pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the R:GEN Laser System and to collect information on&#xD;
      the severity of AMD in subjects with bilateral large drusen. All participants will receive&#xD;
      the intervention at the baseline visit and at the 24-week visit. All participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at 24 and 48 weeks from the baseline visit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults 50 years and over&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity [BCVA] of 6/12 [20/40] or better in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral large drusen: at least 1 druse ≥125 µm in each eye within an inner macular&#xD;
             zone [a circle with a radius of 1500 µm centered on the fovea], and with or without&#xD;
             pigment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to consent, receive laser treatment, and complete all visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of definite reticular pseudo drusen [RPD] &gt; 2-disc areas [DAs] as seen&#xD;
             either by fundus autofluorescence [FAF] or near-infrared reflectance [NIR] enface&#xD;
             imaging in each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of geographic atrophy [GA] within the macula [a circle with a radius of&#xD;
             3000 microns centered on the fovea] excluding peripapillary atrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of nascent GA, or worse evidence of atrophy (complete RPE and outer&#xD;
             retinal atrophy) as determined by OCT: including the subsidence of the inner nuclear&#xD;
             layer and outer plexiform layer [OPL], or the presence of a hyporeﬂective wedge-shaped&#xD;
             band within the limits of the OPL, and accompanied by attenuation or absence of the&#xD;
             RPE and hypertransmission into the choroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current choroidal neovascularization [CNV], (determined on multimodal imaging [MMI],&#xD;
             but angiogram not required) or past evidence of CNV, including the presence of&#xD;
             non-exudative macular neovascularization [NE-MNV] [determined by OCT-A]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Asymptomatic sub-retinal fluid [SRF] [a slither &lt; 50 µm allowed]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any current ocular disease or condition in the study eye including diseases affecting&#xD;
             the optic nerve, the anterior chamber, and autoimmune or systemic inflammatory&#xD;
             conditions in which there are ocular manifestations that either are undergoing or&#xD;
             require treatment, or history of ocular disease within 3 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A central macular serous pigment epithelial detachment greater than 1000 µm in&#xD;
             diameter; a central macular drusenoid detachment &gt; 1000 µm with hyper reflective foci&#xD;
             [HRF] and hypertransmission; or any central macular drusenoid pigment epithelial&#xD;
             detachments &gt;2000 µm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous retinal or ocular surgery within 3 months prior to screening, the effects of&#xD;
             which may now or in the future complicate assessment of AMD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of prior laser treatment to the retina&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any systemic medication known to be toxic to the retina&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to application of a contact lens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of uncontrolled glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or intraocular&#xD;
             pressure &gt; 24 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cataract which in the opinion of the investigator limits evaluation of the retina or&#xD;
             requires cataract surgery within 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who is currently in a clinical study, or has received other active&#xD;
             investigational therapy, within 30 days of the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
