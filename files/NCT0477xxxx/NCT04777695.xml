  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited data regarding sound levels and burden in the pediatric cardiac critical&#xD;
      care unit and how this compares with WHO standards. We seek to record this data and correlate&#xD;
      sound level with bolus sedation administration, patient delirium scores, and patient heart&#xD;
      rate trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 peak sound level in cardiac ICU in decibels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 Mean sound level in cardiac ICU in decibels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 Compare sound levels to WHO recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 To explore patient and unit factors that might influence these levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 To analyze sound levels in post-operative neonates, versus infants, versus children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 To analyze patients on invasive versus non-invasine versus no ventilation&#xD;

      This study aims to measure and average sound levels during hospitalization in the Children's&#xD;
      National Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and investigate any correlation between&#xD;
      heightened sound levels, the incidence of delirium, the administration of sedation&#xD;
      medications given for agitation, and patient heart rate changes. Recognition of modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors, such as sound levels, can lead to the development of preventive strategies to&#xD;
      keep sound levels within recommended guidelines and to lessen the amount of sedation&#xD;
      medications that are given for agitation. Successful completion of this research will&#xD;
      contribute to the development of modifiable environmental factors for the prevention of&#xD;
      oversedation and delirium in critically ill children, potentially improving outcomes in a&#xD;
      vulnerable patient population. This will be the first study of this nature performed in a&#xD;
      large CICU and the first to look at delirium scores and vital sign changes as related to&#xD;
      sound levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that increased sound levels in hospitals can worsen patient agitation&#xD;
      and lead to sleep disturbance and impair rest and healing. The World Health Organization and&#xD;
      the Environmental Protection Agency mandate that hospital sound levels not exceed 40-45&#xD;
      decibels dB(A) during the day and 35 dB(A) at night. Previous studies in four European ICUs&#xD;
      with adult patients showed that ICUs demonstrated higher than recommended sound levels 50% of&#xD;
      the time, with an average sound level of 51 dB(A) over 24 hours and a peak sound level of 85&#xD;
      dB(A). In the only published study on sound levels in a pediatric CICU and their relationship&#xD;
      to sedation administration, Guerra et al showed in 2017 that mean levels were over 59dB in&#xD;
      both open patient areas as well as single rooms with little variation between day and night&#xD;
      levels and that a higher peak and average sound level correlated with more sedation boluses&#xD;
      in the subsequent 2 and 5 hours respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between neurotoxicity and the use of sedatives and analgesia in young infants&#xD;
      with congenital heart disease has also been described. In addition, there are appreciable&#xD;
      negative hemodynamic effects of oversedation on the pediatric patient recovering from cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. For this reason, it is important to investigate the impact that sound levels might&#xD;
      have on sedation administration. Along with this, as vital sign changes such as an elevated&#xD;
      heart rate can lead to patients receiving additional sedation, it is equally important to&#xD;
      study the relationship between patient heart rate and sound level in a cardiac intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is defined as an acute and fluctuating change in attention, thinking, perception,&#xD;
      and consciousness secondary to an underlying medical condition. The consequences of delirium&#xD;
      have been well studied in the adult critical care population, and include prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization time, difficulty with long-term thinking, increased days of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and increased risk of death after discharge from the hospital. In adult&#xD;
      intensive care units, delirium screening is routinely performed because of the known&#xD;
      consequences of the disease. With the advent of the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium&#xD;
      (CAPD), there is now a rapid and reliable method of screening for delirium in pediatric&#xD;
      intensive care units. Since 2018, bedside nurses in the Children's National CICU have been&#xD;
      trained to calculate CAP-D scores. This delirium assessment performed once per shift, can be&#xD;
      analyzed side-by-side with average sound levels over that same shift to assess for any&#xD;
      correlation between these two parameters.&#xD;
