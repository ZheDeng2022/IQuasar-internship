    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has completed the EOT visit of the antecedent trofinetide Study ACP-2566-004 (i.e.,&#xD;
             has completed 40 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. May benefit from continued treatment with open-label trofinetide in the judgment of&#xD;
             the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Can still swallow the study medication provided as a liquid solution or can take it by&#xD;
             gastrostomy tube&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject's caregiver is English-speaking and has sufficient language skills to&#xD;
             complete the caregiver assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
             Childbearing Potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects of childbearing potential must abstain from sexual activity for the duration&#xD;
             of the study and for at least 30 days thereafter. If a subject is sexually active or&#xD;
             becomes sexually active during the study, she must use 2 clinically acceptable methods&#xD;
             of contraception (e.g., oral, intrauterine device [IUD], diaphragm plus spermicide,&#xD;
             injectable, transdermal or implantable contraception) for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and for at least 30 days thereafter. Subject must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Began treatment with growth hormone during the antecedent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Began treatment with IGF-1 during the antecedent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Began treatment with insulin during the antecedent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has developed a clinically significant cardiovascular, endocrine (such as hypo- or&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, or uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes mellitus),&#xD;
             renal, hepatic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease (such as celiac disease or&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is judged by the Investigator or the Medical Monitor to be inappropriate for&#xD;
             the study due to AEs, medical condition, or noncompliance with investigational product&#xD;
             or study procedures in the antecedent study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a clinically significant abnormality in vital signs at Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has an average QTcF interval of &gt;450 ms on the Baseline ECG performed before the first&#xD;
             dose of trofinetide is given in the present study (i.e., the ECG performed at the EOT&#xD;
             visit of the antecedent study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has developed a clinically significant ECG finding during the antecedent study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Patients will be evaluated at screening to&#xD;
        ensure that all criteria for study participation are met. Patients may be excluded from the&#xD;
        study based on these assessments (and specifically, if it is determined that their baseline&#xD;
        health and condition do not meet all pre-specified entry criteria).&#xD;
