  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Argentina, central nervous system (CNS) solid tumors (19%) and non-CNS solid&#xD;
      tumors (25%) account for 44% of pediatric tumors. The new World Health organization (WHO)&#xD;
      2016 classification, which includes genomic characterization, comprises more than 100 CNS&#xD;
      tumor entities and subclasses. In children, glial lineage tumors (gliomas) are the most&#xD;
      frequent and comprise astrocytomas, ependymomas and oligodendroglioma, while embryonal CNS&#xD;
      tumors are a heterogeneous group of WHO grade IV tumors. Pediatric soft tissue tumors (STT)&#xD;
      present difficulties for accurate diagnosis since their morphological and immunophenotypic&#xD;
      features overlap among the different histological patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of new molecular techniques has generated a great advance in the field of solid&#xD;
      tumors, particularly in the molecular definition of groups of patients. This fact makes&#xD;
      tailor-made treatment feasible, according to the biology of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, in children, the identification of treatment targets is especially important&#xD;
      since it may avoid unnecessary sequel in a growing child. This project allows the&#xD;
      articulation between basic and clinical research groups, thus consolidating the objective of&#xD;
      basic translational research and generating both clinical and basic knowledge about the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of pediatric solid tumors in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To standardize and implement a comprehensive multi-level molecular strategy, using&#xD;
      medium and high complexity techniques, for the detection of molecular alterations in primary&#xD;
      pediatric solid tumors (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma family tumors, soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcomas and CNS tumors (gliomas and embryonal)), that can be applied to the&#xD;
      diagnosis, prognosis and/or use of targeted therapies against molecular targets in order to&#xD;
      provide a tailored therapeutic opportunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Pediatric cases of solid tumors will be enrolled prospectively. Based&#xD;
      on the statistics of the participating centers, 100 samples will be included. From each case,&#xD;
      a formalin fixed biopsy will be available and when possible, a fragment will also be&#xD;
      preserved at -70ºC. Clinical and follow-up data will be obtained from the clinical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodological approaches include: 1) Immunohistochemical detection of tumor lineage&#xD;
      determinant markers, some of them with predictive value. 2) FISH (fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization) with break-apart strategy for genes involved in recurrent chromosomal&#xD;
      translocations and locus-specific design probes for other unbalanced structural chromosomal&#xD;
      structural alterations (amplifications and deletions of genes or chromosomal segments). 3)&#xD;
      Real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of fusion transcripts resulting from&#xD;
      chromosomal translocations. 4) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger&#xD;
      sequencing analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as targets for therapy. 5)&#xD;
      Sanger sequencing analysis of fusions, ins/del as a complement to RT-PCR or FISH&#xD;
      (fluorescence in situ hybridization), 6) Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with a specific and&#xD;
      customized panel containing all necessary genes to define a tumor´s genomic mutation profile&#xD;
      for diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis of pediatric tumors. However, NGS sequencing&#xD;
      will only be applied in those cases which could not be resolved with the previous strategies&#xD;
      or cases with poor evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above analyses, an integrated analysis algorithm will be developed according to&#xD;
      WHO recommendations, but adapted to the facilities of the institution. Molecular findings&#xD;
      will be correlated with clinical and histological data&#xD;
