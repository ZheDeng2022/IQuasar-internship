  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of neonatal pain and sedation often includes opioid therapy. A growing body of&#xD;
      evidence suggests long-term harm associated with neonatal opioid exposure. Providing optimal&#xD;
      sedation while neonates are undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) may be beneficial but&#xD;
      also presents therapeutic challenges. While there is evidence from animal models of brain&#xD;
      injury and clinical trials in adults to support the safety and neuroprotective properties of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (DMT), there are no published large clinical trials demonstrating safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of DMT use in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) during treatment&#xD;
      with TH. This study is innovative in proposing a Phase II, 2-arm trial providing the&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate the use of DMT as compared to the use of morphine for sedation and&#xD;
      pain management for babies undergoing TH. We propose to confirm optimal DMT dosing by&#xD;
      collecting opportunistic pharmacokinetics (PK) data and determine safety of DMT in this&#xD;
      population. These data will inform a larger phase III efficacy trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Generalized Motor Assessment Scores (GMA) 7 days after weaned off of study drug or discharge, whichever happens first</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the GMA is a validated test that aids in early detection of neurological movement disorders by evaluating the quality of movements during a 2-minute video. Certified assessors will grade the quality of movements which include: normal writhing, poor repertoire, cramped synchronized, and chaotic movements. All movements other than normal writhing are considered atypical. The results will be compared between the two drug treatments.</description>

    <measure>Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam (HINE) scores at 3-4 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>3-4 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The HINE is a 26 item exam that assesses different aspects of neurological function and these scores will be compared between the two drug treatment regimens. This assessment scores 5 different neurological development areas: Cranial nerve function, posture, movements, tone, and reflexes/reactions. The maximum score is 78 and lowest score is 0. Higher scores show better neurological development consistent with better outcomes.</description>

    <description>This test evaluates posture and motor control and is designed to be used specifically in infants born prematurely. Results are given based on z-scores from normative values and are given as low average, below average, and far below average. Lower scores are more predictive of worse outcomes. These scores will be compared between the two drug treatment regimens.</description>

    <description>This test evaluates fine motor, gross motor, and total motor skills. Results are converted to age equivalent rating and then quotient scores are given for each category. Minimum is 35 and maximum is 165. The average score is 90-110, with higher scores given in 3 SD above average performance and lower scores given in 3 SD below average performance.The higher the score, the better predicted outcome. These scores will be compared between the two drug treatment regimens.</description>
