  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response and toxicity rate of two different&#xD;
      dosages (Individualized dosage VS. fixed dosage) of ATG as a prophylaxis for acute GVHD in&#xD;
      haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-PBSCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) is an important complication of haplo-HSCT. The&#xD;
      Seattle group initially introduced the use of ATG as a treatment for acute graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-PBSCT)&#xD;
      recipients. Presently, in both myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)&#xD;
      haplo-PBSCT, ATG is part of postengraftment immunosuppressive regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regimens for prophylaxis of GVHD based on 10mg/kg rabbit anti-human thymocyte&#xD;
      immunoglobin (ATG, ThymoglobulinÂ®, Genzyme Polyclonals S.A.S) effectively reduced the&#xD;
      occurrence of grade II-IV aGvHD. However, the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EB virus&#xD;
      (EBV) reactivation were higher due to a slower immune reconstitution. The 100-day cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of CMV and EBV viremia were both over 70% in our unmanipulated haplo-PBSCT program.&#xD;
      The optimal dose of ATG balancing the efficacy of GVHD prophylaxis and the risk of virus&#xD;
      reactivation in haplo-PBSCT remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports on the pharmacokinetics of Thymoglobulin in allo-HSCT revealed a high variability.&#xD;
      Recent pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the half-life of total ATG after transplant is&#xD;
      longer than the active ATG (which is available to bind to human lymphocytes and causes the&#xD;
      desired immunological effects). And active ATG appears more associated with pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      effects. The investigators found that virus reactivation and acute GVHD were highly affected&#xD;
      by ATG exposure (area under the curve, AUC) in previous cohort study. The investigators have&#xD;
      found an optimal range of active ATG exposure balancing the efficacy of GVHD prophylaxis and&#xD;
      the risk of virus reactivation. The incidence of CMV reactivation and III-IV aGVHD reduced to&#xD;
      60%, 6% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results suggested that Individualized dosing of ATG has a potential advantage in&#xD;
      balancing the efficacy of GVHD prophylaxis and the risk of virus reactivation in haplo-PBSCT.&#xD;
      This may improve the survival and quality of life of patients undergoing haplo-PBSCT. A&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial is required to compare the efficacy of Individualized dosage of&#xD;
      ATG as a prophylaxis for acute GVHD in haplo-PBSCT.&#xD;
