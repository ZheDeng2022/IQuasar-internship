  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The issue of medication adherence (MA) has long been undestimated but is now growing interest&#xD;
      due to both the increase of patients with chronic diseases and the aging of the population.&#xD;
      According to the World Health Organization, only 50% of patients with chronic illnesses&#xD;
      correctly follow physician's prescriptions in developed countries. Beyond the individual&#xD;
      consequences that failure to adherence can engender (increased morbidity, mortality and&#xD;
      hospitalizations), this concept also encompasses a collective dimension (risk of transmission&#xD;
      of infectious diseases and increased health care costs). Today, improving MA would have more&#xD;
      impact on human health than developping new medical therapies. That's why detecting&#xD;
      non-adherence constitutes a major public health issue in which pharmacists play a significant&#xD;
      role through medication reconciliation and patients' education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods wildly used are based on indirect measurement: questionnaires completed by the&#xD;
      patient himself or the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). Each method has its own advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages, but none is considered as the gold standard. The Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital set up a MA self-report scale ranging from 0 (low) to 10 (high adherence) in the&#xD;
      various care units where the clinical pharmacy activity is deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to assess the MA according to this numerical scale and the MPR&#xD;
      calculation, and evaluate the correlation between these two methods.&#xD;
