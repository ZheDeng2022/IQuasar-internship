      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Master the clinical feathers, imaging features and laboratory diagnosis characteristics&#xD;
      and economic costs of children pneumonia with higher D-dimer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the characteristics of different groups of children in the course of the&#xD;
           disease，clinicalsymptoms and signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All the children in the study need to do enhanced CT, to observe if there were&#xD;
           intrapulmonary vascular thrombosis and necrosis pneumonia signs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. compared changes of coagulation index beside D-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Compared with low molecular weight heparin prevention Disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation（DIC） dose and instructions to the recommended dose in safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness,and proposed elevated anticoagulation D-Dimer specification of the clinical&#xD;
      treatment of children with pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia is the main cause of lung function injury and death in children. The high blood&#xD;
      coagulation state can lead to the formation of pulmonary vascular thrombosis, local pulmonary&#xD;
      ischemia and necrosis, which may be an important mechanism for the occurrence of necrotizing&#xD;
      pneumonia and pulmonary embolism in children with pneumonia. Elevated D-dimer is an important&#xD;
      predictor of pulmonary thrombosis and necrotizing pneumonia. At present, D-Dimer in many&#xD;
      children with severe pneumonia is found to increase, the symptom is severe, the late stage of&#xD;
      the performance of necrotizing pneumonia, seriously affect the children's lung function and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single blind trial(Researchers are not blind, patients are&#xD;
      blind).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. .Experience group We will recruit 93 cases in our trial.All of them are with simple&#xD;
           pneumonia and are hospitalized in the respiratory department of our hospital, also&#xD;
           D-dimer is higher than or equal to 500ug / L, 93 cases as the observation group, were&#xD;
           randomly divided into A, B, C three sub group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. .Control group We will recruit 31 cases in our control group.And children in this group&#xD;
           are also with simple pneumonia,they will be similar with the experience group children&#xD;
           at the age, the disease course but their D-Dimer is lower than 500 ug/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.Randomized methods: A random number table was created by the statistical staff of the&#xD;
      non-present research group using SAS to generate random numbers table before the start of the&#xD;
      study. Selected children are in accordance with the A, B, C three groups of 1:1:1 ratio&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Study method: Fasting venous blood was extracted from all the children from the second&#xD;
      morning after admission to complete the coagulation function, blood routine, biochemical and&#xD;
      related inflammatory indicators and complete chest CT examination。The above indicators were&#xD;
      monitored dynamically during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Study protocal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A :Conventional treatment for children with pneumonia, without the use of low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B :Group B with prevention of DIC amount: low molecular weight heparin calcium 50-100&#xD;
      units / kg, once or twice subcutaneous injection, 5-10 days of treatment or D-Dimer recovery&#xD;
      normal. According to Huang Ke, disseminated intravascular coagulation, Huang Shaoliang, Zhou&#xD;
      Dunhua, editor in chief of pediatric hematology clinical manual, Third Edition, 601-602.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C :Group C with anticoagulant therapy: low molecular weight heparin calcium 100 units&#xD;
      /kg, subcutaneous injection, two times a day, treatment for 7 days orD-Dimer return to&#xD;
      normal. Low molecular weight heparin calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group :Conventional treatment for children with pneumonia, without the use of low&#xD;
      molecular weight heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis system(SAS).2 software was used for statistical analysis . The&#xD;
      continuous variables of the central tendency and the discrete trend are represented by the&#xD;
      median and the four point spacing, and the categorical variables are described by the&#xD;
      constituent ratio. Normal distribution of continuous variables between the 22 comparison&#xD;
      using T test, multiple comparisons using ANOVA. Non normal distribution of continuous&#xD;
      variables between the 22 comparison using Rank Sum Test Wilcoxon, multiple comparisons using&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis method. Statistical testing methods used properly. All the tests were taken by&#xD;
      alpha =0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.Study objection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. .Compare the group A with the control group of the clinical features&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Compare all of the patients in the observation group with the control group of the&#xD;
           chest CT features&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. .To observe the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy to children with D-dimer&#xD;
           increased pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.Sample size estimation：&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no evaluation of the efficacy of children with pneumonia combined with elevated&#xD;
      D-Dimer in China, studies have shown that severe pneumonia is often accompanied by elevated&#xD;
      D-Dimer. Therefore, this study only estimates the sample size based on the effective rate of&#xD;
      heparin in the treatment of severe pneumonia. According to Wang Xuanzhu's research [Wang&#xD;
      Xuanzhu. The efficacy of heparin in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children and its&#xD;
      effect on platelet parameters and D-dimers], the effective rate of conventional methods in&#xD;
      the treatment of severe pneumonia is 76.6%, and the effective rate of low-dose heparin&#xD;
      treatment is 95.8%. This study adopts a two-sided test, taking α=0.05, β=0.20, u0.05/2=1.96,&#xD;
      u0.2=0.8, p1=0.766, p2=0.958.Considering the possible loss to follow-up rate in this study is&#xD;
      10%, the sample size of each group should be: 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Reporting for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver function, coagulation function, and platelet monitoring were performed for each child&#xD;
      in the group. If there is a tendency to bleeding, the test was immediately terminated and&#xD;
      corresponding treatment was given.&#xD;
