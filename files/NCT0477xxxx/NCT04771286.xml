  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 1015550&#xD;
      and its metabolite BI 764333 (M480), [14C]-radioactivity, including mass balance, excretion&#xD;
      pathways and metabolism following a single oral dose BI 1015550 (C-14) administered to&#xD;
      healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the mass balance recovery of [14C]-radioactivity from urine and faeces as well as&#xD;
      vomit in case of occurrence after a single oral dose of BI 1015550 (C-14) administered to&#xD;
      healthy male subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics of [C-14]-BI 1015550 and BI 1015550 as well as its&#xD;
           metabolite BI 764333 in plasma following a single oral dose of BI 1015550 (C-14)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of BI 1015550&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a&#xD;
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), and clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study, in&#xD;
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who meet any of the following criteria from screening until 90 days&#xD;
             after trial completion:&#xD;

             hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
