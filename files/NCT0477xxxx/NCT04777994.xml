  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-CLS-484 as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 targeting agent. The trial aims to establish a&#xD;
      safe, tolerable, and efficacious dose of ABBV-CLS-484 as monotherapy and in combination. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in three parts. Part 1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation, Part 2&#xD;
      Combination Dose Escalation and Part 3 Dose Expansion (Monotherapy and Combination therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone in escalating dose levels to eligible&#xD;
      subjects who have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered at escalating dose levels in combination with a&#xD;
      PD-1 targeting agent to eligible subjects who have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3, ABBV-CLS-484 will be administered alone as a monotherapy at the determined&#xD;
      recommended dose in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, relapsed or refractory head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC), and advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). ABBV-CLS-484 will also be&#xD;
      administered at the determined recommended dose in combination with a PD-1 targeting agent in&#xD;
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic, relapsed or refractory gastric or GEJ&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
