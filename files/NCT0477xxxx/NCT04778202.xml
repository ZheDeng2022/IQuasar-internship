      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of miRNA 125a -5p and miRNA143-3p as a non&#xD;
      invasive biomarker in diagnosis of breast cancer and the relationship between MiRNA&#xD;
      expression and histopathological features as tumor stage ,grade ,molecular subtypes. Also&#xD;
      trying to correlate the results with MRI radiological findings which may help in better&#xD;
      selection of treatment protocols.&#xD;

      Breast cancer ( BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The incidence&#xD;
      and mortality rates for female breast cancer far exceeded those for other cancers . Although&#xD;
      the incidence rate of breast cancer has risen, the mortality rates have steadily fallen due&#xD;
      to early diagnosis and better treatments . Early detection of breast cancer often leads to&#xD;
      better outcomes. According to Cancer Australia's National Cancer Control Indicators, the&#xD;
      relative survival for females diagnosed with early-stage breast cancers at diagnosis was much&#xD;
      higher than that for those with advanced breast diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the improvement in diagnosis and treatment,approximately 20% of BC patients will&#xD;
      develop metastasis.This setting is considered an incurable disease that often occurs due to&#xD;
      either resistance to therapy or diagnosis at advanced stages . In this scenario, although 44%&#xD;
      of the patients are diagnosed at stage I (AJCC cancer staging) with 5-year survival rates of&#xD;
      100%, 5% of patients are diagnosed at stage IV with 5-year survival rates of approximately&#xD;
      26% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The small percentage of women diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease gives evidence that&#xD;
      mammography represents the best available screening option for breast cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, more accurate and meaningful early-diagnosis methods together with image techniques&#xD;
      would improve BC survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are short endogenous noncoding RNA molecules of 19-25 nt that have&#xD;
      important gene regulatory roles at post-transcriptional level [8, 9]. They pair with&#xD;
      messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein-coding genes and depending on complementarity, leading to&#xD;
      mRNa translational repression or degradation . They regulate 30% of transcripts and contain&#xD;
      3% of the human genome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, miRNAs were established as relevant molecular components of cells in&#xD;
      normal or malignant processes.. Particularly, miRNAs have been demonstrated to have an&#xD;
      important role in cancer biology through post transcriptional editing of target messenger&#xD;
      RNAs expression involved in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis or immune escape .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several tumor-associated miRNA profiles have been proposed and investigated as&#xD;
      biomarkers for diagnosis, survival, response to treatment or tumor subclassification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of early diagnostic tools is of most interest to the clinics since early&#xD;
      diagnosis is associated with better prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, miRNAs have been demonstrated to be good early diagnostic biomarkers in&#xD;
      several types of cancer including BC, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main advantages of circulating miRNAs is their high stability in body fluids ,&#xD;
      which is the main reason for them to be used in cancer diagnosis or prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the assessment of circulating miRNAs can be carried out with simple, lowcost and&#xD;
      quick assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These characteristics highlight the value of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers. Indeed,&#xD;
      several miRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in blood, plasma or serum from&#xD;
      healthy donors compared with BC patients, supporting their use as noninvasive, early-stage&#xD;
      diagnosis biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growing evidences revealed that imaging techniques are associated with some limitations such&#xD;
      as expensive. Hence, it seems that utilization of improvement imaging techniques and&#xD;
      biochemistry biomarkers could overcome the limitations associated with imaging techniques.&#xD;
      Beside utilization of imaging techniques, identification of new biomarkers in patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer has provided an interesting landscape .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So studies have identified different circulating miRNAs as new biomarkers for BC detection;&#xD;
      Moreover, they have not been assessed in conjunction with diagnostic imaging, which is used&#xD;
      for quantifying the extent of the disease and provides information related to tumour&#xD;
      aggressiveness representing an obligatory step for treatment planning. The use of diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging to extract quantitative parameters related to the morphology, metabolism and&#xD;
      functionality of tumours, as well as to correlate specific imaging parameters with molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers, is an emerging research topic&#xD;
