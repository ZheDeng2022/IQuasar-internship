      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory viruses circulate throughout the year and around the globe. Wearable and sensor&#xD;
      devices, like smartwatches, may be able to help monitor infectious diseases. Researchers want&#xD;
      to use them to learn how respiratory viruses affect people in different ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use digital devices to collect data from participants in challenge studies that could&#xD;
      indicate subtle changes in health during an infection that might otherwise go unnoticed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults who have enrolled in a challenge study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at NIH for at least 9 days and then they will have outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While at NIH, participants will wear a smartwatch at all times. It will record data like&#xD;
      temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 smartphones. One will be recording at all times to listen for&#xD;
      coughing. Participants will use the other smartphone to check their vital signs. They will&#xD;
      collect data like heart rate, temperature, and the level of oxygen in the blood every 4 hours&#xD;
      during the daytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform tasks every 4 hours during the daytime. They will record themselves&#xD;
      coughing, breathing in deeply, and reading aloud. They will take pictures and videos of their&#xD;
      face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bedside sensor will record participants while they sleep. It will record heart rate and&#xD;
      breathing rate. It will also look at sleep activity, such as movements participants make&#xD;
      during sleep and how deeply they sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants sharing the same room will be exposed to the same challenge virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outpatient visits, participants will use one smartphone and the smartwatch to complete&#xD;
      the above tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last from 10 weeks to 1 year.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Digital Biomarker Discovery in Respiratory Virus Challenge Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable and sensor digital devices have the potential to be important tools in infectious&#xD;
      diseases surveillance. In this study, digital devices will be used to evaluate responses&#xD;
      before and after respiratory virus challenge on a separate NIH protocol. Participants already&#xD;
      enrolled in a challenge study are eligible. All devices will be worn and/or used during the&#xD;
      inpatient hospitalization and at outpatient follow-up visits. Participants will not be&#xD;
      discharged home with any devices. These devices will be used to identify biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with respiratory virus infection. We hypothesize that sensor collected data will&#xD;
      correlate with symptom severity obtained by clinician assessment and participant report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To correlate continuous cough sensor data to cough severity after challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To correlate continuous and noncontinuous vital sign sensor data to routine vital&#xD;
      signs obtained by clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: To evaluate facial and body sensor data after challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Cough quantity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Continuous cough measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Vital signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Respiratory rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pulse oximetry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Facial and body sensor data via quantitative measures of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Forced nasal inspiration&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Forced cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Facial imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Sleep monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Activity monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Reading aloud&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N=50 adult healthy volunteers enrolled in LID CSU respiratory virus challenge studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled at the NIH Clinical Center (CC). This study will take place at&#xD;
      the NIH CC in the Special Clinical Studies Unit or other appropriate designated clinical area&#xD;
      for the inpatient hospitalization and in the OP8 clinic or other appropriate designated&#xD;
      clinical area for outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3 years from start of enrollment to completion of data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 10 weeks through 1 year depending on the challenge study. This includes a&#xD;
      minimum 9-day inpatient hospitalization for respiratory virus challenge through the follow-up&#xD;
      visit 8 weeks to 1 year after discharge.&#xD;
