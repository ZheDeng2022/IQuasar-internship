  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although, a huge number of acute wounds is treated successfully every year, Health Care&#xD;
      Professionals (HCPs) are facing more and more problems when treating skin damages or surgical&#xD;
      incisions: The number of patients with fragile and/or sensitive skin is highly increasing.&#xD;
      Such patients are having a skin integrity issue, meaning the skin is vulnerable to injury,&#xD;
      often damaged, or unable to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational medical devices (IMDs) of the planned clinical evaluation, Leukomed® T&#xD;
      skin sensitive and Leukomed® T plus skin sensitive have been developed for treatment of acute&#xD;
      wounds on patients with fragile or sensitive skin to provide a reliable but skin-friendly&#xD;
      fixation and wound care option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this clinical study is the evaluation of clinical performance to stay&#xD;
      in place up to seven days and the safety of both dressings. Further, data on wearing comfort,&#xD;
      product handling, pain during removal and quality of life are considered as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. The products will be used as part of routine wound care within the scope of their&#xD;
      intended purpose without any additional invasive or burdensome examination.&#xD;
