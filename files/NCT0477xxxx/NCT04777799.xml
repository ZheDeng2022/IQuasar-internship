  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of insomnia includes, as a first step, a healthy lifestyle, including physical&#xD;
      activity at appropriate times, nutritional monitoring, reduced consumption of stimulants,&#xD;
      bedtime and wake-up times that do not vary between weekdays and weekends, banning screens at&#xD;
      least two hours before bedtime, etc. If all these conditions are met and insomnia persists,&#xD;
      additionnal therapies may be offered. URGOTECH has developed a connected headband allowing to&#xD;
      practice neurofeedback in complete autonomy in subjects reporting dissatisfaction with the&#xD;
      quality of their sleep.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the parameters of brain activity used in neurofeedback, the most frequently used EEG&#xD;
      activity is training to strengthen sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). This training could make it&#xD;
      possible to reduce cortical hyperstimulation associated with certain sleep disorders. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the application of such a neurofeedback technique in an ecological&#xD;
      situation at home will improve the subjective quality of their sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject must perform, at home, at least 3 sessions per week with the URGOnight solution&#xD;
      for about 4 months. Since regularity is important in order to observe effects, subjects are&#xD;
      followed up by smartphone application at least 3 times over the training period.&#xD;

    <description>URGOnight is a daytime brain training solution (CE marked) aim at improve the quality of sleep. The device consists of an electroencephalographic (EEG) measuring strip connected to a mobile application. The latter is available free of charge on Android and iOS in various mobile application stores (Google Play Store and App Store).&#xD;
URGOnight is a wireless device, it connects via Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) to the URGOnight mobile application running on a smartphone. The EEG data is broadcast via a BLE protocol, and the standard Bluetooth® operating distance has a range of 10 meters.&#xD;
To use the URGOnight solution, the user must authorize the application to access his phone's memory to store his usage data and must also authorize the geolocation of his phone to enable BLE connection. This data is not recorded but is necessary for the proper functioning of the solution.</description>
