    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal for every health-care system is to have a healthy population by maintaining&#xD;
      good physical fitness levels and lifestyle habits, including regular physical activity, good&#xD;
      sleep quality, smoking and alcohol abstinence. The main components of physical fitness&#xD;
      include body composition, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and cardiovascular&#xD;
      endurance. National research based on actual and perceived physical fitness levels in&#xD;
      University of Malta (UM) students where both physical and non-physical testing are included,&#xD;
      is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, to the knowledge of the researcher, no such research investigated the relationship&#xD;
      between the actual and perceived levels of physical fitness with lifestyle habits (smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the correlation between the actual and perceived levels of&#xD;
      physical fitness (body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance&#xD;
      and flexibility) by physical and non-physical testing, the correlation between lifestyle&#xD;
      patterns (smoking, alcohol consumption and sleep.&#xD;

      The ultimate goal for every health-care system is to have a healthy population by maintaining&#xD;
      good physical fitness levels and lifestyle habits, including regular physical activity, good&#xD;
      sleep quality, smoking and alcohol abstinence. The main components of physical fitness&#xD;
      include body composition, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and cardiovascular&#xD;
      endurance. A national research based on actual and perceived physical fitness levels in&#xD;
      University of Malta (UM) students where both physical and non-physical testing are included,&#xD;
      is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, to the knowledge of the researcher, no such research investigated the relationship&#xD;
      between the actual and perceived levels of physical fitness with lifestyle habits (smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the correlation between the actual and perceived levels of&#xD;
      physical fitness (body composition, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance&#xD;
      and flexibility) by physical and non-physical testing, the correlation between lifestyle&#xD;
      patterns (smoking, alcohol consumption and sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed research shall adopt a quantitative-based, correlational type of study design.&#xD;
      Registrar and student organisations shall act as intermediary entities and send an&#xD;
      information letter via electronic mail to all students aged between 18-30 years. All&#xD;
      participants who respond to the call, on attendance to a pre-set date for a face-to-face&#xD;
      information session by the researcher, will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Each&#xD;
      participant will come for data collection only once at the Department of Physiotherapy&#xD;
      laboratories, Faculty of Health Sciences, at the University of Malta and shall take around 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every query will be answered, a detailed explanation and demonstration of each test will be&#xD;
      given to each participant, and qualified physiotherapists will perform the testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study, the aim of The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND),&#xD;
      Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)&#xD;
      is to quantitatively study various lifestyle habits in UM students including smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and sleep quality respectively. The Self-Perceived Fitness questionnaire (SPF)&#xD;
      shall be used to measure self-perceived physical fitness in University of Malta students. The&#xD;
      Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence is open-access, and can be used for free for research&#xD;
      purposes. On the other hand, permissions to use the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification&#xD;
      Test, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Self-Perceived Fitness questionnaire were given by&#xD;
      their respective authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition shall be measured by Body Mass Index and Waist Circumference, lower and&#xD;
      upper limb flexibility shall be measured by Modified Sit and Reach Test and Back Scratch Test&#xD;
      respectively. In addition, cardiovascular endurance shall be measured by Resting Heart Rate,&#xD;
      Blood Pressure and 3 Min Step Test, while Squats and Push-ups until fatigue shall be used to&#xD;
      measure lower and upper limb muscular strength and endurance. All data will then be analysed&#xD;
      using statistical methods.&#xD;
