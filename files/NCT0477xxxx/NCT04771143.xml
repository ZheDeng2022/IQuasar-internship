  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess safety, tolerability and interactions of AFQ056 and cocaine in&#xD;
      patients with cocaine use disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, participant- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study to assess safety and tolerability and to compare the effects of AFQ056 on IV&#xD;
      cocaine's physiological and subjective effects in non-treatment seeking, cocaine-experienced&#xD;
      participants who meet American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      (DSM-V) criteria for cocaine use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately twenty participants will be randomized to 2 groups (10 in each group),&#xD;
      receiving either AFQ056 or placebo treatment for 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for eligibility as outpatients and inpatients. Outpatient&#xD;
      screening will occur between Day -28 and Day -4. On Study Day -3, participants will undergo&#xD;
      clinic intake to screen for continued eligibility. On Study Day -2, participants will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility with a participant-blinded screening infusion (Infusion Session 1)&#xD;
      of 20 mg cocaine, followed by a saline infusion, followed by a 40 mg cocaine infusion. Each 2&#xD;
      ml infusion of cocaine and saline will be administered by IV over a 60 second time period and&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes apart. Physiological and subjective data (VAS) from these sessions&#xD;
      will be part of the eligibility criteria to continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a participant has been determined to be eligible, the participant will be randomized on&#xD;
      Day -1 to receive either AFQ056 or placebo in a 1:1: ratio and at the same time, will also be&#xD;
      randomized to a specific couple of sequences saline/cocaine or cocaine/saline for Infusion&#xD;
      Session 2 and Infusion Session 3 within each treatment group. The order of the saline and&#xD;
      cocaine infusions for each participant for Infusion Sessions 4 and 5 will be the same as the&#xD;
      randomized order for Infusion Sessions 2 and 3, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive baseline infusions determined by the randomized sequences of saline&#xD;
      and 20 mg of cocaine on Day 1 (Infusion Session 2) and saline and 40 mg of cocaine on Day 2&#xD;
      (Infusion Session 3). The participants will receive either AFQ056 or matching placebo twice a&#xD;
      day from Days 3 to 9. The AFQ056 treatment group will be up titrated to 200 mg according to&#xD;
      the following dosing schedule: Day 3: 50 mg twice daily; Day 4: 100 mg twice daily and Days&#xD;
      5-9: 200 mg twice daily. On Day 10, participants will be administered only the morning dose&#xD;
      of AFQ056 200 mg or placebo. AFQ056 doses must be taken within 30 minutes of meals. On Day 9&#xD;
      and Day 10, approximately 4 hours after the morning dose of AFQ056 200 mg or placebo,&#xD;
      participants will receive treatment infusions determined by the randomized sequence of saline&#xD;
      and 20 mg of cocaine on Day 9 (Infusion Session 4) and saline and 40 mg of cocaine on Day 10&#xD;
      (Infusion Session 5). The participants will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 12,&#xD;
      two days after the last infusion of cocaine (Infusion Session 5) and will have a Follow-up&#xD;
      visit between 7 and 14 days after clinic discharge. A safety follow-up call will be conducted&#xD;
      30 days following the last administration of study treatment on Day 40.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will undergo a screening infusion session with saline and cocaine on Day -2 as part of the eligibility determination. Once deemed eligible, participants will undergo screening infusion sessions 2 and 3 on Days 1 and 2 respectively. Starting Day 3, participants will receive either AFQ056 or matching placebo twice a day from Day 3 to Day 9. The AFQ056 treatment group will be up titrated to 200 mg according to the following dosing schedule: Day 3: 50 mg twice daily; Day 4: 100 mg twice daily and Days 5-9: 200 mg twice daily. On Day 10, participants will be administered only the morning dose of AFQ056 200 mg or placebo. On Days 9 and 10, participants will have infusion session 4 and 5 respectively. The participants will be discharged from the clinic on Day 12 and return for a follow-up visit between 7 to 14 days after clinic discharge. A safety follow-up call will be conducted on Day 40.</intervention_model_description>
