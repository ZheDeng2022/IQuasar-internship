      This study compares the effectiveness and safety of 2 digital therapeutics in adult subjects&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, 12-week, multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of two digital therapeutics in adult subjects diagnosed with MDD who&#xD;
      are on antidepressant therapy (ADT) monotherapy for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a 2-week screening period, a 6-week treatment period, and a 4-week&#xD;
      extension period. All trial visits will be conducted remotely either by video visit or&#xD;
      telephone. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 digital therapeutics within a&#xD;
      mobile application that will reside on the subject's personal iPhone or smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial population will include male and female subjects between 22 and 64 years of age&#xD;
      with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) who are on an ADT for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression. This trial will analyze data gathered from up to 540 subjects in the&#xD;
      United States. An interim analysis will be conducted when a targeted sample of the first 180&#xD;
      subjects has completed week 6 or discontinued the trial prior to week 6.&#xD;
