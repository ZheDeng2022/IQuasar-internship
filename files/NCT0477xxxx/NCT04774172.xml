  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disease affecting the eyes, skeleton, heart and arteries.&#xD;
      Despite MFS affecting multiple organ systems, cardiovascular manifestations are the most&#xD;
      serious and life threatening. Approximately 80% of adult MFS patients will have a dilated&#xD;
      aortic root by age 40 years with aortic aneurysm and dissection the leading causes of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Improvement in diagnostics and medical and surgical interventions&#xD;
      have increased life expectancy. However, the natural history and the influence of medical or&#xD;
      surgical interventions in the UK population are not fully described. Further, the incidence&#xD;
      of aortovascular surgery in this patient group is unknown as MFS is not routinely documented&#xD;
      in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcome Research (NICOR) national cardiac surgery&#xD;
      dataset and therefore, there is currently no mechanism for exploring the aortovascular&#xD;
      outcomes for this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to undertake a 10-year secondary analysis of linked national data&#xD;
      (National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcome Research (NICOR), Office of National Statistics&#xD;
      (ONS), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)) to identify the UK incidence and outcome of&#xD;
      aorto-vascular surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). This includes associated&#xD;
      hospital length of stay, mortality and morbidity rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding mortality alongside morbidity will allow the investigators to study further the&#xD;
      burdens that the aortovascular manifestations may place on MFS population as well as to&#xD;
      continuously evaluate the efficacy of either the health care system or an implemented&#xD;
      intervention in place. Further, these metrics will be useful for the stakeholders to&#xD;
      effectively prioritise which complications to tackle and to allocate resources toward as well&#xD;
      as proactively manage the potential onset of a health event&#xD;
