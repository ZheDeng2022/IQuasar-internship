  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol aims to evaluate the efficacy of a theoretically and stakeholder informed&#xD;
      patient-centered genetic Interactive Health Communication Application to increase patient&#xD;
      understanding of, and affective and behavioral responses to genetic testing. The study&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention will be associated with increases in&#xD;
      knowledge, decreases in distress, increases in communication with relatives and health care&#xD;
      providers, and increases in performance of risk reducing health behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As clinical practice increasingly use multi-gene testing, many patients are left with&#xD;
      unknowns after genetic testing. Many have results that are unclear and may or may not be&#xD;
      associated with any risk for cancer (Variants of Uncertain Significance), or mutations in&#xD;
      genes with very limited information about disease risk or the best medical management.&#xD;
      Importantly, many of these uncertainties will be clarified over time, but there is a need for&#xD;
      effective ways of communicating these updates to patients who had testing months or years&#xD;
      ago. In some cases, there may be multiple updates over time. To address this, this study will&#xD;
      provide patients access, using an Interactive Health Communication Application, MyCancerGene,&#xD;
      to information about their genetic testing, their specific results and the implications, the&#xD;
      ability to print reports and other materials for their relatives and other health care&#xD;
      providers and to assess if there has been a change in the personal or family history.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients can contact their genetic provider through MyCancerGene and the cancer&#xD;
      genetics team can send out updates to patients about their individual results or about new&#xD;
      information about risk estimates or screening recommendations. The study investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that MyCancerGene will be associated with increases in knowledge, decreases in&#xD;
      distress, increases in communication with relatives and health care providers, and increases&#xD;
      in cancer screening and risk reducing health behaviors. After 18 months, all patients will&#xD;
      have access to MyCancerGene, which will aid in understanding who benefits most and least from&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
