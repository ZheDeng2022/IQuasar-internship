  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective study of all congenital diaphragmatic&#xD;
      hernia (CDH) neonates managed at the University of Utah newborn intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      and Primary Children's Hospital NICU that required mechanical ventilation at birth. As both&#xD;
      high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are&#xD;
      standard approaches to ventilatory support of all neonates including CDH, CDH infants will be&#xD;
      randomized at the time of birth or admission to either HFJV or HFOV as initial ventilator&#xD;
      mode, stratified by position of the liver in the abdomen or thorax (if known) by 24 hours of&#xD;
      age. Measures of oxygenation, ventilation and hemodynamics of the CDH cohort managed on HFOV&#xD;
      compared to those on HFJV.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>High Frequency Jet Ventilator</intervention_name>
    <description>HFJV provides short bursts of gas into the respiratory circuit at a rate of 240 to 600/min (4 to 11 Hz) and expiration is passive. It is used in conjunction with a conventional ventilator which provides positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and can also provide occasional sigh breaths.</description>

  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilator</intervention_name>
    <description>HFOV uses a piston diaphragm to generate alternating positive and negative pressure changes to give breaths of 300 to 900/min (5-15 Hz) given over a set mean airway pressure. Both inhalation and exhalation are active.</description>
