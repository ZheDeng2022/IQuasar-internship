  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an initial investigation of the feasibility of applying Bayesian sequential&#xD;
      analyses to individual participant single-case data for rapid detection of whether or not the&#xD;
      individual is benefitting from a low-intensity computerized cognitive training intervention&#xD;
      for depression. Patients waiting for, or in follow-up from, outpatient psychological therapy&#xD;
      will complete first a two-week period of daily symptom monitoring, followed by two different&#xD;
      two-week cognitive training interventions. Data collected will be used to assess feasibility&#xD;
      of a future formal case series using Bayesian sequential analyses to determine switching of&#xD;
      interventions, and inform the analysis parameters for such a future study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is an exploratory single-case series using a within-subject ABC design, with a baseline phase (A) followed by two intervention phases (B) and (C). Participants are randomly assigned to the order in which they complete the two different interventions.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report Daily Version (QIDS-daily)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention (4 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-daily is an adapted version of the QIDS-SR (Rush et al., 2003), which asks about symptoms over the past day and does not include the weight gain/loss items (as used by Holmes et al., 2016). The QIDS-daily will be completed daily over the entire study period, and we will compare the mean and slope of the daily QIDS over the intervention phase to the mean and slope of the daily QIDS in the previous phase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The standard QIDS-SR (Rush et al., 2003) is a measure of depression symptoms asking about symptoms over the past seven days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The DARS (Rizvi et al., 2015) is a 17-item self-report measure of different facets of anhedonia (desire, motivation, effort and consummatory pleasure) across different hedonic domains (hobbies/past-times, food/drinks, social activities, and sensory experiences).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Positive subscale (PANAS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This 18-item positive subscale comprises the Joviality, Self-Assurance, and Attentiveness subscales of the extended PANAS (PANAS-X; Watson &amp; Clark, 1994), and in the current study asks about experience of positive emotions over the past week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a brief (7 items) self-report anxiety questionnaire designed as a screener for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in primary care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The PMH (Lukat et al., 2016) consists of 9 items designed to assess positive mental health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prospective Imagery Test (PIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The PIT (St√∂ber, 2000) is a measure of the vividness with which participants can imagine positive events in their future. In the current study, two 10-item (5 positive and 5 negative) versions are used, with the order counterbalanced across participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feedback questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Feedback questionnaires will be used at the end of each intervention phase, asking about the intervention just completed. Further feedback about the study as a whole will be collected on study completion.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline), end of study (6 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The NEQ (Rozental et al., 2019) asks about potential negative effects of psychological interventions. The short (20-item) version is used, adapted to ask about the cognitive training interventions.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Credibility / Expectancy Questionnaires (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, pre-intervention (2 weeks post-baseline), between interventions (4 weeks post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ (Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000) asks participants' assessment of the credibility of the intervention they are about to receive, and their expectation of improvement in symptoms over the course of the intervention. In this study it will be administered before each phase: prior to baseline phase (about completing daily questionnaires), and prior to each intervention phase, about the imagery CBM and Cognitive Control Training as appropriate.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>

Daily QIDS will be completed throughout the intervention phases.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Imagery Cognitive Bias Modification</intervention_name>
    <description>The imagery cognitive bias modification intervention is derived from that developed via experimental psychopathology research (e.g. Holmes et al., 2009) and adapted for clinical applications in the context of depression (e.g. Blackwell &amp; Holmes, 2010; Blackwell et al., 2015). The intervention is a series of training sessions in which participants listen to training scenarios consisting of descriptions of everyday situations, structured so that they start ambiguously but always end positively. Participants are instructed to imagine themselves in the situations described as the scenarios unfold. The training aims to train a bias to automatically imagine positive resolutions for ambiguous situations encountered in daily life.&#xD;
Participants will complete one introductory session of the training with the researcher present (in the outpatient center, or via videoconferencing software), then 8 sessions over two weeks completed from home via the study website.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Control Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The cognitive control training is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), adapted from that applied in previous studies (e.g. Siegle et al., 2007; Hoorelbeke et al., 2015; Blackwell et al., 2018). Participants will complete one introductory session of the training with the researcher present (in the outpatient center, or via videoconferencing software), then 8 sessions over two weeks completed from home via the study website.</description>
