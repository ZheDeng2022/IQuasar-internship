    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how different types of exercise regimens (resistance, aerobic,&#xD;
      or combined exercise regimens) can be used to minimize muscle loss and mobilize body fat in&#xD;
      severely obese patients after bariatric surgery (BS), despite the rapid surgery-induced&#xD;
      weight loss. Additionally, the study will examine how changes in the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      following BS act as a mediation factor that alter tissue-specific responses in muscle and&#xD;
      adipose tissue. The study will also evaluate the effect of different types of exercise&#xD;
      regimens on cardiometabolic markers, endocrine response, and physical function following BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty sedentary (regular exercise &lt;1 hour per week) candidates to bariatric surgery at&#xD;
      Herzliya Medical Center will be recruited to participate in this six-month-long randomized&#xD;
      control study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of three exercise&#xD;
      regimens intervention groups (aerobic, resistance, or a combined exercise regimen combining&#xD;
      aerobic and resistance exercises) or a control group that will receive standard care.&#xD;
      Training will be supervised and matched for metabolic equivalent (METs). The intervention&#xD;
      will take place at the Sylvan Adams Sports Institute at Tel Aviv University and an online&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will be taken at a presurgical baseline assessment and throughout the study,&#xD;
      and will include changes of muscle mass and adipose tissue distribution, measured by a&#xD;
      3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); body composition- will be assessed using&#xD;
      multichannel bioelectrical impedance (Seca); Bone mass, will be measured by a Dual-energy&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA); microbiota composition and changes will be evaluated by stool&#xD;
      samples that will be subjected to 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16s rRNA) profiling and&#xD;
      metagenomics analysis; fasting blood samples will be used to examine endocrine control and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic markers; anthropometric measurements to assess surgery results associations&#xD;
      with physical activity outcomes and physical function will be assessed by several validated&#xD;
      performance assessments, including handgrip, six-minute walk, sit-to-stand, maximum voluntary&#xD;
      contraction, and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max).&#xD;

      The primary aim will be to determine how different types of exercise regimens (resistance,&#xD;
      aerobic, or combined exercise regimens) can be used to minimize muscle loss and mobilize body&#xD;
      fat in severely obese patients after BS, despite the rapid surgery-induced weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims will include: I. To examine the effect of different exercise regimens on the&#xD;
      composition and diversity of microbiomes, and their role in mediating muscle mass&#xD;
      preservation following BS. II.Evaluate changes in cardiometabolic markers and endocrine&#xD;
      response to different exercise regimens and evaluates microbiome mediation of these changes&#xD;
      after BS. III.Assess the effect of different exercise regimens on physical function among&#xD;
      patients following BS. IV.Clarify the mechanisms of muscle preservation and fat loss&#xD;
      involving hormonal response and atrophy related-genes expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline measurements (detailed below), participants will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      four groups: 1. control group (n=15) that includes routine health care; 2. aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training group (n=15), 3. resistance exercise training group (n=15), 4. combined aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance exercise training group (n=15). Training sessions will be both in-person and as&#xD;
      online exercise supervision. All groups will be supported by a dietitian as part of the&#xD;
      routine health care after the bariatric surgery. The dietetic program for all groups will&#xD;
      consist of a balanced diet by diet progression guidelines for bariatric patients (XX,ZZ) and&#xD;
      the bariatric food pyramid (55). The protein content will be a minimum of 60 gr/protein per&#xD;
      day, according to current guidelines (XX,ZZ) . Each training session will increase gradually&#xD;
      up to 60 minutes per session, three times a week. Participants will be randomized into 4&#xD;
      groups for 26 weeks of intervention including aerobic, resistance, combined exercise training&#xD;
      (aerobic + resistance) and a control group without exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercise training will be matched in metabolic equivalent (METs) and the time of training&#xD;
      per week. Participants will begin a two weeks exercise adaptation period at 3-4 postoperative&#xD;
      weeks. The activity adaptation plan will consist of 15-20 min. of walking, three times per&#xD;
      week, at an intensity of 40-60% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) or rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE) 4-6 on the Borg scale for all intervention groups. Following this period, each&#xD;
      group will participate in a specific progressive training with the following regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aerobic exercise training group, weeks 5-8 after surgery: this training will consist of&#xD;
           30 min. of walking, 3 times per week at an intensity of 60-70% of peak VO2 or RPE 6-7 on&#xD;
           Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Weeks 9-26 after surgery: this training will consist of 60 minutes of exercise, 3 times&#xD;
           per week at an intensity of 65-80% of peak VO2 or RPE 6-8 on the Borg scale. The aerobic&#xD;
           exercises will consist of a treadmill or outside walking or running, stationary cycling&#xD;
           or elliptical trainer in continuous and interval training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resistance exercise training group, weeks 5-8 after surgery: this training will consist&#xD;
           of 5-10 minutes of warmup, followed by 6-8 multi-joint exercises for major muscle&#xD;
           groups, comprising 2 sets of 10 to 25 repetitions at 40% of the one-repetition maximum&#xD;
           (1-RM) for each exercise. The intensity will increase on weeks 9-26 after surgery to&#xD;
           8-10 multi-joint exercises of 3-4 sets of 10 to 25 repetitions. For this training&#xD;
           participants will use free-weights and bodyweight exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The combination exercise training will consist of a combined aerobic and resistance&#xD;
           exercise training sessions three times weekly. At weeks 5-8 after surgery, the sessions&#xD;
           will include 5-10 minutes of warmup, followed by 3-4 multi-joint exercises for major&#xD;
           muscle groups, comprising 2 sets of 10 to 25 repetitions at 40% of the one-repetition&#xD;
           maximum (1-RM) for each exercise. Afterward, the aerobic part of the training will&#xD;
           consist of 10-15 minutes of aerobic exercises (treadmill or outside walking or running,&#xD;
           stationary cycling or outdoors or elliptical trainer) at 60-70% of peak VO2 or RPE 6-7&#xD;
           at Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intensity will increase on weeks 9-26 after surgery to 4-5 multi-joint exercises of&#xD;
           3-4 sets of 10 to 25 repetitions and 30 minutes of aerobic exercises at 65-80% of peak&#xD;
           VO2 or RPE 6-8 at Borg scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The control group will receive conventional treatment so as the other groups (medical&#xD;
           and nutritional follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan...&#xD;
