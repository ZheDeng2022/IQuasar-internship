      The aim of this research is to determine the effect of the snow globe, which is used as a&#xD;
      method of diverting attention, to the perception of pain that develops during the application&#xD;
      of vaccines in infants between 2-6 months of age.&#xD;

      Atraumatic care philosophy developed by Donna Wong; it is a principle of therapeutic care&#xD;
      aimed at minimizing or eliminating the physical and psychological problems experienced by the&#xD;
      child and his/her family. Pediatric nurse; it is obliged to offer atraumatic care by ensuring&#xD;
      the cooperation of the child and his/her family, reducing pain and controlling stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the principles of atraumatic care; limitation of painful initiatives to&#xD;
      prevent or reduce physical stress sources, regulation of environmental conditions, use of&#xD;
      pharmacological and nonpharmamological pain removal methods in the presence of pain;&#xD;
      promoting family-centered care in order to ensure the unity of children and family members;&#xD;
      informing the child and his family about care to ensure the development of a sense of&#xD;
      control, resting recommendations on care, establishing a daily care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Pain Association considers pain the fifth life finding. Studies show that all&#xD;
      babies, including preterm babies, suffer pain and can distinguish pain from other sensory&#xD;
      experiences. Controlling pain in children is multidisciplinary team work. It makes the nurse&#xD;
      different from other team members in the control of pain and ensures that she is in an&#xD;
      indispensable position; the nurse spends a long time with children, learns about the child's&#xD;
      previous pain experiences and methods of coping with pain and benefits from coping methods&#xD;
      when necessary, teaching the child and his family strategies to cope with pain, guiding them,&#xD;
      applying planned treatment, monitoring their effects, results and empathizing, in short,&#xD;
      being able to practice the nursing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are often subjected to painful invasive interventions from the newborn period;&#xD;
      however, they have a structure that requires the consideration of their level of development,&#xD;
      cognitive and communicative skills, previous experiences of pain. According to the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics , newborns and children are exposed to a total of 24 injections due to&#xD;
      vaccination in the first 2 years of their life. In Turkey, the total number of injections for&#xD;
      routine vaccination of children up to 2 years of age is 18. The negative effects of pain,&#xD;
      which cannot be managed effectively, in physiological and psychological dimensions can occur&#xD;
      even years later. The pain and stress experienced with deterioration in the clinical&#xD;
      condition of newborns brings many complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in children is more difficult to assess than in adults. The perception of pain in&#xD;
      children, age, gender, family reactions to pain, previous experiences, insomnia, fatigue,&#xD;
      fear, sadness, anger, being in an unpleasant environment can affect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions caused by pain include short-term changes such as respiratory irregularity,&#xD;
      hypoxemia, fading or redness, blood pressure changes, increased heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      consumption, enlargement of pupils, as well as permanent, structural and functional&#xD;
      (endocrine, behavior and immune system) changes. It negatively affects the behavior, family&#xD;
      infant interaction, diet and clinical course of babies who warn of long-term and frequent&#xD;
      pain, as well as prevents the baby's adaptation to the outside world. Repeated painful&#xD;
      interventions can lead to neurotoxia and lead to deterioration in social cohesion, anxiety,&#xD;
      change in pain sensitivity, stress disorders, hyperactivity/attention deprivation in the&#xD;
      future. That's why the American Pain Society (APS) and the American Academy Of Pediatrics&#xD;
      (AAP) recommend minimizing pain and anxiety due to procedures. The high number of vaccines&#xD;
      for children and infants and the psychological traumas caused by the pain caused by the&#xD;
      vaccines make it mandatory to intervene in the pain that occurs during vaccination and are&#xD;
      one of the ethical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that nurses do not make adequate pain assessments and do not use&#xD;
      nonpharmamological methods effectively. Nonpharmaciological pain methods, which are effective&#xD;
      in consequential or alone, can also be used in the elimination of pain, among the&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods such as hot cold application, diverting attention, listening to&#xD;
      music, balloon blowing, reading books, watching movies, vibration, transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Divert attention; it is a non-drug method that is often used in the management of pain in&#xD;
      children. It removes the perception of pain by focusing the individual's attention away from&#xD;
      pain and in another focus. More work is needed to improve pain management in children and&#xD;
      illuminate optimal pain management and strategies that take into account children-specific&#xD;
      needs&#xD;

    <description>Flacc pain scale score is obtained by evaluating in five categories as facial expression, leg movements, activity, crying and consolingness. By giving 0, 1, or 2 points for each category, the total score between 0 and 10 is reached. As the pain intensity increases, the total score increases, as the pain intensity decreases, the total score decreases</description>
