      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NF1 is a genetic syndrome. Tumors appear early in life. Many people with NF1 develop PN.&#xD;
      These tumors can become an aggressive cancer called MPNST. People with MPNST may benefit from&#xD;
      treatment with a MEK inhibitor (MEKi). Researchers want to learn if there is an increased&#xD;
      risk of MPNST formation from MEKi treatment in people with NF1. To do this, they will review&#xD;
      data that has been collected in NIH NF1 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the characteristics of people who have taken part in NF1 studies at NIH and to&#xD;
      compare the risk of MPNST formation in those treated with MEKi or other PN-directed&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with NF1 who were seen at NIH from Jan. 1, 1998, to Jan. 1, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants medical records will be reviewed. Participants who opted out of future use of&#xD;
      their data will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, like sex, race, and date of birth, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about MEKi and non-MEKi treatments will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data, such as surgery and treatment details, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between all participants who were seen at NIH for any NF1 related study will&#xD;
      be compared. Participants will be put into 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of MEKi therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with tumor directed therapy other than MEKi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with both MEKi and non-MEKi tumor directed therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      No tumor directed medical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with NF1 who were treated for PN with either a MEKi treatment or a non-MEKi&#xD;
      treatment will also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 3 to 6 months.&#xD;

      Study Description: This is a retrospective review that includes all patients with NF1&#xD;
      enrolled on natural history and treatment trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) from&#xD;
      1/1/1998 to 1/1/2020, excluding patients referred for treatment of MPNST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of NF1 study participants&#xD;
      who come for evaluation at the NCI and to compare the risk of MPNST formation in patients&#xD;
      treated with MEK 1/2 inhibitor (MEKi) or other PN-directed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: All participants with NF1 seen at the NIH from 1/1/1998 to 1/1/2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities conducting research: This is a single site study initiated by&#xD;
      the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Data abstraction to completion of data analyses will take 3-6 months.&#xD;
