      This trial is part of the Horizon 2020 project, REPO-TRIAL, on in-silico, mechanism-based&#xD;
      drug repurposing in high unmet-medical-need indications. This project aims to identify&#xD;
      causal, rather than symptomatic disease mechanisms for highly precise and effective&#xD;
      interventions. Here a signalling module comprised of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation&#xD;
      and cyclic GMP signalling has been identified to be involved in post-stroke&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier disruption and neuronal death. It can be targeted by repurposing three&#xD;
      drugs, which inhibit overshooting nitric oxide (NO) and ROS formation, respectively, and&#xD;
      stimulate compromised neuroprotective cyclic GMP formation. It is possible that two of the&#xD;
      drugs (riociguat, perphenazine) may cause a drop and one drug an elevation of blood pressure&#xD;
      (propylthiouracil) leading to an overall drop in blood pressure. On top of that, the three&#xD;
      drugs may synergise on blood pressure in a previously not recognised manner. These potential&#xD;
      safety concerns, expressed in a scientific advice meeting by the Federal Institute for Drugs&#xD;
      and Medical Devices (BfArM), shall be tested in the present phase I safety trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening visit (SCR), a treatment period, and an EOT visit. In the&#xD;
      treatment period, after a baseline evaluation, single doses of all three substances will be&#xD;
      administered concurrently. Provocation manoeuvres (tilt table) will be performed with the&#xD;
      goal of generating maximum safety information on drug-induced blood pressure changes.&#xD;
      Concurrently, a 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded (Holter ECG) and blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn for exploratory biomarker analyses, quantification of riociguat, and optional&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analyses of perphenazine and propylthiouracil.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability in adulthood (WHO report). As of&#xD;
      2020, only one approved pharmacological treatment option, intravenous thrombolysis (rtPA), is&#xD;
      available. However, intravenous thrombolysis is used only for a fraction of stroke patients&#xD;
      given its strict inclusion criteria, broad exclusion criteria, and the risk of lethal&#xD;
      iatrogenic intracranial bleeding. While mechanical recanalization therapy has improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes, it is also limited by (i) relatively narrow time windows for effective&#xD;
      treatment, (ii) being available to patients with large vessel occlusions only, and (iii) by&#xD;
      requiring a dedicated infrastructure to treat these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these limitations there is a need for new approaches to stroke management. The ideal&#xD;
      intervention would (i) be directly neuroprotective, (ii) reduce the brain infarct volume,&#xD;
      (iii) improve functional neurological outcomes, (iv) increase survival, (v) be safe, i.e.&#xD;
      bear no risk to cause secondary bleeding, (vi) be broadly applicable, and (vii) logistically&#xD;
      compatible with recanalization. NO synthase, NOS1, is overactivated, NADPH oxidases, NOX4 and&#xD;
      NOX5 get induced and overactivated, NO and NOX-derived reactive non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug oxygens species (ROS) toxify each other; one target being sGC, which&#xD;
      is oxidatively damaged to no longer contain haeme and no longer respond to NO to form&#xD;
      neuroprotective cyclic GMP (cGMP). Consequently, inhibiting NOS1 and NOX4/5, and reactivating&#xD;
      haeme-free apo-sGC synergistically results in post-stroke blood-brain-barrier stabilisation&#xD;
      and neuroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOX4/5-NOS1-sGC signalling network is required for vascular endothelial maintenance and&#xD;
      dysregulated after an ischemic stroke. After an ischemic event, NOX4/5 and NOS enzymes are&#xD;
      over-activated and lead to an excessive release of ROS in vivo. Such ROS can damage multiple&#xD;
      cellular structures, including soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which no longer responds to&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO) to form neuroprotective cyclic GMP (cGMP). Consequently, pre-clinical&#xD;
      pharmacological inhibition of NOX4/5, NOS1, and restoration of sGC activity lead to reduced&#xD;
      infarct volumes in vivo, especially when administered in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three agents used in the described pre-clinical experiments, perphenazine,&#xD;
      propylthiouracil, and riociguat, are approved medicines used for non-stroke-related&#xD;
      indications. Perphenazine, a typical antipsychotic, and propylthiouracil, a thyroid&#xD;
      peroxidase inhibitor used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, have previously been&#xD;
      identified as off-target inhibitors of NOX4 and NOS, respectively. Riociguat, approved for&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension (CTEPH), is a first-in-class sGC stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the pre-clinical evidence for a signalling-network-based combination therapy consisting&#xD;
      of perphenazine, propylthiouracil, and riociguat, the investigators hypothesize that combined&#xD;
      use of these substances as an add-on treatment to the current standard of care will reduce&#xD;
      infarct volume and improve neurological function in patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
