      Clinical Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the tolerability and safety after transplantation of LSCD101 in patients with&#xD;
      intractable limbal stem cell deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who finally meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria results of the subject eligibility&#xD;
      evaluation will receive transplantation of the investigational product. Adverse drug reaction&#xD;
      will be confirmed during 24 weeks after transplantation.&#xD;

             which corneal neovascularization invades more than two quadrants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No improvement of indication by known treatment (non-surgical/surgical) method&#xD;
             according to investigator's judgment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects judged by the investigator to be inappropriate to participate in the clinical&#xD;
             study&#xD;
