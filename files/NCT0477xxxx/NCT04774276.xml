  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of life, linked to physical, social and mental performance in people with&#xD;
      coronary heart disease represents the primary goals in terms of rehabilitation. This is often&#xD;
      developed to meet the expected performance standard in order to give the person effective&#xD;
      autonomy. However, is the occupational balance always evaluated? and this management adapted?&#xD;
      Does occupational therapist, expert in autonomy and independence in multiple illnesses and&#xD;
      disabilities, has a major role to play in cardiac rehabilitation? This area of expertise and&#xD;
      the application of occupational therapy to coronary patients seems appropriate, if not&#xD;
      necessary. However, there are few scientific studies on the need to include occupational&#xD;
      therapy within cardiac rehabilitation protocols.&#xD;

      The occupational therapy goals are in line with the theoretical objectives of coronary&#xD;
      rehabilitation. At present, there is a lack of data on the benefits of coronary occupational&#xD;
      therapy rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals : Evaluation of the quality of life of coronary heart patients who have benefited from&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation optimized by secondary occupational therapy sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of aerobic and anaerobic performance of coronary heart patients who have benefited&#xD;
      from cardiac rehabilitation optimized by occupational therapy sessions.&#xD;
