  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      regorafenib plus programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in Chinese patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in routine clinical practice. The primary end point is overall survival.&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease&#xD;
      control rate and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively identify patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      who received at least one dose of PD-1 inhibitors plus regorafenib from 5/2019 to 2/2021 in&#xD;
      14 Chinese medical centers. Patients received the study treatment as part of routine medical&#xD;
      care based on the consensus of clinicians and patients. In addition to the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, other patient and treatment characteristics including baseline&#xD;
      microsatellite instability status, metastatic sites, previous treatment regimens,&#xD;
      post-treatment regimens, are collected in order to describe the real-world treatment&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
