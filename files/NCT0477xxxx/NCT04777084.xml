      This study is a prospective, single-arm phase II clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of IBI318 combined with lenvatinib in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer who failed first-line PD-1/PD-L1 And safety research. After being screened to&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria, they will receive IBI318 combined with lenvatinib until the&#xD;
      disease progresses, death, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, new&#xD;
      anti-tumor therapy is started, or the treatment is terminated for other reasons specified in&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-arm phase II clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of IBI318 combined with lenvatinib in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer who failed first-line PD-1/PD-L1 And safety research. After screening and meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria, they will receive IBI318 combined with lenvatinib until the disease&#xD;
      progresses, death, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, new anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapy is started, or the treatment is terminated for other reasons specified in the plan.&#xD;
      During the treatment, RECIST v1.1 was used for clinical tumor imaging evaluation, once every&#xD;
      6 weeks; after 24 weeks of medication, evaluation can be done every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receiving IBI318 combined with lenvatinib have the first evidence of imaging PD&#xD;
      according to RECIST v1.1. If the subject is clinically stable, there is no evidence of rapid&#xD;
      imaging progress, and the investigator assesses that it can continue from the study If the&#xD;
      patient is benefited from the drug, the subject can continue the current study treatment, and&#xD;
      the imaging evaluation must be repeated at least 8 weeks (± 7 days) later for confirmation.&#xD;
      If PD is confirmed by re-assessment, the subject should stop the study treatment; if PD is&#xD;
      not confirmed, the study treatment will continue, and the assessment will be carried out at&#xD;
      the time point of the imaging examination plan specified in the plan until the PD is&#xD;
      confirmed by imaging.&#xD;
