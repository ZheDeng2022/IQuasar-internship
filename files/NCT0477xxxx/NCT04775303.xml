      A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cyclosporine 0.1% (Ikervis®) for&#xD;
      moderate to severe dry eye patients who changed to Cyclosporine 0.1% eye drop(Ikervis®) due&#xD;
      to lack of treatment effects of the previous Cyclosporine 0.05% eye drop.&#xD;

      Eligible patients who agree to participate in the clinical trial in writing will be&#xD;
      administered Cyclosporine 0.1% eye drop(Ikervis®) one drop once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy&#xD;
      and safety will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The cornea staining score(NEI scale) is a grading scale for the corneal surface after fluorescein staining to help measure the efficacy of dry eye treatment. A standardized grading system of 0 to 3 is used for each of the five areas on each cornea. Grade 0 is specified when no staining is present, and the maximum score is 15.</description>
