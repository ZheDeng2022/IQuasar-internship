  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EPYGON VALVE is an innovative mitral valve, intended for valve replacement of a native&#xD;
      mitral valve through a minimally invasive implant procedure by means of a dedicated implant&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EPYGON VALVE is a bio prosthesis, composed by a functional assembly of bovine pericardium&#xD;
      on a NiTinol stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and feasibility of the Epygon™&#xD;
      Transcatheter mitral valve and the transapical delivery system, in adult patients with&#xD;
      severe, symptomatic mitral regurgitation.&#xD;
