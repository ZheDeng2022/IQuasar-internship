  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an intervention approach for non-student emerging&#xD;
      adults that attempts to reduce alcohol use by decreasing stress and increasing engagement in&#xD;
      positive and goal-directed activities that provide meaningful alternatives to alcohol use.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brief alcohol interventions (BAI) are among the most cost-effective preventive care measures&#xD;
      available and the evaluation of these interventions with high-risk and difficult-to-reach&#xD;
      populations is an NIAAA priority. Although emerging adults (EAs) who attend college often&#xD;
      have access to brief alcohol interventions (BAIs), there is a critical need to enhance both&#xD;
      the efficacy and potential for dissemination of these approaches with high-risk non-student&#xD;
      EAs. EAs who are not 4-year college students or graduates report higher levels of&#xD;
      alcohol-related problems, greater levels of comorbid drug use and mental health symptoms, and&#xD;
      higher risk for chronic alcohol use disorder compared to college graduates. Most BAIs include&#xD;
      a single session focused explicitly on discussing risks associated with drinking and&#xD;
      correcting normative beliefs about drinking rates without addressing the reasons why EAs may&#xD;
      drink, including stress and limited behavioral alternatives to drinking. Because many EAs who&#xD;
      do not graduate from college are socially and economically marginalized, an approach that&#xD;
      encourages them to drink less without providing the tools to reduce stress and develop mood&#xD;
      enhancing behavioral substitutes to drinking or drug use is unlikely to be successful. The&#xD;
      Substance-Free Activity Session (SFAS) attempts to increase engagement goal-directed&#xD;
      activities that might provide alternatives to alcohol use and also includes strategies for&#xD;
      coping with stress/depression. The two-session (plus booster) BAI+SFAS approach has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy for reducing both alcohol use/problems and depressive symptoms in two&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials with college EAs and may be a more promising approach than&#xD;
      single-session BAIs for higher-risk non-student EAs. Two critical next steps are to: 1)&#xD;
      evaluate the BAI+SFAS with non-student EAs, and 2) determine if a two-session Relaxation&#xD;
      Training (RT) +SFAS approach, which would enhance wellness and address two synergistic risk&#xD;
      factors for alcohol misuse, demonstrates similar efficacy as the BAI+SFAS intervention. If&#xD;
      so, this wellness-based approach may have greater potential for dissemination than approaches&#xD;
      that include a BAI because the session content may be more appealing to EAs (managing stress&#xD;
      and increasing positive activities). Thus, the primary goal of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      establish the efficacy of these novel BAI approaches with high-risk community dwelling EAs,&#xD;
      and a secondary goal is to identify factors that may increase potential for dissemination. We&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized 3-group (BAI+SFAS vs. RT+SFAS vs. education control) trial with 525&#xD;
      EAs (175 per group; estimated 50% women &amp; 50% African American) who report recent heavy&#xD;
      drinking and who are not students or graduates of 4-year colleges. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Alcohol Consumption and Drug Use at 1-month</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>At each assessment point, participants will complete a computer administered Timeline Followback (TLFB) concerning their daily drinking during the past month, an interval found sufficiently long to characterize drinking patterns. Using a calendar that covers the 30-day recall interval, participants record how many standard drinks of beer, wine, or liquor they consumed each day. Frequencies of heavy drinking (5+ drinks for men, 4+ for women), high intensity drinking (10+ drinks for men, 8+ for women), days and quantities consumed per drinking day will be calculated for analysis. We will also obtain drug user reports using the TLFB and examine past-month illicit drug days as a secondary outcome measure. The TLFB is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for obtaining reliable and accurate reports of alcohol consumption using a variety of assessment modalities (e.g., interview, online, phone) and is accepted by the FDA for use as an efficacy endpoint in clinical trials.</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment, 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants report past month frequency and rate the enjoyment of 36 activities that are substance free vs. substance involved. Frequency and enjoyment ratings are multiplied to obtain a cross product that reflects reinforcement derived from the activity, and the relative reinforcement value of alcohol (R-ratio) is computed for analysis [(alcohol-related total / (alcohol-free total + alcohol-related total)]. Participants also report the number of hours spent engaging in several activity categories during a typical week in the past month (work, exercise, drinking, recreation). This information is used to generate the initial SFAS feedback on time allocation and potential alternatives to drinking and, at follow-up, will evaluate whether the interventions resulted in increased participation in substance-free activities, increased substance-free reinforcement, and decreased proportionate substance-related reinforcement relative to the control condition (R-ratio).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Alcohol Purchase Task responses at 1-month</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire asks participants to report how many standard drinks they would consume across 20 prices ($0 to $20) in an imaginary drinking setting, which yields multiple observed and derived indices reflecting sensitivity to price changes that correspond with actual alcohol use. Elasticity of demand and intensity (consumption at $0) will be used for analysis. Relative insensitivity to price changes (&quot;inelastic&quot; demand) is related to risky drinking and alcohol problems, and intensity has incremental utility to predict alcohol use disorder symptoms beyond drinking practices. Consistent with previous research, alcohol demand will be evaluated as a mediator of treatment outcomes.</description>

    <description>The DASS is a reliable and valid self-report survey designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS scales contains seven items and participants are asked to use 4-point scales to rate the extent to which they have experienced each emotional state over the past week; scores for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores. Previous research indicates that the BAI+SFAS is associated with decreases in DASS scores, and we will evaluate DASS total scores as a secondary outcome and mediator of treatment effects.</description>

The session will conclude with a brief discussion of additional stress and anxiety management strategies (e.g., apps to monitor heartrate and breathing).

    <ipd_description>This study will submit and share data with NIAAA Data Archive (NIAAADA), a data repository housed within the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). We also plan to release the data to qualified researchers who wish to collaborate with the study investigators. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>In this clinical trial, clinical assessments to establish baseline subject characteristics and eligibility criteria will be collected from all research participants at the screening and randomization visits, prior to the completion of the behavioral intervention. Assessment to measure changes in drinking and other dependent variables will take place a 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention.</ipd_time_frame>
