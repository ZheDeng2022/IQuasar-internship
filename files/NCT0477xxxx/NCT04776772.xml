  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research was to carry out an experimental study, triple blind, on&#xD;
      the possible immunophysiological effects of a nutritional supplement (Synbiotic, Gasteel&#xD;
      Plus®, Heel España S.A.U.), containing a mixture of probiotic strains, such as&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium lactis CBP-001010, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-4036, Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      longum ES1, as well as prebi-otic fructooligosaccharides, in both professional athletes and&#xD;
      sedentary people. The effects on some inflammatory/immune (IL-1β, IL-10, and immunoglobulin&#xD;
      A) and stress (epinephrine, nore-pinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, CRH, ACTH, and cortisol)&#xD;
      biomarkers were evaluated, determined by flow cytometer and ELISA. The effects on metabolic&#xD;
      profile and physical activity, as well as on various parameters that could affect physical&#xD;
      and mental health, were also evaluated via the use of accelerometry and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation was a triple blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study designed&#xD;
      to identify the possible differing effects of the synbiotic Gasteel Plus® supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were professional soccer players of the Second Division B of the Spanish&#xD;
      League and sedentary students of the same sex and age range. Both study groups were randomly&#xD;
      divided into two groups: a control group administered with placebo, and an experimental group&#xD;
      administered with the synbiotic. Each participant was evaluated at baseline, as well as after&#xD;
      the intervention which lasted one month. Only in the athletes group did the synbiotic&#xD;
      intervention clearly improve objective physical activ-ity and sleep quality, as well as&#xD;
      perceived general health, stress, and anxiety levels.&#xD;
