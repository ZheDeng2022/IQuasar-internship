      Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a video-assisted&#xD;
      discharge education program on activities of daily living, functionality, and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction after total hip replacement (THR) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study included 31 participants who were randomly divided in the physiotherapy&#xD;
      (PT) group (n=18), and the video-assisted discharge education (VADE) group (n=13). Both&#xD;
      groups received a physiotherapy program. VADE group was additionally received VADE program.&#xD;
      In both groups, all education programs were given face to face. Data were collecting using&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score (HHS), Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily&#xD;
      Living Scale (NEADL), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) and Patient Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire at 1st week and 3rd month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice Implications: The current study has contributed to the development of video-assisted&#xD;
      health technologies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a common surgical procedure performed in patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to long-term conservative treatment to reduce high pain sensation and movement&#xD;
      limitation in the joint (Li and Xu, 2018). Physiotherapy and rehabilitation routinely applied&#xD;
      to regain functional independence in daily living, restore pain and joint range of motion,&#xD;
      eliminate muscle weakness, regulate walking pattern, prevent falls, loosening, revision&#xD;
      surgery and dislocations in the prosthesis, increase participation in activities of daily&#xD;
      living (ADL), quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction levels after THR (Louw et al.,&#xD;
      2013; Galea et al., 2008). It was determined in Kennedy et al. (2017) that patients have&#xD;
      education expectations on recognition of the surgical team, general information about the&#xD;
      disease and prosthesis, rehabilitation, pain management, home care activities, complications,&#xD;
      medications, ADL after THR surgery. At the present time, with the help of demographic changes&#xD;
      in the society and patients, changes in healthcare provision, and technological approaches,&#xD;
      discharge education became more effective with video assistance (Abu Abed et al., 2014). The&#xD;
      aim of our study was to investigate the effect of a video-assisted discharge education&#xD;
      program on activities of daily living, functionality, and patient satisfaction after total&#xD;
      hip replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the Non-invasive Clinical Researches Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (60116787-020/58408) on 04.09.2018. The participants included in the study were informed&#xD;
      about the study and informed consent form was signed by all participants. Our study was&#xD;
      performed between September 2018 and June 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 36 participants who met the inclusion criteria, 5 were excluded from the study for&#xD;
      missing follow-ups or not wanting to participate in the study. The 31 participants included&#xD;
      in the study were randomized using systematic sampling. According to last number of file&#xD;
      numbers odd numbers included in the physiotherapy (PT) group (n=18), and even numbers&#xD;
      included in the video-assisted discharge education (VADE) group (n=13). The first meeting&#xD;
      with participants was made in the hospital room within the first 5 days after THR surgery in&#xD;
      both groups. Participants and their relatives were given physiotherapy and video-assisted&#xD;
      discharge education by the same physiotherapist without being told which group they were in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapy program given to the PT group included breathing exercises, positioning,&#xD;
      hip range of motion and strengthening exercises, and information about walking and&#xD;
      ambulation. The whole program was taught verbally and practically to participants and their&#xD;
      relatives. Information was given about the exercises to be added at the end of the first week&#xD;
      and in the 4th week. A physiotherapy booklet prepared with the same content was given to the&#xD;
      participants. The booklet was examined by the patient and relatives, and the questions they&#xD;
      asked were answered by the same physiotherapist. The participants were informed that they&#xD;
      should continue the exercises for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VADE group received video-assisted discharge education in addition to the physiotherapy&#xD;
      program given to the PT group on the same day by the same physiotherapist. The VADE program&#xD;
      included information about THR, preventive rehabilitation approaches, transfer activities,&#xD;
      using stairs, self-care activities, home settings by modifying the treatment and discharge&#xD;
      protocols of Lucas (2008). VADE was prepared as a presentation of written information and&#xD;
      videos which is shown this information by a professional model. Video shoots were done by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist experienced in the field of physiotherapy and rehabilitation after THR&#xD;
      surgery. The presentation was stopped when participants have questions or have points were&#xD;
      not understood and the necessary explanations were shown verbally and practically. Along with&#xD;
      the physiotherapy booklet, the participants were given an educational booklet containing&#xD;
      written and visual information prepared in the same content as VADE. The booklet was examined&#xD;
      by the patient and relatives during VADE, and the questions they asked were answered by the&#xD;
      same physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interviews were completed in approximately 30 minutes in the PT group and&#xD;
      approximately 45 minutes in the VADE group. A healthy person was used to prevent damage to&#xD;
      the hip joints of those who had undergone surgery in photographs and videos in the VADE and&#xD;
      booklets. In the booklets, easily understandable sentences were used by participants and&#xD;
      their relatives. Booklets were prepared in Arial font and 11-point size. All participants&#xD;
      were called by phone every 15 days for 12 weeks, and their participation in the exercises and&#xD;
      ADL was followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments were performed within the first 5 days after the THR surgery (Descriptive&#xD;
      Information, Pain, Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire) in the hospital room after&#xD;
      physiotherapy and VADE programs, and at the 3rd-month control (Pain, Harris Hip Score (HHS),&#xD;
      Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale&#xD;
      (NEADL), Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire) in orthopedics and traumatology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the statistical analysis of data obtained in this study, Windows-based SPSS (IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics, Version 24.0, Armonk, NY, USA) package program was used. It was calculated that&#xD;
      the number of patients included in our study was 89% power and 95% confidence for each group.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were expressed as a mean Â± standard deviation or as a median&#xD;
      (minimum-maximum values), and categorical variables as a number and percent. Analytical&#xD;
      (Kolmogorov-Smirnov/Shapiro-Wilks test) and visual (Histogram and probability graphs) methods&#xD;
      were used to test the conformity of data for normal distribution. When the parametric test&#xD;
      assumptions were provided, Independent Sample T-Test was used to compare independent group&#xD;
      differences; when the parametric test assumptions were not provided, Mann Whitney-U test was&#xD;
      used to compare independent group differences. In the dependent group analyzes; when the&#xD;
      parametric test assumptions were provided, Paired Sample T-Test was used; when the parametric&#xD;
      test assumptions were not provided, Wilcoxon Test was used. Chi-Square Analysis and Fisher&#xD;
      Exact Test were used compare differences between categorical variables&#xD;
