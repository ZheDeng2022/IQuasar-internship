  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the acceptability and feasibility of an advance care planning (ACP)&#xD;
      intervention which has been developed to be used with the health care proxies of residential&#xD;
      aged care facility (RACF) residents who no longer have decision making capacity for medical&#xD;
      decisions. The intervention involves two discussions that are facilitated by a trained health&#xD;
      professional. The first discussion aims to discuss the resident's life story, values,&#xD;
      previous medical treatments and experiences with illness and death and whether or not they&#xD;
      have previously documented their wishes for future care. The second discussion also involves&#xD;
      the treating physician and aims to document anticipatory decisions for emergency situations.&#xD;
      Follow-up discussions after 12 months or any change in situation will be conducted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-centered care involves treating patients in the way that is the most aligned with&#xD;
      their values and their self-determination. This is the aim of Advance Care Planning (ACP), a&#xD;
      communication-based complex intervention. ACP involves accompanied reflection about one's&#xD;
      values, anticipation of potential health problems in future states of impaired&#xD;
      decision-making capacity, consideration of a range of treatment and care options,&#xD;
      anticipatory decision making and the documentation and communication of these decisions to&#xD;
      family members and health care professionals. This process ensures that a person's&#xD;
      self-determination is respected even when she is no longer able to make health care&#xD;
      decisions. ACP programs are well established in the English-speaking world and are currently&#xD;
      being developed across Asia and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in ACP requires decision-making capacity. Yet, many people lose this capacity&#xD;
      before having formally expressed their care preferences. In these cases, their health care&#xD;
      proxies, families and health professionals are called upon to make decisions on their behalf,&#xD;
      based on what they believe the person would have wanted (presumed will). This is problematic&#xD;
      and distressing for both family members and health professionals. The fact that many people&#xD;
      do not participate in ACP or complete advanced directives, along with an increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of neuro-degenerative diseases entailing a loss of decision-making capacity, means&#xD;
      that growing numbers of people are likely to require others to make medical decisions on&#xD;
      their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's exploratory research, confirmed by the literature, highlights an urgent&#xD;
      unmet need for comprehensive and systematic interventions to assist in promoting&#xD;
      self-determination of older people who lack decision making capacity. ACP by proxy (ACP-bp)&#xD;
      has been suggested as a model to help proxies of incapacitated patients plan ahead and&#xD;
      prepare for future care decisions. However, this model has never been specifically developed&#xD;
      nor tested. This is why the investigators have developed a specific model of ACP-bp and aim&#xD;
      to test it in a pilot study among proxies of residential aged care facility (RACF) residents&#xD;
      who lack decision making capacity, primarily due to advanced dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention and the&#xD;
      appropriateness of outcome measures through a pilot study in two RACFs in the Swiss canton of&#xD;
      Vaud over a period of one year. A process evaluation will be conducted through the&#xD;
      triangulation of mixed-method data: self-report scales, semi-structured interviews, document&#xD;
      analyses, resident health care records and an economic cost analysis. This will form the&#xD;
      basis for a subsequent cluster-randomized control trial to test the intervention's&#xD;
      effectiveness. This novel approach of ACP-bp has potential to promote self-determination and&#xD;
      patient-centered care that improves both the ethical appropriateness and economic&#xD;
      sustainability of care. It may lead to patients being treated in accordance with their&#xD;
      wishes, reduce unnecessary overtreatment and avoid distress for family members and health&#xD;
      care professionals. This approach also responds to calls for models of ACP which can be used&#xD;
      in people with dementia and people living in RACFs, vulnerable populations that have&#xD;
      generally remained invisible in ACP research so far.&#xD;
