  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal surgery represents the most frequent activity in the surgical block. Advances in&#xD;
      surgical techniques and improvements in postoperative care imply the need for greater control&#xD;
      of the surgical outcomes obtained and the comparison of results between services with the&#xD;
      same characteristics with the help of assessment scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational study will be carried out during 2021. All patients undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery will be included. Demographic variables, personal and surgical history,&#xD;
      preoperative and intraoperative data, and variables related to surgery will be collected. At&#xD;
      30 days postoperatively, the clinical history of the patients will be reviewed and&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be collected as well as the mortality that occurred. With&#xD;
      these data, the POSSUM, the P-POSSUM and the Charlson comorbidity index will be calculated.&#xD;

      Abdominal surgery represents the most frequent activity in the surgical block. Advances in&#xD;

      of the surgical outcomes obtained and the comparison of results between services with the&#xD;
      same characteristics with the help of assessment scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational study will be carried out during 2021. All patients undergoing&#xD;
      abdominal surgery will be included. Demographic variables, personal and surgical history,&#xD;
      preoperative and intraoperative data, and variables related to surgery will be collected. At&#xD;
      30 days postoperatively, the clinical history of the patients will be reviewed and&#xD;
      postoperative complications will be collected as well as the mortality that occurred. With&#xD;
      these data, the POSSUM, the P-POSSUM and the Charlson comorbidity index will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this data are collected, the following objectives will be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate the POSSUM and P-POSSUM systems in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
           in our hospital, comparing the estimated morbidity and mortality with that observed 30&#xD;
           days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the correlation of estimated morbidity and mortality of the POSSUM and P-POSSUM&#xD;
           with respect to that observed in scheduled surgery vs. emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the correlation of estimated morbidity and mortality of POSSUM and P-POSSUM with&#xD;
           respect to that observed in laparoscopic surgery vs. laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the relationship and predictive ability of CHF with respect to morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality at 30&#xD;

&#xD;
        At 30 days postoperatively, the clinical records of the patients will be reviewed in order&#xD;
        to establish the incidence of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
