  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Individual Patient Expanded Access IND has been created as requested by an 83-year-old&#xD;
      man who suffers Parkinson's disease and for which the drugs currently approved are not&#xD;
      providing an improvement over the progression of this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND with the primary goal of treatment for an&#xD;
      individual with Parkinson's Disease. There are no FDA approved, fully restorative treatments&#xD;
      for Parkinson's Disease. The subject will receive a total of twelve autologous HB-adMSCs&#xD;
      infusion of 200 million cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the efficacy of HB- adMSCs by improving activities of daily living in a&#xD;
      subject with Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of HB- adMSCs by improving quality-of-life in a subject with&#xD;
           Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the safety of multiple administrations of HB-adMSCs in a subject with&#xD;
           Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3. Statistical Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events as measured by CBC, CMP, coagulation panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein and Sedimentation rate will be measured to evaluate the ability of&#xD;
           HBadMSCs to alter Parkinson's Disease related inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in brain and dopamine availability reflected in PET Scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in motor function as measured by the UPDRS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in motor function as documented in video records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in function abilities as measured by the Schwab and England Activities of Daily&#xD;
           Living score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in quality-of-life scores as measured by the subject evaluations in the &quot;Social&#xD;
           Roles and Activities&quot; surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Measurement Tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UPDRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuro-QOL Scale v1.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Writing Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living score.&#xD;
