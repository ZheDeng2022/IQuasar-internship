  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, low-level, non-commercial intervention, comparative clinical trial (phase IV) of&#xD;
      balanced, randomized groups, to compare the analgesic efficacy of the local anesthetics&#xD;
      Ropivacaine and Levobupivacaine in peripheral nerve block in hip fracture surgery in the&#xD;
      elderly .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several studies that try to identify the ideal anesthetic for the management and&#xD;
      control of pain in hip fracture surgery in the elderly. The optimum would be to use an&#xD;
      anesthetic with the lowest possible latency, since this will favor the start of surgery. And,&#xD;
      at the same time, with a more lasting analgesia with the least motor impairment. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is essential to collect data on efficacy (effective block that allows us to mobilize the&#xD;
      patient), latency, and analgesic scales appropriate to the cognitive state of the study&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;

    <measure>To compare the analgesic efficacy of both local anesthetics in the regional block of hip fracture surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration of treatment for each patient will be considered until the evaluation of the analgesic scale corresponding to 48 hours after the procedure is performed.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of study efficacy will be the difference in the duration of the block.&#xD;
To compare the analgesic efficacy, we will use 3 assessment scales: Numerical Visual Scale (EVN), Algoplus Scale (ALGSC), and Paint Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To describe the behavior of this combined technique in hip fractures, establishing the latency of initiation.</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration of treatment for each patient will be considered until the evaluation of the analgesic scale corresponding to 48 hours after the procedure is performed.</time_frame>
    <description>Latency: evaluated by analgesic scales up to 10 minutes. Analgesic scales: EVN, Algoplus and PAINAD at rest and in activity. They will be carried out on arrival of the patient to the operating room, continuous until 10 minutes after the nerve block, in the sitting position to perform the subarachnoid block, upon discharge from the PACU, and at 6, 12, 24 h after the procedure blocking, and end of effect after blocking.&#xD;
Need and rescue drugs: rescue analgesia will be prescribed for the hospital ward, in case it is necessary. The need, drug and time of administration will be collected regarding the execution of the blockade.</description>

    <description>We will use 3 assessment scales:&#xD;
