  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral ankle ligament stabilization procedures are well described in the orthopaedic&#xD;
      literature. Although success rates are high, the incidence of recurrent instability is well&#xD;
      documented. In addition, with standard rehabilitation protocols, the timeline to return to&#xD;
      sport and functional activities may be prolonged. The InternalBrace Ligament Augmentation&#xD;
      Repair is a safe and reproducible technique using FiberTape® and BioComposite SwiveLock® as&#xD;
      an augmentation to a Brostrom procedure. The InternalBrace Ligament Augmentation repair&#xD;
      consists of a FiberTape bridge between two Knotless Swivelock anchors providing a protective&#xD;
      reinforcement and allows the surgeon to repair lateral or medial ankle instability and the&#xD;
      pain associated with it. This type of repair can be utilized in acute and chronic ankle&#xD;
      sprains.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that use of InternalBrace Ligament Augmentation in addition to standard&#xD;
      anatomic modified Brostrum repair allows for earlier return to pre-injury level compared to a&#xD;
      standard Brostrum procedure. It is also secondarily hypothesized that intermediate and long&#xD;
      term incidence of recurrent instability will be lower with use of internal brace augmentation&#xD;
      of standard modified Brostrum lateral ankle ligament reconstruction.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; (0) and &quot;worst pain (10).</description>

    <measure>Veterans Rand (VR-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VR-12 is a patient-reported instrument from which physical and mental health component summary scores (Physical Component Score and Mental Component Score) are derived. The VR-12 items assess physical functioning, role limitations due to physical or mental health problems, pain, energy, mental health, social functioning, and general health. The United States population average PCS and MCS are both 50 points. The United States population standard deviation is 10 points. Therefore, each increment of 10 points above or below 50 corresponds to one standard deviation away from the population average. Change from pre-op and post-operative data collection timepoints will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FAAM is a self-report measure that assesses physical function of individuals with lower leg, foot, and ankle musculoskeletal disorders. The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure is a 29-item questionnaire divided into two subscales: the 21-item Activities of Daily Living Subscale and the 8-item Sports Subscale. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (4 to 0) from 'no difficulty at all' to 'unable to do'. Item score totals, which range from 0 to 84 for the ADL subscale and 0 to 32 for the Sports subscale, were transformed to percentage scores. Higher scores represent higher levels of function for each subscale, with 100% representing no dysfunction. Change from pre-op and post-operative data collection timepoints will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Karlsson and Peterson Scoring System</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>TheKarlsson and Peterson Scoring System is a self-report that assesses ankle function. It is composed of 8 questions with a low score of 0 (low function) and a high score of 100 (high function). Change from pre-op and post-operative data collection timepoints will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Tegner Activity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 26 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale is a one-item score that grades activity based on work and sports activities on a scale of 0 to 10. Zero represents disability because of knee problems and 10 represents national or international level soccer. Change from pre-op and post-operative data collection timepoints will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Range Of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected at the following time points: Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion of joints is measured using an instrument called a goniometer. Range of Motion will be measured using a goniometer during passive motion in a seated position. All measurements are from a neutral position. Normal values for the ankle are 0-50 degrees for plantar flexion and 0-20 degrees for dorsiflexion. For the foot, normal values are 0--35 degrees for inversion and 0-25 degrees for eversion. Change from pre-op and post-operative data collection timepoints will be assessed.</description>
