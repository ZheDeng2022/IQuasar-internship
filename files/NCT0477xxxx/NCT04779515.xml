  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum on post&#xD;
      operative pain and inflammation in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      by comparing it to standard practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent from eligible study participants. patients were randomized&#xD;
      into one of two masked groups, labelled red and green. The red-label group was operated at&#xD;
      standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum, while the green-label group was operated at low-pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum. Baseline blood samples were obtained pre-operatively for ten inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, patients' demographics and intra-operative details collected, then post-operative&#xD;
      pain and change in inflammatory markers were followed.&#xD;

    <masking_description>none of the participants knew at which pressure they will be operated on, nor the physicians who followed participants at floor or those analyzing blood samples, not the assigned physician to collect data, nor the personnel doing the analysis.&#xD;
only the operating surgeon and circulating nurse were aware of the meaning of the participant assigned label at time of operation. The masking was revealed post completion of analysis.</masking_description>
