  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational real world study with prospective follow up that will&#xD;
      evaluate the treatment approach in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who undergo ASCT in&#xD;
      Argentina.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gather real world evidence of the proportion and&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with relapsed refractory cHL who undergo ASCT, who receive&#xD;
      consolidation with BV, and to study the factors that determine BV consolidation after ASCT in&#xD;
      real world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the treatment approach in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who&#xD;
      undergo ASCT. All consecutive adult patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who undergo ASCT,&#xD;
      regardless of the prior indication to receive or not BV consolidation therapy, will be&#xD;
      included in this study and prospectively followed according to local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated and monitored by their physicians according to local clinical&#xD;
      practice and guided by the local approved label for patients receiving BV consolidation.&#xD;
      Usual follow-up will be determined by the treating physicians' standards of care, and no&#xD;
      scheduled patient visits are required for the conduct of this study. There are no visits or&#xD;
      specific procedures planned by protocol, however, baseline and follow up data will be&#xD;
      gathered every time the patient's response to treatment is assessed or has a medically&#xD;
      important event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that undergo ASCT will be included in final analysis of the primary objectives&#xD;
      (Full study population). Patients that receive BV consolidation or not (Non-BV consolidation)&#xD;
      will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study are expected to be recruited during 24 months and followed up&#xD;
      to progression, death, lost to follow or end of study (12 months after the inclusion of the&#xD;
      last patient), whatever occurs earlier.&#xD;
