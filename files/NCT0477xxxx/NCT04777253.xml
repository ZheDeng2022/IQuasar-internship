    <textblock>
      The research will make it possible to assess effects of rehabilitation of arm function with&#xD;
      the use of biofeedback method and conventional therapies administered to patients at a&#xD;
      chronic stage of recovery post-stroke, as part of the treatment in a health-resort setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      : In accordance with the study design, the group will comprise 100 patients with hemiparesis&#xD;
      after stroke, participating in a health-resort based rehabilitation program during their stay&#xD;
      in the Health-Resort Rehabilitation Hospital in Iwonicz Zdrój, Poland. The minimum size of&#xD;
      the sample was calculated based on the total annual number of patients after stroke receiving&#xD;
      treatment in the Health-Resort Rehabilitation Hospital in Iwonicz Zdrój, i.e. approximately&#xD;
      200 patients, 100% of these being in a chronic stage of recovery. It was assumed that 50% of&#xD;
      the patients would present stage 4-5 arm paresis according Brunnström scale. A fraction of&#xD;
      0.8 and a maximum error of 5% were applied and the sample size of 71 patients was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the study group (50 patients), participating in a conventional rehabilitation program&#xD;
           supplemented with additional biofeedback training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the control group (50 patients), participating in the conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
           program only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in both groups will participate in a three-week rehabilitation program (from&#xD;
      Monday to Friday), with the treatments and therapies continued for up to two hours per day.&#xD;
      The program will include: group and individual exercise (active and assisted exercises,&#xD;
      manipulation exercises, PNF-based practice, balance and breathing exercises), manual massage,&#xD;
      physical treatments, such as: laser, whirlpool therapy, mud compress therapy, carbonic acid&#xD;
      therapy, TENS therapy, BIO-V lamp, and localized cryotherapy. The patients in the study group&#xD;
      will also receive biofeedback training aimed to improve motor function of the upper limb. The&#xD;
      exercise will be performed using equipment manufactured by Biometrics. The device makes it&#xD;
      possible to perform movements in all the planes of the joints in the upper limb. During the&#xD;
      exercise, a visualisation of the movements is shown to the patient on the screen; this&#xD;
      biofeedback makes it possible for them to regulate and increase the range of movement, to use&#xD;
      greater muscle strength and to visually assess the accuracy of their performance. The&#xD;
      training with the biofeedback function will be carried out for 30 minutes per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the program is completed, the subjects from the control group will have an opportunity&#xD;
      to also practice with the Biometrics device with the biofeedback function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations will be carried out three times: the baseline at the start of the rehabilitation&#xD;
      program, a check-up at the end of the three-week program, and a follow-up two months after&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital. The tests will be performed at the same time of day, and&#xD;
      following the same conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' condition and the rehabilitation effects will be assessed using the following&#xD;
      measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hand grip strength and pinching strength of the fingers, to be tested with a dynamometer&#xD;
           and pinch meter, respectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ranges of motion in the joints of the upper limb, with R500 goniometer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  manual skills, with Box and Blocks test;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  handgrip function, according Franchay scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  motor capacities of the upper limb, according to Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMG test, with the Biometrics device;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  activities of daily living, with Barthel Index.&#xD;

    <description>Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Scale for Upper Extremity is a comprehensive tool enabling measurement of motor function; it comprises 33 motor tasks, designed to assess general movements, precision movements, grip, coordination and speed. It is also possible to perform H subgroup tests - assessing superficial and deep sensibility, and J subgroup tests - for range of passive motion and pain induced by such movements.&#xD;
Individual tasks are assessed on a scale 0-2 0 - impossible task&#xD;
