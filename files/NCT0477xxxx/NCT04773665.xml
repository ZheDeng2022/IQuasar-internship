  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VBI-2902a and VBI-2905a are investigational vaccine candidates that use enveloped virus-like&#xD;
      particle (eVLP) expression of a modified version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and&#xD;
      are designed to induce neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. VBI-2902a expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate&#xD;
      (the first virus variant isolated in 2019 in Wuhan, China), while VBI-2905a expresses the&#xD;
      spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variant Beta (B.1.351 variant, first isolated in 2020 in South&#xD;
      Africa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1a portion of this study tests one- and two-dose regimens of VBI- 2902a with 5 μg S&#xD;
      protein content and aluminum phosphate (alum) adjuvant or placebo delivered by intramuscular&#xD;
      (IM) injection. The Phase 1b portion of the study tests a one-dose regimen of VBI-2905a with&#xD;
      5 μg S protein content and alum adjuvant or placebo delivered by IM injection in participants&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with an authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and a two-dose open-label&#xD;
      regimen of VBI-2905a with 5 μg S protein content and alum adjuvant delivered by IM injection&#xD;
      in participants not previously vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines.&#xD;

      Phase 1a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg&#xD;
      of S protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults of 18-54 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg of S&#xD;
      protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults 18-54 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G1 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Day&#xD;
           1 and placebo at Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G2 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Days&#xD;
           1 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G3 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review blinded safety data&#xD;
      (reactogenicity, adverse events (AEs) and safety laboratory assessments) at Day 7 after the&#xD;
      first vaccination. The second vaccination will only be given if the DSMB confirms that Day 7&#xD;
      safety is acceptable and that stopping rules were not met. The DSMB will further review&#xD;
      blinded post-vaccination safety through Day 35, 7 days after the second vaccination and&#xD;
      through Day 56, 28 days after the second vaccination. The study will be unblinded following&#xD;
      DSMB review of safety data collected through Day 56. Study participants will continue with&#xD;
      study visits as planned up to 12 months of follow up after the first dose of study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a one-dose regimen of&#xD;
      VBI-2905a at a 5 μg dose level of S protein in healthy adults (age 18-54 years) who had been&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with mRNA vaccines or a two-dose regimen of VBI-2905a at a 5 μg dose&#xD;
      level of S protein in previously unvaccinated healthy adults (age 18-54 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of a one-dose regimen of VBI-2905a&#xD;
      at a 5 μg dose level of S protein in healthy adults (age 18-54 years) who had been previously&#xD;
      vaccinated with mRNA vaccines or a two-dose regimen of VBI-2905a at a 5 μg dose level of S&#xD;
      protein in previously unvaccinated healthy adults (age 18-54 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 81 healthy adults, age 18-54 years, with no history of clinical or laboratory&#xD;
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV- 2 infection or COVID-19 illness, will be enrolled in the Phase 1b part&#xD;
      of the study. Of these, 54 participants who had been previously vaccinated with an authorized&#xD;
      mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, including the second dose administered at least 4 months prior to&#xD;
      enrollment, will be enrolled at the clinical sites in Canada and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive, in a blinded fashion, one dose of VBI-2905a or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G4 - 27 participants will receive VBI-2905a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Day&#xD;
           1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G5 - 27 participants will receive placebo at Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, 27 participants who have not been previously vaccinated with any authorized or&#xD;
      experimental COVID-19 vaccine will be enrolled into an open-label arm at the clinical site in&#xD;
      Mexico City to receive two doses of VBI-2905a:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group G6 - 27 previously unvaccinated participants will receive VBI-2905a at a dose of 5&#xD;
           μg of S protein at Day 1 and Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will review blinded post-vaccination safety data 7 days after each vaccination&#xD;
      (reactogenicity, AEs and safety laboratory assessments). In Phase 1b, the DSMB will review&#xD;
      blinded Day 7 safety data after the first 10 participants in groups G4 and G5 (previously&#xD;
      vaccinated) and 10 participants in group 6 (not previously vaccinated) have received the&#xD;
      first dose. Only after the DSMB confirms that safety is acceptable and that stopping rules&#xD;
      were not met will the enrollment in the respective study groups continue to its completion.&#xD;
      The second vaccination in group G6 will proceed only after the DSMB has confirmed that the&#xD;
      vaccine safety and tolerability is acceptable and that stopping rules were not met through 7&#xD;
      days after the first 10 participants have received the first dose of VBI-2905a.&#xD;
