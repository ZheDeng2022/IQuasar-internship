  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark.&#xD;
      Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of&#xD;
      all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing&#xD;
      radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including&#xD;
      the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation,&#xD;
      and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side&#xD;
      effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome,&#xD;
      xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the&#xD;
      overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there&#xD;
      is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of&#xD;
      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells&#xD;
      have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after&#xD;
      radiotherapy damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells&#xD;
      from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in&#xD;
      previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a&#xD;
      clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from&#xD;
      xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since&#xD;
      only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of&#xD;
      xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia is the diagnosis of the subjective feeling of dry mouth. Xerostomia can coexist&#xD;
      with or exist without a reduced production of saliva, although xerostomia is first perceived&#xD;
      when unstimulated whole saliva flow rate is reduced by more than 40-50%. In this context, a&#xD;
      subnormal or pathologically reduced saliva production (hyposalivation) will severely diminish&#xD;
      the quality of life and lead to severe dental decay. The two main causes of grave xerostomia&#xD;
      are Sjögren's syndrome and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      plays a central role in the curative treatment of most upper head and neck cancers, either as&#xD;
      a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery, and the prevalence of&#xD;
      xerostomia after head and neck radiation ranges from 74 to 85%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy increases local tumor control significantly along with the chance of&#xD;
      survival, but despite the more advanced methods of radiation therapy, Intensity-Modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT), a significant proportion of the radiation is deposited in the&#xD;
      healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. The decrease of saliva secretion after radiation&#xD;
      therapy predisposes the patients to a variety of conditions. These are either directly or&#xD;
      indirectly a result of the decreased production of saliva and include xerostomia, impairment&#xD;
      of the normal oral functions (talking, chewing, and swallowing) due to insufficient wetting,&#xD;
      and reduced lubrication of mucosal surfaces and the ingested food which impairs nutrition.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the oral mucosa can become dry, making the oral mucosa vulnerable, which may&#xD;
      lead to frictional trauma and ulceration. In addition, a reduced salivary flow results in a&#xD;
      reduced &quot;rinsing&quot; of the entire oral cavity, thus leading to microbial overgrowth, which in&#xD;
      addition to other factors may result in rapid dental decay, dental erosion, and oral&#xD;
      candidiasis (thrush).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of&#xD;
      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types. For more than&#xD;
      ten years, researchers have investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an&#xD;
      approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage and several&#xD;
      groups have addressed the use of MSCs or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in&#xD;
      preclinical studies of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group has completed an encouraging randomized-controlled pilot study (MESRIX-I)&#xD;
      with 30 patients assessing the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded autologous ASCs for&#xD;
      radiation-induced xerostomia in an effort to regenerate the function of the salivary glands&#xD;
      (EudraCT nb:2014-004349-29). The results of this study show most importantly that the&#xD;
      treatment is safe without any serious adverse events (SAE) and no systemic reactions, and&#xD;
      secondly, the patients treated with stem cells have a promising enhanced production of saliva&#xD;
      of 33%-50%. Furthermore, the research group has shown that the stem cell group gained vital&#xD;
      quality of life measures compared with the placebo group in the form of diminished trouble in&#xD;
      eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group has furthermore recently investigated the safety of allogenic ASCs for the&#xD;
      treatment of xerostomia (MESRIX-II) with a clinical safety and feasible trial (EudraCT nb:&#xD;
      2018-003856-19). The study included ten patients who received intraglandular injections of&#xD;
      allogeneic ASCs. No serious treatment-related adverse reaction occurred, and the efficacy&#xD;
      data was similar to the results from our first trial with autologous ASCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Treatment with ASCs will result in an improvement of the participant's&#xD;
      unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rate and ameliorate the xerostomia and increase&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of&#xD;
      allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and&#xD;
      xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to&#xD;
      develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering&#xD;
      from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful&#xD;
      since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom&#xD;
      of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center,&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of ASCs as a treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia for&#xD;
      previous head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Patients between the age of 18-70 years previously treated with radiation for a head&#xD;
      and neck cancer and a clinically evaluated reduced salivation and hyposalivation, evaluated&#xD;
      by a screening, can be included. Each participant will be double-blindly randomized to&#xD;
      receive either allogeneic ASCs or placebo consisting of CryoStor10 (BiolifeSolutions), the&#xD;
      freeze media for ASCs containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Allogeneic ASCs are provided&#xD;
      from the Cardiology Stem Cell Centre (CSCC) at Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated on salivary gland function and saliva flow rate by sialometry.&#xD;
      Both unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated whole saliva will be collected. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators will analyze the following on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by&#xD;
      ionic balance estimation, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride, total&#xD;
      protein and selected proteins, and amylase. For evaluation of the participants´ perception of&#xD;
      xerostomia, the participants will answer validated questionnaires in Danish (EORTC QLQ Module&#xD;
      for H&amp;N-35 and XQ) at baseline and after four months. These patient-reported outcomes (PRO)&#xD;
      questionnaires are essential, validated tools for estimating the degree of quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) and xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of MESRIX-III participants and obtaining informed consent MESRIX-III participants&#xD;
      (recipients/placebo) will be recruited through the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and&#xD;
      Neck Surgery at Rigshospitalet and Oncology Departments at Rigshospitalet and Herlev&#xD;
      Hospital, and through our databases on head and neck cancer patients. The investigator will&#xD;
      send a letter to eligible patients who have been treated and followed for their previous&#xD;
      cancer disease. Eligible patients can also contact the investigators or a trained member of&#xD;
      the MESRIX-III study by phone or by a specific study e-mail&#xD;
      (regionh-stamcelle.rigshospitalet@regionh.dk) if the eligible patients wish to receive a&#xD;
      letter with further information. Subsequently, the principal investigator or a trained member&#xD;
      of the MESRIX-III study group will contact patients by phone and inquire about their interest&#xD;
      in participating in the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the eligible patients have an interest in participating in the project, the eligible&#xD;
      patients will be invited to an interview at the outpatient clinic of the Department of&#xD;
      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rigshospitalet for further information concerning the&#xD;
      trial. In the written information material, besides material about the trial, the pamphlets&#xD;
      &quot;Rights of test subjects in a health scientific research project&quot; and &quot;before decision&quot; will&#xD;
      be included. The right to bring counsel to the information interview will likewise be&#xD;
      explained. Motivated patients referred from doctors in other parts of Denmark and patients&#xD;
      who approach our department with an interest in participation in the stem cell research will&#xD;
      also be offered information about the trial. Patients from all parts of Denmark can be&#xD;
      included if the participants pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below.&#xD;
      However, transportation and accommodation cannot be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information interview will take place in an undisturbed environment with the principal&#xD;
      investigator or trained member of the MESRIX-III study group, who has the professional&#xD;
      qualifications to communicate the content of the research project, and who will clearly&#xD;
      explain that it is a request to participate in a health science research project. The&#xD;
      participant will be given oral information about the project in layman's terms on the basis&#xD;
      of the written information, and any questions will be answered. The oral information will be&#xD;
      adapted to the participant's requirements, and it will be explained without the use of&#xD;
      technical terms. Participants will be informed of the right to reflection following the&#xD;
      information interview. Participants will likewise be informed of the opportunity to get&#xD;
      feedback on the scientific results but will also be informed that no new information on the&#xD;
      individual participant's disease or prognosis will be obtained. The potential participants&#xD;
      for MESRIX-III will be contacted by telephone by the responsible physician for final&#xD;
      commitment to participate. If participants are still interested in participating in the&#xD;
      project, an appointment is made where a medical history is taken, and where the remaining&#xD;
      trial appointments will be planned in agreement with the participant, and here the&#xD;
      participants and the responsible physician will sign the medical consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation, reporting, and recording of adverse events All adverse events (AEs) are monitored&#xD;
      and recorded along with concomitant medicine at the scheduled follow-up (day one, and 4&#xD;
      months after the intervention). AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the&#xD;
      clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily&#xD;
      have a causal relationship with the treatment (ASC/placebo). AEs will be assessed and graded&#xD;
      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 guidelines (CTCAEv5.0).&#xD;
      Thus, all adverse events are recorded with CTCAE grade. All grade 3 and grade 4 events and&#xD;
      incidents considered related to this trial will be reported to the sponsor by the&#xD;
      investigator immediately after the events are discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse reaction (AR) is defined as any untoward or unintended response in a participant&#xD;
      to an investigational medical product (IMP) which is related to any dose administered to that&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is stated as all noxious and unintended responses to a&#xD;
      medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR), or Suspected Unexpected Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), means any AE, AE, SUSAR, respectively, that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results in death or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A serious deterioration in health that&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Resulted in life-threatening illness or injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Resulted in permanent impairment of body structure or body function&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Resulted in medical or surgical treatment to prevent the above&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lead to foetal death, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other negative effect on&#xD;
           the foetus&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anything the Principal Investigator deems to be of Clinical serious significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical judgment will be exercised by the primary investigator together with the sponsor&#xD;
      whether an AE or AR should be classified as serious in other situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included participants will be instructed to contact the principal investigator or a&#xD;
      special trained person from the research group in case of events with possible relation to&#xD;
      the trial treatment within the main study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will immediately (within maximum 24 hours after receiving the&#xD;
      information) inform the sponsor if SAR, SAE or serious suspected adverse reactions occurs.&#xD;
      The sponsor will report SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) to the Danish&#xD;
      Medicines Agency and the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics within 15 days&#xD;
      of occurrence and 7 days in case of death or life-threatening issue. Unexpected reactions are&#xD;
      defined as reactions that are not described in the section &quot;Reference Safety information&quot; of&#xD;
      this protocol. All other unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported within 15 days&#xD;
      after the sponsor becomes aware of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SARs that have occurred during the trial will be reported to The Danish Medicines Agency,&#xD;
      The Danish Patient Safety Authority, and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (if&#xD;
      appropriate) once a year by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will annually send a concise review and evaluation of pertinent safety&#xD;
      information, a Development Safety update report (DSUR) collected during the reporting period&#xD;
      related to the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the trial, the sponsor will after 90 days inform the Danish Medicines&#xD;
      Agency that the study is completed. Within a year, the sponsor will submit trial results to&#xD;
      the board, according to the law on drugs (Lov om lægemidler) § 89. 2, No. 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference safety information (RSI) Adverse events with possible relation to injection of&#xD;
      ASCs: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not&#xD;
      serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary swelling of&#xD;
      the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events with relation to similar procedures and in MESRIX-I: Type; Frequency;&#xD;
      Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;&#xD;
      Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;&#xD;
      Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;&#xD;
      Not serious Infection of the salivary gland; 0.5-5%; Not serious Bleeding/hematoma in the&#xD;
      salivary gland; 1-5%; Not serious&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above numbers and AEs are based on the previous phase I-II trial (EudraCT:&#xD;
      2014-004349-29) and on the literature cited and described in the section &quot;Risk Assessment&quot;.&#xD;
      In the previous study by the research group, MESRIX-I, with autologous ASCs no SAR or SUSARs&#xD;
      were detected, so any SAR in this study will be reported as a SUSAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term safety and efficacy follow-up Following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human&#xD;
      Use (CHMP) under EMEA draft from January 2018 on safety and efficacy (S&amp;E) follow-up and risk&#xD;
      management of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), the MESRIX-III participants will be&#xD;
      invited to a follow-up of efficacy and ARs one year after the intervention (ASCs/placebo).&#xD;
      Longer follow-up is not needed based on the reported long-term safety described in the&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Risk Assessment&quot;. Follow-up will include basic ear, nose, and throat examination,&#xD;
      fiberscope, ultrasound of submandibular glands, sialometry, and blood samples. Data from the&#xD;
      electronic medical journals and national pathology database will be gathered. It is expected&#xD;
      that a number of the participants will have a recurrence of their primary cancer during the&#xD;
      study or follow-up period due to the nature of the head and neck cancer. The allogeneic MSCs&#xD;
      are believed to be rejected in the recipients, and the stem cells are adult non-pluripotent.&#xD;
      However, in case of recurrence of cancer or new primary cancer developments each case will be&#xD;
      carefully evaluated and potentially investigated with genetic analysis in an attempt to&#xD;
      distinguish whether a tumor is due to recurrence, the administered product, or endogenous&#xD;
      tumor formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power considerations From MESRIX-I it appeared to be realistic to increase&#xD;
      saliva production for whole unstimulated salivary flow (in milliliter(ml)/minut) rate by&#xD;
      about 33% or in absolute numbers from 0.125 to 0.151 after 1 month and 0.155 after 4 months.&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. This means that the&#xD;
      total number of patients included would have to be 100 (50 in each group) for a paired&#xD;
      t-test. 10-20 additional participants may be included to compensate for dropout during the&#xD;
      study period. The investigators believe that a 33% increase in whole, unstimulated salivary&#xD;
      flow rate is clinically important and also realistic to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration.&#xD;
      The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency (DPA)&#xD;
      will be requested permission to conduct the study. Moreover, the Danish Medicines Agency will&#xD;
      be requested approval, and the trial will be monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;
      unit (Birgitte Grøn). Each volunteer (MESRIX-III participants) is required to give written&#xD;
      informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about&#xD;
      participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is&#xD;
      covered by professional secrecy. No project participant has a personal financial incentive to&#xD;
      implement the described project. The samples will be analyzed and stored in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk assessment When the study participants in MESRIX-III will receive either ASCs or placebo&#xD;
      into the large salivary glands the risk of adverse events such as infection and bleeding is&#xD;
      estimated to be below 0.5% when using similar procedures. In our previous studies, none of&#xD;
      the 40 participants developed adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MESRIX-III participants may also experience some pain briefly during injection of the&#xD;
      transplant product (ASCs or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A theoretical risk of a possible carcinogenic effect in the treatment of MSC/ASCs has been&#xD;
      discussed. This is due to their production of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      (EGF), a factor produced by the MSC/ASCs. These considerations are particularly relevant&#xD;
      since ASCs are used in participants previously diagnosed with cancer. However, in model&#xD;
      systems of cancer, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth is controversial as MSCs have both&#xD;
      been shown to be inhibitory and stimulatory. Further, numerous clinical trials with more than&#xD;
      1000 participants have been conducted with MSCs in different participant populations, and no&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of cancer has been detected. These studies include local injection&#xD;
      of MSCs. With respect to the use of ex vivo expanded MSCs, despite extensive research, there&#xD;
      is no data indicating malignant transformation of expanded human MSCs/ASCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report&#xD;
      Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring,&#xD;
      audit, and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines&#xD;
      Authority, or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA&#xD;
      for the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.&#xD;
      Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with R. Our data will be kept securely in the electronic data capture&#xD;
      system (EDC) Redcap. All data will be directly entered. The trial will be completed when all&#xD;
      data is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be stored and analyzed electronically; participants' anonymity is ensured in&#xD;
      accordance with the national data legislation. After completion of the study, data will be&#xD;
      stored in an anonymous form. Data containing social security numbers will be kept locked and&#xD;
      inaccessible to unauthorized persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject confidentially The investigator is obliged to ensure that participant anonymity is&#xD;
      protected and maintained. On the CRF´s subjects should be identified by their initials and a&#xD;
      subject study number only, Documents that are not for submission (e.g., signed informed&#xD;
      consent forms) will be kept in strict confidence by the principal investigator. In compliance&#xD;
      with the GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and the institution permit&#xD;
      authorized representatives of a monitoring company direct access to reviewing subjects'&#xD;
      original medical records for verification of study-related procedures and data. All&#xD;
      information obtained concerning this protocol regarding participants is protected according&#xD;
      to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&#xD;
