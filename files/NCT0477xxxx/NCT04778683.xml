    <textblock>
      Background: Circumcision is one of the most common surgical interventions in boys, and boys&#xD;
      undergoing this procedure experience anxiety and fear during the preoperative period. In&#xD;
      addition, postoperative pain in children is reported to be associated with anxiety and fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aimed to examine the effects of using a virtual reality (VR) application&#xD;
      before circumcision on the pre- and postoperative anxiety and fear levels and postoperative&#xD;
      pain symptoms in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: This randomized controlled experimental study included 5-to 10-year-old&#xD;
      boys referred to a pediatric hospital for circumcision between June and September 2019.&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using the randomized block design, and the subjects were divided&#xD;
      into control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 40) groups. The data were collected using a&#xD;
      participant information form, the children's fear scale (CFS), the children's anxiety meter&#xD;
      scale (CAM-S), and the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale; data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0&#xD;
      package program. The data were evaluated using descriptive statistics; the chi-square test&#xD;
      was used to assess the sociodemographic data, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare two&#xD;
      independent groups, the Wilcoxon T-test was used to compare intra-group preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative values, and the Spearman Correlation test was used to examine the relationship&#xD;
      between anxiety, fear and pain scores.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled study was included 5-to 10-year-old boys who were referred to a&#xD;
      pediatric hospital in Turkey for circumcision between June and September 2019. The sample&#xD;
      size for the study was calculated using the G-Power 3.0.10 program and t-test for comparison&#xD;
      of two independent groups with an effect size of 0.8, an alpha level and margin of error of&#xD;
      0.05, and a power of 95%. The sample size was determined to be 70; each of the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups included 35 children. Data were collected from 98 children. Of them, 14&#xD;
      children were excluded from the study because two could not obtain approval from their&#xD;
      families to participate in the study, four had previous surgical interventions, six had&#xD;
      chronic and mental illnesses, and two had vision problems. The inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      study were agreement to participation in the study, age between 4 and 10 years, no vision or&#xD;
      hearing problems, no history of surgical intervention, and no chronic and mental health&#xD;
      problems. Children who met the inclusion criteria and who had written and verbal consents&#xD;
      from their parents for participation in the study were divided into 2 groups. The&#xD;
      experimental group consisted of 40 children who received a VR application, and the control&#xD;
      group consisted of 38 children who received standard healthcare. A randomized block design&#xD;
      method was used to randomize the participants to the groups. The randomization list was&#xD;
      prepared by a third person and was given to the investigator only during the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments The data were collected using a participant information form to obtain details&#xD;
      about baseline characteristics; children's fear scale (CFS) and children's anxiety meter&#xD;
      scale (CAM-S) were used to evaluate fear and anxiety in children during both the pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative periods, and the Wong-Baker faces pain rating scale (WBS) was used to evaluate&#xD;
      the levels of postoperative pain in children. A white colored &quot;VR BOX 3.0&quot; with VR glasses (a&#xD;
      headset with a screen covering the children's eyes) was used in this study. It was compatible&#xD;
      with iOS and Android operating systems and 4-6-inch screen smartphones. The VR device, which&#xD;
      is activated through applications installed on smartphones, divides the image into two equal&#xD;
      windows, providing the necessary viewfinder range for panoramic view. The distance between&#xD;
      the mobile phone and the lens can be adjusted for each user. The VR glasses do not require&#xD;
      any power or electrical connection, except the mobile phone, during their use. The weight of&#xD;
      the VR glasses is 0.414 kg. Soundproof headsets are used to provide immersive VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Sociodemographic data of the children and their mothers were collected using the&#xD;
      participant information form. Then, the children rated their fear and anxiety on the scales&#xD;
      using a pen. Similar assessments were performed by their mothers and the investigator. The&#xD;
      investigator explained the use of VR glasses to the children in the VR group. The&#xD;
      investigator selected two VR programs to be watched by the children. In the VR program named&#xD;
      Amazon, the child perceives himself to be walking among the trees in the Amazon forests. The&#xD;
      other VR program gives the child a feeling of water skiing. Before commencement of the study,&#xD;
      the VR applications were administered to five children aged between five and ten years, and&#xD;
      these children shared no negative feedback about the VR programs. Before the surgery, the&#xD;
      children were allowed to watch the VR program of their choice, the average duration of which&#xD;
      was 4.5 minutes, using the VR glasses. Parts of the device that come in contact with the&#xD;
      children's faces were cleaned before each application. After the surgery, the children, their&#xD;
      mothers, and the investigator re-evaluated the fear and anxiety in children using the CFS and&#xD;
      the CAM-S. The pain levels in children during the postoperative period were evaluated by both&#xD;
      their mothers and the nurse. The same evaluations were performed in children in the control&#xD;
      group who received routine clinical care.&#xD;
