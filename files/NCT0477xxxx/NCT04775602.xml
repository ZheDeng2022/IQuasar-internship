      Single-center, prospective, open-label, not randomized, diagnostic phase II trial in the&#xD;
      management of patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      additional diagnostic role of 18F- PSMA PET /CT (sensitivity) in patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer with biochemical relapse compared to other diagnostic methods routinely used. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity of 18F-PSMA PET/CT defined as the ratio&#xD;
      between the number of 18F-PSMA PET/CT positive patients and the number of prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients with biochemical relapse and negative standard imaging.Patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study would benefit from a more accurate but above all earlier diagnosis of disease&#xD;
      recurrence sites, thus being able to undergo targeted therapies, with a clear impact on the&#xD;
      clinical management of the disease.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the predictive role of 18F-PSMA PET/CT on disease status, for patients that will start an anticancer treatment. It will be performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated by plotting sensitivity versus 1-specificity The best cut-off value for distinguishing between positive and negative 18F- PSMA PET/CT findings will be determined using Youden's index.</description>
