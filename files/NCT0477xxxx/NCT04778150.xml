  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is an important parameter in the management of patient&#xD;
      during liver transplantation surgery especially during portal vein clamping. The only way to&#xD;
      measure it is to use a pulmonary artery catheter. If the authors can show a positive&#xD;
      relationship between invasive SvO2 measurement and noninvasive jugular venous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SjvO2) measurement with VO 100 medical device, it will possible to use SjvO2 as a&#xD;
      noninvasive surrogate of SvO2 in patients during liver transplantation surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SvO2 measures mixed venous oxygen saturation from the lower and upper half of the body. To be&#xD;
      measured, Sv02 requires a central venous catheter. SvO2 gives knowledge about the balance&#xD;
      between the delivery of oxygen and oxygen consumption in the body. Interest in SvO2&#xD;
      monitoring in anesthesia and critical care has been debated. However, SvO2 is still&#xD;
      recommended as a major hemodynamic target of early resuscitation of critically ill patients.&#xD;
      SvO2 measurement through pulmonary artery catheter is accompanied with morbidity due to its&#xD;
      invasiveness. During liver transplantation surgery, measurement of SvO2 is required to&#xD;
      adequately manage hemodynamics of the patient, especially during portal venous clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO 100 medical device from Mespere LifeSciences allows a non-invasive measurement of SjvO2&#xD;
      using the NIRS technique. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) is a measurement of the&#xD;
      amount of oxygen left in the venous system after the brain has removed the oxygen that it&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the same principle that a positive relationship between ScvO2 and SvO2 has been shown,&#xD;
      what the investigators are trying to do is to show a positive relationship between SjvO2 and&#xD;
      SvO2 in order to possibly use in the future SjvO2 measured by VO 100 as a noninvasive&#xD;
      surrogate of SvO2 during liver transplantation surgery.&#xD;
