      Compare the microcirculatory reactivity before and after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      40 mg/kg vitamin C and evaluate intra-individual variation of hemodynamic parameters between&#xD;
      T0 and T1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a transversal study allowing to compare the microcirculatory reactivity before and&#xD;
      after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 40 mg/kg vitamin C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A monocentric, open-label, transversal study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size :&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 6 hours and 24 hours after admission, the patient will be included after collection&#xD;
      of the non opposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two evaluation times: T0 before the start of vitamin C's perfusion, and T1: 1&#xD;
      hour after the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned. Analysis will be performed at the end of the study after data&#xD;
      review and freezing of data base.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the change in microcirculatory vascular reactivity before and after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 40 mg / kg vitamin C.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Change (%) in microcirculatory vascular reactivity. T0 being measured just before the start of the vitamin C infusion. T1 being measured immediately after the 30-minute vitamin C infusion. The microcirculatory vascular reactivity will be evaluated using a cutaneous doppler laser coupled to an iontophoresis system. The doppler laser measures the skin perfusion on a sample of skin. A low intensity electric field is delivered for 12 seconds (3 times in a row at 1 minute interval) and allows local skin diffusion of an ionized solution of acetylcholine placed on the skin in a micro-sponge. It has been shown that this technique is very precise and that it is a very good reflection of endothelial function by measuring 3 parameters, the microcirculatory basal flow, the peak in response to acetylcholine and a more integrative index, the area under the curve with a standardized 10-minute recording. This local technique does not induce any side effects, it is very well tolerated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To study the hemodynamic effects of vitamin C on cardiac output, hemodynamic parameters: HR, BP, clinical perfusion parameters: marbling score, cutaneous re-coloring time.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Variation (%) in cardiac output between T0 and T1 (echocardiography) ((T1-T0) / T0x100).&#xD;
Variation (%) of hemodynamic parameters between T0 and T1 ((T1-T0) / T0x100): Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cardiac output&#xD;
Variation (%) of clinical perfusion parameters between T0 and T1 between T0 and T1: mottling score, skin recoloration time.&#xD;
All these parameters are routinely measured as part of the management of septic shock.</description>

        During septic shock, there are microcirculatory abnormalities, partly related to oxidative&#xD;
        stress, which contribute to the pathophysiology of organ failures. We systematically&#xD;
        supplement septic shock patients admitted in intensive care with vitamin C (ascorbic acid)&#xD;
        because of the frequency of vitamin deficiencies in this population. Vitamin C having&#xD;
        anti-oxidant properties, we hypothesized that Vitamin C's infusion could modulate&#xD;
        microcirculatory endothelial reactivity in septic shock patients. This trial will allow us&#xD;
        to include patients in stabilized septic shock between H6 and H24 of patient's care under&#xD;
        norepinephrine.&#xD;

               -  Patients with sepsis (suspected infection + 2 SOFA points) according to the&#xD;
                  latest international and the need to receive norepinephrine to maintain an&#xD;
