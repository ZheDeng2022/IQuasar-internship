  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tools to investigate dietary lutein and zeaxanthin (L/Z) intake and electronic device (ED)&#xD;
      use are important to progress research that investigates the role of ED blue light (BL)&#xD;
      exposure, and dietary L/Z intake on macular health. This project aims to validate two&#xD;
      questionnaires developed by our research group: The L/Z FFQ, and the Electronic Device Use&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EDUQ). The L/Z FFQ aims to investigate dietary intake of L/Z over the prior&#xD;
      week or month. The EDUQ aims to investigate usual hours and behaviours surrounding ED use&#xD;
      over the prior three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aims of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate a L/Z FFQ recalling over a weekly and monthly timeframe against multiple&#xD;
           24-hour diet recalls over four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validate the EDUQ against multiple 24-hour ED use diaries over eight weeks. A cohort of&#xD;
           100 adults will be invited to participate to validate the FFQ and EDUQ. Participants&#xD;
           will be offered to choose to participate in one or both the questionnaire validations&#xD;
           (L/Z FFQ and EDUQ).&#xD;

      L/Z FFQ Validation The validation procedure will span over four weeks, consisting of&#xD;
      administering the L/Z FFQ and 24-hour diet recalls at multiple timepoints. Timepoints for the&#xD;
      eight 24-hour diet recalls will be determined by random number generator for each of the&#xD;
      participants at baseline (https://www.random.org/), of which two will take place on weekend&#xD;
      days, and the remainder on week days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The weekly L/Z FFQ will be completed at the conclusion of each of the four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The monthly L/Z FFQ will be completed at baseline and at the conclusion of week four.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will indicate their consent to participate on Checkbox® by proceeding to the&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic information: at the beginning of the first investigation (monthly L/Z FFQ)&#xD;
           participants will be asked to report their weight, height, age, gender, highest level of&#xD;
           education, occupational status (employed or unemployed), post-code and country of&#xD;
           residence, usual hours of physical activity per week, how they heard about the study,&#xD;
           and whether they are actively trying to gain or lose weight. Personal information is to&#xD;
           be collected to qualify the characteristics of the population in which the tool is being&#xD;
           validated. Data collected via Checkbox ®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. L/Z FFQ: The weekly L/Z FFQ is a 91-item questionnaire that takes approximately 20&#xD;
           minutes to complete, and investigates the frequency of intake of listed foods or&#xD;
           supplements over the prior seven days. The monthly L/Z FFQ contains the same 91 items,&#xD;
           takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, and investigates the frequency of intake of&#xD;
           listed foods or supplements over the prior month. In addition, the monthly L/Z FFQ&#xD;
           contains four qualitative questions that investigate change in usual dietary intake over&#xD;
           the last one to ten years. Questionnaire data collected via Checkbox®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24-hour diet recall: the diet recall via the online Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour&#xD;
           Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24®) takes approximately 25 minutes to complete, and&#xD;
           investigates food and beverages consumed in the prior 24-hours (20). The ASA24® is&#xD;
           supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States (US) with&#xD;
           national variants and as a US government entity not within the EU-US Data Privacy Shield&#xD;
           for legal reasons. Therefore, explicit consent for use of the ASA24® tool will be sought&#xD;
           from participants. For further information on the tool:&#xD;
           https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EDUQ Validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation procedure will occur over eight weeks consisting of administering eight&#xD;
      24-hour diary of ED use (24-hour ED use diary) and the EDUQ at three time points. The time&#xD;
      points for the eight 24-hour ED use diaries will be determined by random number generator for&#xD;
      each of the participants at baseline (https://www.random.org/), of which two will take place&#xD;
      on weekend days, and the remainder on weekdays. The EDUQ will be completed at baseline and at&#xD;
      the conclusion of weeks four and eight. Upon consenting to participate on the Checkbox® by&#xD;
      proceeding to the questionnaires, participants will be instructed to fill out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The EDUQ: A 22-item questionnaire that takes 20 minutes to complete, and measures&#xD;
           participant demographic information (weight, height, age, highest level of education,&#xD;
           occupational status, post-code and country of residence), usual daily ED use from&#xD;
           present up to 20 years ago, occupational influence to use, and differences to ED use&#xD;
           between a weekend and weekday (questionnaire adapted from Williams et al. (2019) (21).&#xD;
           Personal information collected as part of this questionnaire is to qualify the&#xD;
           characteristics of the population in which the tool is being validated. Data collected&#xD;
           via Checkbox®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24-hour ED use diary: Participants will be asked to record their ED use in hours and&#xD;
           minutes over 24 hours. Data collected via Checkbox®.&#xD;
