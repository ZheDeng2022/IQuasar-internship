  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In preterm infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS), exogenous pulmonary&#xD;
      surfactant(PS) replacement therapy is one of the most important therapeutic breakthrough to&#xD;
      reduce neonatal mortality. Nowadays, PS is commonly used in newborn infants with respiratory&#xD;
      distress, but the incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) and/or death are&#xD;
      inconsistent. The result indicates that not all preterm infants with respiratory distress can&#xD;
      be beneficial from PS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, the international neonatal ARDS (NARDS) collaborative group provides the first&#xD;
      consensus definition for NARDS. And whether or not PS being beneficial for preterm infants&#xD;
      with NARDS remains unknown.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, PS is not recommended to adult and pediatric ARDS. Meantime, systematic review&#xD;
      indicates that PS does not demonstrate statistically significant beneficial effects on&#xD;
      reducing the mortality and the rate of BPD in term and late preterm infants with meconium&#xD;
      aspiration syndrome(MAS). Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that preterm infants with&#xD;
      NARDS do not benefit from one dose of PS. And the speculation can explain why not all preterm&#xD;
      infants with respiratory distress can be beneficial from PS. In the era of pre-NARDS, the&#xD;
      preterm infants fulfilling the definition of NARDS may have been considered as NRDS in the&#xD;
      first three days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the diagnostic criteria of NARDS, a key procedure for diagnosis of NARDS is to&#xD;
      exclude the newborn infants with NRDS. But no detailed procedures are available to&#xD;
      differentiate NRDS from NARDS.&#xD;
