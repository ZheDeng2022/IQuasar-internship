  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized control trial employing a cross sectional stepped wedge design. Women with&#xD;
      anticipated vaginal delivery, receiving usual care for the control group while women&#xD;
      receiving usual care plus support from a trained companion will constitute the experimental&#xD;
      group. Events and outcomes will then be assessed during and after birth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The order of introduction of the intervention will be determined randomly. Control data will&#xD;
      be obtained from the first health facility until the sample size for the control for that&#xD;
      facility is achieved. Following collection of control data for the first facility, the&#xD;
      intervention will be introduced to the same facility to a new group of participants.&#xD;
      Simultaneously control data from the other facilities will be collected and this will be done&#xD;
      until all the facilities are covered in a step wedge manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of a session of training on admission in labor. The training&#xD;
      will focus on emotional and physical support; emotional support including being Present,&#xD;
      demonstrating a caring and positive attitude, saying calming verbal expressions, using humor,&#xD;
      praise, encouraging and acknowledging efforts during the process of pushing the baby.&#xD;
      Physical support including supporting her to change position favoring upright positions,&#xD;
      walking with her, giving her drinks and food, massage, reminding her to go and pass urine,&#xD;
      helping her find a comfortable position for pushing, wipe her face with cool cloth and help&#xD;
      her breast feed.&#xD;
