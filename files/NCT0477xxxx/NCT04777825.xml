  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study whether Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback training can improve abnormal head&#xD;
      posture and painful symptomatology in patients with &quot;cervical dystonia&quot; not selected for DBS&#xD;
      after extensive screening in a specialized unit but diagnosed &quot; dysfunctional &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the respiratory coherence group will receive HRV biofeedback training for 12&#xD;
      sessions during a 6 months-period. The hypothesis is that this kind of physiological&#xD;
      noninvasive therapy increasing coherence respiratory, will reduce pain and patient's complain&#xD;
      about their psychogenic abnormal head posture. Improvement of anxiety, depression and quality&#xD;
      of life are expected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with an isolated abnormal head posture, first diagnosed as cervical&#xD;
      dystonia, demonstrated in fact, after neurological screening, to be of psychogenic origine.&#xD;
      These patients are not candidate for functional surgery and, furthermore, usually refuse&#xD;
      psychotherapy leading them to medical nomadism. This study proposes to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of an innovative intervention program based on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback that&#xD;
      promotes self-regulatory skills in dysfunctional movement disorders (DMD) patients in order&#xD;
      to improve their condition and symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate is under the control of efferent sympathetic and vagal activities directed to the&#xD;
      sinus node, which are modulated by central brain stem (vasomotor and respiratory centers) and&#xD;
      peripheral oscillators (oscillation in arterial pressure and respiratory movements). Spectral&#xD;
      analysis of HRV is a reliable quantitative method for analyzing the modulatory effects of&#xD;
      neural mechanisms on the sinus node. Several biofeedback protocols and assistive electronic&#xD;
      technologies, such as proposed by SymbioCenter©, exist to enhance increase HRV and&#xD;
      synchronize respiration with the heart rhythm. HRV biofeedback training appears to be an&#xD;
      opportunity in the patient's management in order of preventing medical overconsuming. It is&#xD;
      offering a safe and non-pharmacological alternative approach managed by a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team in a functional neurosurgery unit. It is expected that developing respiratory coherence&#xD;
      in these patients will improve their painful symptomatology.&#xD;
