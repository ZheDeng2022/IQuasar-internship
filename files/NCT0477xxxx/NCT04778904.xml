  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to determine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-HBV and MVA-HBV vaccines, with or without nivolumab, in patients with chronic HBV who&#xD;
      are virally suppressed with oral anti-viral therapies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre study conducted in 64 participants, who will each be administered 2&#xD;
      vaccine injections (IM) on Day 0 and Day 28 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: MVA-HBV + MVA-HBV Group 2: ChAdOx1-HBV + MVA-HBV Group 3: ChAdOx1-HBV + MVA-HBV +&#xD;
      nivolumab (IV infusion) Group 4: ChAdOx1-HBV + nivolumab + MVA-HBV + nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomised to treatment as the groups are initiated with a 1:1:1:1&#xD;
      allocation. A sentinel participant is dosed in Group 1, with further participants in Group 1&#xD;
      only being dosed at least 48h later. Group 2 is initiated following a Day 7 safety assessment&#xD;
      of the first 6 participants in Group 1. Groups 3 and 4 are initiated following a Day 7 safety&#xD;
      assessment of the first 6 participants in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the&#xD;
      treatment regimens; this will be assessed by analysis of the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      (serious) adverse events and any changes in laboratory values and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are the determination of the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-HBV and MVA-HBV vaccines and the impact of PD-blockade, as well as the effect on HBV&#xD;
      markers; these are assessed by measurements of the magnitude and avidity of HBV-specific CD4+&#xD;
      and CD8+ T cells and the magnitude of HBV markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following first vaccination, participants remain in the study for 9 months and attend clinic&#xD;
      visits for vaccination and assessments on Days 0, 7, 28, 35 and Months, 3, 6 and 9.&#xD;
