  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to leverage the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative's&#xD;
      (MSQC) existing network and surgeon performance feedback platform to improve opioid&#xD;
      prescribing practices for surgeons within the network found to be prescribing in a manner&#xD;
      discordant with published guidelines and to inform best practices for future surgical quality&#xD;
      improvement initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being completed to learn more about the effectiveness, feasibility, and&#xD;
      acceptability and that the goal is both to evaluate how effective this intervention and&#xD;
      mechanism are for changing surgeon opioid prescribing behavior and to inform best practices&#xD;
      for future quality initiatives. The study hypothesizes that provider-level feedback will&#xD;
      allow clinicians to tailor postoperative prescribing more closely to patient consumption, and&#xD;
      reduce excess postoperative prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort of surgeons which have been identified as outliers by the Michigan Surgical&#xD;
      Quality Collaborative (MSQC) will be be invited to participate in this trial. The study team&#xD;
      will randomize the surgeons to either the provider-level push notifications (74 participants)&#xD;
      or to receive no communication (74 participants) from the study team. In this study&#xD;
      de-identified prescribing data will also be analyzed for sites that do not sign the Exhibit&#xD;
      B-1 form.&#xD;

    <description>Surgeons randomized to provider-level push report notifications will receive an email displaying their personal prescribing performance compared to Michigan Opioid Prescribing Engagement Network (OPEN) prescribing guidelines and their de-identified peers.&#xD;
The push report will also include a link to the secure MSQC data platform that displays more information about the case so the surgeon can further investigate prescribing information. The email will also contain contact information for the study team so as to help any surgeons troubleshoot, learn more, request to stop receiving reports, etc.&#xD;
Following receipt of the push report surgeons will also be invited to participate in a qualitative interview. The purpose of this interview is to learn about surgeons' preferences and experiences with the push reports.</description>
