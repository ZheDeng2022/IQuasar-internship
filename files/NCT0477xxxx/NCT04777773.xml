  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are studies investigating the dual-task effect in sitting, standing up without sitting&#xD;
      and walking in children with spastic CP. Some of these studies investigated motor-motor, some&#xD;
      of them motor-cognitive dual-task states, and children with CP were compared to typically&#xD;
      developing children. In all these studies, it is clearly seen that children with CP have more&#xD;
      dual-task complexities than their typically developing peers. Some of these studies draw&#xD;
      attention to dual-task education in children with CP. However, other than a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study and a case report in the literature, we did not find any studies&#xD;
      investigating the effectiveness of dual-task training in children with CP. When the&#xD;
      literature is examined in detail, there is no study that examines the effect of dual-task&#xD;
      exercise programs on walking activities and children's participation in daily life in&#xD;
      children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been planned based on this deficiency in the literature. Based on ICF, This&#xD;
      study has been planned dual-task training for children with CP.&#xD;
