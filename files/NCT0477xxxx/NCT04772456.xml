  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of performing&#xD;
      hyperpolarized metabolic MRI in the diagnosis of brain tumor. This study will also assess the&#xD;
      accuracy of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI to diagnose intermediate to patients with&#xD;
      infiltrating gliomas and examine the added utility of metabolic MRI over standard MRI imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA is allowing the use of hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate (HP 13C-pyruvate) in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 patients may take part in this study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB).&#xD;

    <description>To study the accuracy of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI to diagnose Glioma Cancer. We will compare the prediction of cancer from the MRI scan compared to actual diagnosis of cancer by any subsequent workup or procedure the participant undergoes. Prediction of cancer from MRI scan will be performed by assigning a standardized score . Actual diagnosis of cancer will be based on tissue pathology.</description>

    <description>Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, containing spin-polarized (&quot;hyperpolarized&quot;) [ 13C]pyruvate, is being studied as a diagnostic agent in combination with 13C spectroscopic MR imaging. The aim is to visualize [13C]pyruvate and its metabolites and thereby distinguish between anatomical areas with normal vs. abnormal metabolism, which should be useful in diagnosing and characterizing, for example, malignancy.&#xD;
Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection and [13C]pyruvate are general terms used throughout this brochure, that refer to all 13C labeling patterns, such as [1- 13C]pyruvate, [2- 13C]pyruvate and [1,2- 13C]pyruvate. From biological and safety standpoints, pyruvate with each of the labeling patterns behaves identically in the human body [Koletzko et al., 1997].</description>
