  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common cancer in the world and the fourth&#xD;
      most common cancer in France with more than 6,000 cases per year. For non-metastatic&#xD;
      patients, a preoperative chemotherapy is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As colorectal adenocarcinomas, gastroesophageal cancers (OGC) could be caused by a failure of&#xD;
      DNA repair related to the loss of expression of one of the DNA repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2,&#xD;
      PMS2, MSH6) (deficient MMR (dMMR)). The prevalence of tumors with dMMR is evaluated at 14%&#xD;
      (Choi et al, 2014; Kim et al, 2015). This proportion reaches 25% among patients over 70 years&#xD;
      old. Evidence suggests that patients with dMMR tumors do not benefit from neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Smyth et al, 2017), which may even have a negative impact, especially in&#xD;
      elderly patients, and which should be discussed in this particular situation. The decision of&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy must be taken very quickly after the endoscopic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the diagnostic performance of the determination of dMMR&#xD;
      status by endoscopic biopsies of OGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, there is no clear recommendation for the determination of dMMR status in OGC&#xD;
      especially regarding the size of the forceps to use to ensure the quality of samples and the&#xD;
      best molecular techniques for dMMR status determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods In this prospective study, the investigators will include patients who will benefit&#xD;
      from an upper endoscopy within 5 French hospital centers (Saint-Louis, Lariboisière, Beaujon,&#xD;
      Bichat and Avicenne) linked to the NORDICAP network. If a suspect lesion of OGC is discovered&#xD;
      during the gastroscopy, the endoscopist will perform at least 8 endoscopic biopsies,&#xD;
      according to the recommendations, and by the mean of 2 kinds of forceps: standard biopsy&#xD;
      forceps and a large capacity biopsy forceps. The clinical and follow-up data will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected and will include demographics data, cancer stage, lymph node&#xD;
      invasion, treatment history, recurrence and survival data. The investigators will assess MSI&#xD;
      status by genotyping and MMR proteins expression by immunochemistry (IHC), performed, for&#xD;
      each patient, on both biopsies and surgical tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results This study will allow us to compare diagnostic performance of endoscopic&#xD;
      biopsies to surgical samples for the assessment of dMMR status. Likewise, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the diagnostic performance of the two kinds of endoscopic forceps and of IHC and&#xD;
      genotyping for the determination of dMMR phenotype. It will enable us to establish&#xD;
      recommendations for the benefit of gastro-enterologists and pathologists.&#xD;
