  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The parent trial that supports this ancillary research is a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a group-based yoga intervention to decrease the frequency and impact&#xD;
      of urinary incontinence in ambulatory middle-aged and older women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women aged 50 years and older who report daily or more frequent stress-, urgency-, or&#xD;
      mixed-type incontinence, are not already engaged in formal yoga or muscle&#xD;
      stretching/strengthening programs, are willing to temporarily forgo other clinical treatments&#xD;
      for incontinence, are able to walk to and use the bathroom without assistance, and meet other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are being recruited from multiple locations surrounding the San&#xD;
      Francisco Bay area. Following a series of telephone- and then clinic-based screening&#xD;
      assessments, including a voiding diary to confirm the frequency and clinical type of&#xD;
      incontinence, eligible women are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in either a 3-month&#xD;
      yoga program (N~110) or a time-equivalent, non-specific muscle stretching and strengthening&#xD;
      control program (N~110).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3-month intervention period, participants participate in structured intervention&#xD;
      programs (either yoga-specific or muscle stretching-strengthening) consisting of twice&#xD;
      weekly, 90-minute group classes led by trained instructors). They are also be instructed to&#xD;
      practice their assigned intervention for at least an additional hour per week, with the&#xD;
      assistance of participant manuals created by the study team and a set of home yoga or&#xD;
      stretching/strengthening exercise props.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this ancillary trial research, the investigators are examining ancillary measures of a)&#xD;
      physical performance status, b)perceived stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms, and c)&#xD;
      sleep quality, duration, and continuity, already incorporated by the principal investigator&#xD;
      into the parent trial. The investigators will examine prospective relationships between these&#xD;
      ancillary measures and participant-reported urinary incontinence frequency/severity/impact,&#xD;
      examine intervention effects on these ancillary outcomes, and assess the extent to which&#xD;
      these ancillary outcomes mediate intervention effects on incontinence&#xD;
      frequency/severity/impact.&#xD;

    <measure>Standing Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in successive semi-tandem, tandem, and one-legged balance stand tests, in which their ability to hold each position for up to 30 seconds. Scoring is based on the number of seconds in which the participant is able to hold the one-legged balance position, ranging from 0 to 30. If a participant cannot make it through the semi-tandem and tandem stands, the one-legged balance will not be attempted. They will receive a score of zero for the one-legged balance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower extremity strength/power (by 30-second chair stand test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in lower extremity strength/power, participants are asked to stand up from a standard chair to a fully extended standing position as many times as possible within 30 seconds with their arms folded across their chest. The number of completed repetitions achieved in 30 seconds is recorded, with higher number indicating more strength or power.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic endurance (by 2-minute step test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in aerobic endurance. In this test of aerobic endurance for older adults, participants are asked to step in place as many times as possible in a 2 minute period, each time raising the knee to a level midway between the patella and iliac crest. Higher scores indicating greater endurance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in total score on Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item measure of thoughts and feelings related to perceived stress in the past month, validated in a probability sample of the United States. Scores range from 0 to 40; higher scores indicated greater perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in total score on Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, a validated 20-item self-administered questionnaire measure that has been widely used in clinical trials, including trials of bladder interventions, and has been shown to be sensitive to change. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicate greater burden of depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Somatic anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in somatic anxiety. Somatic anxiety (i.e., the affective component of anxiety believed to be related to autonomic physiological arousal response) is measured using the trait component of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a 20-item self-administered measure validated in clinical populations, including patients with bladder symptoms. Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater somatic anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in cognitive anxiety. Cognitive anxiety (i.e., the mental component of anxiety associated with fear of failure) is measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a validated self-administered questionnaire that includes a 7-item Anxiety Subscale shown to be sensitive to change in incontinence trials. Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep disruption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in sleep disruption. Average time spent awake after initial sleep onset is also assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary, based on participant recordings of nocturnal awakenings after initially falling asleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <description>Assess change in global sleep quality. Subjective sleep quality is being assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), an 18-item validated questionnaire originally designed to assess sleep quality, latency, efficiency, and problems over a one-week period. A global sleep quality score ranging from 0 to 21 can be derived from the PSQI, with higher scores reflecting poor sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average nightly sleep duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess change in average nightly sleep duration. Average total sleep duration is assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary is a daily self-report measure previously validated against actigraphy data, and used in multiple past studies of older adults.</description>
