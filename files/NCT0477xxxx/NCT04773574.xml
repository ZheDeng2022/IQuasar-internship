  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of myopia is seemingly increasing, and it is one of the major causes of&#xD;
      blindness. High myopia is defined as a refractive error with spherical equivalent exceeding&#xD;
      -6 diopters and/or the axial length longer than 26.5 mm. The global prevalence of high myopia&#xD;
      is estimated to rise from 2.7% of the world population in 2010 to 9.8% of the world&#xD;
      population in 2050. High myopia is characterized by axial length elongation, and consequent&#xD;
      stretching of the posterior eye wall (thin retina and choroid). There are many complications&#xD;
      of high myopia such as posterior staphyloma, lacquer cracks and myopic choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization. Normal labour may cause the ocular complication in pregnant women with&#xD;
      high myopia, such as macular hemorrhage. Therefore, the caesarean section with epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia is recommended. Moreover, there is no standard screening guideline for pregnant&#xD;
      women with high myopia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are few studies of posterior ocular changes during pregnancy. A recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      showed that the choroidal thickness and retinal vascular density were increased during&#xD;
      pregnancy especially in the 3rd trimester. From the literature review, there is only one&#xD;
      publication of physiologic ocular changes during pregnancy in high myopia. Chen et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that the choroidal thickness was increased significantly in the 3rd trimester.&#xD;
      However, the changes of retinal vascular density in pregnant women with high myopia have&#xD;
      never been studied before.&#xD;
