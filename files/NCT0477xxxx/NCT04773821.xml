  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of localized prostate cancer remains controversial because of a risk of over&#xD;
      diagnosis and over treatment. Focal therapy represents an approach to improve the therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio of prostate cancer treatments. Focal therapy has been developed as minimally invasive&#xD;
      procedure with the aim of providing equivalent oncological safety, reduced toxicity and&#xD;
      improved functional outcomes. Multiparametric (mp) MRI Imaging may provide a reliable mean of&#xD;
      monitoring for disease recurrence, and has been suggested as the most accurate imaging tool&#xD;
      currently available for systematic detection of recurrence, pre-biopsy and preoperative&#xD;
      mapping for an eventual salvage therapy. However, question about the performance of MRI and&#xD;
      targeted biopsy in monitoring and defining successful therapy and follow up has been poorly&#xD;
      evaluated. Modalities (standard biopsy, ablation zone biopsy vs targeted biopsy) and number&#xD;
      of biopsies to be performed, depending on the results of MRI, remains unanswered due to a&#xD;
      lack of available data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the combination of MpMRI of the prostate with subsequent targeted biopsy&#xD;
      (TB) may improve detection of prostate cancer and may therefore improve the follow-up of men&#xD;
      after focal therapy (FT) to better identify patients that need a salvage treatment and when.&#xD;

      This trial is a multi-centric prospective and diagnostic study, comparative, not randomised.&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the value of Multiparametric MRI (MpMRI) and targeted&#xD;
      biopsy in detecting recurrence after focal treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). The secondary&#xD;
      objectives (all energy and according to the energy used) are: to describe the specific&#xD;
      changes in prostate morphology after focal therapy ( normal presentation and recurrence in&#xD;
      the treated and in the non-treated zone, all energy and according to the energy used),to&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of MpMRI in the detection of residual PCa, in the treated zone, in the&#xD;
      whole gland, to evaluate the performance of targeted biopsy and non targeted biopsy for the&#xD;
      detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to evaluate the combination of targeted biopsy and&#xD;
      non targeted biopsy for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to assess the number and&#xD;
      amount of unnecessary non targeted biopsies taken during the follow up of men in focal&#xD;
      therapy, to describe the morbidity of prostate non-targeted and targeted biopsy (number and&#xD;
      severity of biopsy complications) for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of recurrence detection on patient management (number and type of salvage&#xD;
      treatment),to evaluate the post treatment PSA levels including density, PSA nadir, and its&#xD;
      goal in detection recurrence, to examine failures in order to learn potential future&#xD;
      predictors of failure (all energy and according to the energy used, the initial location of&#xD;
      the target on MRI and it's Gleason grade).The first objective of ancillary study is a central&#xD;
      MRI lecture with 3 experts which will allow, performance and inter-observer reproducibility,&#xD;
      to evaluate the percentage of cases that will be scored with agreement for concordant biopsy&#xD;
      decision by the central radiology team and the site radiologist, to determine on the&#xD;
      pre-treatment MRI predictive criteria of success or failure for focal therapy according of&#xD;
      the energy used and to propose recommendations for MRI interpretation after FT. The second&#xD;
      objective of ancillary study is a central pathology reading to evaluate the percentage of&#xD;
      cases that will be scored with agreement on the Gleason score by the central pathologists and&#xD;
      the site pathologist and to propose recommendations for histology interpretation post focal&#xD;
      therapy. The study population will consist of men with low and intermediate risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer (ISUP 1 and 2) who has already chosen to undergo focal treatment, and be willing and&#xD;
      able to undergo MpMRI with subsequent prostate biopsies, as indicated. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at baseline by an urologist in one of urology units listed as investigation center.&#xD;
      The focal treatment should take place no later than 3 months after inclusion visit. The&#xD;
      follow-up visits will be planned at 3 month,6 month,12 and 13 months after focal treatment,&#xD;
      consistently with patient usual care. In this study, all patients will have a MpMRI and MpMRI&#xD;
      targeted biopsy in the presence of a lesion suggestive of recurrence.The statistical analysis&#xD;
      is to compare the positive biopsy rate between non targeted and targeted in subject as his&#xD;
      own control (with a 12-month relapse rate of 30%) assuming 18.25% positive with the standard&#xD;
      method (H0) and 26.25% with the targeted method (H1) and 15% of discordant pairs. By&#xD;
      simulation with a MacNemar test, with a bilateral alpha risk of 5% and power of 90% we need&#xD;
      260 subjects.&#xD;
