  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyze the efficacy of a mobile health application (app) designed&#xD;
      to increase mental health literacy, help seeking attitudes and reduce stigma associated with&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. A randomized controlled trial with crossover design will be&#xD;
      carried out in non-clinical population to assess pre-post changes in levels mental health&#xD;
      literacy, help seeking attitudes and stigma through app completion (an estimation of 10&#xD;
      days). Moreover, the stability of the changes will be tested at 3 and 6 months. Participants&#xD;
      from community will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: undertaking immediate-use&#xD;
      or delayed use. We hypothesized that after using the app, participants will have a greater&#xD;
      knowledge about obsessive-compulsive disorder, will be more prone to ask for help in case of&#xD;
      showing OCD symptoms, and will show lower stigma attitudes and social distance.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stigmatizing attitudes are a problem associated to mental disorders. In obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      disorder (OCD) stigma has been associated to shame, guilty and delay asking for help. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is to analyze the efficacy of a mobile health application (app) designed to&#xD;
      increase mental health literacy, help seeking attitudes and reduce stigma associated with&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. The app has been named ESTOCMA. It consists in a game in which&#xD;
      participants are asked to fight against the OCD stigma monster through ten missions.&#xD;
      Participants have to liberate 10 characters who are prisoners of EsTOCma monster. A&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with crossover design will be carried out in non-clinical&#xD;
      population to assess pre-post changes in levels mental health literacy, help seeking&#xD;
      attitudes and stigma through app completion (an estimation of 10 days), and after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months (follow up). Participants from community will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      conditions: undertaking immediate-use or delayed use. All participants will be requested to&#xD;
      complete a set of questionnaires at baseline (T1), after completion of the app (T2), 3 months&#xD;
      (T3) and 6 months (T4) from baseline. Participants from immediate-use will be asked to use&#xD;
      the app during 10 days between T1 and T2. Participants from delayed used condition, will use&#xD;
      the app after T2 evaluation, and will have an extra evaluation after 15 days (T2.1).&#xD;

    <description>Score change in mental health literacy (MHL) from baseline to app completion (estimation of 10 days), and 3 and 6 months after app completion. MHL will be assessed through a self-report questionnaire developed ad hoc to assess general OCD knowledge and OCD identification. It is composed by 12 items with different alternatives. Correct answers will be computed. Higher score indicates higher number of correct answers, that is, higher OCD knowledge and identification.</description>

    <description>Score change in stigma from baseline to app completion (estimation of 10 days), and 3 and 6 months app completion. Stigma will be assessed by the Spanish Mental Illness Stigma Attribution Questionnaire. It is composed by 27 items and a Likert scale from 1 to 9. Higher scores indicate higher stigmatizing attitudes.</description>

    <description>Score change in social distance from baseline to app completion (estimation of 10 days), and 3 and 6 months after app completion. Social distance will be measured through a self-report questionnaire: Social Distance Scale, 7 items, Likert scale from 0 to 3. Higher scores, higher social distance.</description>

    <description>Score change in attitudes toward seeking help from baseline to app completion (estimation of 10 days), and 3 and 6 months after app completion. It will be assessed with a self-report questionnaire assessing intention of seeking from formal/ informal sources of help: the General Help Seeking Questionnaire. It is composed by 7 items with a Likert scale from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate higher intentions of asking for help except in item 7 (reversed score).</description>
