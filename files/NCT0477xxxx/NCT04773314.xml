  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To confirm and consider the occurrence of important identified risks described in the&#xD;
      Japanese Pharmaceutical Risk Management Plan (J-RMP) under conditions used in routine medical&#xD;
      practice. The safety specification include: uterine hypercontractions and associated foetal&#xD;
      distress, uterine rupture, cervical laceration, amniotic fluid embolism, and foetal distress.&#xD;
