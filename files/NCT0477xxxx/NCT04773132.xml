  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is commonly described as a consequence of excess calorie intake. Conventionally, the&#xD;
      physiological variables that have been of extensive interest are food intake and energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Despite decades of research on factors influencing intake and expenditure, to&#xD;
      date, no compelling theory has been promulgated to explain why certain humans are more&#xD;
      susceptible to weight gain than others. The investigators hypothesize that the measure of an&#xD;
      individual's fraction of energy mobilized or deposited as protein (P-ratio), contributes&#xD;
      towards an obese morphology and may essentially form a novel approach in understanding the&#xD;
      etiology, management and treatment of obesity. In addition, there is a general perception&#xD;
      that the consumption of sugar sweetened foods and beverages are one of the major causes of&#xD;
      obesity. This study aims to understand metabolic flexibility and the glycemic index of diets&#xD;
      in the etiology of obesity. Individual metabolic flexibility may be the key factor that&#xD;
      predisposes an individual to obesity. This study is carried out to determine the P-ratio in&#xD;
      human subjects.&#xD;

      Obesity is commonly described as a consequence of excess calorie intake. Conventionally, the&#xD;
      physiological variables that have been of extensive interest are food intake and energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Despite decades of research on factors influencing intake and expenditure, to&#xD;
      date, no compelling theory has been promulgated to explain why certain humans are more&#xD;
      susceptible to weight gain than others. The investigators believe that a measure of an&#xD;
      individual's metabolic flexibility towards an obese morphology is essential and forms a novel&#xD;
      approach in understanding the etiology, management and treatment of obesity. Payne and&#xD;
      Dugdale developed a simple model of energy balance, based on dividing the human body into&#xD;
      four compartments, namely &quot;fast&quot; lean tissue (protein), &quot;slow&quot; lean tissue (protein),&#xD;
      structural fat, and tissue fat. Notionally, these are considered to act as four separate&#xD;
      compartments which interconnect with each other. Body weight is thus simply the sum of the&#xD;
      four weights, and metabolic rate is the sum of the separate compartment rates. Any energy&#xD;
      deficit in the &quot;balancing compartment&quot; is met by withdrawing tissues from the neighboring fat&#xD;
      and lean (muscle) compartments in a proportion which is fixed for any individual. The&#xD;
      observed human variability in both the susceptibility to gain weight or to lose weight&#xD;
      efficiently on a calorie surplus or restricted diet is thus afforded by using the model&#xD;
      developed by Payne and Dugdale for energy balance. P-ratio is calculated on the assumption&#xD;
      that body protein is 16% nitrogen and has a metabolizable energy value of 16.7 kJ/g. Thus&#xD;
      P-ratio can be calculated as: P- ratio= urinary nitrogen excretion x 6.25 x 16.7 / total&#xD;
      energy expenditure. The regulatory control of energy-partitioning between protein and fat is&#xD;
      highly variable between individuals, but constant within the same subject. It is this&#xD;
      variability in tissue partitioning between lean (protein) and fat that is central to the&#xD;
      regulation of body weight. This implies that for a given individual, there is a fixed&#xD;
      partitioning of energy between lean (protein) and fat tissue when excess calories are&#xD;
      consumed. Using the results of the classical study of human semi-starvation by Keys et al,&#xD;
      Dugdale and Payne calculated the individual pattern of tissue mobilization (P-ratio) in these&#xD;
      subjects. The P-ratio ranged from 0.03 to 0.60. On the basis of these data, they classified&#xD;
      individuals into &quot;metabolically lean&quot; and &quot;metabolically fat&quot;. A P-ratio of 0.03 means&#xD;
      approximately 3% of the energy loss from this subject's body tissues was derived from protein&#xD;
      catabolism and 97% from fat. Thus during excess calorie consumption, 3% of the calories will&#xD;
      be deposited as protein and 97% as fat (&quot;metabolically fat&quot;). Similarly a subject with a&#xD;
      P-ratio of 0.60 will deposit 60% calories as protein and only 40% as fat (&quot;metabolically&#xD;
      lean&quot;). This stratification of &quot;metabolic type&quot; is a novel approach in obesity research,&#xD;
      treatment and its management. The current method for the determination of P-ratio is based on&#xD;
      subjects undergoing total starvation/fasting, e.g. complete food restriction, ad libitum&#xD;
      water intake. This is a highly impractical approach. The investigator's proposal is to&#xD;
      develop a more convenient and practical methodology to determine the P-ratio. An individual's&#xD;
      Basal Metabolic Rate after a 10 hour overnight fast will approximate the denominator of the&#xD;
      P-ratio. Henry et al reported a quantitative relationship between a fasting urine nitrogen&#xD;
      loss (FUNL) and obligatory urinary nitrogen loss (OUNL), the ratio FUNL: OUNL remained close&#xD;
      to 1.5. OUNL can be measured in urine when a subject is fed a protein free diet. With these&#xD;
      two measures, the P-ratio of an individual can be estimated. OUNL is the protein lost in the&#xD;
      urine when fed a zero or non-protein diet and fasting urinary loss is the nitrogen lost&#xD;
      during starvation/ fasting (FUNL). The investigator's proposed study will be the first&#xD;
      real-time study that will utilize the obligatory urine nitrogen loss and BMR to quantitate&#xD;
      human P-ratio.&#xD;
