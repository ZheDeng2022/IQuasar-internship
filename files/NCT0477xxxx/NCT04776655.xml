      This study is a prospective, randomized phase III, to evaluate if in patients with mCRC&#xD;
      RAS/BRAF wild type on tumor tissue and RAS mutations on liquid biopsy, treating in first line&#xD;
      with antibody anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) is superior in terms of PFS&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment with antibody anti-EGFR (cetuximab) plus FOLFIRI, and then in&#xD;
      patients RAS/BRAF wild type on tumor tissue who develop RAS mutations on liquid biopsy after&#xD;
      the beginning of the first line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI, in the absence of a&#xD;
      clinical or radiological progression disease, to anticipate a change of treatment with&#xD;
      bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI further impacts on the PFS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized phase III study, first of all we aim to evaluate if in&#xD;
      patients with mCRC RAS/BRAF wild type on tumor tissue and RAS mutations on liquid biopsy,&#xD;
      treating in first line with antibody anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) is&#xD;
      superior in terms of PFS compared to standard treatment with antibody anti-EGFR (cetuximab)&#xD;
      plus FOLFIRI, and then in patients RAS/BRAF wild type on tumor tissue who develop RAS&#xD;
      mutations on liquid biopsy after the beginning of the first line treatment with cetuximab&#xD;
      plus FOLFIRI, in the absence of a clinical or radiological progression disease, to anticipate&#xD;
      a change of treatment with bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI further impacts on the PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients RAS mut at first liquid biopsy will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio, to receive&#xD;
      FOLFIRI plus cetuximab or FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with RAS wt at first biopsy will be treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab up to 8&#xD;
      cycles outside the protocol. Patients not progressed after 4 months (8 cycles of treatment)&#xD;
      will undergo to a second liquid biopsy. In case of mutation of RAS, the patients will be&#xD;
      randomized with a 1:1 ratio to continue cetuximab or to switch to bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, other conditions compromise subject safety or patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be analyzed for mutations of KRAS, NRAS and in BRAF V600 using the Idylla&#xD;
      system (Biocartis). Samples will be retrospectively analysed by next generation sequencing&#xD;
      using the Oncomine Pan-Cancer Cell-free Assay, which assesses genetic alterations in 52&#xD;
      driver genes, in order to evaluate the possible correlation of tumor heterogeneity with&#xD;
      patients' outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we could identify the best monoclonal antibody treatment in mCRC RAS/BRAF&#xD;
      wild type on tumor tissue and RAS mutated on liquid biopsy and if liquid biopsy can be used&#xD;
      in clinical practice as an integrated analysis to mutational tissue evaluation, to identify&#xD;
      RAS mutations not detected on tissue.&#xD;
