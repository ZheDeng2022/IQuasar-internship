  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When hearing-impaired listeners are properly aided with a hearing aid (HA) or cochlear&#xD;
      implant (CI), they are often able to comfortably maintain a conversation in quiet&#xD;
      environments. However, in group environments, such as a large family dinner, restaurant, or&#xD;
      other environment where multiple people are talking simultaneously, hearing-impaired&#xD;
      listeners have great difficulty participating in conversations and frequently withdraw or&#xD;
      avoid the situation. As such, it would be highly beneficial to implement an algorithm into&#xD;
      HAs or CIs to remove background talkers (&quot;babble&quot;) from the signal to reduce listening effort&#xD;
      for the hearing-impaired listener and allow them to converse as if they were in a quiet&#xD;
      environment. Although HAs and CIs frequently incorporate noise reduction algorithms, these&#xD;
      algorithms are not effective when the background is babble. The problem of removing babble&#xD;
      involves segregating speech from speech. Hence, the spectral properties of the signal and&#xD;
      noise are extremely similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these challenges, we developed an algorithm to remove background babble. In the&#xD;
      following study will test the ability of cochlear implant users to understand speech with&#xD;
      background babble noise using our noise reduction algorithm or no noise reduction algorithm.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CI users will be able to understand significantly more speech in babble&#xD;
      noise when using our algorithm.&#xD;
