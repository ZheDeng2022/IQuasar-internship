      The PLAY 2 Study is the continuation of an R21 pilot PLAY study. In the R21, we tested the&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy of three early childhood education setting-&#xD;
      based, multi-level interventions to promote preschoolers' physical activity using wearable&#xD;
      technology and additional behavior change techniques to engage educators and parents. We have&#xD;
      selected one of these 3 as the main intervention for the R33 portion of the grant. The&#xD;
      intervention will contain components of teacher wellness, parent engagement, and activity&#xD;
      level monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity in early childhood is important for numerous aspects of children's health&#xD;
      and development. Preschoolers are thought to be very active but previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that they are sedentary for the majority of time and not getting adequate opportunities to&#xD;
      engage in active play. Experts have recommended strategies to promote physical activity in&#xD;
      early learning settings and to involve parents in efforts to promote active living from a&#xD;
      young age. Through early learning settings, we may be able to change behaviors in large&#xD;
      groups of children and particularly benefit more vulnerable children who have fewer&#xD;
      opportunities for outdoor play and physical activity at home or in their neighborhoods.&#xD;
      However, meaningful engagement from families is also important and research suggests that&#xD;
      there is gap in communication and perhaps alignment between educators and parents on the&#xD;
      topic of preschoolers' physical activity. This research uses wearable technology to monitor&#xD;
      physical activity in children, motivate parents and educators to help create active play&#xD;
      opportunities, and create a platform for communication and shared accountability about this&#xD;
      important health behavior. We will focus particularly on children from lower income&#xD;
      backgrounds who suffer from disparities in both health and educational outcomes. Our primary&#xD;
      outcome of interest is accelerometer measured physical activity. We will also explore how&#xD;
      changes in preschooler's physical activity relate to behavioral indicators, which are topics&#xD;
      of great significance to early childhood educators, policy makers and parents.&#xD;
