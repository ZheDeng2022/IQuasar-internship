  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of resistive blanket warming to&#xD;
      forced air warming in maintaining body temperature in participants undergoing renal&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve two arms: a resistive blanket warming system arm and a forced air&#xD;
      warming system arm. Both devices will be set to warm the participant at a standard 41 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius when the participant is to be rewarmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the forced air warming system (FAWS) will be placed on the (resistive&#xD;
      blanket warming system (RBWS), with the participant laying on top of the forced air warming&#xD;
      system. The arm components will be wrapped around the participant's arms to assist with&#xD;
      patient positioning for surgery. Both the forced air and resistive blanket warming systems&#xD;
      will be attached to their respective heating units before the participant is brought to the&#xD;
      OR and transferred to the operating room table. After the needed standard monitors for&#xD;
      surgery have been placed, general anesthesia will be induced and maintained with&#xD;
      participant's hemodynamics and other vitals maintained per standard care (no additional&#xD;
      measurements beyond standard of care which is recorded in EPIC). The certified registered&#xD;
      nurse anesthetists (CRNA) will be involved in the placement of the blankets. Operating Room&#xD;
      Nurse managers and CRNA's will be informed by research team regarding participant's&#xD;
      involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's core temperature will be measured with a nasopharyngeal temperature probe.&#xD;
      Vital signs, including continuous blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide, will be monitored and recorded in Epic as is routine with all&#xD;
      anesthetics performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard anesthetic care of the participant will occur for the duration of the surgery. The&#xD;
      participant will be randomized to either the FAWS or RBWS before arrival to the operating&#xD;
      room. The participant's temperature will be monitored and recorded for the duration of&#xD;
      surgery with the selected warming system. The primary outcome variable is the nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      temperature as recorded at the end of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature measurement in the PACU will be standardized with skin temperature probes that&#xD;
      will be placed on the forehead prior to leaving the operating room.&#xD;

    <description>Outcome is reported as the Area Under Curve (AUC) of temperature vs time curve during hypothermia (core temperature less than 36 degrees Celcius) during the duration of surgery. Unit of measure is degrees Celsius per minute.&#xD;
Time during surgery spent under 36 degrees Celsius through comparison of nasopharyngeal temperature, which is measured by placing a nasopharyngeal temperature probe 10 to 20 cm into the nare, between forced air warming system (FAWS) and resistive blanket warming system (RBWS).</description>

    <description>The forced air warming system has a heater unit that blows air through a conduit to an &quot;air blanket&quot; that inflates with forced air that circulates throughout the blanket, and exits through tiny perforations on the patient-side of that blanket. The heat primarily warms the subject through convective means. As the warmed air escapes through the perforations in the blanket, it creates an environment of continuously circulating warm air that is in contact with the skin.</description>

    <description>This blanket is equivalent to an operating-room-safe electric blanket. Through a power cord, a separate power source powers a semiconductor layer within the resistive blanket to generate heat. The heat primarily warms the subject by conductive warming through direct skin contact, and, secondarily, by warming the air around the participant in areas where there is no direct skin contact.</description>
