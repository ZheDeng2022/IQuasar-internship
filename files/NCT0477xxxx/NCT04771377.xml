  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is considered a chronic disease that increases the risk of developing diseases that&#xD;
      reduce life expectancy. The treatment of obesity is complex. However, treatments based&#xD;
      exclusively on dietary changes have not shown long-term efficacy especially in people with&#xD;
      severe obesity. In contrast, in this group of people bariatric surgery (BS) has shown good&#xD;
      long-term results in weight loss and maintenance. These changes are accompanied by&#xD;
      significant improvements in health, improved quality of life, and reduced mortality. However,&#xD;
      the changes in the digestive system created by BS and the high level of dietary restriction,&#xD;
      affect the nutritional status and require a proper supplementation of vitamins and minerals&#xD;
      during the follow-up. Intense weight loss during the first few months, coupled with an&#xD;
      insufficient amount of protein in the diet, can lead to a loss of muscle mass. Excessive&#xD;
      muscle loss during the short-term period can lead to functional repercussions (decreased&#xD;
      strength and physical function) and reduced calories that the body burns daily. Naturally,&#xD;
      this is especially important in people suffering from sarcopenia before BS, and it occurs&#xD;
      more frequently in postmenopausal women. Despite this is known, specific protein intake&#xD;
      recommendations after BS have not yet been defined based on scientific evidence. In this&#xD;
      context, the first part of our proposal will assess the effect of two levels of protein&#xD;
      supplementation: standard (S-PS) versus high (H-PS) on changes in a) body composition, b)&#xD;
      energy expenditure, c) metabolic flexibility d) the physical condition during weight loss&#xD;
      that follows BS. In addition, in patients with H-PS, the added effect of a physical exercise&#xD;
      program, carried out with a personal trainer (professional of sports medicine trainer)&#xD;
      virtually, will be evaluated. Protein supplementation and the virtual exercise program will&#xD;
      be done during the 4 months following BS, and the results will be studied at 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
      months. Once the results have been defined, it is essential to transfer the recommendations&#xD;
      to the real world. In a second part, and to achieve knowledge transfer to clinical practice,&#xD;
      the investigators will explore the key elements that influence patient experience (XPA).&#xD;

      energy expenditure, c) metabolic flexibility d) the physical condition during weight loss&#xD;

      exercise program, carried out with a personal trainer (professional of sports medicine&#xD;

      8, and 12 months. Once the results have been defined, it is essential to transfer the&#xD;
      recommendations to the real world. In a second part, and to achieve knowledge transfer to&#xD;
      clinical practice, the investigators will explore the key elements that influence patient&#xD;
      experience (XPA). The investigators will define indicators to assess it, especially those&#xD;
      that are related to adherence to nutritional recommendations and to changes in lifestyle. The&#xD;
      investigators are currently in the recruitment phase of the study. I have studied the&#xD;
      necessary elements, ambitions and included the components that will help to define the&#xD;
      dietary and lifestyle recommendations for our population. Aim to facilitate and define the&#xD;
      performance of the professionals providing realistic, based on the XPA and in this way to&#xD;
      improve the impact of the CO on health and quality of life. This is an ambitious and&#xD;
      necessary study and includes all the component that will help define dietary and lifestyle&#xD;
      recommendations for our population. It aims to facilitate and define the action of&#xD;
      professionals provides realistic tools, based on XPA and thus improve the impact of BS on&#xD;
      health and quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        women ≥45 years of age who meet CB criteria: Body mass index (BMI) ≥40.0 kg / m2 or between&#xD;
        35.0 and 39.9 kg / m2 with comorbidities (metabolic diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases),&#xD;
        sedentary lack of regular physical activity: &lt;30 minutes / day and &lt;3 days / week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of severe joint disease, severe liver disease, history of cardiovascular&#xD;
             event or known heart disease, renal failure (defined as a FG &lt;30 ml / min), type 1 or&#xD;
             type 2 diabetes with HbA1c&gt; 10%, being treated with drugs that may affect body&#xD;
             composition (such as corticosteroids), exercise muscle strength-endurance regularly&#xD;
             (more than 2 times / week), have previously undergone obesity surgery.&#xD;

    </criteria>
    <gender>Female</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>The study will only include women. The difference in muscle mass and strength justifies the need for this limitation. In addition, women account for 80% of CB cases in our Hospital and in the vast majority of literature series. Given that muscle mass loss and risk of sarcopenia are typical of older adults, our study (focused on the prevention and / or delay of the onset of sarcopenia) targets women over the age of 45 a first CB in our center. Although the results of this study will only be valid for this group, the resulting nutritional and lifestyle recommendations will be relevant as women are the majority in the use of CB. Addressing this goal in men would require a different protocol.</gender_description>
