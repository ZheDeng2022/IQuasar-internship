  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s scan helps identify&#xD;
      changes in the tumor during radiation and chemotherapy treatment in patients with high grade&#xD;
      glioma. Additional MRIs scan may help researchers to see changes in the status of the&#xD;
      disease. Seeing these changes may result in changes to the treatment plan.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the radiation dosimetric coverage of the surgical cavity and any residual tumor&#xD;
      when the immediate post-operative MRI is used versus (vs.) newly acquired MRI prior to&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the cumulative dosimetric differences for the target volume and normal&#xD;
      structures between an adaptive radiotherapy approach based on serial MRI vs. the&#xD;
      conventionally delivered radiotherapy plan using the target and normal structure volumes from&#xD;
      the initial MRI simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report the incidence of tumor progression between surgery and radiation therapy and&#xD;
      factors related to higher risk of tumor progression (e.g. Time interval between surgery and&#xD;
      radiation, extent of surgery, molecular characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the relationship between the delivered dosimetry and patterns of failure and&#xD;
      changes in neurocognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the relationship between voxel-wise quantitative changes on multiparametric&#xD;
      MRI including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA), relative&#xD;
      cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional volume of the extravascular, extracellular space&#xD;
      (ve) and Ktrans (transfer constant that characterizes the diffusive transport of&#xD;
      low-molecular weight gadolinium across the capillary endothelium) with patterns of failure&#xD;
      and changes in neurocognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if early post-operative progression is associated with worse overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the difference in reported pseudoprogression at first follow-up after&#xD;
      completing radiation when the baseline MRI is the immediate post-op MRI vs. newly acquired&#xD;
      MRI prior to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare image co-registration accuracy between the radiation planning computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) images and MRI for the immediate post-op MRI vs. newly acquired MRI prior to&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the relationship between standard clinical neurocognitive function (NCF) and&#xD;
      iPad based NCF (iNCF) test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo MRI with and without contrast immediately before radiotherapy (for radiation&#xD;
      planning) and at mid treatment (week 3). Patients also undergo MRI without contrast on weeks&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 of radiotherapy. Patients may also undergo neurocognitive function testing&#xD;
      over 70 minutes before treatment, at the end of each week of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after completion of treatment.&#xD;
