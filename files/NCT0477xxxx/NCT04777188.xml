      Objective to investigate the left ventricular (LV) systolic function by speckle tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography before and after percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (named Liwen Procedure) is a safe&#xD;
      and effective treatment approach for HOCM and results in sustained improvement in exercise&#xD;
      capacity and persistent in reducing left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. However,&#xD;
      the systolic function of the myocardial after Liwen procedure in HOCM patients is not well&#xD;
      exploration and research. Strain evaluation using speckle tracking echocardiography is an&#xD;
      excellent tool for assessing regional and global LV functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aimed to characterize regional and global strain using&#xD;
      speckle tracking echocardiography to assess LV radial, circumferential and longitudinal&#xD;
      systolic myocardial function in patients with HOCM before and after Liwen procedure.&#xD;

    <description>The left ventricular(LV) systolic function was analyzed by Tomtec Workstation with related software. LV was automatically divided into 16 segments using standard segmentation. The following LV parameters were automatically calculated by the software. The 3D strain indexes derived included ,LV peak systolic global longitudinal strain (GLS,percent), LV peak systolic global radial strain (GRS,percent), LV peak systolic global circumferential strain (GCS,percent)</description>

    <description>Under transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) guidance, the puncture site is positioned at the apex. A guiding line is applied along the septal long axis and the radiofrequency ablation electrode needle(17G, Cool-tip™ RF Ablation System and Switching Controller;Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) pierced towards the hypertrophic anterior interventricular septum (AIVS) 8-10 mm from the subaortic valve. Each ablation lasts for up to 12 min and the ablation power is gradually increased from 30-40W. Then, the ablation needle is withdrawn 10 mm to prepare for the next application. Overall, 3-4 applications are performed in each patient. The ablation creates an area of thermal coagulative myocardial necrosis that appears as a hyperechogenic reflection detected by TTE. If deemed necessary, we repeat the procedure at the posterior interventricular septum (PIVS).</description>
