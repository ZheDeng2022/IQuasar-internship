      The purpose of this randomized controlled pilot study is to test whether an in-hospital&#xD;
      nurse-led smoking cessation intervention increases the refferal rate to healty life-centers&#xD;
      in the municipalities. We will also describe the proportion who succeed in quitting smoking&#xD;
      between the intervention group and the control group and obtain new knowledge about the&#xD;
      patient and system factors of importance for participation to healty life-centers and for&#xD;
      successful and unsuccessful smoking cessation.&#xD;
