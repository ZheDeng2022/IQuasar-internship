  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a multispecies probiotic on the&#xD;
      function of the vagal nerve in patients with major depression and healthy participants in a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all participants giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened for eligibility for study entry and will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner to receive either a multistrain probiotic or a placebo for 3 months. At&#xD;
      entry, 1 week after inclusion, 4 weeks after inclusion and 3 months (end of study) vagal&#xD;
      activity will be measured using a 24hr electrocardiogram.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at study entry, after 7 days, after 4 weeks and after 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is used to rate sleep quality. It includes a scoring key for calculating a patient's seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a &quot;global&quot; score that can range from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality.</description>

Secure = high scores on Close and Depend subscales, low score on Anxiety subscale&#xD;
Anxious = high score on Anxiety subscale, moderate scores on Close and Depend subscales&#xD;
Avoidant = low scores on Close, Depend, and Anxiety subscales</description>
