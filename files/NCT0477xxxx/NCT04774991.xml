  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized trial aims to compare the impact of different delivery approaches to&#xD;
      azithromycin distribution on coverage, costs, and feasibility outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that door-to-door delivery will have higher coverage and costs and similar&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability compared to fixed-point delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Azithromycin distribution has been shown to reduce mortality in children 1-59 months. This&#xD;
      trial aims to contribute evidence on viable approaches to implementation as high mortality&#xD;
      countries consider this intervention to improve child survival. From a pool of eligible rural&#xD;
      and peri-urban communities in the Dosso Region in Niger, 80 will be randomly selected and&#xD;
      randomized to receive door-to-door or fixed-point delivery of a single dose of azithromycin&#xD;
      distribution to children 1-59 months of age via community health workers. Treatment coverage,&#xD;
      costs and cost-effectiveness, and feasibility and acceptability will be compared by arm.&#xD;
