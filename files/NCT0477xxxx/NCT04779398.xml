    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate in healthy adults 18-65 years of age the association of&#xD;
      electronic device blue light exposure and macular pigment optical density (MPOD) considering&#xD;
      usual dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin (L/Z) as confirmed by serum lutein and&#xD;
      zeaxanthin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised in healthy adults 18-65 years of age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Higher usual daily electronic device blue light exposure will be negatively correlated&#xD;
           with MPOD value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual dietary intake of L/Z will be positively correlated with MPOD value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. L/Z concentration will be positively correlated with MPOD value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Usual dietary intake of L/Z will be positively correlated with plasma L/Z&#xD;
           concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Higher usual intake of L/Z will mitigate the effect of higher electronic device exposure&#xD;
           on MPOD value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exponential uptake of modern technology over the last 30 years (computers) and 10 years&#xD;
      (smartphones) has resulted in remarkable increase in artificial blue light exposure amongst&#xD;
      all age groups. This suggests the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) could&#xD;
      be increasing significantly in the population in the years to come. It is unknown whether the&#xD;
      extent of daily blue light exposure influences macular pigment optical density (MPOD) in&#xD;
      young to middle age adults. Stringham et al. (2017) showed that, in 18-25 year old healthy&#xD;
      adults, exposed to electronic devices over 6 hours daily, MPOD value and visual performance&#xD;
      significantly improved after 6 months of lutein/zeaxanthin/meso-zeaxanthin supplementation.&#xD;
      The findings of this project may inform on the risks of high exposure to electronic screens&#xD;
      and the need to address with preventive measures the potential decline in MPOD and increased&#xD;
      risk of AMD. The impact of usual dietary intake of macular xanthophylls on circulating&#xD;
      concentrations and MPOD will be investigated. Findings may inform guidelines on recommended&#xD;
      daily intake of these food constituents either through diet or supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Confidentiality of Data Collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent is sought for extended use of the collected data which means it may be used in future&#xD;
      research. For example, in the future if more sensitive methods for detecting L/Z, or other&#xD;
      macular pigments become available, stored blood samples may be re-analysed. Furthermore, data&#xD;
      may be used for subsequent statistical analysis and statistical analysis may be published in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals, however no identifiable personal details will be published or used.&#xD;
      Any personal information, such as full name and date of birth will remain confidential to&#xD;
      only the study investigators at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hard copy personal information and measures taken as part of the study protocol will be&#xD;
      stored in locked filing cabinets when not in use, and will only be accessible to approved&#xD;
      study investigators. Any electronic data collected for the study will be stored using the UQ&#xD;
      Research Data Management system. Data will be de-identified through the use of participant ID&#xD;
      numbers allocated at enrolment. Re-identification of participant information will only be&#xD;
      accessible by study investigators. At the conclusion of the study, participant hard copy&#xD;
      files and trial documents are kept in locked filing cabinets for a period of 15 years. After&#xD;
      this time, records will be disposed of by a certified record destruction, such as shredding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for research purposes, specifically for the measurement of&#xD;
      plasma lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations. Collected samples will be stored as per the&#xD;
      extended consent sought, held for up to 15 years. After this time, they will be destroyed via&#xD;
      incineration. Collected plasma samples will only be identifiable via the participant study&#xD;
      number allocated at enrolment. All publicly shared data or data used in publications will be&#xD;
      in a non-identifiable form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recorded and maintained for this trial will be controlled in accordance with the&#xD;
      national Privacy Principles and Privacy Act 1988.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed on the basis of a MPOD coefficient of variation of&#xD;
      0.187 optical density units (ODU) measured in a sample of 5581 adults using the Macular&#xD;
      Pigment Screener II (18). A minimum of 105 participants was calculated using a two tailed,&#xD;
      random model, linear multiple regression with an alpha error probability: 0.05, power: 0.90,&#xD;
      number of predictors: 4. This also allows for a 20% drop out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be conducted using GraphPad Prism 8. Participants will be stratified by MPOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive statistics will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All data will be tested for normality of distribution using the D'Agostino-Pearson&#xD;
           normality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Based on the outcome of testing for normality of distribution, Spearman or Pearson's&#xD;
           correlations will be used to test for correlation between the following variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. MPOD and daily hours of electronic device use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. MPOD and usual dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin (L/Z).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. MPOD and serum L/Z concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Serum L/Z concentration and usual dietary intake of L/Z.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multiple linear regression will be used to test for correlation to MPOD with the&#xD;
           following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Daily hours of electronic device use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Usual dietary intake of L/Z.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
