  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesize that the combined use of (1) non-invasive biomarkers in&#xD;
      peripheral blood predicting anti-donor immunological activation or quiescence (2) interactive&#xD;
      and actionable data analytics delivered at the bedside will promote safe clinical follow-up&#xD;
      of kidney transplant patients with less need for invasive and induced risk surveillance by&#xD;
      allograft protocol biopsies to assess allograft rejection in clinically stable kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients. It is therefore proposed an European, multicenter, prospective&#xD;
      randomized comparing two strategies of follow-up: in the first, biopsies are guided by&#xD;
      biomarkers, in the second one, a routine biopsy is performed at M3. In both groups, a biopsy&#xD;
      is performed at M12 and whenever considered necessary by the clinician.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the ability of use of non-invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers to decrease the number of allograft biopsies during the first year after&#xD;
      transplantation. 300 new transplanted patients in the 7 clinical transplant sites will be&#xD;
      included in the prospective multicentre EU-TRAIN Impact study with centralized storage of&#xD;
      samples in CHUN (blood mRNA), ICS (blood cellular assays), Saint -Louis Hospital (blood&#xD;
      anti-HLA DSA, and non-HLA antibodies), INSERM (Biopsy mRNA). Recruitment of patients will&#xD;
      start on the day of transplantation (d-8 for transplantation from living donors) and&#xD;
      data/samples collected over the first year following transplantation. Realization of all the&#xD;
      acts for the research are representing the usual medical practice (Standard Of Care: SOC)&#xD;
      except six additional blood samples that will be collected and analyzed specifically for the&#xD;
      research and additional analysis done specifically for the research on half of one of the two&#xD;
      biopsy cores from the recipient. 3 additional blood samples from the living donor will also&#xD;
      be collected and analyzed specifically for the research (timepoint of the sampling: anytime&#xD;
      from 8 days to the day of transplant.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 12-month follow-up multicenter, randomized, biomarker strategy design trial, whereby kidney transplant patients will be randomized 1:1 at the time of transplantation in 2 study groups:&#xD;
Group I (&quot;routine group&quot;): Patients will follow a standard clinical follow-up based on kidney allograft function (serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria) and a surveillance allograft biopsies performed at 3 and 12 months after transplantation (M3 and M12).&#xD;
Group II (&quot;biomarker guided follow-up&quot;): Patients will follow a biomarker-guided strategy based on specific non-invasive biomarkers as defined in EUTRAIN-1 study on the basis of its detection and prediction capacities for rejection at M3 to decide whether a biopsy is performed. At M12 a routine biopsy is performed.&#xD;
In both groups, a biopsy can be performed up on clinical decision if needed.</intervention_model_description>
