  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Permanent hair dyes are commonly used in over the counter direct to consumer products and&#xD;
      within hair salons. Allergy, also known as contact dermatitis, to hair dye is a well known&#xD;
      phenomenon. Herein, we seek to decrease the risks of allergy to hair dyes by testing a novel&#xD;
      version of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) with less allergy potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with PPD sensitizations, it is important to find alternatives for dark hair&#xD;
      dyes. P-toluenediamine (PTD) and potentially also 2-methoxyethyl p-phenylenediamine (ME-PPD)&#xD;
      show cross-reactivity with PPD and therefore we want to prove that our new compounds PPD-6&#xD;
      and PPD-7 show no or significantly reduced cross-reactions with PPD and do not induce&#xD;
      relevant allergic reactions in patients with proven PPD sensitizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims for this study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1) To show that PPD 6 and PPD 7 have reduced or optimally no reaction in standard patch&#xD;
      tests in patients with proven allergy to PPD A2) To compare the sensitization pattern to&#xD;
      other possible commercially available alternatives for hair dye, such as ME-PPD and PTD A3)&#xD;
      To evaluate and rule out any possible non-specific irritant reaction of PPD-6 and PPD-7 in&#xD;
      these patch tests (i.e. confirm in-vitro safety profile in-vivo)&#xD;
