      During the last fifteen years, the landscape of AML diagnosis and therapeutical options has&#xD;
      markedly evolved. Refined genetic and prognostic characterizations, together with new drug&#xD;
      approvals and new allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures, have&#xD;
      increased patient journey diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I - At initial AML diagnosis, not all newly diagnosed patients are entering clinical trials.&#xD;
      A substantial proportion of them are treated with standard therapies outside of any trial. To&#xD;
      date, the standard approved frontline treatment options include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard intensive 3+7 (anthracycline + cytarabine) chemotherapy ± an approved FLT3&#xD;
           inhibitor (midostaurine, Rydapt®), according to different dose schedules in older versus&#xD;
           younger patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Combination of sequential gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg®) with 3+7&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Liposomal formulation of daunorubicin + cytarabine (CPX-351, Vyxeos®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Less intensive chemotherapy with azacytidine or low dose cytarabine (LDAC) in patients&#xD;
           considered as not eligible for the more intensive options above&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's choice is guided by AML and patient's characteristics, and by the approved&#xD;
      indications for each of these treatment options. This study will thus start including these&#xD;
      specific options. Further study amendments might be necessary in case of new standard&#xD;
      treatment definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II - Secondly, no specific salvage regimen has emerged as a standard in patients with primary&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed AML (R/R AML). R/R AML is thus an important field for investigational&#xD;
      new drugs (INDs) and precision medicine development. To date, the only IND approved to treat&#xD;
      R/R AML is gilteritinib for FLT3-mutated AML patients. The French agency ANSM also allow to&#xD;
      use GO for treating R/R AML patients in the frame of a RTU (Recommendation Temporaire&#xD;
      d'Utilisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;real life&quot;, because of the multiplicity of treatments used in these patients, some of&#xD;
      them being now quite efficient, it has become difficult to accurately describe the general&#xD;
      outcome of R/R AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III - Thirdly, allogeneic HSCT is no more considered at the ultimate and final goal of AML&#xD;
      therapy in all patients, as it was in the past. Transplant indications have been better&#xD;
      described and HSCT in now evaluated in the context of the whole treatment course, including&#xD;
      pre- and post-transplant therapy, as well as pre- and post-transplant minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, it is of utmost importance to document the various characteristics,&#xD;
      treatments and outcomes of patients treated in the real-life, outside of clinical trials, for&#xD;
      1) real-world treatment evaluation; 2) post-approval use of recently approved drugs; 3)&#xD;
      standardization and improvement of routine patient management; and 4) better disease&#xD;
      understanding.&#xD;
