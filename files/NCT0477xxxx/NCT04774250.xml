  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of zonisamide (ZNS) for the&#xD;
      treatment of noise-induced hearing loss in adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study is to test whether&#xD;
      zonisamide (ZNS) can treat noise-induced hearing loss in police officers on the range&#xD;
      following training and certifications sessions. Participants who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      requirements will be randomized to receive either ZNS 100 milligrams (mg) or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from the Akron Police Department, Summit County Police&#xD;
      Department, and other local surrounding police departments. Police officers will be offered&#xD;
      participation if they are training for firearm certification as part of their standard&#xD;
      occupational requirements. These are officers that would be recommended and/or required to&#xD;
      complete these trainings/certifications despite this investigation and this investigation&#xD;
      will have no influence on audiologic recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study expectations and potential risks, all individuals&#xD;
      providing written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The study will be &quot;masked&quot; or &quot;blinded&quot; in the sense that all the study participants and the study team members will be blinded to the assignment in the study groups. Only the pharmacist who will prepare the drug packets and will seal the envelopes, and the programmer not involved with the study who will produce the random treatment assignments and print the labels will know the order of treatments for any subject. An independent medical professional who is not part of the study team will complete the de-identification of the study drug, and a procedure and documentation log will be in place for quality assurance purposes. The ZNS and placebo capsules will look, taste, and smell the same.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measure is the proportion of officers with permanent threshold shift (PTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days (+/- 3 days) after training</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of officers with PTS is defined as the ratio of officer with ≥10 dB shift at 30 days (+/- 3 days) after training to the total number of officers enrolled in the study group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before shooting), within 5-10 minutes after shooting and 30 days (+/-3 days) after training</time_frame>
    <description>DPOAE amplitudes are measured to determine threshold shifts. A change is noted in DPOAE amplitude at any frequency that is significantly greater than the stability of each measurement (i.e., 95% confidence interval of each measurement do not overlap).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ultra-high frequency audiometry</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before shooting), within 5-10 minutes after shooting and 30 days (+/-3 days) after training</time_frame>
    <description>A change in ultra-high frequencies greater than 5 dB; to measure for both temporary and permanent high frequency audiometric changes. A significant change is defined for any frequency that is greater than 5 dB HL from baseline thresholds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrocochleography (ECochG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before shooting) and 30 days (+/-3 days) after training</time_frame>
    <description>To measure for changes in ECochG AP amplitude, latency and width.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Words In Noise Test (WIN)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (before shooting) and 30 days (+/-3 days) after training</time_frame>
    <description>The WIN test battery consists of 35 words that are presented in a background noise (speech babble) with varying degrees of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from 24 dB HL to 0 dB HL. The babble is set at 80 dB SPL, and the target word levels decrease from 104 dB SPL to 80 dB SPL. The SNR at 24 dB HL is the easiest, with words presented at 24 dB above the noise background, whereas the SNR of 0 dB is the most difficult with target words being presented at the same level as the background noise (Wilson and Burks, 2005; Wilson and Watts, 2012). The WIN will be repeated three times in order to assess test-retest reliability. The total number of words correctly identified will be used to calculate a dB HL S/N threshold by the Spearman-Karber equation at the mean of 50% correct points.</description>
