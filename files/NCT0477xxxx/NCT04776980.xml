  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a new diagnosis of high-grade glioma based on MRI, who are considered surgical&#xD;
      candidates determined by neurosurgeons or patients with recurrent glioblastoma with the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis of glioblastoma (histologic or molecular proof) and recommended for&#xD;
      clinically surgical resection may be eligible for this study. Subjects may participate in&#xD;
      this study if they are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI will be used to quantify tumor-associated macrophages. This is a&#xD;
      non-therapeutic trial in that imaging will not be used to direct treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood draw is being completed to evaluate cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA) and&#xD;
      cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in subjects with a new diagnosis of high-grade glioma based on classic&#xD;
      MRI appearance who are considered surgical candidates and patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      diagnosis of glioblastoma (GB) who have completed chemoradiation and now have new&#xD;
      contrast-enhancing lesions or lesions showing increased enhancement ( 25% increase) who are&#xD;
      recommended for a clinical surgical resection. Subjects may participate in this study if they&#xD;
      are at least 18 years of age, most participants will be receiving care at the clinical&#xD;
      practices of the University of Pennsylvania. Subjects who come to the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania for diagnosis and/or treatment of GB and who meet the study inclusion criteria&#xD;
      may be approached by study personnel for recruitment into this study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      approached about study participation regardless of race or ethnic background. Investigators&#xD;
      anticipate enrolling up to 30 participants. Subjects who consent but do not complete the&#xD;
      study imaging will be considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Accrual will likely&#xD;
      occur over approximately 2 years. After undergoing screening assessments and verifying&#xD;
      eligibility for study participation subjects will undergo a research ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI&#xD;
      of the brain and blood draws for liquid biopsy.&#xD;
