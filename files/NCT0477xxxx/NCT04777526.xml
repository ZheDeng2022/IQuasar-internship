  <brief_summary>

      Objective: To establish the effectiveness of a proprioceptive training program as a&#xD;
      complementary therapy for a traditional protocol in position control, pain intensity, upper&#xD;
      limb function and occupation performance for patients with thumb CMC joint OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Standard conservative thumb CMC joint OA treatments were received for both the&#xD;
      control (n=26) and experimental groups (n=26) for a period of 12 weeks. The experimental&#xD;
      group received a proprioceptive training program during the same intervention period, which&#xD;
      was conducted twice weekly (24 sessions). The severity of pain with activity was measured&#xD;
      according to the visual analog scale (VAS). QuickDASH questionnaire was used to measure upper&#xD;
      extremity function. Patient's occupational performance was measured with the Canadian&#xD;
      Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and proprioception was assessed using Joint position&#xD;
      sense (JPS) testing.&#xD;

    <measure>Joint position Sense (JPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception using active joint position sense (JPS) has been utilized in studies to establish a correlation between therapy intervention and proprioception. The target position of 30o CMC abduction will be selected. Joint angle will be measured using a standard clear plastic goniometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline- 3- 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for pain assessment which is used frequently for clinical and research purposes. It consists of a 10-cm line anchored at each end. The left-hand anchor reads 'no pain' and the right-hand anchor reads 'worst possible pain'; the patients marked a line to represent their pain level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline- 3- 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's occupational performance will be measured with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). The COPM enables subjects to identify goals for hand therapy and engage in a subject-specific therapeutic process. It has been established that the COPM has good convergent validity and responsiveness for evaluating the relationship between patient self-perception and satisfaction for patients with CMC thumb OA .</description>

    <measure>Quick-dash</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline- 3- 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH questionnaire will be used to measure upper extremity function. This tool consists of 11 items providing a total score ranging from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates no limitation and 100 suggests full disability. Eight items include questions about the ability of the patient to perform certain daily activities.</description>
