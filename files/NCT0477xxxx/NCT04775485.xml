  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FIREFLY-1 is a Phase 2, multi center, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      oral pan-RAF inhibitor DAY101 in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma harboring a known BRAF alteration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 pediatric patients will be treated with DAY101, an oral pan-RAF inhibitor,&#xD;
      for a planned period of 26 cycles will be treated with DAY101 for a planned period of 26&#xD;
      cycles (approximately 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY101 will be administered at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 420 mg/m2 (not to&#xD;
      exceed 600 mg) orally once weekly (QW) for each 28-day treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment cycles will repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients will undergo radiographic evaluation of their disease at the&#xD;
      end of every third cycle. Patients will continue on DAY101 until radiographic evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression by RANO criteria as determined by treating investigator, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, patient withdrawal of consent, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have radiographic evidence of disease progression may be allowed to continue&#xD;
      DAY101 if, in the opinion of the investigator and approval by the Sponsor, the patient is&#xD;
      deriving clinical benefit from continuing study treatment. Disease assessments for patients&#xD;
      being treated beyond progression should continue as per regular schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY101 is an oral pan-RAF inhibitor administered as an oral tablet at 420 mg/m2 (not to&#xD;
      exceed 600 mg).&#xD;
