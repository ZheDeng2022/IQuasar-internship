      This study aims to study the effectiveness of preoperatively nebulized dexamethasone in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and severity of Post Operative Sore Throat, POST in patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery under general anesthesia using the Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device, with&#xD;
      secondary aims of determining the effectiveness of dexamethasone in reducing post-operative&#xD;
      cough severity and hoarseness of voice&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of dexamethasone in reducing the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat&#xD;
      (POST) with ETT use is established in few studies. Some of the studies had done were found to&#xD;
      have result on pertaining to efficacy of steroids in reducing incidences of POST in usage of&#xD;
      SGA device, hence we decided to undertake this double-blinded, randomized study in patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anaesthesia using the Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone which is 26.6 and 6.6 more potent than cortisol and prednisolone, acts via&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects; inhibiting and reducing the release of inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
      Hence this study aims to study the effectiveness of preoperative nebulized dexamethasone in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and severity of POST to improve patient satisfaction following general&#xD;
      anaesthesia,and reduce morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of preoperatively nebulized dexamethasone in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of post-operative sore throat following Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the incidence of post-operative sore throat (POST) with pre-operatively&#xD;
           nebulized dexamethasone following insertion of Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device at 30 minutes&#xD;
           and 24 hours post operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the severity of POST with pre-operatively nebulized dexamethasone using a&#xD;
           visual analogue scale (VAS) following insertion of Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device at 30&#xD;
           minutes and 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the incidence and severity of cough with pre-operatively nebulized&#xD;
           dexamethasone using a 4-point scale grading at 30 minutes and 24 hours post-operatively&#xD;
           following the insertion of Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the incidence and severity of hoarseness of voice with pre-operatively&#xD;
           nebulized dexamethasone using a 4-point scale grading at 30 minutes and 24 hours&#xD;
           post-operatively following the insertion of Ambu® AuraGainTM SGA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis H0:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in terms of efficacy of pre-operatively nebulised dexamethasone in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence and severity of POST Sore throat, cough and hoarseness will be graded&#xD;
      as per Tazeh-Kand et al's study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis H1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively nebulised dexamethasone is effective in reducing the incidence and severity&#xD;
      of POST Sore throat, cough and hoarseness will be graded as per Tazeh-Kand et al's study&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN The proposed study design is a single-centre, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      controlled, parallel-group interventional study conducted in Kelantan, Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (using a block randomization software) to 2 study arms (1:1&#xD;
      ratio), into Groups C and D whereby:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Control group, patients receiving usual standard of care in practice of SGA device&#xD;
      (including analgesics), without receiving any active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: Patients receiving nebulised dexamethasone 8mg (2ml) with 3mls of normal saline 0.9%&#xD;
      30 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia in the pre-operative receiving room via a&#xD;
      wall-mounted oxygen source at 15L/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each patient will stay in their assigned treatment arm for the duration&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blinded randomized controlled study, carried out by a single operator&#xD;
      and assessor. Both operator/ assessor and patient will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY AREA Operating theatres in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, HUSM, Kubang Kerian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS Group C: Control group, patients receiving usual standard of care in practice&#xD;
      of SGA device (including analgesics), without receiving any active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D: Patients receiving nebulised dexamethasone 8mg (2ml) with 3mls of normal saline 0.9%&#xD;
      30 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia in the pre-operative receiving room via a&#xD;
      wall-mounted oxygen source at 15L/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION The sample size was estimated using the PS Software version 3.1.2&#xD;
      (Dupont and Plummer 1997) based on comparing 2 proportions for incidence of sore throat, And&#xD;
      G*Power version 3.1.9.4 (Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Buchner, 1996) based on a 3 point scale for&#xD;
      determining the severity of sore throat, cough and hoarseness of voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alpha: 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power: 80%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the parameters in the study by Tazeh-Kand NF, Eslami B, Mohammadian K. Inhaled&#xD;
      fluticasone propionate reduces postoperative sore throat, cough, and hoarseness. Anesth&#xD;
      Analg. 2010 Oct;111(4):895-8 (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest sample size generated was 128 (for 64 patients in each arm) for incidence of&#xD;
      cough 1 hour post-operatively to detect a 30% difference in prevalence of cough between 2&#xD;
      study groups with a alpha value of 0.05 and power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION METHOD After written consent pre-operatively, patients will be randomized as&#xD;
      2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group C, and Group D. Group C: Patients receiving normal conduct of anaesthesia Group D:&#xD;
      Patients receiving dexamethasone 8mg (2ml) with 3mls of normal saline 0.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a sealed, opaque envelope containing a code with either N or D&#xD;
      according to the randomization software pre-operatively, which will be opened by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist or nurse not involved in the study. The anesthesiologist or nurse opening&#xD;
      the envelope will be told to withhold this information from the operator/investigator and&#xD;
      patient. If the envelope contains the letter D, the said nurse/ anesthesiologist will be told&#xD;
      to prepare and administer the nebulised drug as described, also without the knowledge of the&#xD;
      operator/investigator. The operator/investigator will have no contact with the patient once&#xD;
      the envelope is opened, and will remain away from the preoperative receiving room for 30&#xD;
      minutes from the arrival of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group D will receive a total of 5mls of nebulized drug 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia in the pre-operative receiving room via a wall-mounted oxygen source&#xD;
      at 15L/minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After nebulisation for 30 minutes in the pre-operative receiving area, patients will be&#xD;
      brought to the respective operating theatre. Monitoring according to standards will be&#xD;
      applied - Non-invasive blood pressure, ECG, oxygen saturation, and capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A humidified gas exchanger will be used for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of anesthesia will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will not be premedicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3-5 minutes or until an end-tidal&#xD;
           oxygen fraction of 85 is achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous induction with IV Fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, IV Propofol 1-3mg/kg, with no use of&#xD;
           neuromuscular blockade of IV Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The insertion of a fully deflated SGA AMBU AURAGAIN® lubricated with Lignocaine 2% on&#xD;
           the posterior aspect using the appropriate size according to patients' weight once there&#xD;
           is loss of eyelash reflex by the operator using a standardized technique. The cuff will&#xD;
           then be inflated with appropriate amount of air according to LMA size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cuff pressure will be measured immediately once the airway is secured, and subsequently&#xD;
           measured hourly using a handheld pressure gauge. Cuff pressure of not more than 60 cmH20&#xD;
           will be maintained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaesthesia will be maintained using Sevoflurane, titrated to a Minimum Alveolar&#xD;
           Concentration (MAC) of 0.9-1.0 in 50/50 oxygen/air mixture with SIMV (Pressure or volume&#xD;
           control) mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of anaesthesia, the oral airway will be suctioned once gently and 100% oxygen&#xD;
           will be administered until the SGA removed without deflation once regular, spontaneous&#xD;
           ventilation has returned with opening of eyes to calling of name&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to the recovery area where all patient will receive supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen via face mask at 5L/minute until discharged from the post-operative recovery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 point questionnaire on POST will be applied at 30 minutes to 1 hour and 24 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively in the ward by the same operator. If the patient is discharged prior to the&#xD;
      24 hour interview, they will be followed up via phone.&#xD;
