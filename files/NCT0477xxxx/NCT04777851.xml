  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RENOTACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of regorafenib and nivolumab (Rego-Nivo) versus transarterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE) for the first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or liver cancer).&#xD;
      Approximately 496 patients in around 80 clinical sites worldwide will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational arm: Regorafenib in combination with nivolumab (rego-nivo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients will receive trial treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that warrants permanent trial treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation or other treatment discontinuation criteria is met. After trial treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation, subsequent treatment will be administered according to the Investigator's&#xD;
      clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that combining regorafenib and nivolumab, may be advantageous over&#xD;
      standard treatment at an earlier HCC stage such as the intermediate-stage. This drug&#xD;
      combination was tested previously in pre-treated metastatic gastric and colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (Phase 1b, REGONIVO trial). The 80 mg regorafenib dose had a manageable safety profile and&#xD;
      encouraging antitumor activity (objective tumor response 40 precent) in patients with heavily&#xD;
      pretreated disease. Based on these promising results, the Rego-Nivo combination is being&#xD;
      tested in a number of ongoing clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RENOTACE will compare the efficacy and safety of the standard of care approach in patients&#xD;
      with this stage (i.e. TACE) versus Rego-Nivo, for the first-line treatment of&#xD;
      intermediate-stage HCC with beyond up-to-7 criteria. Although there are a number of trials&#xD;
      comparing TACE with TACE in combination with systemic therapy, this will be the first trial&#xD;
      comparing TACE with systemic therapy alone, an approach that could potentially represent a&#xD;
      shift in the management of intermediate-stage HCC.&#xD;

      RENOTACE is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of regorafenib and nivolumab (rego-nivo) versus transarterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE) for the first-line treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with&#xD;
      beyond up-to-7 criteria. Approximately 496 patients (about 248 in each arm) in around 80&#xD;
      sites will be randomized in order to power the study efficiently to measure a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful improvement for the primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) according to&#xD;
      Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) based on the InvestigatorÂ´s&#xD;
      assessment. To provide a balanced representation from the different regions involved in the&#xD;
      trial, the number of patients enrolled in Asian countries will be capped at approximately 50&#xD;
      precent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include patients who had been diagnosed with intermediate-stage HCC by biopsy,&#xD;
      cytology or diagnostic imaging, such as dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), according to the criteria of the American Association for the Study&#xD;
      of Liver Diseases (AASLD). Patients should have at least one measurable lesion as per&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, disease not amenable to&#xD;
      curative treatment but amenable to TACE (conventional TACE or drug-eluting bead TACE), and&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, Child-Pugh class A, and&#xD;
      beyond up-to-seven criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the following stratification factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geographic region (Asia versus non-Asia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG PS (0 versus 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade (1 versus 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCC etiology (viral hepatitis versus non-viral)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized patients will receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational arm: Regorafenib in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: TACE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients will receive trial treatment (Rego-Nivo or TACE) until progressive&#xD;
      disease per mRECIST, unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of patient's condition that&#xD;
      warrants permanent trial treatment discontinuation or other treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria is met. After trial treatment discontinuation, subsequent HCC treatment will be&#xD;
      administered according to the Investigator's clinical judgment.&#xD;
