  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this RCT is to explore the clinical, functional and neurophysiological&#xD;
      effectiveness of RE-assisted (Robotic Exoskeleton) early intervention gait therapy in stroke&#xD;
      patients during inpatient and outpatient stroke rehabilitation as compared to traditional&#xD;
      gait training in three groups: 1) RE; 2) RE-Standard of Care (SOC) and 3) SOC. We will&#xD;
      evaluate the short and long-term effects on functional mobility, clinical,&#xD;
      neurophysiological, community participation and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will continue to receive their prescribed standard of care physical therapy/gait training. They will also utilize the robotic exoskeleton twice a week during their inpatient stay and 3 times a week for 5 weeks as an outpatient (for outpatient, only if in the RE group). The Robotic Exoskeleton is a device that will be strapped to the chest and legs and worn over the shoulders like a backpack that will assist in walking. It uses sensors and participant motion to move. A licensed physical therapist will be assisting participants as they use the device.</description>

                  or neurological pathologies (e.g., Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, or&#xD;
                  traumatic brain injury with evidence of motor weakness and multiple sclerosis)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Orthopedic pathologies or history that will interfere with ambulation or limit&#xD;
