  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a biofilm-mediated chronic inflammatory disease with a multi-factorial&#xD;
      etiology; it belongs to the group of diseases classified as &quot;Non-communicable Diseases&quot;&#xD;
      (NCDs). According to the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2017, it is the&#xD;
      sixth most prevalent disease worldwide and it constitutes a heavy burden on health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for such disease include non-modifiable risk factors, i.e. familiarity,&#xD;
      diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, as well as modifiable risk factors,&#xD;
      i.e. diet, stress and low physical exercise. Given the significant impact of oral health on&#xD;
      the quality of life and overall well being of the individual, many studies investigated the&#xD;
      importance of risk factors for oral health. In particular, there is some evidence that more&#xD;
      severe manifestations of periodontitis are associated with lower physical activity (De&#xD;
      Oliveira Ferreira et al., 2019), poor sleep quality (Karaaslan &amp; Dikilita≈ü, 2019) and more&#xD;
      perceived stress (Coelho et al., 2020). With regards to diet, despite the high number of&#xD;
      studies demonstrating an anti-inflammatory effect of the Mediterranean Diet, no study has&#xD;
      ever investigated the adherence to Mediterranean Dieta to the oral health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a methodological standpoint, investigations regarding environmental factors are mainly&#xD;
      carried out through questionnaires administration, whose validity and reproducibility had&#xD;
      been previously demonstrated. The novelty introduced by the present study would be a complete&#xD;
      analysis of the effects of lifestyles (diet, sleep quality, physical exercise, perceived&#xD;
      stress) on the periodontal status of the individual.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to mediterranean diet</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim will be to relate the presence and severity of periodontitis to the adherence to Mediterranean diet, measured through a questionnaire (Gnagnarella et al. 2018) on a scale between 0 to 9. The higher the score, the higher the adherence to Mediterranean diet.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim will be to relate the presence and severity of periodontitis to sleep quality, measured through a questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) on a scale between 0 to 21. The higher the score, the poorer the sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim will be to relate the presence and severity of periodontitis to the amount of physical exercise, measured through a questionnaire (International Physical activity questionnaire, IPAQ) on a scale between 0 to 2 (0= low physical activity; 1= moderate physical activity; 2= intense physical activity)</description>

    <measure>Italian Perceived Stress Scale (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim will be to relate the presence and severity of periodontitis to the amount of stress perceived, measured through a questionnaire (Italian perceived stress scale) on a scale between 0 to 40. The higher the score, the higher the amount of stress perceived.</description>

    <description>A full periodontal chart will be carried out including all biometric periodontal variables: Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Bleeding on Probing (BoP), presence of Plaque, recession (REC), Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS), Full Mouth Bleeding Score (FMBS), presence of furcation and mobility. Periodontal status, as assessed by the periodontal chart, will be evaluated following the New Classification of Periodontal and Peri implant diseases.</description>
