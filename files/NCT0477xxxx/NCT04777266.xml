  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of symptoms, rehabilitation of cognitive deficits, improvement of social&#xD;
      functioning and quality of life in schizophrenia and other psychoses are approached through a&#xD;
      comprehensive strategy that combines psychopharmacology with psychosocial interventions.&#xD;
      However, despite the efficacy of these interventions, this is not the same in all patients,&#xD;
      and a large percentage do not achieve functional recovery.&#xD;

      The aim of this research is to carry out a randomized trial on the effects of a music therapy&#xD;
      (MT) program, implemented in addition to the usual pharmacological and psychosocial&#xD;
      rehabilitation (TAU), on symptoms, self-esteem, internalized stigma, social cognition, social&#xD;

    <description>The session-based intervention programme was designed with an integrated and multimodal perspective of music therapy [37], which allows the combination of active and passive activities together with focuses and perspectives based on empirical evidence [38]. It was implemented using a process-based approach, adapting content to different phases in the process: initial contact, managing resistance, confidence building, relationships, awareness, and closure. The central focus is on the patient and to adapt and remain flexible in the sessions in accordance with the capabilities and needs of the group members. Different perspectives are integrated via nonverbal communication. The layout and any changes to the setting are made in a gradual way in keeping with the process to foster feelings of security and belonging. Sessions begin with a brief period of breathing which then moves into warming-up and free-expression using instruments, followed by the central activity and the closure.</description>
