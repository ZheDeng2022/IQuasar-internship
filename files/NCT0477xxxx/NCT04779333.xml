  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase physical activity (PA) in children with ADHD using a&#xD;
      novel, family-based intervention that promotes PA within the context of evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral management training (BMT) for caregivers, enhanced with mobile health (mHealth)&#xD;
      behavior change strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the primary effects of a 9-week, family-based intervention&#xD;
      (Lifestyle Enhancement for ADHD Program - LEAP) to promote PA in young children with ADHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To evaluate secondary effects of the LEAP program on child ADHD symptoms and&#xD;
      executive functioning&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial comparing the LEAP program to standard BMT for ADHD (without the&#xD;
      enhanced focus on health behaviors, mHealth technology, or social media). Specifically, 80&#xD;
      families will be randomized to receive either LEAP or a standard BMT program based on Russell&#xD;
      Barkley's Defiant Children intervention manual. Moderators (e.g., child sex, medication, BMI)&#xD;
      and mediators (e.g., change in PA) will be analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Hypotheses being&#xD;
      tested include: 1) LEAP will be successful in increasing PA in children with ADHD in the&#xD;
      short-term and over a year, more so than standard BPT and 2) children randomized to LEAP will&#xD;
      exhibit greater and more sustained improvement in clinical outcomes relative to standard BMT.&#xD;
      If successful, the R33 phase will inform the development of a larger and longer, confirmatory&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
