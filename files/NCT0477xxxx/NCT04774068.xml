  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial finds the appropriate parsaclisib dose level in combination with&#xD;
      romidepsin for the treatment of T-cell lymphomas that have come back (relapsed) or that have&#xD;
      not responded to standard treatment (refractory). The other goals of this trial are to find&#xD;
      the proportion of patients whose cancer is put into complete remission or significantly&#xD;
      reduced by romidepsin and parsaclisib, and to measure the effectiveness of romidepsin and&#xD;
      parsaclisib in terms of patient survival. Romidepsin blocks certain enzymes (histone&#xD;
      deacetylases) and acts by stopping cancer cells from dividing. Parsaclisib is a PI3K&#xD;
      inhibitor. The PI3K pathway promotes cancer cell proliferation, growth, and survival.&#xD;
      Parsaclisib, thus, may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking PI3K enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Giving romidepsin and parsaclisib in combination may work better in treating&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory T-cell lymphomas compared to either drug alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of parsaclisib in combination with&#xD;
      romidepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of parsaclisib in combination with romidepsin&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma / mature&#xD;
      T-cell and NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (CTCL/PTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of response (DOR) to treatment. III. Disease control rate&#xD;
      (DCR). IV. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of&#xD;
      parsaclisib in combination with romidepsin in patients with relapsed/refractory CTCL/PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of parsaclisib in the Induction Phase and fixed-dose&#xD;
      in the Maintenance phase, and fixed-dose romidepsin in all Phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1,8, and 15 and&#xD;
      parsaclisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive romidepsin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      parsaclisib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressive therapy within 28 days of randomization. Immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy includes, but is not limited to, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, or high-dose&#xD;
             corticosteroids. Participants receiving corticosteroids must be at a dose of =&lt; 10&#xD;
             mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) within 7 days of randomization. However, topical&#xD;
             steroids (maximum strength Class III according to World Health Organization&#xD;
             Classification of Topical steroids) are allowed to control pruritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active infection requiring a systemic antimicrobial. The patient should be off&#xD;
             antibiotic treatment for an active infection for 7 days prior to enrollment in the&#xD;
             trial. However, antibiotic prophylaxis is acceptable as long as the dose of the&#xD;
             medication has been stable for at least 7 days prior to the baseline exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to a live vaccine within 30 days of treatment start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive at the time of screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen or viral load, hepatitis C viral load. Hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis&#xD;
             C (HCV) infection: Participants positive for HBV surface antigen or HBV core antibody&#xD;
             will be eligible if they are negative for HBV-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); these&#xD;
             participants should be considered for prophylactic antiviral therapy. Participants&#xD;
             positive for anti-HCV antibody will be eligible if they are negative for HCV&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy within the past 2 years (allowing squamous cell and basal cell&#xD;
             carcinomas with free margins at excision)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with a PI3K inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that is clinically meaningful.&#xD;
             Screening corrected QT interval (QTc) interval &gt; 450 milliseconds is excluded&#xD;
             (corrected by Fridericia). In the event that a single QTc is &gt; 450 milliseconds, the&#xD;
             participant may enroll if the average QTc for 3 ECGs is &lt; 450 milliseconds. If left&#xD;
             bundle branch is present, upper limit of QTc will be 550 milliseconds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor was recently used,&#xD;
             there should be 14 days or 5 half-lives time (whichever is longer) before the first&#xD;
             dose of parsaclisib is administered. Use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are strongly&#xD;
             discouraged but not strictly prohibited. If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is started after&#xD;
             study enrollment, the study principal investigator (PI) should be contacted to discuss&#xD;
             alternatives&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to swallow tablets, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function,&#xD;
             or resection of the stomach or small bowel or ulcerative colitis, symptomatic&#xD;

             Prior treatment with romidepsin is allowed if it was well-tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to comply with study procedures, including follow-up, as specified by&#xD;
             this protocol, or unwillingness to cooperate fully with the investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, or&#xD;
             laboratory values, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient&#xD;
             unsuitable for inclusion in the study&#xD;
