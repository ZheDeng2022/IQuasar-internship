  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer remains the commonest cancer among men, and third commonest among women in&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia . Presentation with metastatic disease occurs in almost one third of patients ,&#xD;
      with 5-year survival decreasing significantly from 90% in stage 1 to 14% once the disease is&#xD;
      metastatic . There is enthusiasm in the potential for liquid biopsies to provide easily&#xD;
      accessible genetic biomarkers for mutational cancer characterization . Epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies are widely used in the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that do not harbor RAS mutations (RAS wild type). Hence genotyping of&#xD;
      oncogenic RAS mutations is essential prior to the initiation of systemic therapy for such&#xD;
      patients as the presence of these mutations predict resistance to EGFR targeted antibodies&#xD;
      such as Cetuximab and Panitumumab . Detection of such mutations has been done on tissue&#xD;
      biopsies with the disadvantage of this being an invasive procedure, and data suggesting that&#xD;
      such testing may not be reflective of the true mutational burden of the disease since a&#xD;
      single fragment of tissue may be inadequate to reflect the intratumoral heterogeneity. There&#xD;
      is increasing evidence suggesting that liquid biopsies or blood based mutational profiling&#xD;
      can provide a more comprehensive molecular profile of the disease, and carries the advantage&#xD;
      of being minimally invasive. Serial liquid biopsies can act as a tool to identify spatial and&#xD;
      temporal heterogeneity predicting response or resistance to targeted agents, and can shed&#xD;
      light into the emergence (or disappearance) of specific mutations that may potentially be&#xD;
      targeted with newer anti cancer agents .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) consists of small nucleic acid fragments liberated from&#xD;
      cells by rupture, necrosis or apoptosis, and is now increasingly being used to detect RAS&#xD;
      (and other) mutations in patients with advanced colorectal cancers. KRAS has remained an&#xD;
      &quot;undruggable&quot; target for decades until the most recent evidence that showed a new anticancer&#xD;
      drug that targets KRAS G12C mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to perform cfDNA testing on patients with advanced colorectal cancers&#xD;
      who have no RAS mutations (and hence start on EGFR inhibitors) as baseline, compare the&#xD;
      results with mutational analysis on fresh tumor tissue, and perform cfDNA at first&#xD;
      progression to determine what mutations have emerged, and specifically look for KRAS G12C&#xD;
      mutation, which can be targeted with a new novel anti cancer drug . These patients will be&#xD;
      collected over a 12 month period (with the aim of performing this on at least 100 patients),&#xD;
      and followed from diagnosis (with baseline cfDNA) and until progression on EGFR inhibitors&#xD;
      (where another cfDNA sample will be taken). A detailed proposal delineating this process will&#xD;
      follow once accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is unique as it examines mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR inhibitors in our&#xD;
      patients with advanced colorectal cancers, determines the prevalence of a specific mutation&#xD;
      using liquid biopsies and examining cfDNA use, and may have therapeutic implications in&#xD;
      facilitating obtaining KRAS G12C inhibitors for such patients.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer remains the commonest cancer among men, and third commonest among women in&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia . Presentation with metastatic disease occurs in almost one third of patients ,&#xD;
      with 5-year survival decreasing significantly from 90% in stage 1 to 14% once the disease is&#xD;
      metastatic . There is enthusiasm in the potential for liquid biopsies to provide easily&#xD;
      accessible genetic biomarkers for mutational cancer characterization . Epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies are widely used in the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that do not harbor RAS mutations (RAS wild type). Hence genotyping of&#xD;
      oncogenic RAS mutations is essential to be done prior to initiation of systemic therapy for&#xD;
      such patients as the presence of these mutations predict resistance to EGFR targeted&#xD;
      antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab . Treatment of metastatic CRC has become more&#xD;
      complex and precision medicine approaches have evolved in recent years with the discovery of&#xD;
      new oncogenic (potentially targetable) pathways . The prognosis of metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer has improved from 6 months with best supportive care to more than 2 years with&#xD;
      multi-agent chemo and targeted therapy including anti EGFR antibodies . Targeting other&#xD;
      singling pathways in CRC such as adding vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors has&#xD;
      benefitted patients as well . It is estimated that 55% of patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) will have oncogenic mutations in KRAS and NRAS. Detection of such mutations has&#xD;
      been done on tissue biopsies with the disadvantage of this being an invasive procedure, and&#xD;
      data suggesting that such testing may not be reflective of the true mutational burden of the&#xD;
      disease since a single fragment of tissue may be inadequate to reflect the intratumoral&#xD;
      heterogeneity. There is increasing evidence suggesting that liquid biopsies or blood based&#xD;
      mutational profiling can provide a more comprehensive molecular profile of the disease, and&#xD;
      carries the advantage of being minimally invasive. Serial liquid biopsies can act as a tool&#xD;
      to identify spatial and temporal heterogeneity predicting response or resistance to targeted&#xD;
      agents, and can shed light into the emergence (or disappearance) of specific mutations that&#xD;
      may potentially be targeted with newer anti cancer agents . To account for this molecular&#xD;
      heterogeneity, the genomic profiles of metastatic colorectal cancer patients should be&#xD;
      examined at different time points during the course of therapy using liquid biopsy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been small studies that examined mechanisms of resistance to anti EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies in mCRC using liquid biopsy. A study of 37 mCRC patients who were treated with&#xD;
      cetuximab found that 40% of them developed RAS mutations at progression 10). Another study&#xD;
      with limited number of participants examined patients with mCRC treated with panitumumab and&#xD;
      found that 9 out of 24 patients (38%) developed KRAS mutations on treatment as a mechanism of&#xD;
      acquired resistance to anti EGFR therapy . Furthermore, fewer studies with limited number of&#xD;
      patients used liquid biopsy as a biomarker when re-challenging mCRC patients with EGFR&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies. The majority of these studies were retrospective. However, one was the&#xD;
      first prospective trial and had a similar protocol to our study. It included 28 patients and&#xD;
      reported that 52% of these patients were RAS wildtype at re-challenge with cetuximab - when&#xD;
      these patients were exposed to, and progressed on cetuximab in the first line setting. This&#xD;
      study showed that re-challenge with cetuximab significantly improved progression free&#xD;
      survival when RAS was found to be wild type on circulating tumor DNA(12). One of the&#xD;
      limitations of this study was that a single liquid biopsy sample was done (prior to&#xD;
      re-challenge with cetuximab) and hence does not display the predicted &quot;switch&quot; of the RAS&#xD;
      target, which the investigators plan to study in our trial. Furthermore, a more recent study&#xD;
      protocol has been published at BMC Cancer where the investigators plan to study 120 patients&#xD;
      and perform liquid biopsy analysis every 3 months while patients are on first line cetuximab.&#xD;
      This is to study the evolution of the RAS target, and to correlate this with disease&#xD;
      response, as well as help guide therapy with EGFR inhibitors in mCRC patients. However, based&#xD;
      on limited data, current guidelines have not yet adopted testing using liquid biopsy and&#xD;
      using this strategy to decide on re challenge of anti EGFR therapy in 3rd line setting or&#xD;
      not, which is the question investigators would like to answer in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) consists of small nucleic acid fragments liberated from&#xD;
      cells by rupture, necrosis or apoptosis originating from normal and deceased cells, and is&#xD;
      now increasingly being used to detect RAS (and other) mutations in patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancers. There is new evidence that G12C RAS mutation can be targeted with a novel&#xD;
      anti cancer agent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators aim to perform cfDNA testing on patients with advanced colorectal cancers&#xD;
      who have no RAS mutations i.e wild type (and hence start on EGFR inhibitors - which is&#xD;
      standard of care treatment) pre third line therapy. This will help the treating physician&#xD;
      decide whether to give these patients with RAS wt status an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody or&#xD;
      standard third line therapy (Regorafenib or TAS-102). These patients will be collected over&#xD;
      an 18 month period. The cfDNA test at second progression (i.e prior to third line systemic&#xD;
      therapy) will determine whether the subset of patients who may have developed RAS mutation(s)&#xD;
      after progression to first line therapy (or other mutations as a mechanism of resistance)&#xD;
      with anti - EGFR monoclonal antibodies have switched their RAS status and became wild type.&#xD;
      This will support the re-challenge of EGFR inhibitors in the third line setting, and has the&#xD;
      potential of changing the colorectal cancer treatment guidelines. Upon this, the principle&#xD;
      investigator will decide whether to re-challenge with anti EGFR inhibitor. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to study 60 patients in total and have 30 patients at least in the rechallenge (with anti&#xD;
      EGFR mAb) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have their standard of care (SOC) biopsy of tumor/ metastatic site to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis, and determine RAS status. Once RAS wild type, and primary disease is left sided,&#xD;
      these patients will receive standard chemotherapy (choices of FOLFOX, FLOFIRI, CapeOX,&#xD;
      XELIRI) with an anti EGFR mAb (cetuximab or panitumumab). Upon progression of disease, second&#xD;
      line systemic chemotherapy +/- anti VEGF antibody will be given as per SOC. Upon second&#xD;
      progression, patients will be enrolled into the study as per inclusion criteria and consent,&#xD;
      and a cfDNA blood test will be drawn, and RAS status will be examined. If RAS is wildtype,&#xD;
      then the investigator will decide whether to re-challenge with an anti EGFR antibody (see&#xD;
      study schema - figure 1), or give SOC third line chemotherapy (Regorafenib or TAS-102).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessments will be done every 8 - 12 weeks as per SOC using CT scans, and/or MRI,&#xD;
      and will be reported as per RECIST criteria v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for cfDNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) from CRC patients cfDNA extraction Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected in K2EDTA tubes (BD Vacutainer® Blood Collection Tubes, Becton&#xD;
      Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA) and sent to the Translational Pathology Laboratory. The&#xD;
      plasma fraction will be separated from the blood cells by two consecutive rounds of&#xD;
      centrifugation for 30 min at room temperature at 1600 × g. The collected plasma was aliquoted&#xD;
      and stored at -80 °C until use. cfDNA is extracted from plasma volumes ranging from 0.4 to&#xD;
      5.5 ml using the MagMax Cell-Free Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,&#xD;
      Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The cfDNA quantity was assessed&#xD;
      with the dsDNA HS assay kit by the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cfDNA&#xD;
      quality was assessed with the Agilent Tap Station System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,&#xD;
      USA). Only cfDNA samples with a clear fragment size peak between 140-200 bp will be&#xD;
      considered for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGS library preparation NGS libraries will prepared from 10 ng of cfDNA following the&#xD;
      Oncomine™ Pan-Cancer Cell-Free Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Our general library&#xD;
      preparation protocol is based on a two-cycle multiplex touch-down PCR reaction with a&#xD;
      temperature range from 64 °C to 58 °C, which allowed to amplify target regions and introduce&#xD;
      unique molecular identifiers. The resulting tagged amplicons of around 100-140 bp length are&#xD;
      then cleaned up using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) at a bead to sample&#xD;
      ratio of 1.5× and purified products are eluted in 24 μl low TE buffer. A second round of PCR&#xD;
      (18 cycles) will be performed in a total volume of 50 μl to amplify the purified amplicons&#xD;
      and introduce Ion Torrent™ Tag-Sequencing adapters containing sample-specific barcodes. The&#xD;
      resulting library of target DNA fragments will be purified by performing a two-step cleanup&#xD;
      using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) at a bead to sample ratio of 1.15× and 1.0×,&#xD;
      respectively. The purified libraries re then diluted 1:1000 and quantified by qPCR using the&#xD;
      Ion Universal Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The quantified stock libraries are&#xD;
      then diluted to 100 pM for downstream template preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing NGS libraries will be sequenced on an Ion S5™ instrument (Thermo Fisher&#xD;
      Scientific) using semiconductor sequencing technology. Briefly, sequencing runs are planned&#xD;
      on the Torrent Suite Software™ v5.10, libraries are pooled and loaded on an Ion 540™ chip&#xD;
      using the Ion Chef™ instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The loaded chip is then sequenced&#xD;
      using 500 flows. Raw data are processed automatically on the Torrent Server™ and aligned to&#xD;
      the reference hg19 genome. QC will be performed manually for each sample based on the&#xD;
      following metrics; number of reads per sample&gt;15,000,000 (for Oncomine™ Pan-Cancer Cell-Free&#xD;
      Assay libraries aries), on-target reads &gt;90%, read uniformity &gt;90%, median molecular coverage&#xD;
      &gt;500×, median read coverage &gt;15,000. Tissue NGS libraries are then sequenced according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing data of the QC passing samples are then uploaded&#xD;
      in BAM format to the Ion Reporter™ Analysis Server for variant calling and annotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis For plasma samples variant calling is performed on Ion Reporter™ (IR) Analysis&#xD;
      Software v5.10 using the Oncomine™ TagSeq Pan-Cancer Liquid Biopsy w2.0 workflows. The&#xD;
      analysis pipeline also includ signal processing, base calling, quality score assignment,&#xD;
      adapter trimming, PCR duplicate removal, and control of mapping quality. Coverage metrics for&#xD;
      each amplicon is obtained by running the Coverage Analysis Plugin software v5.6 (Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher Scientific). Identified variants are only considered if the variant had a molecular&#xD;
      coverage of at least three, indicating that the variant is detected in three independent&#xD;
      template molecules. Finally, all candidate mutations are manually reviewed using the&#xD;
      Integrative Genomics Viewer. Further annotation will be performed by Qiagen QCI platform and&#xD;
      in-house oLIMS system.&#xD;
