  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and&#xD;
      therapeutic ultrasound combined with home-based exercise in comparison with home-based&#xD;
      exercise alone in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Participants are&#xD;
      going to evaluate before training, and at the 1-month follow-up and 3-month follow-up using&#xD;
      the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain during activity, at rest, and at night, and the&#xD;
      Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SIS is an important cause of pain and disability and affects activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Therefore, a major goal of SIS treatment is to reduce pain and improve upper extremity&#xD;
      function. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single-blind, interventional trial, a&#xD;
      total of 60 patients with SIS who met the eligibility criteria are going to enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Eligible participants are going to randomly assign to one of the three groups by an&#xD;
      independent blinded researcher, using a computer-generated random numbers and allocation&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1:1: the LLLT group (LG, n = 20), the ultrasound therapy group (UG, n = 20), and&#xD;
      the control group (CG, n = 20). Participants are going to evaluate before training, and at&#xD;
      the 1-month follow-up and 3-month follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for&#xD;
      pain during activity, at rest, and at night, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index&#xD;
      (SPADI).&#xD;
