  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the effects of automated physician directed messaging on&#xD;
      patient engagement in the digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP). The messages are&#xD;
      tailored to patient engagement levels based on established engagement thresholds, which are&#xD;
      based on the patient's use of the dDPP application. The system is designed to minimize work&#xD;
      for providers by sending automated targeted messages to patients to potentially increase&#xD;
      engagement, prevent onset of diabetes and improve clinical outcomes. The patients in the&#xD;
      study are automatically nudged using a combination of text messaging and MyChart messaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a mixed-methods design, this study will be completed in three phases. For Phase 3, we&#xD;
      aim to conduct a randomized control trial with 400 patients with pre-diabetic, all of whom&#xD;
      will be using the dDPP application. Half of enrolled patients will be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group and receive automated targeted messaging.&#xD;
