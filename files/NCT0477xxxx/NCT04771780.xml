    <description>During the dosing period, subjects administer KHK7791 twice daily just before meals.Subjects will be underwent tests at scheduled visits at least weekly until Week 12, at least once every 2 weeks after completion of Week 12 test.&#xD;
KHK7791 and phosphate binders are adjusted with the goal of controlling serum phosphorus concentration within a certain range based on the dose adjustment criteria described in the study protocol.It should be considered that phosphorus adsorbent should be switched to KHK7791 whenever feasible.</description>
