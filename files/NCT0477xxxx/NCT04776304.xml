  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Service members and/or recently separated veterans with post traumatic stress symptoms and&#xD;
      mild traumatic brain injury may participate in 8 sessions including 2 sessions including&#xD;
      interviews and questionnaires as well as 6 sessions of art therapy. In the art therapy,&#xD;
      participants will be provided with a blank paper mache mask template and invited to alter the&#xD;
      mask however they wish using a variety of art materials. The therapist will use the&#xD;
      art-making process and culminating product to aid in self-reflection, reframe negative&#xD;
      thoughts and feelings, and work through traumatic content. Prior to the session start&#xD;
      participants will get set up with a mobile qEEG (worn like a hat and backpack). The qEEG will&#xD;
      measure brain activity in a non-invasive way throughout the art therapy session to improve&#xD;
      understanding of brain activity during the art therapy process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, interventional clinical trial in which all 9 service members with comorbid&#xD;
      PTSD and mTBI participate in 8 sessions (1 baseline session of interviews and questionnaires,&#xD;
      6 sessions of art therapy, and 1 final session of interviews and questionnaires).&#xD;
      Participants must have significant posttraumatic stress symptoms and a history of mild&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. Target enrollment is 9 active duty service members or recently&#xD;
      separated veterans, aged 18-64 with no prior art therapy exposure, at the NICoE at Walter&#xD;
      Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are&#xD;
      persistent and frequently comorbid complications of combat that remain a challenge to&#xD;
      healthcare providers. In these complex cases, traditional treatments often fail to provide&#xD;
      complete relief from symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress (PTS), anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression, leading the military healthcare system to look towards complementary and&#xD;
      integrative treatments. Art therapy is one promising intervention that helps service members&#xD;
      (SMs) develop a &quot;visual voice,&quot; using imagery, symbolism, and metaphor to externalize&#xD;
      emotions and experiences that they may not be able to express in words. The standardized,&#xD;
      integrative mental health and human services approach of the art therapy program at the NICoE&#xD;
      utilizes a mask-making directive to explore thoughts, feelings, and experiences of combat and&#xD;
      self-understanding. This process is especially relevant to SMs with PTS symptoms who often&#xD;
      remember their trauma as an incoherent, fragmented memory that is often predominantly sensory&#xD;
      in nature. NICoE researchers have provided preliminary evidence suggesting associations&#xD;
      between recurring art themes represented within the masks and individual BH symptoms; yet,&#xD;
      the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this therapeutic technique remain obscure. To date,&#xD;
      there have been few studies using neuroimaging techniques to investigate brain network&#xD;
      changes during art creation. Studies have utilized electroencephalography (EEG) and&#xD;
      functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during art creation but not within the context&#xD;
      of art therapy. Mobile, quantitative EEG allows for real time data capture that could&#xD;
      minimize interference of neuroimaging during the therapeutic process and provide insight into&#xD;
      the neurological mechanisms underlying art therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures: Participants will be provided with a blank paper mache mask&#xD;
      template and invited to alter the mask however they wish using a variety of art materials.&#xD;
      The therapist will use the art-making process and culminating product to aid in&#xD;
      self-reflection, reframe negative thoughts and feelings, and work through traumatic content.&#xD;
      Prior to the session start participants will get set up with the mobile qEEG. The qEEG will&#xD;
      be segmented into a pre-art therapy session resting state, prompt-specific tasks during the&#xD;
      art therapy session, and a post-art therapy session resting state.&#xD;
