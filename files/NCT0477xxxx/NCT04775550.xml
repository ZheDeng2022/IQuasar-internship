      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the combination of daratumumab&#xD;
      (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone works in&#xD;
      treating smoldering multiple myeloma and preventing progression to active or symptomatic&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This combination of drugs are considered &quot;investigational&quot; which means it has not been&#xD;
      approved in this combination for smoldering myeloma by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daratumumab (also called Darzalex Faspro)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib (also called Velcade)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be treated for up to 24 months and will be followed for up to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      investigational drug(s). The investigational drugs used in this research study are&#xD;
      daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and&#xD;
      dexamethasone. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)&#xD;
      has not approved the combination of daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid),&#xD;
      bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone as a treatment regimen for the specific disease.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded from the study because lenalidomide is an&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Note that PFT/FEV1 testing is required at screening for patients suspected of&#xD;
