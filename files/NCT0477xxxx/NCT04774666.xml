  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of&#xD;
      a caregiver-assisted oral fluid-based HIV test to screen children for HIV. The results of&#xD;
      this study are intended to support expanded access to HIV testing and treatment services for&#xD;
      children, and to ensure that all newly diagnosed children are linked to clinical care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Globally, there are 1.8 million children living with HIV (CLHIV), however, despite&#xD;
      great progress over the past 15 years, only 52% are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART),&#xD;
      leaving approximately 864,000 children in need of treatment.1 Pediatric case finding is the&#xD;
      first, critical step to close the pediatric ART gap. In Uganda, there are an estimated 36,873&#xD;
      CLHIV in need of HIV treatment.2 Reaching this population is challenging, because children&#xD;
      are dependent on parents and caregivers to access HIV testing services. Parents and&#xD;
      caregivers often face logistical, societal and other barriers that limit the uptake of&#xD;
      testing services for children. In order to achieve the second and third UNAIDS 95 targets for&#xD;
      pediatric HIV treatment coverage and viral load suppression to reach epidemic control,&#xD;
      country programs need to utilize increasingly targeted and innovative testing modalities to&#xD;
      optimize the identification CLHIV. Oral fluid-based screening may present a safe, convenient&#xD;
      and reliable way to identify CLHIV that can expand access to essential testing services in&#xD;
      resource-limited settings where most CLHIV reside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will use a cross-sectional cluster sampling design, in which 32 facilities&#xD;
      in 16 districts will be selected using probability-proportional-to-size (PPS) sampling. In&#xD;
      the 32 selected facilities, index parent/caregivers of approximately 4,687 children will be&#xD;
      recruited to accept test kits for their children. Adult index parent/caregivers will be&#xD;
      consented to participate in the study and asked for parental permission for their child(ren)&#xD;
      to participate, given a number of oral screening kits corresponding to the number of children&#xD;
      eligible for screening, and followed-up to confirm the oral fluid-based screening results and&#xD;
      participate in a testing experience survey. Any children who screen HIV reactive will receive&#xD;
      confirmatory testing and active linkage to care and treatment services. A cost analysis which&#xD;
      includes savings associated with facility or home-based costs averted, using existing sources&#xD;
      to estimate the costs of facility-based testing and home-based by a community health worker&#xD;
      (CHW), preferably from antenatal settings will be undertaken.&#xD;
