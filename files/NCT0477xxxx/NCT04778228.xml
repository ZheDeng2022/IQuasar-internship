    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to make analysis of potentially modifiable factors contributing to&#xD;
      outcome of mechanically ventilated ARDS adult patient receiving lung protective strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: is to evaluate whether DP was superior to the variables that define it in&#xD;
      predicting hospital outcome including mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: is to identify manageable factors associated with outcome such as&#xD;
      ventilator-related parameters and to investigate the role of non-modifiable factors such as&#xD;
      demographic characteristics, severity of illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute and intense inflammatory disease&#xD;
      process of the Lungs, characterized clinically by severe hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrates. The hospital mortality ranges between 35% and 45% (1). Traditionally, critically&#xD;
      ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were ventilated using high tidal volumes&#xD;
      (Vt) and high airway pressures, until the pivotal ARDS net randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      demonstrated that a &quot;lung-protective&quot; MV strategy using a Vt of 4-8 mL/kg predicted body&#xD;
      weight (PBW) and moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improved survival&#xD;
      (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The driving pressure (DP) (calculated as the Pplat minus applied PEEP) has been suggested as&#xD;
      a major determinant for the beneficial effects of the three main components of&#xD;
      lung-protective MV, namely, Vt, Pplat, and PEEP. and also a given DP would have different&#xD;
      effects on outcome depending on the Vt, Pplat, and PEEP (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective analysis of several trials in patients with ARDS comparing different PEEP&#xD;
      levels at the same VT or different VT levels at the same PEEP, or a combination of both,&#xD;
      found that Î”Prs is the stronger predictor of mortality as compared with Pplats (3).&#xD;

    <description>critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were ventilated using high tidal volumes (Vt) and high airway pressures, until the pivotal ARDS net randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that a &quot;lung-protective&quot; MV strategy using a Vt of 4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW) and moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improved survival (2). Since then, limitation of Vt to 4-8 mL/kg PBW, plateau pressures (Pplat) to a maximum of 30 cm H2O, and application of PEEP 10 -16 cm H2O represent the standard for MV in ARDS patients.</description>
