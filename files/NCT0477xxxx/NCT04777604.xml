  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators create organoid from the pancreatic cancer tissue obtained via EUS-FNA and&#xD;
      EUS-FNB within the pancreatic cancer diagnostic process. And also the investigators create&#xD;
      organoid from the pancreatic cancer tissue obtained after surgery as part of the pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer treatment process. Check for the reactivity to anti-cancer drugs through cell&#xD;
      viability assay after treating with various anti-cancer drugs, such as anti-cancer drugs used&#xD;
      as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer to the organoid. Also, perform genomic&#xD;
      analysis on each organoid, and then check if there are any unique genomic mutations for each&#xD;
      organoid. By recognizing the relationship between the unique genomic mutations and reactivity&#xD;
      to the anti-cancer drug within pancreatic cancer patients eligible for surgery, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to strategize appropriate neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery, thus&#xD;
      developing a platform to predict the outcomes of each patient.&#xD;
