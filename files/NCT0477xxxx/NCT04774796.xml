  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy has been found to have a profound impact on parents of children with food&#xD;
      allergy, with caregivers experiencing poorer psychological outcomes such as increased stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, worry and depression than parents of non-allergic children. Furthermore, they report&#xD;
      poorer quality of life (QoL) due to the psychosocial impact of looking after a child with&#xD;
      food allergy, identifying the need for parental interventions aimed at improving these&#xD;
      outcomes. There has generally been a paucity of research in this area, but there has recently&#xD;
      been encouraging evidence to suggest that interventions involving Cognitive Behavioural&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT) have the potential to improve the lives of those parents impacted by a child's&#xD;
      food allergy. This study aims to add to this emerging evidence base by reporting on the&#xD;
      feasibility of a brief, group CBT intervention for parents of children with food allergy.&#xD;
      This small, proof of concept study also aims to report on a range of psychological measures&#xD;
      to see if there is any evidence that this intervention may be effective in improving&#xD;
      outcomes. Thirty to forty parents of children with food allergy will be recruited to the&#xD;
      study and randomised to receive either a one-day or two half-day group CBT intervention or&#xD;
      treatment as usual. Measures of a range of psychological outcomes, food allergy specific QoL&#xD;
      and goal-based outcomes will be taken at baseline and at one and three-month follow ups.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked for their feedback so that researchers can report on the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention for those involved. This study is also interested in&#xD;
      hearing about the parental experience of accessing psychological therapies as it is still not&#xD;
      clear why some parents may require psychological intervention whilst others may not;&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will be invited to take part in interviews in order to&#xD;
      share their experiences. It is hoped that this set of findings will help to determine if a&#xD;
      brief group CBT intervention could be recommended for efficacy testing as part of a wider&#xD;
      effort to provide evidence-based treatments for parents of children with food allergy&#xD;
      experiencing poor psychological outcomes and poor food allergic-specific QoL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is the adverse reaction of the body's immune system to the ingestion of food&#xD;
      protein. When a food allergen is ingested, the immune system detects the food protein as a&#xD;
      threat and releases a number of chemicals which cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction.&#xD;
      These symptoms can include watery eyes, a running nose, itching, rashes, swelling and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal problems, and may vary in their severity. Reactions can progress to&#xD;
      anaphylaxis, which is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset; symptoms can&#xD;
      include a range of frightening respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms&#xD;
      which may result in death if not treated promptly and effectively with adrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, food allergy is a prevalent problem, with an estimated 2 million people living&#xD;
      with a diagnosed food allergy in the UK. Prevalence rates are higher in children than in&#xD;
      adults, with an estimated 6-7% of children affected compared to 1-2% of adults, with this&#xD;
      prevalence thought to be increasing. Currently, treatment involves avoidance of food&#xD;
      allergens and the administration of treatment for accidently ingested foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current management of food allergy involves the burden of constant vigilance, planning&#xD;
      and preparation, with this responsibility often falling on parents (particularly the mothers)&#xD;
      of young children. Furthermore, those with food allergy and their caregivers have to manage&#xD;
      the unpredictable nature of food allergy and live continually with the risk and fear of&#xD;
      accidental food ingestion which can negatively impact the Quality of Life (QoL) of allergy&#xD;
      sufferers and their immediate family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in this field has started to examine the psychological impact food allergy can not&#xD;
      only have on the allergic child but also their parents. Previous studies have suggested that&#xD;
      allergic children and their mothers experience higher stress and anxiety levels compared to&#xD;
      the general population. Reasons why food allergy can cause such distress in parents include:&#xD;
      the constant vigilance needed to check safety of foods; anxiety caused by severe and&#xD;
      potentially fatal consequences of accidental ingestion of the food allergen; anxiety caused&#xD;
      by handing over control of allergy management to the child (for example reading their own&#xD;
      food labels); risk from the environment including people not understanding the impact of food&#xD;
      allergy; worry about the future of their child, and dietary restrictions leading to social&#xD;
      restrictions and potentially isolation. Given the impact looking after a child with food&#xD;
      allergy can have on mental health and QoL in parents, the need for interventions to improve&#xD;
      psychological outcomes is of high importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been a paucity of research on interventions to improve psychological&#xD;
      outcomes for parents of children with a food allergy. However, there is emerging evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may be a promising intervention for parents&#xD;
      experiencing poor psychological outcomes and QoL. CBT is a short-term therapy based on the&#xD;
      rationale that what individuals think and do affects the way individuals feel. It has a&#xD;
      strong evidence base for a range of mental health issues including anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      and therefore may be appropriate for parents experiencing high levels of stress, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression in relation to a child's food allergy. In the first study which reported on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of CBT for mothers of children with a food allergy, five mothers received 12&#xD;
      weeks of individual face-to-face CBT, with six mothers acting as controls. All participants&#xD;
      completed measures of anxiety, depression, worry, stress, general mental health, generic and&#xD;
      food allergy specific QoL at baseline and at 12 weeks. Results showed that anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and worry in the CBT group significantly reduced and overall mental health and QoL&#xD;
      significantly improved from baseline to 12 weeks for mothers in the CBT group. A larger&#xD;
      randomised control trial supported these promising initial findings. Two hundred mothers of&#xD;
      children with food allergy were randomised to receive either a single-session CBT&#xD;
      intervention or standard care, with anxiety and risk perception assessed at 6 weeks and 1&#xD;
      year. Results found significantly reduced state anxiety at six weeks in the intervention&#xD;
      group, in the subgroup of mothers with moderate to high anxiety at enrolment and reduced risk&#xD;
      perception. The study also found evidence of a reduction in physiological stress response in&#xD;
      the intervention group, as measured by a salivary cortisol response to a simulated&#xD;
      anaphylaxis scenario at one year. The results of both of these studies indicate that a CBT&#xD;
      intervention may be an appropriate intervention for parents of children with food allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to add to this emerging evidence base by reporting on the feasibility of a&#xD;
      brief group CBT intervention for improving psychological outcomes and food allergy specific&#xD;
      QoL in parents of children with food allergy. There is already evidence that non-CBT-specific&#xD;
      group interventions for parents with food allergic children can both be acceptable to parents&#xD;
      and decrease parental burden, however, this study is the first to the researchers' knowledge&#xD;
      to report on the feasibility of a brief group CBT intervention for parents of children with&#xD;
      food allergy. Although a brief (one-day) intervention may seem optimistic in being able to&#xD;
      bring about change, previous research in the field of child anxiety has shown promising&#xD;
      evidence for the use of one-day interventions. A recent study has shown that children whose&#xD;
      parents attended a one-day group intervention were 16.5% less likely to have an anxiety&#xD;
      disorder than children whose parents received treatment as usual, highlighting than an&#xD;
      inexpensive, one-day psycho-educational intervention may be useful in bringing about change.&#xD;
      Group CBT interventions have the potential to offer a non-time consuming and cost-effective&#xD;
      treatment option for parents of children with food allergy, an important factor for high in&#xD;
      demand allergy services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research has provided insights into why food allergy can cause distress, however,&#xD;
      reasons why parents access psychological support and their experiences of this, is still&#xD;
      relatively unexplored. Differences in parental coping styles and levels of distress have been&#xD;
      noted, indicating that only a sub-set of parents of food-allergic children may require&#xD;
      psychological intervention. This study aims to speak to parents about their experiences of&#xD;
      accessing psychological support (e.g. reasons for accessing psychological support, how other&#xD;
      forms of support have helped/hindered and how they think a psychological intervention may&#xD;
      help) in order to shed light on who CBT interventions may be most helpful for, and what CBT&#xD;
      should comprise of for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore is a contribution to the wider effort of providing evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for parents of children with food allergy impacted by the distressing psychosocial&#xD;
      implications of caring for a food allergic child.&#xD;
