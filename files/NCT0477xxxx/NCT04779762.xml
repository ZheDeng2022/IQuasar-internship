  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary therapy involving the Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CDED) is an evolving strategy&#xD;
      to target the microbiome and innate immunity in order to reduce inflammation and promote&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current pilot study is to evaluate the added benefit of treatment with&#xD;
      Ustekinumab combined with CDED in anti TNF exposed patients compared to treatment with&#xD;
      Ustekinumab alone in term of achieving remission.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The induction period is crucial for a patient's response to biologic therapy but also for&#xD;
      maintenance of remission, as simple as it sounds, maintenance of remission requires&#xD;
      remission. Biological medications using a single monoclonal antibody directed target, seem to&#xD;
      be effective only for a segment of the population with Crohn's disease Dietary therapy is&#xD;
      highly effective in children and induces remission in approximately 60% of young adults with&#xD;
      uncomplicated luminal disease. It was shown to shift the microbiome away from Proteobacteria&#xD;
      towards Firmicutes, and to decrease intestinal permeability (i.e improvement in leaky gut).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary therapy is widely used in children and both exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) and the&#xD;
      Crohn's disease exclusion diet were highly effective for induction of remission and reduction&#xD;
      in inflammation in children in a multinational randomized controlled trial (Levine A,&#xD;
      Gastroenterology 2019). Recently a prospective randomized controlled trial in biologic na√Øve&#xD;
      adults demonstrated clinical remission in 62% of adults by 6 weeks (Yanai H, UEG Week 2020).&#xD;
      A two week course of EEN in adults was effective for improvement of symptoms and reduction in&#xD;
      inflammation (Wall CL Inflamm Intest Dis 2018). Xu et al demonstrated clinical remission in&#xD;
      52 and 47% of two adult cohorts (n=104) using EEN for induction of remission (Xu Y, Therap&#xD;
      Adv Gastroenterol 2019). Taken together, these studies suggest that dietary therapy could act&#xD;
      as a bridge to biologic effect and have a synergistic effect on the disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients taking oral iron supplements may be enrolled if they discontinue the&#xD;
             supplements prior to receiving UST, and are NOT ALLOWED to take oral iron supplements&#xD;
             during the first 12 weeks of the trial as the diet reduces oral iron exposure to&#xD;
             decrease siderophoric pathobionts (patients are allowed to receive intravenous iron or&#xD;
