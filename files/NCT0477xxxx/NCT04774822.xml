  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects approximately 35 million Americans, each of whom needs at least one retinal&#xD;
      exam per year. However, majority do not get their eye exam due to multiple prohibitive&#xD;
      factors such as cost, transportation, difficulty of taking time off from work, and&#xD;
      inconvenience, amongst others. The standard of care in diabetes requires at least an annual&#xD;
      eye exam to detect onset of diabetic retinopathy and to treat when indicated. This is&#xD;
      important as diabetes is the most common cause of visual impairment and blindness in working&#xD;
      age adults in the United States. There are too few trained professionals to diagnose diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy, this prompted the development of RETINA-AI Galaxy an automated software as a&#xD;
      medical device which screens for diabetic retinopathy in the primary care setting. This&#xD;
      observational study is designed to validate the safety and efficacy of the device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of RETINA-AI Galaxy in screening for diabetic retinopathy in the primary care&#xD;
      setting. The study design conforms to an Intent to Screen (ITS) paradigm [1]. The Galaxy is a&#xD;
      software medical device designed to analyze digital color fundus photographs and rapidly&#xD;
      screen for the presence of more than mild diabetic retinopathy or vision-threatening diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 360 subjects after exclusions. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be recruited from three sites staffed by primary care providers. Eligibility will be&#xD;
      assessed and informed consent obtained, after which digital color fundus photographs will be&#xD;
      taken using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared non-mydriatic fundus cameras, by&#xD;
      an operator using the Galaxy photography manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a total of 5 non-mydriatic robotic screening cameras used in the AI system&#xD;
      protocol part of the study. There will be a dedicated validation camera used in the&#xD;
      Validation Reading Center Protocol part of the study. Primary care clinical staff (e.g.&#xD;
      medical assistant) with no prior professional ophthalmic photography experience and only a 4&#xD;
      hour training will operate the RETINA-AI Galaxy device and the screening cameras. The Retina&#xD;
      Reading Center - certified professional ophthalmic photographers will operate the validation&#xD;
      fundus cameras according the the 4W-D stereo protocol.&#xD;
