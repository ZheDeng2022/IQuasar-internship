    <textblock>
      To observe the efficacy and safety of hydrochloride anlotinib combined with concurrent&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy for patients with FIGO stage IB3 and IIA2-IVA cervical cancer. Patient&#xD;
      characteristics, image and genetic information of tumor, microbial sample of tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and biomarker in the blood sample will be collected and analysis by&#xD;
      multi-omics and bioinformatic technology. Aim to provide a new treatment module for cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed pathologically as cervical cancer (squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or&#xD;
      adenosquamous carcinoma) with stage of FIGO IB3 and IIA2 to IVB will be included in this&#xD;
      study according to the prescribed criteria in the protocal. Classical radiochemotherapy will&#xD;
      be conducted by clinical routine method. Radiation will be given by external beam radiation&#xD;
      of 45Gy total dose and 3D-brachytherapy of 30Gy/5F or 28Gy/4F. Duration of radiotherapy will&#xD;
      be no more than 8 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy will be administrated weekly during&#xD;
      radiation for a total of 5-6 doses. Cisplatin of 40mg/m2 will be the most preferred regime&#xD;
      and for patients with intolerable toxicity of cisplatin, carboplatin of AUC 2 will be the&#xD;
      alternative drug. Apart from that, hydrochloride anlotinib, a multiple targets&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis kinase approved by CFDA, will be orally taken daily at a dose of 12mg for&#xD;
      14 days aiming to improve tumor response. Then rest for 7 days and start a new cycles for a&#xD;
      total of 3 cycles. First capsule of anlotinib will be taken 7 days before the first&#xD;
      radiation. Once the treatment is finished, patients will be examination for tumor evaluation&#xD;
      and toxicity monitor every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every half years for the&#xD;
      third year unless progression or death. During those period, patient characteristics, image&#xD;
      data, tumor tissue, blood, urine, stool and microbial sample of tumor micro environment will&#xD;
      be collected and analysis by multi-omics and bioinformatic technology. A total of 53 patients&#xD;
      will be included and this study will be conducted in the department of radiation and clinical&#xD;
      oncology in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.&#xD;
