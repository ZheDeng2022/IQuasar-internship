    <textblock>
      Inflammatory cardiomyopathies are associated with inflammation and impaired function of the&#xD;
      heart muscle and encompass myo- and pericarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis. Due to the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations, establishing the diagnosis and prediction of&#xD;
      outcome is challenging. Specifically for myocarditis, it is associated with acute and chronic&#xD;
      heart failure and sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) allows imaging of tissue characteristics (i.e. edema&#xD;
      and fibrosis). CMR is the primary diagnostic tool in myocarditis and can also be used for&#xD;
      differentiating other inflammatory diseases. Beside the presence of edema, also&#xD;
      hyperemia/capillary leak, fibrosis and myocardial function can be assessed and quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated the prognostic role of CMR features beyond traditional markers&#xD;
      of LV function, but are limited to smaller cohorts and single-center studies. Furthermore,&#xD;
      CMR is a rapidly developing modality and as new features of the modality become available,&#xD;
      additional research is needed to identify which combination of parameters optimize risk&#xD;
      stratification of this heterogenous inflammatory cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the goal of the registry is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of&#xD;
      clinical techniques in inflammatory cardiomyopathies, particularly CMR, and which combination&#xD;
      of features provide the highest potential. This analysis will include new advanced CMR&#xD;
      techniques but will also assess the role of other techniques that may be more cost-efficient&#xD;
      and more widely available, which could be used as a precursor to CMR imaging exams.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inflammatory cardiomyopathies, like myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis are associated with&#xD;
      inflammation of the heart muscle and or pericardium, which is the likely cause of impaired&#xD;
      function of the myocardium. Clinical presentation of these diseases present high variability&#xD;
      - from asymptomatic cases to patients with cardiac arrest or severe heart failure. Due to the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations, establishing the diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      remains challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its high spatial resolution and excellent tissue characterization (i.e. the&#xD;
      identification of edema and fibrosis), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is the&#xD;
      cornerstone in the workup of acute myocarditis and can also be used for differentiating other&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. One of the main criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis&#xD;
      has been the Lake Louise Criteria (LLC), where specifically the inclusion of edema and&#xD;
      fibrosis as assessed by CMR are necessary to make the diagnosis of myocarditis. The first&#xD;
      recommendations released in 2009 indicated 2 of 3 of the following criteria were needed;&#xD;
      presence of edema, hyperemia/capillary leak and/or fibrosis. More recently, 2018 updated&#xD;
      guidelines are broadened to non-ischemic inflammation to include sarcoidosis, systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus and a variety of types of myocarditis. These criteria now include a 2 of 2&#xD;
      criteria with at least one T2-based (edema) and one T1-based (necrosis/fibrosis mostly)&#xD;
      criterion, which can be supported by pericardial effusion or systolic LV wall motion&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, CMR has been reported to be a very strong prognosticator. Traditional markers such&#xD;
      as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), assessed&#xD;
      in CMR are outcome predictors for future adverse cardiac events in myocarditis patients.&#xD;
      Similar findings have been shown in sarcoidosis as well. However, CMR is a rapidly developing&#xD;
      modality and as new features of the modality frequently become available, additional research&#xD;
      is needed to identify the best combination of parameters for risk stratification in patients&#xD;
      with inflammatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT) is a developing contrast-free quantitative method that uses&#xD;
      cine images in routinely acquired CMR scanning and it is able to quantify systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic myocardial deformation in different orientations. CMR-FT has recently been shown to&#xD;
      have diagnostic and prognostic value beyond ejection fraction in patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. Recently, the investigators could show in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School that myocardial&#xD;
      strain using CMR-FT provides independent and incremental prognostic value over clinical&#xD;
      features, ejection fraction and scar (LGE) in patients with myocarditis. CMR-FT may serve as&#xD;
      a novel marker to improve risk stratification in myocarditis. Yet this has not yet been&#xD;
      investigated yet with parametric mapping techniques, nor with other inflammatory&#xD;
      cardiomyopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the registry is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of clinical&#xD;
      techniques in inflammatory cardiomyopathies, particularly CMR, and which combination of&#xD;
      features provide the highest potential. This analysis will include new advanced CMR&#xD;
      techniques like feature tracking and T1- and T2 mapping but will also assess the role of&#xD;
      other techniques that may be more cost-efficient and more widely available, which could be&#xD;
      used as a precursor to CMR imaging exams. Further, other imaging modalities such as&#xD;
      echocardiography and nuclear imaging (I.e. Positron Emission Tomography) and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) findings will be assessed and associated with biomarkers and outcome.&#xD;
