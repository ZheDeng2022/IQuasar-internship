  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of avapritinib in treating malignant solid tumors that&#xD;
      have a genetic change (mutation) in CKIT or PDGFRA and have spread to nearby tissue or lymph&#xD;
      nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body (metastatic). Avapritinib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Avapritinib may&#xD;
      help to control the growth of malignant solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of avapritinib in patients with pathogenic&#xD;
      CKIT or PDGFRA activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors, as assessed by the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the duration of response (DoR) to avapritinib in patients with pathogenic CKIT&#xD;
      or PDGFRA activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of avapritinib in patients with pathogenic&#xD;
      CKIT or PDGFRA activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of avapritinib in patients with pathogenic CKIT&#xD;
      or PDGFRA activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors, as assessed by the National&#xD;
      Cancer institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with pathogenic CKIT or PDGFRA&#xD;
      activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors receiving avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the ORR and DoR of avapritinib in patients with measurable brain or central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with pathogenic CKIT or&#xD;
      PDGFRA activating mutation-positive malignant solid tumors receiving avapritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the correlation between genomic mutations and clinical outcome. V. To&#xD;
      evaluate time on treatment (including patients treated beyond progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate baseline genomics and circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) and&#xD;
      functional analyses of variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive avapritinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
