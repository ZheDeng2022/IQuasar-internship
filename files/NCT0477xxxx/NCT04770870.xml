      The H3 TAR Prosthesis was approved by FDA (P160036) on June 4, 2019. Continued approval of&#xD;
      the premarket approval application (PMA) is contingent upon the submission of periodic&#xD;
      reports (Annual Report), required under 21 CFR 814.84. In order to provide continued&#xD;
      reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the PMA device, data from this&#xD;
      post-approval study must be submitted to FDA in a PMA Post-Approval Study Report per the&#xD;
      requirements set forth in the approval.&#xD;

      The Hintermann Series H3Â® (H3) prosthesis is a mobile bearing total ankle replacement (TAR)&#xD;
      indicated for use as a non-cemented implant to replace a painful arthritic ankle joint due to&#xD;
      primary osteoarthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis or arthritis secondary to inflammatory&#xD;
      disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, hemochromatosis, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present version (third generation) of the H3 TAR and the earlier generations of this&#xD;
      total ankle system have been marketed (initially in 2003) under a license agreement in&#xD;
      Europe, South Korea, Australia, and Canada and other countries outside the U.S. (OUS). The H3&#xD;
      TAR prosthesis has been used in over 20,000 procedures in the markets OUS. The H3 TAR device&#xD;
      has not been withdrawn from marketing for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
