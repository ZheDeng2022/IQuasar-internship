  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GERD is a prevalent condition worldwide, estimated to be around 20-30 % in North America.&#xD;
      Obesity is rapidly increasing with an estimated prevalence of 66% in the adult population in&#xD;
      the United States. Presently, bariatric interventions are the only sustainable method to&#xD;
      address morbid obesity and its resulting comorbidities. One of the most common restrictive&#xD;
      surgeries includes laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Although very effective for&#xD;
      treating obesity, some of these surgeries might cause deleterious effects regarding GERD, due&#xD;
      to anatomical modifications. Refractory GERD is defined by lack of symptom control on maximum&#xD;
      dose of PPI therapy. Cardia Band Ligation Anti-reflux (CLEAR) procedure utilizes multiple&#xD;
      band ligations at the cardia in a 270-degree fashion, resulting in tissue necrosis and scar&#xD;
      formation, narrowing the GE junction and enhancing the flap valve system. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that CLEAR can be a safe and efficient intervention to improve post bariatric&#xD;
      GERD.&#xD;

      GERD is a prevalent condition worldwide, estimated to be around 20-30 % in North America.&#xD;
      Obesity is rapidly increasing with an estimated prevalence of 66% in the adult population in&#xD;
      the United States. GERD symptoms are common in the obese population with data showing weekly&#xD;
      GERD symptoms in 34.6% and erosive esophagitis 26.9% in people with BMI &gt; 30 Kg/m^2. Reflux&#xD;
      is associated with complications such as esophagitis, Barrett's Esophagus and ultimately&#xD;
      esophageal adenocarcinoma. Presently, bariatric interventions are the only sustainable method&#xD;
      to address morbid obesity and its resulting comorbidities. There are endoscopic and surgical&#xD;
      bariatric interventions. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective and efficient&#xD;
      means of achieving significant weight loss in obese individuals. One of the most common&#xD;
      restrictive surgeries includes laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Although very effective&#xD;
      for treating obesity, some of these surgeries might cause deleterious effects regarding GERD,&#xD;
      due to anatomical modifications. LSG can increase the incidence of GERD, which may be&#xD;
      explained from the changes in the angle of His and by increasing intragastric pressure.&#xD;
      Pharmacological therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPI), H2 blockers and lifestyle changes&#xD;
      are first line forms of treatment utilized to control the symptoms related to GERD. However,&#xD;
      patients who use pharmacological treatment experience reduction in quality of life and seek&#xD;
      alternative options. Refractory GERD is defined by lack of symptom control on maximum dose of&#xD;
      PPI therapy. Moreover, due to the anatomical changes associated with bariatric surgeries, the&#xD;
      traditional surgical and endoscopic techniques (TIF, Nissen Fundoplication) used to treat&#xD;
      GERD in the general population are not suitable for these patients. With the current trend of&#xD;
      an increase of bariatric surgery and thus GERD that arises after these surgeries, new&#xD;
      innovative techniques to treat GERD are needed, especially in PPI averse or non-responsive&#xD;
      patients. Cardia Band Ligation Anti-reflux (CLEAR) procedure utilizes multiple band ligations&#xD;
      at the cardia in a 270-degree fashion, resulting in tissue necrosis and scar formation,&#xD;
      narrowing the GE junction and enhancing the flap valve system. The investigators will perform&#xD;
      CLEAR by placing 4 bands at the GEJ. The investigators hypothesized that CLEAR can be a safe&#xD;
      and efficient intervention to improve post bariatric GERD.&#xD;
