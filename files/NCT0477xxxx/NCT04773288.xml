  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of the randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of a digital&#xD;
      intervention on hand hygiene of young children. Children in intervention kindergartens /&#xD;
      elementary schools will see live instructions and feedback on their current hand washing&#xD;
      activity while washing hands. We hypothesize that the digital intervention will improve hand&#xD;
      hygiene practices of children in kindergarten / elementary school.&#xD;

    <measure>Main effects of live feedback on handwashing of children</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Live feedback is hypothesized to change hand washing activities of children in the short- and long-term. Change in hand washing activity is determined with IoT devices measuring water and soap usage (combined into one measure).</description>

    <measure>Effect of one-time education session on handwashing of children</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>One-time educational video is hypothesized to change handwashing activity in the short term but declines with time. Change in hand washing activity is determined with IoT devices measuring water and soap usage (combined into one measure).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Habit formation through live feedback on handwashing of children</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hand washing activities of children are hypothesized to remain changed when live feedback is stopped and in locations where no live feedback is available. Change in hand washing activity is determined with questionnaires for children, parents and educators.</description>
