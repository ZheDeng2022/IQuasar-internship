  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the retrospective cohort study is 1) to determine preoperative risk factors&#xD;
      for revision af patellofemoral arthroplasty, and 2) to provide a detailed description of&#xD;
      indications for revision after patellofemoral arthroplasty. All patients operated with&#xD;
      patellofemoral arthroplasty in Denmark from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2015, will be&#xD;
      included in the cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approx. 11,000 operations with the insertion of a knee arthroplasty (knee prosthesis) are&#xD;
      performed annually DK. The durability and quality of the treatment are assessed with&#xD;
      prosthesis survival, that expresses the proportion of prostheses that are still functional&#xD;
      after a given number of years (eg the 10-year prosthesis survival for all types of knee&#xD;
      prostheses in DK is approximately 94%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unicompartmental implants are increasingly used, so that only the worn part of the knee is&#xD;
      replaced. Especially for osteoarthritis between the patella and the femur, a patellofemoral&#xD;
      prosthesis (PFA - patellofemoral alloplasty) can be inserted, which is much smaller than the&#xD;
      traditional full prosthesis (TKA - total knee arthroplasty).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFA operations are controversial. A recently published Danish study (double-blind RCT)&#xD;
      comparing TKA and PFA has shown that PFA patients achieve greater satisfaction, better knee&#xD;
      function and greater quality of life than TKA patients. A recent study has also demonstrated&#xD;
      that the cost of a PFA procedure is less than that of a TKA. As a paradox to this clear RCT&#xD;
      finding, all national implant registers (Sweden, England, New Zealand, Denmark, etc.) show a&#xD;
      significantly poorer prosthesis survival for PFA compared with TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important for the future treatment of patients with severe osteoarthritis between the&#xD;
      patella and femur to understand the cause of the discrepancy between RCT and registry&#xD;
      results. The discrepancy gives rise to a number of questions regarding. indications,&#xD;
      techniques, competences, postoperative regimens etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The divergence between the RCT and registry studies can only be clarified by a study that 1)&#xD;
      examines the influence of preperative factors (patient history, physical findings, radiology&#xD;
      etc.) on outcome, and that 2) attempts a causal analysis for each reoperation. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to do this though a cohort study including all cases of patellofemoral&#xD;
      arthroplasty performed in Denmark from January 1, 2008 until December 31, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to determine preoperative risk factors for revision after PFA and to provide a&#xD;
      detailed description of indications for revision after PFA.&#xD;

    <description>The cohort consists of all patients operated with patellofemoral arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis in Denmark from Jan 1 2008 to Dec 31 2015. The number of patients is expected to be around 500. A patellofemoral arthroplasty is defined as an arthroplasty consisting of a metal trochlear component and a polyethylene patella component. The definition of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis in the study is pragmatic and given by the operating surgeon.</description>
