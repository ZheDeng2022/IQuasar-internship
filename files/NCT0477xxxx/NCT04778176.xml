  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the DopaFuse System can reduce the&#xD;
      fluctuation of plasma levodopa levels compared to participants' standard intermittent doses&#xD;
      of oral LD/CD tablets (background treatment). It will also assess whether the system is safe,&#xD;
      well tolerated, and can relieve motor symptoms.&#xD;
