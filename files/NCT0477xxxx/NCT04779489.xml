  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically node positive (cN+) bladder cancer carries a poor prognosis, especially in&#xD;
      patients who are unable to receive or fail to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is FDA-approved in advanced bladder cancer for patients&#xD;
      unable to receive or failing to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. The present study&#xD;
      seeks to determine if next-generation radiation therapy (personalized ultrafractionated&#xD;
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, or PULSAR) is feasible and effective in patients&#xD;
      receiving ICI for bulky cN+ bladder cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are eligible for the trial if they have bulky, clinically node-positive (cN+)&#xD;
      bladder cancer and have either recently initiated (within ≤ 1 week) or are planned to&#xD;
      initiate immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy due to either 1) ineligibility for/refusal&#xD;
      of platinum-based downstaging chemotherapy; or 2) failure to achieve a complete clinical&#xD;
      response to platinum-based downstaging chemotherapy. Patients will initiate PULSAR treatment&#xD;
      1-2 weeks after initiating ICI. PULSAR will be administered in 3 fractions of 12 Gy each (36&#xD;
      Gy total) at 12-16 day intervals and patients will undergo radical cystectomy with bilateral&#xD;
      extended pelvic lymph node dissection within 4-8 weeks after completion of PULSAR. ICI&#xD;
      therapy will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing route and schedule and will&#xD;
      be continued during PULSAR treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PULSAR treatment will be initiated 1-2 weeks after the patient is initiated on an&#xD;
      FDA-approved ICI agent. PULSAR will be administered in 3 fractions of 12 Gy each at 12-16 day&#xD;
      intervals. Target areas will include the region of the bladder containing the primary tumor&#xD;
      (confirmed, if necessary, on office flexible cystoscopy at UTSW) and to up to five&#xD;
      targetable, pathologically enlarged bulky lymph nodes (as deemed feasible by the treating&#xD;
      radiation oncologist). Non-enlarged pelvic lymph nodes will be spared to minimize adverse&#xD;
      effects on the tumor immune response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bladder cancer, confirmed pathologically on transurethral resection of bladder tumor&#xD;
             (TURBT) or on bladder biopsy. Pure urothelial, variant urothelial, or any proportion&#xD;
             of squamous cell carcinoma are permitted. Questions about eligibility may be resolved&#xD;
             by consultation with UTSW pathology but formal pathologic review is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bulky, clinically node positive disease (cN+) defined as: 1) a single pelvic lymph&#xD;
             node of ≥ 1.5 cm largest diameter on CT or MRI; or 2) multiple pelvic lymph nodes ≥ 1&#xD;
             cm largest diameter on CT or MRI. Pathologic confirmation is not required. Imaging to&#xD;
             establish eligibility must have been obtained no more than 60 days prior to trial&#xD;
             enrollment. The scans must be personally reviewed by the enrolling clinician. For&#xD;
             imaging studies obtained outside of UT Southwestern, imaging review of node status and&#xD;
             sign off by the enrolling investigator is required. Review and sign off by a UTSW&#xD;
             radiologist is optional in ambiguous or questionable cases, but is not mandatory.&#xD;

             counseling, refusing to receive any-platinum-based chemotherapy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient staged with bulky cN+ disease as defined above, medically ineligible to&#xD;

             radiologic complete response after three or four cycles of platinum-based DCT (failure&#xD;
             of all enlarged lymph nodes to decrease to &lt; 1 cm short-axis diameter)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient, initially staged with bulky cN+ disease as defined above, failing to achieve&#xD;
             radiologic complete response after one or two cycles of platinum-based DCT which was&#xD;
             discontinued due to patient intolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patient, initially not staged with bulky cN+ disease as defined above, who progresses&#xD;
