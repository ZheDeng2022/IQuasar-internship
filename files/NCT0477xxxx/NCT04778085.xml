  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a combined clinical patient outcome study and a health-services research&#xD;
      sub-study. Illness management and recovery (IMR) constitutes an evidence-based practice with&#xD;
      11 modules focusing on personal recovery developed for adults with severe mental health&#xD;
      illnesses. IMR can be offered in groups or individually, once a week for 10-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how young people experience the utility of IMR treatment groups in&#xD;
      child and adolescent mental health outpatient clinics. The primary aim is to explore in-depth&#xD;
      how the participants experience the utility of the IMR approach. The health research&#xD;
      sub-study will provide new insights into the IMR implementation process in outpatient clinics&#xD;
      for adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMR has previously been implemented for adolescents in an inpatient unit in the hospital's&#xD;
      catchment area. In order to offer the same treatment to all young patients, IMR treatment&#xD;
      groups will be established in 4 out of 7 outpatient clinics in the hospital's catchment area.&#xD;
      Participants belonging to the clinics in which no IMR treatment groups are being established&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in IMR groups in clinics nearby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to gain new insight into how young people experience the utility of IMR&#xD;
      treatment groups conducted in outpatient practices and, if relevant, which changes could be&#xD;
      made to adapt IMR more to young people. To explore how the participants experience the&#xD;
      utility of IMR treatment groups, a qualitative focus-group study, consisting of a maximum of&#xD;
      5 focus-group interviews will be conducted. The participants in each IMR treatment group will&#xD;
      be offered treatment once a week up to 10-12 months. To establish an IMR treatment group a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 patients and a maximum of 8 participants must participate. Participants are&#xD;
      mainly being included in the IMR treatment groups at the two primary admissions to each&#xD;
      treatment group. Thus, some of the participants in the focus-groups may have participated in&#xD;
      IMR groups for less than 10-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are related to fidelity to the model and the extent to which IMR treatment&#xD;
      groups are implemented at an organizational level. The treatment groups will be led by&#xD;
      trained IMR-therapists employed in inpatient units, together with therapists in training who&#xD;
      are employed in outpatient clinics. Leaders and other clinicians in the outpatient clinics&#xD;
      will contribute knowledge about the extent to which core components of IMR are being&#xD;
      implemented, as well as information relating to quality improvement and individual&#xD;
      adjustment. Two of the out-patient clinics in which no IMR group is being established will be&#xD;
      included in the sub-study. The clinics will receive written feedback after each measurement&#xD;
      time to support quality improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to include up to 48 participants receiving IMR treatment in outpatient clinics.&#xD;
      Up to 8 hospitalized participants will participate in a pilot focus-group interview. In the&#xD;
      sub-study, a maximum of 16 IMR therapists, trained and in training, and up to 24 staff&#xD;
      members will be invited to participate.&#xD;
