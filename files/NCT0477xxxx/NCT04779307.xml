  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab is a medicine that helps to reduce inflammation and pain in the digestive system.&#xD;
      In this study, children and teenagers with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis will be&#xD;
      treated with vedolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to check if participants achieve remission after treatment with&#xD;
      vedolizumab. Remission means symptoms improve or disappear and an endoscopy shows no or&#xD;
      limited signs of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 3 infusions of vedolizumab over 6 weeks. Then, those who have a&#xD;
      clinical response will receive 1 of 3 doses of vedolizumab once every 8 weeks. They will&#xD;
      receive the same dose every time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to&#xD;
      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 3 doses of vedolizumab IV infusion at Day 1, Week 2, and Week 6&#xD;
      based on their baseline weight in the Induction Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 14, participants who achieve clinical response will be randomized in the 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      2 double-blind dose groups (high dose and low dose) within each of the 3 weight groups and&#xD;
      will receive respective treatment up to Week 46 in the Maintenance Period as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 300 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ≥30 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants &gt;15 to &lt;30 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 150 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants 10 to 15 kg, Vedolizumab 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the discretion of the investigator, participants receiving the low dose (150 or 100 mg) of&#xD;
      vedolizumab IV may be escalated to the high dose (300, 200 or 150 mg) or receive rescue&#xD;
      therapy with corticosteroids, if the participants demonstrate disease worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is up to 3 years. After the Week 54 visit, participants may be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in extension study. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic for the first 72&#xD;
      weeks, and then will be contacted by telephone up to 2 years after last dose for a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 54 Based on Modified Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 54</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission based on the modified Mayo score is defined as stool frequency subscore 0 to 1 and a decrease of 1 or more from Baseline; rectal bleeding subscore of 0; and, endoscopy subscore 0 to 1 (modified so that a score of 1 does not include friability). Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. Modified Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and Mayo endoscopic subscore (findings on endoscopy). Each subscale is graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Here, higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Clinical remission based on the PUCAI score is where a participant achieves clinical remission if he or she has a PUCAI of ≤10 points at Week 54. The PUCAI is composed of 6 clinical items abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency of most stools, number of stools per 24 hours, nocturnal stools, and activity level. The PUCAI score ranges from 0 to 85; a score of &lt;10 denotes remission, 10 to 34 denotes mild disease, 35 to 64 denotes moderate disease, and 65 to 85 denotes severe disease. A clinically significant response to therapy is defined as a reduction in the PUCAI score of ≥20 points. A higher score indicates greater disease activity.</description>

    <description>Clinical response is defined as: 1) maintainence of reduction of ≥2 points and ≥25% from the Baseline partial Mayo score, including a ≥1-point decrease in the Mayo stool frequency subscore and a ≥1-point reduction in the rectal bleeding subscore or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point; 2) ≥20-point decrease from Baseline in the PUCAI score. Partial Mayo score consists of 3 sub-scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and Physician's global assessment. Each subscale is graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9. Higher score indicates more severe disease. PUCAI score is determined as a total of the subscores for each of the six evaluation items (0 to 85), including abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency of most stools, number of stools per 24 hours, nocturnal stools and activity level. A higher score indicates greater disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 158 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect and/or is a important medical event. An AESI (serious or non-serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the compound or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to Takeda may be appropriate. AESIs include: infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity, serious infection, malignancy, or other (liver injury and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]).</description>
