      for a minimally invasive cochlear implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cochlear implant (CI) is a neural prothesis and has been the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss over several decades. The surgical procedure&#xD;
      for cochlear implantation surgery aims to atraumatically insert the electrode array of the&#xD;
      cochlear implant into the cochlea. However, due to the location of the cochlea inside the&#xD;
      skull, the surgeon is required to initially create an access from the surface of the temporal&#xD;
      bone to the cochlea (inner ear). In conventional methods, this access is acquired by removal&#xD;
      of large portions of the mastoid bone through a wide mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy.&#xD;
      The outcome and success of the conventional procedure varies due to mainly two factors:&#xD;
      surgeon skill and subject anatomical variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these variables toward a more consistent and less invasive cochlear implantation&#xD;
      surgery, the development of robotic and image guided cochlear implantation has taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study primarily aims to explore the efficacy of the HEARO robotic cochlear implantation&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • explore the efficacy of a minimally invasive direct cochlear access via the HEARO&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  explore the safety of a minimally invasive direct cochlear access via the HEARO&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exploratively evaluate the electrode array insertion outcomes through the direct tunnel&#xD;
           access.&#xD;
