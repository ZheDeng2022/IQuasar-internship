  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a novel sleep aid known as&#xD;
      SlumberCurve™, which serves as an adjustable form of a wedge pillow, on sleep quality and&#xD;
      pain management following rotator cuff repair. The researchers hypothesize that SlumberCurve™&#xD;
      will significantly improve sleep quality and reduce night-time pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor sleep quality is prevalent among patients undergoing rotator cuff repair surgery, and&#xD;
      negatively affects the potential for proper healing. Without adequate sleep, the production&#xD;
      of anabolic steroids and inflammatory cytokines are diminished. These anabolic steroids and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines play a key role in postoperative healing, resulting in adequate pain&#xD;
      regulation and increased patient satisfaction. Therefore adequate sleep quality is important&#xD;
      not only for quality of life, but for postoperative healing. A recent systematic review&#xD;
      revealed that some studies reported varying degrees in both the time and magnitude of change&#xD;
      in return to adequate sleep quality following rotator cuff repair. This study hopes to&#xD;
      address this gap in the literature by investigating a novel sleep aid, SlumberCurve, and its&#xD;
      effect on sleep quality and night-time pain relief. SlumberCurve is a Class I Medical Device&#xD;
      and is currently advocated to relieve tension and diminish pain in patients undergoing&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair surgery. The device provides adjustable elevation of the torso as well as&#xD;
      concave positioning, placing the shoulder in a more forward position. This novel sleep aid&#xD;
      has the potential to increase sleep quality, and therefore enhance both patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and postoperative recovery from rotator cuff repair surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Fitbit Sleep Data - Time spent awake, restless, and asleep</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Estimates of time spent awake, restless, and asleep will be assessed. All three measures will be recorded in minutes. Restless sleep indicates movement, and excessive movement will indicates time spent awake.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fitbit Sleep Data - Sleep Stages</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep stages are estimated by utilizing movement and heart rate variability. Sleep stages are categorized into light sleep, deep sleep, and REM. Collective time spent in each stage will be recorded in minutes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI tracks sleep disturbances over time and includes seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. Total of 21 points. Scores of less than 5 indicate adequate sleep. Scores of greater than 5 indicate poor sleep.</description>

    <description>Patients who undergo rotator cuff repair and have been consented and randomized to the experimental group will be given a Slumber Curve sleep aid to be used during sleep. Each device will be numbered and recorded in the patient's REDCap entry for future reference if needed. Following administration of the Slumber Curve, patients will be given instructions on how to use the sleep aid while sleeping, and will be asked to use Slumber Curve nightly.</description>
