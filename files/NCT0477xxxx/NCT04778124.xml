    <textblock>
      A wide variety of methods has been proposed for treating hemorrhoidal disease with excisional&#xD;
      hemorrhoidectomy remaining the gold standard. The aim of this trial is to assess the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of the HAL-RAR technique in treating hemorrhoidal disease. Arterial&#xD;
      ligation was performed by using the highest doppler signal to locate the site of the&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal artery in combination with RAR in order to reposition redundant rectal&#xD;
      mucosa/submucosa that prolapses to its original anatomical location, leading to resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study from January 2010 to November 2019 of patients who underwent&#xD;
      HAL-RAR for hemorrhoidal disease. Demographics, degree of disease, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, complications (urinary retention, dyschezia, bleeding, necrosis of a&#xD;
      hemorrhoid, anal discomfort, sensation of fullness) and recurrence were recorded. Patients&#xD;
      were followed-up at postoperative day 1 and 8, and at 1, 6 and 12 months. The main outcome of&#xD;
      the study was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications,&#xD;
      postoperative pain and patient-assessed resolution of symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, single-institution, study conducted from January 2010 to November&#xD;
      2019. Grade of hemorrhoidal disease was assessed according to Goligher's classification.&#xD;
      Patients with grade II, resistant to conservative treatment, grade III and IV hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      disease that underwent the HAL-RAR technique, were included in the study. Patients with grade&#xD;
      II disease presented a small degree of prolapse. Non-surgical techniques, such as rubber-band&#xD;
      ligation or injection of sclerosing agents, were not performed prior to the HAL-RAR operation&#xD;
      since this is not a common practice in our institution. Conservative treatment for grade II&#xD;
      hemorrhoids included diet rich in fiber, lifestyle modifications (increased fluid intake,&#xD;
      improved anal hygiene, avoiding staining and constipation), the use of phlebotonics and other&#xD;
      topical ointments that contained a combination of local anesthetics, corticosteroids and&#xD;
      antiseptics, designed to relieve symptoms of pruritus and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was reviewed and approved by the institution's ethics committee. Detailed informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients before the operative procedure. Exclusion criterion&#xD;
      included age &lt;18 years, pregnancy, coagulation disorders, patients with major comorbidities&#xD;
      (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] ≥3), psychiatric conditions preventing&#xD;
      collaboration and follow-up, other concomitant anorectal disease (rectal prolapse, anal&#xD;
      fissure, anal stenosis, perianal fistula or abscess, fecal incontinence) and previous pelvic&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Preoperative clinical assessment and classification for all patients included&#xD;
      complete medical history particularly underlining hemorrhoidal disease-related symptoms,&#xD;
      physical examination, proctoscopy, and rigid sigmoidoscopy. Further investigation was&#xD;
      performed when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, degree of hemorrhoidal disease, length of hospital stay, perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative data were recorded. Clinical assessment and surgery were performed by two of&#xD;
      the authors trained and experienced with the technique. Patients did not receive a solid diet&#xD;
      after 10:00p.m. the night before surgery. Preoperative preparation included one or two&#xD;
      phosphate enemas before the procedure. Antibiotic prophylaxis was not considered mandatory&#xD;
      and was not administered. The severity of pain was self-evaluated by the patients using a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 indicating the absence of pain and 10 the worst possible&#xD;
      pain. Data about analgesic consumption was also recorded. Postoperatively, intravenous&#xD;
      Paracetamol 3gr and Parecoxid 80mg was administered daily, and in cases of severe pain&#xD;
      Tramadol 500mg was given upon request. Patients were discharged when adequate pain control&#xD;
      was achieved. They were examined by the surgeon to rule out early complications and ensure&#xD;
      the outcome of the operation. Patients were advised to avoid prolonged straining and heavy&#xD;
      physical activity for 1 month and to consume at least 2 liters of water per day and a diet&#xD;
      rich in fiber, supplemented by the oral consumption of stool softeners. After discharge, oral&#xD;
      analgesics were prescribed that consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and oral&#xD;
      narcotics. Patients were followed-up on postoperative day 1 and 8, and at 1, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      and evaluated with a proctologic examination. A patient directed diary card to assess the&#xD;
      resolution of symptoms was implemented. Recurrence was evaluated after physical examination&#xD;
      and defined as relapse of symptoms such as bleeding or prolapse often daily requiring manual&#xD;
      reduction. The main outcome of the study was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included&#xD;
      postoperative complications, postoperative pain and patient-assessed resolution of symptoms.&#xD;
      Continuous variables are presented as median values and range, and categorical variables, as&#xD;
      numbers and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique The operation was performed, with the patient in the lithotomy position,&#xD;
      under general or spinal anesthesia according to the patient's preference in consultation with&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist. Perianal block was not offered as an alternative. The region is then&#xD;
      treated with an antiseptic solution. After lubrication with xylocaine gel, the anal canal is&#xD;
      dilated to a width of two fingers to allow insertion of the proctoscope. The HAL proctoscope,&#xD;
      equipped with a doppler transducer (HAL II Doppler, A.M.I., Feldkirch, Austria) which is&#xD;
      orientated just below the proctoscope's lateral ligation window, allows the identification&#xD;
      and the selective ligation of the hemorrhoidal artery. In addition, a built-in light source&#xD;
      provides illumination for easy placement of sutures under direct vision. As the submucosal&#xD;
      terminal branches of the superior hemorrhoidal artery are best identified with the Doppler&#xD;
      signal 2cm above the dentate line, the proctoscope was inserted 5-6 cm above the anal verge&#xD;
      for best localization. The operation started and ended at the 12 o'clock position. The&#xD;
      proctoscope was then rotated clockwise in search of the 6 main terminal branches, usually&#xD;
      located at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock. Once identified, the proctoscope was slowly&#xD;
      withdrawn distally until the best Doppler signal was obtained. Arterial ligation was then&#xD;
      performed with a &quot;Z&quot; suture using 2-0 polyglycolic acid and 5/8-inch needle. A knot-pusher&#xD;
      was used to secure the suture. The lateral ligation window in the proctoscope's lumen was&#xD;
      used to calculate the exact depth of the transfixed sutures. By inserting the tip of the&#xD;
      needle holder inside the pivot hole before suturing, it ensured a maximum depth of 6mm,&#xD;
      primarily involving the mucosa and submucosa, avoiding the perforation of the entire rectal&#xD;
      wall. Eradication or significant reduction of the Doppler signal when tying the suture&#xD;
      confirmed the successful arterial ligation. The proctoscope was rotated clockwise at the same&#xD;
      level to locate further arteries. Once a full rotation had been completed, the procedure was&#xD;
      repeated 15mm below the first series of sutures. The number of arterial ligations ranged from&#xD;
      6 to 10. After completion of the arterial ligation the RAR procedure, known as mucopexy, was&#xD;
      performed where hemorrhoidal prolapse was detected. Using the same proctoscope, the outer&#xD;
      sleeve is removed, in order to expand the operating window and expose a wider rectal mucosal&#xD;
      area. The prolapsing tissue comes under direct vision inside the proctoscope's lumen. RAR is&#xD;
      carried out with a continuous suture along the longitudinal axis in a proximal-to-distal&#xD;
      direction in the lower part of the rectum with the same 2-0 polyglycolic acid and 5/8-inch&#xD;
      needle. The continuous suture of the mucosa and submucosa can be performed repeatedly&#xD;
      according to the size and extent of the prolapse and must always entrap the site of the&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal artery with suture above and below. It is important to ensure 5mm distance&#xD;
      between each suture, to avoid tissue ischemia and ensure sufficient venous outflow from the&#xD;
      hemorrhoids. The continuous suture ends up to 1cm proximal to the dentate line, sparing the&#xD;
      anal canal, avoiding postoperative pain. After securing the continuous suture the redundant&#xD;
      rectal mucosa/submucosa that prolapses is repositioned to its original anatomical location.&#xD;
      The number of RAR performed ranged from 1 to 5, while special attention was given to stay&#xD;
      above the dentate line.&#xD;
