      This study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      MEDI7352 in healthy participants.&#xD;

      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of up to 36 days (approximately 5 weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Treatment Period of 6 weeks where participants will be given 1 dose of study treatment&#xD;
           every 2 weeks (4 doses in total). Participants will be required to stay in the Clinical&#xD;
           Unit from Days -1 to 8 (Visit 2), from Days 14 to 15 (Visit 6), from Days 28 to 29&#xD;
           (Visit 9), and from Days 42 to 50 (Visit 12). In addition, participants will have&#xD;
           multiple visits to the Clinical Unit to complete the study assessments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Period of 42 days (6 weeks) where participants will also have multiple&#xD;
           visits to the Clinical Unit to complete the study assessments, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final Follow-up Visit after 42 days after the Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive fixed multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of MEDI7352 or placebo on 4&#xD;
      occasions; one dose every 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43, under fasted conditions.&#xD;
