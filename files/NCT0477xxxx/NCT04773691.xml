  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fight against alcoholism is a public health priority. Around 15 million Europeans and 10&#xD;
      million North Americans are alcohol dependent. Worldwide, 1 death out of 25 is thought to be&#xD;
      attributed to alcohol. In France, the latest published data on alcohol-related mortality&#xD;
      indicates that there were 49,000 alcohol-related deaths in 2009. Alcohol is thought to be the&#xD;
      leading cause of hospitalisation for French people, and its social cost is estimated at 37.4&#xD;
      billion euros.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few patients with an alcohol use disorder are treated: less than 8% in Europe and&#xD;
      less than 10.5% in the USA receive appropriate treatment for their alcohol problem. This low&#xD;
      rate of treatment is mainly due to the fact that these patients are not ready to stop&#xD;
      drinking. They are therefore not attracted by the goal of abstinence that is required by most&#xD;
      current therapies and drug treatments. The arrival of new treatments aimed at reducing&#xD;
      consumption (rather than abstinence) should make treatment more attractive. To date, nalmefen&#xD;
      is the only treatment marketed for this indication. Baclofen should be marketed in 2020, but&#xD;
      with restrictive prescription criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this new strategy to reduce consumption, brain stimulation could play a predominant role&#xD;
      as an alternative or complementary therapy. Indeed, functional brain imaging techniques have&#xD;
      made it possible to visualise the cortical regions involved in craving, in particular the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Craving, i.e. the irrepressible desire to consume, is&#xD;
      often at the origin of consumption and relapse. Stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex with non-invasive cerebral stimulation techniques, such as repeated transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has provided encouraging results for the reduction of cravings&#xD;
      in all addictive behaviours (alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, food). Furthermore, stimulation of&#xD;
      the DLPFC seems to modulate decision-making processes: it may thus reduce impulsivity and&#xD;
      strengthen inhibitory control, leading to a reduction in substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation allows a&#xD;
      reduction in alcohol consumption in patients with an alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
