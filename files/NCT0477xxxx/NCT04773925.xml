  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if mind and body counseling and training&#xD;
      improves quality of life in women undergoing treatment for chronic pelvic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic illnesses are expected to self-manage much of their treatment. Barriers&#xD;
      include limited time during appointments, consultations with multiple different providers,&#xD;
      technical communication style, health literacy issues, and a sense of feeling overwhelmed.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pain syndromes experience symptoms which can negatively impact their&#xD;
      quality of life by interfering with ability to sleep, work, and function in their social&#xD;
      roles. One proposed mechanism in chronic pain management is mindfulness. Mindfulness is the&#xD;
      intentional and non-judgmental conscious awareness of the present moment, or &quot;paying&#xD;
      attention on purpose&quot; with the goal of physical and psychological health improvement.&#xD;
      Participants are taught autonomy, increasing self-regulation, and focusing awareness on a&#xD;
      particular goal or activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a mind-body counselor will improve patient engagement and&#xD;
      promote adherence to pain coping treatments. If the initial findings from this project&#xD;
      support the use of Integrative Medicine services in women with chronic pelvic pain, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to expand this study to a larger, randomized controlled trial that is&#xD;
      adequately powered to determine significant difference among participants in the control and&#xD;
      study groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Women with chronic pelvic pain will be recruited during outpatient visits to Mayo Clinic Florida. Baseline patient-reported outcomes will be obtained using the PROMIS-CAT questionnaire. Questionnaires will be assigned in the electronic medical record. All subjects will receive standard care for their chronic pelvic pain, including a consultation with a gynecologist. Patients will then be referred for three 60-minute mindfulness counseling sessions conducted via telemedicine with a certified Mind-Body Counselor who has a degree in Social Work in the department of Integrative Medicine. The initial consultation will consist of a 60-minute individual session. The subsequent sessions will be group visits (anticipate 5 subjects per group) lasting 60 minutes. PROMIS-CAT questionnaires will be repeated at 3 months and 6 months, and a satisfaction survey will be distributed at the completion of the program.</intervention_model_description>
