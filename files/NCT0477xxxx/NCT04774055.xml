    <textblock>
      Brain injury remains the leading cause of death in comatose patients resuscitated from OHCA.&#xD;
      One of the most challenging aspects in the treatment of a post-cardiac arrest patient is the&#xD;
      assessment of the extent of brain damage. Reliable, clinical measures of ongoing brain injury&#xD;
      have potential to guide individualized treatment and potentially improve outcomes. Persistent&#xD;
      candidate measures to fill this role is combined cerebral metabolism monitoring assessed by&#xD;
      jugular bulb microdialysis (JBM) and positron emission tomography (PET) of 18-Fluor&#xD;
      deoxyglucose ([F-18]-FDG). This multimodal neuromonitoring is cutting-edge technology used in&#xD;
      a clinical setting&#xD;

      Background Survival rates around 50 % are reported in comatose patients treated with&#xD;
      hypothermia in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The&#xD;
      high risk of ICU death is generally due to the primary hypoxic-ischemic insult, and&#xD;
      subsequently secondary brain damage caused by prolonged insufficient cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (CBF), disturbed autoregulation, ischemia-reperfusion injury and compromised cerebral energy&#xD;
      metabolism injury. Conclusive evidence of secondary cerebral ischemia following cardiac&#xD;
      arrest has been elusive. Secondary injury is a significant determinant of neurologic outcome,&#xD;
      and alleviating its deleterious effects is a mainstay of post-cardiac arrest management. This&#xD;
      far, the clinicians still need more accurate monitoring methods to identify and manage&#xD;
      potential reversible ongoing brain ischemia, and predicting early neurological outcome in the&#xD;
      ICU. Methods measuring global brain ischemia and reflecting metabolic perturbations after&#xD;
      resuscitation are needed for a more individualized post-resuscitation care-and target-driven&#xD;
      therapy to improve patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jugular bulb microdialysis (JBM) allows global cerebral metabolic variables of the draining&#xD;
      venous blood to be monitored continuously and provides data on substrate supply and&#xD;
      metabolism at the cellular level in the brain. The ability to measure global brain&#xD;
      metabolites concentration of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, lactate to pyruvate ratio (LPR),&#xD;
      glutamate and glycerol at the bedside has provided the option of utilizing JBM as a clinical&#xD;
      brain-monitor. High LPR &gt; 30 is considered a robust indicator of anaerobic metabolism (low&#xD;
      pyruvate) and is an independent predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome in traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury among patients monitored with MD (1-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has recently published that I) metabolic monitoring in the jugular bulb is&#xD;
      representative of the overall cerebral metabolism and can be used in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      compromised global cerebral metabolism during cardiac surgery (7) and II) global JBM&#xD;
      indicating isolated early brain injury was found after OHCA and consecutive resuscitation&#xD;
      (study in press) III) preliminary JBM data indicates that approximately 30 % of comatose OHCA&#xD;
      survivors (cerebral performance category 3-5, poor neurological outcome) are suffering from&#xD;
      early secondary brain ischemia (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further advances in the knowledge of cerebral metabolism have been achieved by applying&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) of 18-Fluor deoxyglucose ([F-18]-FDG) to OHCA patients,&#xD;
      enabling cerebral metabolic rate of glucose CMRglc to be quantified (9-10). PET provides a&#xD;
      global metabolic map of the whole brain but only for the duration of the scan. FDG-PET&#xD;
      measurement is primarily a marker of glucose uptake, which cannot be used to determine the&#xD;
      fate of this brain fuel. At the same time, the JBM variables have the potential of displaying&#xD;
      several options regarding the fate of glucose and signs of metabolic crisis. It is in this&#xD;
      context that the present study attempts to determine if there is a metabolic crisis due to&#xD;
      ischemia or due to mechanisms other than ischemia by examining global brain tissue with&#xD;
      combined positron emission tomography and jugular bulb microdialysis. The sensitivity of JBM&#xD;
      to detect relevant secondary brain injury in cardiac arrest patients is further investigated&#xD;
      through comparative imaging with PET-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The study aim to use 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) combined&#xD;
      with jugular bulb microdialysis to investigate pathophysiological brain derangements&#xD;
      following cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary endpoint: The difference in overall CMRglc at day 0 and 3 after OHCA&#xD;
      between neurological outcome groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correlation between JBM variables and the overall CMRglc on day 0 and 3 after OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do the patterns of PET-verified global glucose metabolism reflect the early global&#xD;
           neuro-metabolic pattern (ischemia/mitochondrial dysfunction) obtained by jugular bulb&#xD;
           microdialysis following OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method A prospective feasibility study designed to investigate pathophysiological brain&#xD;
      derangements following cardiac arrest using combined 18-FDG-PET with jugular bulb&#xD;
      microdialysis (JBM). Ten unconscious patients admitted to the ICU, with sustained return of&#xD;
      spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will be included. Assent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For detection of early global brain ischemia in the post-resuscitation phase jugular bulb&#xD;
      microdialysis catheters will be implanted as fast as possible after ICU admission. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for 96 hours or until arousal or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.&#xD;
      Intravenous microdialysis catheters (CMA 67 IV 130 mm, membrane length 10 mm, MDialysis AB,&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden) with 20 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes enable the measurement of&#xD;
      energy-related metabolites: glucose, lactate, pyruvate, LPR, glutamate and glycerol. The&#xD;
      samples will be collected in microvials for analysis every one hour by enzymatic photometric&#xD;
      techniques, and presented bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET will be obtained on day 0 and 3 after OHCA regardless of neurological status.&#xD;
      Neurological outcome is assessed at hospital discharge according to the Cerebral Performance&#xD;
      Category (CPC) scale: CPC 1 - no neurological deficit; CPC 2 - mild to moderate dysfunction;&#xD;
      CPC 3 - severe dysfunction; CPC 4 - coma; and CPC 5 - death. CPC scores of 1 and 2 are&#xD;
      considered as 'good' outcomes and a CPC 3-5 'poor' outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations Lateralization in cerebral venous drainage may affect jugular bulb sampling.&#xD;
      Although, the investigators use bedside ultrasound to identify the dominant jugular vein, and&#xD;
      the JBM technique is applied to a condition producing strictly global cerebral injury and&#xD;
      hypoxic ischemia. Clinicians are not blinded to data obtained bedside from jugular bulb&#xD;
      microdialysis, so all outcome assessors will be blinded to minimize the risk of bias.&#xD;
      Simultaneously cerebral blood flow cannot be estimated due to logistics and operational&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected clinical impact The mortality of patients who are admitted in a comatose state&#xD;
      following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest remains high. Combined JBM and&#xD;
      FDG-PET have the clinical potential to provide novel insights in dynamic pathogenic metabolic&#xD;
      patterns related to secondary brain injury. Combining these two technologies would,&#xD;
      therefore, appear to be attractive aiming at exploring whether brain tissue after a period of&#xD;
      global transient ischemia displays biochemical signs of ongoing ischemia. In the future, this&#xD;
      multimodal approach might optimize brain metabolism and individualize the treatment of&#xD;
      post-cardiac arrest patients suffering from secondary ischemia and potentially improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project feasibility The research group has shown that metabolic monitoring in the jugular&#xD;
      bulb is representative of the overall cerebral metabolism and can be used in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      compromised global cerebral metabolism in a clinical setting. The next step is to combine&#xD;
      jugular bulb microdialysis with FDG-PET in a pilot study to prove the feasibility of this&#xD;
      novel combined technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will not interfere with or delay routine diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures. The ethical justification for participating in the COMA-PROTECT study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of cerebral metabolism in comatose patients resuscitated after OHCA cannot be&#xD;
      gained outside the acute setting.&#xD;
