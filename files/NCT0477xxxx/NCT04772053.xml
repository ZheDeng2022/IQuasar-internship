      This is a single arm interventional molecular analysis study with no administration of&#xD;
      investigational product and no masking. This multicenter study will involve participants with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic disease for the purpose of collecting tumor tissue and blood samples for&#xD;
      broad molecular analysis and examining the expression of specific biomarkers using validated&#xD;
      clinical assays.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is a candidate for molecular screening for a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)&#xD;
             precision therapeutic clinical study (the Intended Treatment Protocol) that is being&#xD;
             conducted in parallel at or nearby the MDCI recruitment site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is willing to travel to a site recruiting for the intended GSK treatment&#xD;
             protocol (or alternative treatment protocol), if feasible, and if, in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion, the participant would benefit from enrolment into the intended&#xD;
             GSK treatment protocol at an alternative clinical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with confirmed advanced/metastatic diagnosis of solid malignancy in one&#xD;
             of the following disease-areas: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), Breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with life expectancy of greater than (&gt;) 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are able to provide blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are able to provide an archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded&#xD;
             (FFPE) tumor specimen from a current lesion/most current setting (from no more than 2&#xD;
             years ago). If an archival tumor specimen is not available, surplus tissue from&#xD;
             standard of care procedures is acceptable before fresh biopsy may be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding,&#xD;
             and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a woman of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP) or Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly&#xD;
             effective (with a failure rate of less than [&lt;]1 percent [%] per year), preferably&#xD;
             with low user dependency; A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test&#xD;
             (urine or serum) as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before tumor&#xD;
             biopsy; and if a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (for example, an ambiguous&#xD;
             result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be&#xD;
             excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and&#xD;
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early&#xD;
             undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with&#xD;
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &gt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of myocardial infarction, acute inflammatory heart disease,&#xD;
             unstable angina, or uncontrolled arrhythmia within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female participants, pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder or other&#xD;
             conditions that could interfere with the participant's safety, obtaining informed&#xD;
             consent or compliance to the screening study procedures.&#xD;
