      The purpose of this research study is to develop a better understanding of vascular stains&#xD;
      and to improve the usual laser treatment for vascular stain by using optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT). This study is being done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#xD;
      (UW-Madison) and University of California, Irvine. A total of about 115 people will&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;

      Vascular stains, commonly called &quot;port wine birthmarks,&quot; are vascular anomalies that affect&#xD;
      0.3-0.5% of newborns; they impact quality of life due to soft tissue overgrowth, nodularity&#xD;
      and life-altering, stigmatizing disfigurement. Laser treatment is the standard of care and&#xD;
      relies on photocoagulation of vessels. Yet less than 25% are reported to clear entirely; the&#xD;
      reason for this lack of response is poorly understood. Recently, mosaic mutations in genes&#xD;
      that control cell-cycle regulation including GNAQ, GNA11, PiK3CA and others were elucidated&#xD;
      as a genetic cause for these birthmarks. This finding has transformed our fundamental&#xD;
      understanding of their pathophysiology. It provides a molecular explanation for limited&#xD;
      responsiveness to laser, as these genes share oncogenic pathways that result in synchronous,&#xD;
      tightly regulated cellular proliferation and growth. Most importantly, this discovery has&#xD;
      unlocked the potential to utilize pharmacologic blockade of activated downstream pathways to&#xD;
      improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to utilize novel imaging to highlight differences in the vasculature of&#xD;
      vascular birthmarks with genotyping and deep, paired clinical phenotyping, and to create a&#xD;
      targeted laser algorithm based on genotype and age. In a small subset of patients with&#xD;
      confirmed GNAQ/GNA11 genotyping, the investigators will utilize single cell spatial&#xD;
      transcriptome profiling of affected tissue to drive drug discovery. Upon completion of this&#xD;
      project, the investigators will have refined genotype-phenotype correlations enhanced by&#xD;
      novel imaging of targeted tissue, elucidating differences in the vasculature by genotype, all&#xD;
      of which may accelerate precision-based treatments to prevent disfigurement and improve&#xD;
      quality of life. These results will provide critical data for implementation of clinical&#xD;
      trials that will shift treatment paradigms from a single, ineffective destructive treatment&#xD;
      modality to a targeted pharmacologic intervention coupled with light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that clearance of port wine birthmarks will require: 1) A&#xD;
      precision-based approach including optimal laser dosimetry informed by novel angiographic&#xD;
      imaging, age, and genotype, and 2) pathway specific-targeted pharmacologic blockade of&#xD;
      activated pathways informed by investigation of downstream effectors. The long-term goal is&#xD;
      to shift treatment paradigms from a single ineffective destructive modality to a targeted&#xD;
      laser source coupled with targeted topical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Correlate genotype with clinical phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.1 Correlate genotype with comprehensive phenotyping on available participants in&#xD;
           Strata A and Strata B. When stratified by participant age, the hypothesis is that&#xD;
           genotype will influence vessel size, with greater cell-cycle activation associated with&#xD;
           larger median vessel diameter and depth on OCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.2 Correlate clinical phenotype with dynamic optical coherence tomography (OCT) in&#xD;
           Strata A and Strata B. The investigators hypothesize that participant age will be the&#xD;
           greatest predictor of median vessel size and depth on OCT. The investigators expect to&#xD;
           see diversity in the architecture and patterning of the vasculature based on genotype.&#xD;
           The hypothesis is GNAQ mutated patients will demonstrate significant vascular&#xD;
           distortion, with drop out and vascular dilation as has been reported in the ocular OCT&#xD;
           literature in patients with Sturge Weber Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.3 Collect both quantitative and qualitative outcomes in participants treated with OCT&#xD;
           to evaluate the participant experience utilizing this adjuvant modality in treatment in&#xD;
           Strata B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1.4 Integrate OCT data to create a targeted laser algorithm by age and/or genotype to&#xD;
           optimize photo-coagulation of mutated cells in Strata B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanism of facial vascular stains to develop&#xD;
      pathway-specific therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.1 In 4-6 children with confirmed GNAQ/GNA11 mutations in Strata A or Strata B, perform&#xD;
           biopsies from affected and normal tissue, collect blood and saliva samples, to&#xD;
           facilitate targeted high-depth next generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2.2 Identify novel downstream genotype-specific targets using unbiased spatial&#xD;
           transcriptomic analysis through single cell genotyping of participants in Strata A or&#xD;
           Strata B with targeted evaluation of 3 pathways for which topical inhibitors are&#xD;
           currently in development (PiK3CA, mTOR, and MEK/ERK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent has been obtained, a visual skin exam will be done by the study&#xD;
      dermatologist to document the cutaneous findings and photographs of the affected area(s) will&#xD;
      be taken for this study. The photographs will be used to determine the genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      correlations and will be shared with the coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs will be stored electronically in a secure HIPAA compliant manner according to&#xD;
      each site's policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment or at a subsequent visit, but only once during participation in the&#xD;
      study, subjects can agree to provide any of the following non-medically necessary samples for&#xD;
      genetic studies: blood sample, saliva sample, skin punch biopsy (normal skin or affected&#xD;
      skin), surgical tissue specimens, paraffin-embedded tissue samples (from previous surgeries).&#xD;
      Collection of any of these samples is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment participants will be placed onto Strata Arm A - one time OCT&#xD;
      measurements or Strata B - serial OCT measurements that are taken in association with&#xD;
      standard of care laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who will proceed onto Strata A will have one-time OCT measurements of their&#xD;
      vascular stain if they choose not to/are not eligible for/have previously undergone standard&#xD;
      of care laser treatment for their vascular stain at the time of enrollment. The indication&#xD;
      for Strata A is that some patients will elect not to undergo laser treatment, particularly if&#xD;
      they have been extensively treated with laser previously, or have a light pink vascular stain&#xD;
      that has been stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who will proceed onto Strata B will have serial OCT measurements of their&#xD;
      vascular stain performed prior to the start of standard of care laser treatment. OCT will be&#xD;
      performed prior to each standard of care laser treatment if the participant has elected to&#xD;
      have standard of care laser treatment as treatment of their vascular stain at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are enrolled to Strata A and undergo a one time OCT measurement may go onto&#xD;
      Strata B if, at a later time they decide to undergo standard of care laser treatment for&#xD;
      their vascular stain. These participants will still only be able to participate in the above&#xD;
      sample collections one time during their participation. Transition from Strata A to Strata B&#xD;
      is not considered a second enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will remain on study until the study has been closed. Participants will be&#xD;
      able to perform sample collections at any visit while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical phenotyping of participants will be augmented through use of dynamic OCT to&#xD;
      characterize the mean diameter and depth of blood vessels. OCT is a non-invasive, skin&#xD;
      specific technology that enables rapid identification of the mode blood vessel diameter,&#xD;
      vessel density and depth within the area scanned. It is effectively like placing an&#xD;
      ultrasound probe on the participant's skin. The probe is 6 x 6 mm and within 60 seconds of&#xD;
      placement, provides the most common (mode) blood vessel diameter detected, along with the&#xD;
      depth of the vascular plexus. OCT should be painless and of minimal risk to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on Strata B, OCT will be performed at baseline and prior to each standard of&#xD;
      care laser treatment. Anatomic landmarks for choice of OCT placement will be decided by the&#xD;
      study physician, with the goal to image the most prominent area of the stain. In a subset of&#xD;
      participants, OCT measurements will also be taken post standard of care laser treatment.&#xD;
      Anatomic landmarks for choice in this subset, will be decided by the study physician; the&#xD;
      lightest area of the stain will also be imaged to contrast differences between vessel&#xD;
      diameter as this would impact the choice of optimal laser settings in differing areas of the&#xD;
      stain. The number of areas in which OCT will be performed over the vascular stain will be&#xD;
      determined by the treating physician based on the size of the vascular stain. The altered&#xD;
      laser settings used for the standard of care laser treatment will be guided by use of the&#xD;
      theory of selective photothermolysis to determine optimal pulse duration of the laser based&#xD;
      on OCT measurement. This will adhere to acceptable standards of care, and will ultimately be&#xD;
      at the discretion of the laser surgeon. The study physician will also aim to measure the same&#xD;
      areas prior to each visit, with the expectation that the size of the stain is likely to vary&#xD;
      based on treatment resolution of the vascular stain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on Strata B, a questionnaire will be completed at each visit by the&#xD;
      participant and by the parent/guardian of participants ages 8-17 years. The questionnaire&#xD;
      will ask how the participants and/or their parent/guardian feel about the results of the&#xD;
      laser treatment and how they feel about using OCT in addition to their standard treatment. A&#xD;
      questionnaire will not be performed for participants on Strata A.&#xD;
