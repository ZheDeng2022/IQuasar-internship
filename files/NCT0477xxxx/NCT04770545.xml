      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who participated in Study APL2-103 (NCT03777332) or&#xD;
      completed the treatment at Month 24 of either Study APL2-303 (Derby, NCT03525613) or Study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ocular-specific inclusion criteria apply to the study eye only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have participated in APL2-103 (NCT03777332) or completed the treatment&#xD;
             at Month 24 of either APL2-303 (Derby, NCT03525613) or APL2-304 (Oaks, NCT03525600).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects who participated in either the 303 or 304 studies, the condition listed&#xD;
             below must also be met for participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who did not fully stop study drug treatment, but missed the visit at&#xD;
                  Month 24, can also participate in the study. However, to participate, subjects&#xD;
                  must be seen within 60 days from the last day of the period allowed for the 24&#xD;
                  months visit in the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The eyes of subjects must have transparency to permit visualization of parts inside&#xD;
             the eye such as the retina and subjects must be able to look steadily at a provided&#xD;
             target allowing the doctor to get good quality pictures from the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women that cannot have children, or&#xD;

               -  Women who can have children must have a negative result of a blood pregnancy test&#xD;
                  on the first day of the study visit and agree to use ways to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
                  during the study and 90 days after the last dose of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males with female partners who can get pregnant must also agree to use ways to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy and agree not to donate sperm while in the study or until 90 days after&#xD;
             administering the last dose of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to participate in the study by signing the consent document providing&#xD;
             information about the study; and take part in all tests and assessments as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects cannot take part in the study if the eye that will be treated during the study&#xD;
        currently meets any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants in APL2 303/304 studies who fully stopped study drug treatment before the&#xD;
             visit in month 24 but remain in the study to observe the study medication's safety.&#xD;
             Those subjects who temporarily paused study drug treatment are still eligible to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If, according to your doctor you currently have any disease affecting your eyes that&#xD;
             could interfere with your vision, including diseases that affect your retina or macula&#xD;
             (the center of the back of your eyes). And, if according to your doctor, the disease&#xD;
             in your eyes is benign and does not interfere with the study (e.g. diseases that&#xD;
             affects the periphery of the retina), you are also eligible to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If, according to your doctor you currently have any inflammation/infection in or&#xD;
             around your eyes that could prohibit you from receiving an injection inside your eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If, according to your doctor, any current disease that could directly interfere in&#xD;
             your participation in the study or that could make it difficult for you to come to the&#xD;
             scheduled visits during the next three yearsover the next 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If you have known allergies to fluorescein sodium, a solution that is injected into&#xD;
             your body for eye testing; or to pegcetacoplan (the study drug) or any inactive&#xD;
             substances in pegcetacoplan solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
