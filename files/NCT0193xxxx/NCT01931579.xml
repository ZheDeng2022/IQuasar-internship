  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solitary pulmonary nodule has become a major challenge in respiratory clinical practice.&#xD;
      According to published guidelines, their management often requires close CT follow up, PET CT&#xD;
      and invasive procedures to obtain a definite histology. In this context, innovative&#xD;
      endoscopic techniques refered as navigational bronchoscopy have proved to be efficient, for&#xD;
      the localization and sampling of peripheral lung nodules. However, these techniques are&#xD;
      unable to differentiate malignant lesions from benign ones, in-vivo, in real time. Confocal&#xD;
      endo-microscopy (CELLVIZIO) of the distal lung - also refered as distal lung probe based&#xD;
      confocal laser endo-microscopy or alveolar lung endo-microscopy - allows in-vivo imaging of&#xD;
      the distal lung structures in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective trial we will assess confocal endoscopy as a tool to localize the peripheral&#xD;
      lung nodules and to differentiate benign from tumoral lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate that confocal endo-microscopy is not inferior to navigational endoscopy&#xD;
           for the localisation of peripheral lung nodule&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that confocal endoscopy can differentiate benign from malignant tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentric prospective controlled trial, conducted in three academic centers, specialized&#xD;
      in interventional bronchoscopy, equipped with both navigational bronchoscopy and probe based&#xD;
      confocal endo-microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with peripheral lung nodule requiring navigational bronchoscopy will be explored&#xD;
      using both Confocal endoscopy AND navigational bronchoscopy. Confocal probe will be inserted&#xD;
      in the same catheter as used for the navigational bronchoscopy and confocal images will be&#xD;
      recorded before sampling. An ancillary study using topical methylene blue as in situ will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Rouen University Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary protocol includes the use of in situ methylene blue deposition and 660 confocal&#xD;
      endo-microscopy analysis.&#xD;

      Main assessment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. number of lesions localized by confocal endoscopy compared to navigational bronchoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive and negative predictive values of confocal signs before and after IV&#xD;
           fluorophore injection for the diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this this study, positive diagnostic criteria for the localization of peripheral nodule&#xD;
      using confocal imaging is a solid pattern as opposed to the usual loose fibered network&#xD;
      pattern of the normal alveolar duct. According to this criteria, the confocal imaging&#xD;
      procedure will be considered as valid if the number of lesions localized by confocal is not&#xD;
      inferior to 90 % of those localized by navigational bronchoscopy. Therefore, probe based&#xD;
      confocal laser endo-microscopy will prove valid if it can recognize at least 70 subjects out&#xD;
      of the 78 / 120 subjects for which the navigational bronchoscopy is forecasted to localize&#xD;
      the peripheral lesion (Cohen concordance Kappa value of 0,74 between confocal and&#xD;
      navigational bronchoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective will be to describe specific signs of cancer using confocal endoscopy .&#xD;
      This will be assessed on the first 30 patients using confocal imaging obtained before and&#xD;
      after fluorophore IV injection, in comparison to histology, and confirmed on the following 48&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of the use of confocal endo-microscopy using the CELLVIZIO device and either the 1 mm CELLVIZIO miniprobe (ALVEOFLEX) or the 0.6 mm CELLVIZIO miniprobe (CHOLANGIOFLEX), during a navigational bronchoscopy procedure for the diagnostic of peripheral nodule. In this study, the navigational device - either radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or electromagnetic navigation (EMN) - will be moved to another location if the CELLVIZIO displays a non solid pattern, indicating that the nodule may not have been reached during the procedure. Three attempts of EBUS or EMN are allowed until the CELLVIZIO shows a solid pattern.</description>
