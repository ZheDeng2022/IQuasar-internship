      Optimal fluid therapy in severe falciparum malaria has not been well defined, especially in&#xD;
      resource poor settings where access to mechanical ventilation is limited. Recent studies&#xD;
      suggest that liberal fluid resuscitation is harmful for severe malaria patients despite they&#xD;
      often being hypovolemic on admission. In order to elucidate the minimum fluid therapy&#xD;
      required to prevent complications in severe malaria, we will conduct a prospective&#xD;
      observational study in adults with severe malaria, and also in adults with severe sepsis as a&#xD;
      comparison group. The objective of this study is to describe the association between&#xD;
      hemodynamic variations in conventional fluid management and the probability of developing&#xD;
      acute kidney injury (AKI) or pulmonary edema in adults with severe malaria and severe sepsis.&#xD;
      Hemodynamic measurements will be obtained by using transpulmonary thermodilution and arterial&#xD;
      pulse contour analysis.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid therapy in severe malaria and severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe falciparum malaria causes multiple organ dysfunction including metabolic acidosis,&#xD;
      coma, anemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and pulmonary edema. The mortality rate of the&#xD;
      disease is still around 15-23% despite optimal antimalarial therapy. Supportive therapy and&#xD;
      intensive care are crucial elements in the treatment of the multiple complications of the&#xD;
      disease. Optimal fluid therapy however, one of the fundamental elements of the supportive&#xD;
      therapy, has not been well defined. A large randomized controlled trial of fluid therapy in&#xD;
      shocked African children (the FEAST study) showed that fluid bolus resuscitation increased&#xD;
      the mortality in severe malaria. A retrospective study in adult patients with severe malaria&#xD;
      showed that fluid loading had no effect on acid-base status or renal failure. A recent study&#xD;
      by our group showed that liberal fluid management guided by invasive monitoring was not&#xD;
      associated with improved renal function or acid-base status, but did aggravate pulmonary&#xD;
      edema in patients developing pulmonary capillary leakage during admission in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit. The study found that 38% of severe malaria patients developed clinical pulmonary&#xD;
      edema, 80% of which occurred after liberal fluid resuscitation. In this study, plasma lactate&#xD;
      as a crude measure of tissue hypoperfusion correlated with the degree of sequestration&#xD;
      (directly observed by OPS imaging), and not with the volume of fluid resuscitation. It was&#xD;
      concluded that liberal fluid management is not indicated in adult severe malaria. However,&#xD;
      this same study showed that all patients with severe malaria present with intravascular&#xD;
      dehydration, and often have not been able to maintain proper fluid intake for a considerable&#xD;
      time. Failure to give these patients enough fluid therapy could therefore be expected to&#xD;
      precipitate renal failure and tissue hypoperfusion. Overall, the evidence suggests that in&#xD;
      severe malaria, liberal fluid resuscitation is harmful despite patients often being&#xD;
      hypovolaemic on admission. The minimum fluid therapy required to prevent complications has&#xD;
      yet to be defined. Currently, the clinician has no guidance except for the very general&#xD;
      adage: &quot;keep them dry&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for fluid therapy in sepsis and septic shock is also limited. Goal-directed&#xD;
      resuscitation during the first 6 hours is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign&#xD;
      Guideline (SSCG), based on two randomized controlled study. Fluid challenges are one of the&#xD;
      methods used to achieve the goals, with administration of fluid boluses and initial higher&#xD;
      volume of intravenous fluids. Due to its inclusion in guidelines1, early goal-directed&#xD;
      therapy (EGDT) and fluid challenges have now become common clinical practice in resource-rich&#xD;
      countries. On the other hand, the efficacy of large fluid bolus resuscitation is questioned&#xD;
      because of low level of evidence for physiological support and lack of clinical controlled&#xD;
      trials comparing fluid bolus therapy versus no fluid bolus therapy. The variable availability&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation must be considered when making recommendations for fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation. Since access to mechanical ventilation is often limited in developing world&#xD;
      settings, the recommendations in the SSCG are not applicable in this context without&#xD;
      additional evaluation. Recently, the FEAST trial in East African children with compensated&#xD;
      shock in severe malaria and sepsis revealed that fluid bolus therapy of 20 to 40 mL/kg body&#xD;
      weight caused a dramatic increase in case fatality. Several studies have found positive fluid&#xD;
      balance to be associated with increased mortality in sepsis or septic shock. A retrospective&#xD;
      study (the VASST study) included 778 patients with septic shock showed that there is&#xD;
      significant correlation between a more positive fluid balance at both time points of 12 hours&#xD;
      and day 4 and increased mortality. In the SOAP study, multicenter prospective cohort study&#xD;
      enrolled 1177 patients with sepsis, cumulative fluid balance within first 72 hours after the&#xD;
      onset was an independent predictor of mortality. Also, a prospective observational study of&#xD;
      164 patients with septic shock reported that there was no significant difference in 90-days&#xD;
      mortality between patients with higher fluid volume infused (&gt; 4.0 L) and lower volume (&lt; 4.0&#xD;
      L) on day 1. They concluded that initial fluid volume administered was not associated with&#xD;
      mortality in patients with septic shock. Optimal initial fluid volume and strategy in sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock is thus unclear. Especially in resource-limited countries, fluid overload is&#xD;
      more dangerous than that in resource-rich countries, because development of pulmonary edema&#xD;
      and ALI/ARDS is almost always fatal in settings without access to mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      recommendation of fluid bolus resuscitation therapy as promoted in the SSCG should therefore&#xD;
      be evaluated cautiously in the resource-poor setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      As outlined above, the optimum fluid management in severe malaria and sepsis has yet to be&#xD;
      established, particularly in resource poor settings where access to mechanical ventilation is&#xD;
      limited. Whilst liberal fluid resuscitation appears deleterious, it is not clear what the&#xD;
      minimum fluid requirements are; this study aims to address this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will longitudinally monitor the hemodynamic parameters along with&#xD;
      cumulative fluid administration and fluid balance during conventional fluid strategy, as&#xD;
      practiced by the local physicians. For monitoring, we will use transpulmonary thermodilution&#xD;
      and arterial pulse contour analysis (PiCCO-plus, Pulsion Medical System, Germany). The PiCCO&#xD;
      system is in routine use as part of standard clinical practice to provide hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring of severely ill patients admitted to ICU. It uses a central venous and arterial&#xD;
      line to provide continuous monitoring of hemodynamic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the investigators believe that by monitoring the hemodynamics using the PiCCO system&#xD;
      will give valuable new insight into the relationship between fluid management and renal&#xD;
      function, pulmonary edema, and acid-base status in adult patients with severe malaria.&#xD;
      Patients with severe sepsis will be recruited as a comparison group, and the volume status&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the same manner.&#xD;
