      The purpose of this study is to understand how to improve health care services for&#xD;
      HIV-positive women during their pregnancy and after delivery. The study's aim is to compare&#xD;
      two different ways of providing antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women with HIV. The study&#xD;
      is to be conducted at the Gugulethu Midwife Obstetric Unit (MOU) in Cape Town. There are&#xD;
      three phases of the study: Phase 1 is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive&#xD;
      HIV-infected pregnant women attending their first antenatal clinic visit (n=1600); Phase 2 is&#xD;
      an observational cohort that will follow women from Phase 1 who are eligible for ART (n=600)&#xD;
      from the second antenatal clinic visit until the first postpartum visit; Phase 3 is a&#xD;
      randomized trial of women from Phase 2 who are breastfeeding and will compare two different&#xD;
      service models for delivering ART to women after they delivery their babies (n=480). For&#xD;
      Phase 3, women who are taking ART will randomly be assigned to either (1) referral to receive&#xD;
      ART at the nearest adult clinic at 4-8 weeks after delivery (this is currently how all women&#xD;
      receive care in this setting) or (2) to continue to come to the antenatal clinic for ART&#xD;
      services until the end of breastfeeding. All women will received the standard local ART&#xD;
      services (with identical medications and medical treatment); they are different because some&#xD;
      women will stay longer in care at the antenatal clinic. All women participating in Phase 3&#xD;
      will be followed through at least 2 months after they deliver.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study includes a three-phase design in which HIV-positive pregnant women are followed&#xD;
      during the antenatal and postnatal periods. Throughout, participants will attend study&#xD;
      measurement visits conducted separately from routine ART service appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women attending&#xD;
      their first antenatal clinic visit seeking care at the study clinic. This phase of the study&#xD;
      will allow characterization of the health status of the population of HIV-positive pregnant&#xD;
      women seeking care at the Gugulethu (Midwife Obstetric Unit)MOU and the services they&#xD;
      receive. At their first antenatal clinic visit, women will be approached to complete Informed&#xD;
      Consent #1, including consent for abstraction of routine clinic data on obstetric and&#xD;
      HIV-related care. As part of this cross-sectional study, participating women will complete a&#xD;
      short questionnaire and undergo phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study is an observational cohort of all women who are eligible for initiation&#xD;
      of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (following SA guidelines), from their second antenatal&#xD;
      clinic visit until their first postpartum clinic visit (conducted within 7 days postpartum).&#xD;
      This phase of the study will provide detailed description of ART initiation and antenatal&#xD;
      follow-up in the population of women who will be involved in the postnatal component of the&#xD;
      study, and be used to measure potential predictors of the primary outcome. At the second&#xD;
      antenatal clinic visit, women from Phase 1 who are ART-eligible or who initiated ART during&#xD;
      the pregnancy will be approached to complete Informed Consent #2, be interviewed with&#xD;
      questionnaire on behavioral and psychosocial measures, and undergo phlebotomy. Women will&#xD;
      complete another study measurement visit during the third trimester and again within 1 week&#xD;
      postpartum (with study measurement visits timed to coincide with routine care appointments).&#xD;
      At these visits, additional questionnaires and phlebotomy will be used to collect study&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 of the study is a randomised trial of strategies for delivering ART to women during&#xD;
      the postpartum period (the primary objective) with measurement of secondary outcomes during&#xD;
      the postnatal period. Women enrolled in Phase 2 who are breastfeeding their infants will be&#xD;
      approached to participate in the trial at the routine postpartum clinic visit (this takes&#xD;
      place within 7 days of birth and is the only standard postpartum care for women). After&#xD;
      completing Informed Consent #3, women will be interviewed with behavioral and psychosocial&#xD;
      questionnaires and undergo phlebotomy for study measurements before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be to one of two approaches to providing ART during the postpartum period&#xD;
      to HIV-infected mothers who are breastfeeding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: referral to general adult ART services from approximately 4-8 weeks postpartum&#xD;
           (the local standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: continued receipt of ART in the antenatal clinic, as part of a MCH-focused ART&#xD;
           service that includes primary care for HIV-exposed infants. This service only refers&#xD;
           women to general adult ART services after the end of breastfeeding and once infants'&#xD;
           final HIV status is determined&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomized to Arm A or Arm B will be asked to return for four additional study visits&#xD;
      during the postpartum period at approximately 6 weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months&#xD;
      postpartum. Details of study measurement visits conducted in both the antenatal and postnatal&#xD;
      periods are described below in Section 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women enrolled in Phases 1 and 2 of the study, participation will not impact on any&#xD;
      aspect of routine antenatal and obstetric care during pregnancy. Similarly, throughout the&#xD;
      antenatal period women's HIV-related care (including PMTCT services and ART) will not be&#xD;
      affected in any way by participation, with ART initiated according to the current standard of&#xD;
      care. For women enrolled in Phase 3 of the study, participation will only impact on the&#xD;
      setting and approach to providing ART services to mothers during the postpartum period,&#xD;
      comparing immediate referral to general adult ART services versus ongoing care in MCH-focused&#xD;
      ART services within the Gugulethu MOU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, a total of approximately 1600 HIV+ pregnant women will participate in Phase 1 of the&#xD;
      study over 12 months. From this group, it is anticipated that approximately 400-500 HIV+&#xD;
      pregnant women eligible for ART will be identified as eligible for Phase 2 participation. We&#xD;
      estimate that of the approximately 600 women on ART followed in Phase 2, approximately 480&#xD;
      will be eligible for and enrolled into Phase 3 and randomized to one of two postpartum ART&#xD;
      delivery strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of all participants in Phase 3 will end at 12 months postpartum. The total length&#xD;
      of participation will vary based on gestational age at enrollment into Phase 2, ranging from&#xD;
      a minimum of approximately 52 weeks to a maximum of approximately 80 weeks.&#xD;
