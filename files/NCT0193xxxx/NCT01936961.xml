        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic NSCLC,&#xD;
             colon, or TNB cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by CT scan (or PET/CT, if patient&#xD;
             is allergic to CT contrast media).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For NSCLC patients without EGFR or ALK abnormalities amenable to EGFR or ALK targeted&#xD;
             therapy: patients must have received no more than at least 2 or 3 cycles of either&#xD;
             first- or second-line systemic therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. For&#xD;
             NSCLC patients with EGFR or ALK abnormalities amenable to receive EGFR or ALK targeted&#xD;
             therapy: patients must have progressed on first-line EGFR or ALK targeted therapy and&#xD;
             received no more than at least 2 or 3 cycles of either second- or third-line systemic&#xD;
             therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For colon cancer patients: patients must have patients must have received no more than&#xD;
             at least 2 or 3 cycles of either first- or second-line systemic therapy for the&#xD;
             treatment of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For TNB cancer patients, patients must have patients must have received no more than&#xD;
             at least 2 or 3 cycles of either first- or second-line systemic therapy for the&#xD;
             treatment of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At the time of screening, all patients must have scans (within 28 days) showing stable&#xD;
             disease by RECIST 1.1. Where applicable, measurable tumor marker (e.g. CA19-9, CEA, or&#xD;
             CA125) collected within 14 days must be at least 10% less than baseline value on most&#xD;
             recent systemic therapy (baseline value has to be abnormal elevated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood&#xD;
             counts at time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500 mm3, platelet count ≥ 100×109 L, hemoglobin ≥ 9&#xD;
             g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serum creatinine ≤2.0, total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL, AST/ALT ≤ 5 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal range&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within institutional normal limits. If TSH is above&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal range, then a free T4 within institutional normal limits is&#xD;
             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Persistent prior systemic therapy non-hematologic AE grade ≥2 (except alopecia or&#xD;
             correctable electrolyte abnormality with supplementation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral&#xD;
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 30 days&#xD;
             following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has known brain metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled for&#xD;
             at least 1 month (defined as clinically stable, no edema, no steroids and stable in 2&#xD;
             scans at least 4 weeks apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment&#xD;
             plan and follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has known active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C (patients are&#xD;
             NOT required to be tested for the presence of such viruses prior to therapy on this&#xD;
             protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Requiring daily corticosteroid dose ≥ 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has undergone major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery (e.g., surgery done&#xD;
             to obtain a biopsy for diagnosis without removal of an organ), within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Day 1 of treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any&#xD;
             of their excipients, or the patient exhibits any of the events outlined in the&#xD;
             Contraindication or Special Warnings and Precautions sections of the product or&#xD;
             comparator SmPC or Prescribing Information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or&#xD;
             serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the patient's safety or the&#xD;
             study data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient will be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy during participation in this&#xD;
             trial.&#xD;
