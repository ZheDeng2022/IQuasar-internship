      The primary purpose of this study is to define in HIV-uninfected volunteers the innate,&#xD;
      cell-mediated and humoral responses induced by AIDSVAX B/E in the systemic and mucosal&#xD;
      compartments and to characterize B cell functional specificities in peripheral blood, bone&#xD;
      marrow and sigmoid compartments.&#xD;
