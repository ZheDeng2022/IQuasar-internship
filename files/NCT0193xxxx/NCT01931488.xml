      The Feasibility of Novel 124I-MIBG Tracer in Evaluation of Myocardial Sympathetic Denervation&#xD;
      and Assessment of Neuroendocrine tumors. Comparison with 123I-MIBG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The autonomic nervous system consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurotransmitter of the sympathetic system is norepinephrine (NE) which in response to a&#xD;
      stimulus, is released to the synaptic space Guanethidine is a false neurotransmitter analog&#xD;
      of NE that is not catabolized . When labeled with radioactive iodine the radiotracer&#xD;
      meta-iodobenzylguanidine (as I-MIBG) may be used for localization of different clinical and&#xD;
      pathological conditions. There are two main indications for scintigrpahy with labeled MIBG 1.&#xD;
      Whole body imaging of neuroendocrine tumors such as phechromocytoma and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
      Scintigraphy allows staging of the disease as well as follow up in patients with MIBG-avid&#xD;
      tumors. Moreover, when labeled with high doses of 131I it can be used for treatment in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. 2. the other indication of labeled MIBG&#xD;
      scintigraphy is for assessment of myocardial sympathetic nerve endings Autonomic disturbances&#xD;
      are of the common symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD). They may appear early in the disease&#xD;
      occasionally prior to the motor symptoms, thus raising a potential use of autonomic system&#xD;
      assessment as a biological marker for prediction of future development of motor PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labeled MIBG imaging is a potential test for determining of the integrity of the individual&#xD;
      autonomic function. Reduced MIBG uptake indicates postganglionic sympathetic dysfunction,&#xD;
      which has been observed during the early stages of PD. MIBG scintigraphy is thought to be a&#xD;
      sensitive modality for the diagnosis of PD, assisting in the differential diagnosis of other&#xD;
      parkinsonian diseases, PD and other movement disorders. This method has also been reported to&#xD;
      be of a high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The labeled MIBG used routinely is the tracer labeled with 123I which can be used with gamma&#xD;
      camera for performance of planar imaging or 3D SPECT images. 123I emits predominantly γ&#xD;
      photons with energies of 159 keV and has a half-life of 13.2 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of 123I MIBG myocardial uptake by the Heart to-Mediastinum ratio (H/M) measured&#xD;
      from planar imaging has been found to be of predictive value for assessment of prognosis for&#xD;
      cardiac events. H/M obtained from 123I MIBG SPECT was reported to improve the differentiation&#xD;
      between subjects with normal and those with abnormal MIBG uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike 123I which is a gamma emitting isotope 124I, a positron emitter, with a half-life of&#xD;
      4.2 d, can be used for positron emission tomography (PET) thus allowing a better as well as&#xD;
      quantification of tracer accumulation Studies using 124I-MIBG positron emission tomography&#xD;
      was initiated as early as 1992. Preliminary studies demonstrated that imaging with 124I-MIBG&#xD;
      in humans is safe when using the correct amount of radioactivity tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we propose to perform two images sessions. First would be the injection of 6mCi&#xD;
      123I-MIBG which results in radiation dose of 4.2 mSv.In the second session 0.8 mCi 124I-MIBG&#xD;
      will be injected which results in radiation dose of 7.4 mSv. The estimated total radiation&#xD;
      dose to the patient of both studies is 11.8 mSv. When comparing to the radiation doses of&#xD;
      daily routine scintigraphy: The radiation dose of bone scan (25 mCi Tc MDP) is 5.3 mSv. The&#xD;
      radiation dose of 12 mCi 18F-FDG PET-CT is 13.32 mSv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail Objectives Given the merits of MIBG ligand and the 124I positron emission tomography,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the added value of PET-CT with 124I-MIBG tracer,&#xD;
      compared to planar and SPECT imaging with the routine 123I-MIBG tracers for&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of the Myocardial Sympathetic Denervation of patients with Parkinson and&#xD;
           family members of patienst with PD who are carriers of the mulation for PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Staging and follow-up of pts. with neuroendocrine malignancies.&#xD;
