      The EARLY-MYO (EARLY routine catheterization after alteplase fibrinolysis vs. primary PCI in&#xD;
      acute ST-segment elevation MYOcardial infarction) is an investigator-initiated, prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized (1:1), open-label, actively-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy and safety of a PhI strategy with half-dose&#xD;
      fibrinolysis versus PPCI in STEMI patients presenting within 6 hours after symptom onset and&#xD;
      with an expected PCI-related delay of ≥60 min.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early, successful restoration of myocardial perfusion after a ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) is the most effective way to reduce final infarct size and improve&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Reperfusion for STEMI treatment in the modern era encompasses mechanical&#xD;
      and pharmacological strategies. It is generally well-accepted that primary percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PPCI) is the preferred reperfusion strategy for all STEMI patients&#xD;
      when it can be performed within the guideline-recommended timeframe at PPCI-capable&#xD;
      facilities. However, PPCI is not universally available, and delays in performing percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) are common in real-world practice. Even in some large cities,&#xD;
      patients have a high chance of presenting to hospitals not providing around-the-clock PPCI&#xD;
      service. Given this background, in recent years there has been great interest and progress in&#xD;
      creating triage strategies for STEMI patients who cannot receive timely PPCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaco-invasive (PhI) strategy, an early reperfusion strategy by initial prompt&#xD;
      fibrinolysis with subsequent early catheterization (with either routine early PCI after&#xD;
      successful fibrinolysis or rescue PCI as needed), has been proposed as a therapeutic option&#xD;
      for STEMI patients when timely PPCI is not feasible. However, current evidence on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of PhI strategy in STEMI patients is limited, and the role of PhI&#xD;
      strategy in STEMI continues to be debated. Given that no randomized clinical trial is&#xD;
      available to compare a PhI strategy with half-dose fibrinolytic regimen versus PPCI in STEMI&#xD;
      patients, investigators plan to perform a controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase fibrinolysis versus PPCI in&#xD;
      STEMI patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Immediately after PCI</time_frame>
    <description>TMPFC is a novel method to standardize and quantify myocardial perfusion by timing the filling and washout of contrast in the myocardium using cine-angiographic frame-counting. Briefly, the first frame of TMPFC was defined as the frame that clearly demonstrated the first appearance of myocardial blush beyond the IRA (F1). The last frame of TMPFC was then defined as the frame where contrast or myocardial blush disappeared (F2). TMPFC is F2-F1 frame counts at a filming rate of 15 frames/sec, or (F2-F1)×2 frame counts at the corrected filming rate of 30 frames/sec.</description>
