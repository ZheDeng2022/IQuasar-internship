  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      rAAV1-PG9DP when administered intramuscularly at different dose levels in healthy male&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, blinded, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of rAAV1-PG9DP when administered intramuscularly at 4x10^12 vg, 4x10^13 vg,&#xD;
      8x10^13 vg and 1.2x10^14 vg in healthy male adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before injection and will be followed for 12 months&#xD;
      after the single administration. It is anticipated that it will take approximately 13 months&#xD;
      to enroll the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be randomly assigned investigational product (IP) or placebo within each of&#xD;
      the dose groups described in the study design table above depending on which group is&#xD;
      enrolling. Study staff and volunteers will be blinded only with respect to the allocation of&#xD;
      placebo or IP. Blinding will not apply to the assignment of dosage levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be offered enrollment into a follow-up study at the research center when they&#xD;
      have finished participating in the trial&#xD;
