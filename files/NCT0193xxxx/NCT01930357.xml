  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to document immunogenicity and safety of VRVg in a pre-exposure&#xD;
      regimen in healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of&#xD;
           subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 international&#xD;
           units (IU)/mL at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe if at least 99% of subjects achieve an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D42 with a&#xD;
           lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%, in the VRVg group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when&#xD;
           administered in a pre-exposure schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 14 days after the last&#xD;
           vaccination, i.e. at D42, and 6 months after the first vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the geometric mean titer ratio between the two vaccine groups at D42, i.e.&#xD;
           14 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive a total of three vaccinations, one each at Day 0, Day 7, and Day&#xD;
      28, respectively, and will be assessment for immune response to rabies vaccine before the&#xD;
      first injection (baseline titer), at Day 42, and at Month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed in all participants up to 28 days after each injection. Serious&#xD;
      adverse events and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be collected up to 6&#xD;
      months after the last injection.&#xD;
