      Rapid and rational health-care interventions are of great importance to efficiently combat&#xD;
      the emergence of resistant and virulent bacteria. In recent years, spread of ESBL-E on a&#xD;

      aims to assess a new approach to ESBL-E eradication. To avoid administration of the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections (BSI) with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria such as extended-&#xD;
      spectrum betalactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. In recent years,&#xD;
      rapid spread of ESBL-E on a global level has been observed. While guidelines on effective&#xD;
      infection control and treatment measures are urgently needed, the required basis of evidence&#xD;
      is yet to be generated. Particularly data from interventional trials is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From October 2011 to December 2012, a multicenter cohort study on ESBL-E colonization and&#xD;
      infection in haematology/oncology patients has been conducted within the Deutsches Zentrum&#xD;
      für Infektionsforschung (DZIF) and allowed for a detailed description of the epidemiology of&#xD;
      ESBL-E in this patient population. Based on these results, the sample size calculations for&#xD;
      this study were carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid and rational health-care interventions are of great importance to efficiently combat&#xD;
      the emergence of resistant and virulent bacteria. In recent years, spread of ESBL-E on a&#xD;
      global level has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, the KRINKO (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention) at the&#xD;
      Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, German, published their new recommendations on the&#xD;
      management of colonization and infection with Gram-negative MDR bacteria, including ESBL-E.&#xD;
      In high-risk settings, e.g. haematology/oncology wards and intensive care units, contact&#xD;
      isolation is recommended for all patients who are colonized or infected with ESBL-E. While&#xD;
      recommendations of the KRINKO are not legally binding, many institutions are now integrating&#xD;
      these suggestions into their standards of care, given the recent increase in the prevalence&#xD;
      of ESBL-E. This development is putting a considerable strain on patients and treating&#xD;
      physicians. Firstly, previous studies have demonstrated the negative impact of long-term&#xD;
      isolation on the patients' frequency of contacts with health care workers, a decrease in&#xD;
      scores for self-esteem and an increase in scores for anxiety and depression.Secondly, proper&#xD;
      contact isolation requires treatment in a single room. Many hospitals are, however, not&#xD;
      equipped with sufficient numbers of single rooms, to accommodate all patients carrying MDR&#xD;
      bacteria. Apart from problems associated with contact isolation, immunocompromised patients&#xD;
      who are colonized with ESBL-E are at an increased risk of subsequent bloodstream infections&#xD;
      (BSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical care providers are used to be faced with similar problems when dealing with&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, nowadays, eradication regimens&#xD;
      offer the possibility to remove MRSA from the skin and mucosa of colonized patients, thus&#xD;
      interrupting its further spread to a considerable extent. For ESBL-E, effective eradication&#xD;
      regimens are not yet available. The current study therefore aims to assess a new approach to&#xD;
      ESBL-E eradication. To avoid administration of the eradication regimen to patients at low&#xD;
      risk of subsequent BSI with ESBL-E, the study population will be restricted to&#xD;
      immunocompromised high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human intestinal tract is known to be colonized by hundreds of different bacterial&#xD;
      species and other microbes. Based on the experience with fecal microbiota therapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, it can be hypothesized that the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome may influence the success or failure of the present study intervention.&#xD;
      Thus, at selected sites, a metagenomic analysis of the intestinal microbiome will be&#xD;
      performed to explore possible associations between certain microbiome patterns and the&#xD;
      successful eradication of ESBL-E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an ongoing discussion on whether antibiotic regimens used for eradication and&#xD;
      selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD) might lead to the emergence of multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant bacteria.11 Emergence of resistance under long-term administration of SDD to ICU&#xD;
      patients has been previously reported.12 However, a recently published meta-analysis,&#xD;
      including 64 studies in ICUs, of which 47 were randomized controlled trials and 35 included&#xD;
      data for the detection of antimicrobial resistance, no relation between the use of SDD and&#xD;
      the development of antimicrobial resistance could be detected.13 Even without this&#xD;
      information, the risk for emergence of resistance should be classified as very low,&#xD;
      considering that patients will receive eradication treatment for the duration of only seven&#xD;
      days. Nevertheless, the possible emergence of non-ESBL multi-drug resistant bacteria in the&#xD;
      intestine will be assessed during the study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the choice of an antibiotic regimen with a high chance of effectively eradicating&#xD;
      ESBL-E from the gut, data from previous studies has been taken into account. Most previous&#xD;
      study concepts were based on the idea of SDD.14-16 SDD aims to eradicate abnormal aerobic&#xD;
      gram-negative bacteria, while preserving anaerobic bacteria. In this setting, the problem of&#xD;
      adverse events caused by systemic effects of the antibiotics used can be discarded. However,&#xD;
      if only locally active antibiotics are used for achieving eradication, patients are less&#xD;
      likely to clear concurrent ESBL-E colonization of the throat, skin and urinary bladder. These&#xD;
      body sites may then serve as a source of intestinal re-colonization with ESBL-E. Therefore,&#xD;
      the current pilot study uses a combination of a non-absorbable enterally administered&#xD;
      antibiotic and a systemic antibiotic. To facilitate the choice of an optimum non-absorbable&#xD;
      antibiotic, antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of ESBL-E from&#xD;
      haematological high-risk patients was carried out at the University Hospital Cologne in 2012.&#xD;
      Virtually no resistance towards colistin could be detected (data not published), such that&#xD;
      colistin was chosen as the non-absorbable component. As previous studies have shown promising&#xD;
      results for a combination of colistin and gentamicin, the latter was added to the eradication&#xD;
      regimen. Concerning the choice of a systemically active antibiotic, promising data on the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of fosfomycin in ESBL-E infections and in the reduction of ESBL-E in the&#xD;
      intestinal flora have been published. Given the additional convenience of an available oral&#xD;
      formulation - a prerequisite not given for most other ESBL-E active treatments - fosfomycin&#xD;
      was chosen for combination with oral colistin and gentamicin. For the treatment of urinary&#xD;
      tract infections, oral fosfomycin is usually administered as a single dose of 3g. However,&#xD;
      several studies have assessed treatment of complicated or chronic urinary tract infections&#xD;
      with repetitive administrations of 3g fosfomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since a single dose may not suffice to reduce the intestinal ESBL-E burden below the limit of&#xD;
      detection, a schedule of 3g p.o. every 72h was chosen for this study.&#xD;
