  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triclabendazole is a benzimidazole compound used as a systemic antihelmintic in veterinary&#xD;
      practice. Triclabendazole is considered to be a second-line drug for parasites and is used&#xD;
      when other preferred agents cannot be used because they are ineffective or because adverse&#xD;
      reactions limit their use. Although Triclabendazole is widely used in developing countries&#xD;
      for the treatment of parasites it is not approved by the FDA for this treatment in the US. It&#xD;
      is currently being distributed in the US through a special arrangement with the FDA and the&#xD;
      manufacturer on an individual patient approval basis. This arrangement requires that a single&#xD;
      patient Investigational New Drug (IND) be obtained from FDA for each patient requiring&#xD;
      Triclabendazole. Upon approval by FDA, the manufacturer (Novartis) will ship the drug&#xD;
      directly to the prescribing physician.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of parasites whose resistance pattern has indicated&#xD;
             resistance to first line agents and sensitivity to Triclabendazole or in whom an&#xD;
             additional drug needs to be added to their regimen because of inadequate response to&#xD;
             existing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a parasite that is sensitive to Triclabendazole and who have experienced&#xD;
             an allergic or adverse reaction to other agents that prevent their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with parasitic disease that has responded to treatment with first line drugs&#xD;
             but who experienced allergic or adverse reactions to these agents that has prevented&#xD;
             their continued use or who have experienced a relapse in their disease that&#xD;
             necessitates the addition, or substitution, of second-line agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not qualify for a study using Triclabendazole or for whom a study does&#xD;
             not exist and thus the patient would not otherwise have access to the drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone whose parasitic disease can be adequately treated by other available&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anyone who is allergic or who has had a severe adverse reaction to Triclabendazole in&#xD;
             the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant Women&#xD;
