  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination therapy of trametinib and docetaxel with growth factor support in Japanese&#xD;
      subjects with Stage IV or a postoperative recurrence non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This&#xD;
      study data will be used for making decision for further Japanese development plan for NSCLC.&#xD;
      Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled in a dose level to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the combination treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity will be assessed during the&#xD;
      first 21 days of combination therapy.&#xD;
