  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled study is to evaluate whether the knowledge of a&#xD;
      personalized diabetes risk score affects adherence to a 12-week diet and exercise lifestyle&#xD;
      change program in prediabetic patients. The intervention group will receive diabetes risk&#xD;
      score results at the beginning of the twelve weeks, and the control group will not receive&#xD;
      these results. Both groups will review their baseline and 12-week diabetes risk score results&#xD;
      at the conclusion of the program and will be followed for an additional twelve weeks.&#xD;
      Attendance rates and changes in weight, BMI, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, HgA1c,&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, and diabetes risk score will be compared between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
