      -  The aim of this study is to compare the standard and 3D miniplates fixation in&#xD;
           mandibular angle fractures regarding to wound dehiscence, infection, nonunion, pain,&#xD;
           hypoesthesia, and malocclusion. and to analyze advantages and disadvantages of one&#xD;
           method over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic follow-up (in the form of posteroanterior and panoramic radiographs) will&#xD;
           used to evaluate the patients immediately and 2 and 4 months postoperatively. Patients&#xD;
           returned 7 days after surgery for clinical evaluation . The patients will be examined&#xD;
           radiographically for accuracy of the reduction, screw positioning, adverse reactions in&#xD;
           the vicinity of screw placement, and bone healing. the complications encountered will be&#xD;
           recorded and treated. The clinical evaluations will be performed by 1 surgeon at each&#xD;
           institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients will also evaluated clinically for infection, nonunion, pain, hypoesthesia,&#xD;
           and malocclusion. Malocclusion will assessed based on patient complaints. Criteria for&#xD;
           infection will based on either of the following conditions: 1) purulent discharge from&#xD;
           an incision and 2) serosanguineous drainage and a wound culture positive for a known&#xD;
           pathogen. All the patients will evaluated postoperatively by a single assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statically analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student's t test will be used to compare 3D and Champy's miniplate fixation. A value of P ≤&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  This study will include 20 dentate patients with mandibular angle fracture whom&#xD;
           presented for treatment at Department Of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty Of Oral&#xD;
           And Dental Medicine, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients after inclusion will be randomly divided into either Group A or Group B.&#xD;
           Group A consist of 10 patients underwent open reduction with internal fixation of the&#xD;
           angle mandibular fracture with 3D titanium miniplates whereas Group B consist of 10&#xD;
           patients underwent open reduction with internal fixation of the mandibular angle&#xD;
           fracture with standard miniplate using a single miniplate technique of Champy's&#xD;
           principle of osteosynthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: 1) Age group between 15-40 years. 2) patients with non-infected and&#xD;
           non-comminuted mandibular angle fractures 3) surgical treatment provided within 7 days&#xD;
           of injury via open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) by an extra oral approach 4)&#xD;
           no use of postsurgical maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) postoperatively 5) a 1-week&#xD;
           duration of postsurgical oral antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria : 1) the fracture was infected at the time of treatment, 2) medical&#xD;
           conditions that could possibly have interfered with healing (diabetes, chemotherapy,&#xD;
           etc.) or prevented general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Careful extra and intraoral clinical examinations will be perform on all patients. The&#xD;
      presence of lacerations, swelling, ecchymosis, occlusal disturbances, or broken, avulsed, or&#xD;
      missing teeth will noted, and the mandibular movements, maximal interincisal opening, and&#xD;
      nerve function will be recorded. Palpation of the mandible for areas of tenderness, segment&#xD;
      mobility, bony crepitus, and tooth mobility will be also perform . Radiographic images&#xD;
      (panoramic and posteroanterior) will be taken to evaluate the fracture. Immediately&#xD;
      preoperatively, each patient will be given a standard dose of 1.5 g of Unasyn* and 8 mg of&#xD;
      Epidron** intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of arch bars, the fracture line will be exposed through extraoral a&#xD;
      submandibular (Risdon) incision. Only the amount of soft tissue stripping necessary to&#xD;
      visualize, reduce, and stabilize the fracture will be performed. Mobile teeth or teeth with&#xD;
      apices that will be exposed in the fracture will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All a fracture site will be identified, reduced, and after obtaining satisfactory occlusion,&#xD;
      temporary maxillomandibular fixation will be placed using either Erich's arch bar or Ivy loop&#xD;
      eyelet wiring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixation in group A will be achieved using a 3D curved strut miniplate* (Fig 1) , installed&#xD;
      and stabilized with monocortical screws. The 3D plate will be place in such a way that a&#xD;
      horizontal bar is perpendicular and a vertical bar is parallel to the fracture line. While in&#xD;
      group B fixation will be perform by A single non compression miniplate with 4-hole 2-mm using&#xD;
      2-mm monocortical screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both group fixation will be carried out through extraoral submandibular approach and&#xD;
      placed in the neutral zone of the mandibular angle (between tension and compression areas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After fixation of the fracture, intermaxillary fixation will be removed . And the incisions&#xD;
      will be close in layers by absorbable suture while the skin closed by 5-0 nylon sutures. No&#xD;
      drains will placed. and the occlusion will checked .&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Postsurgical Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics will be continued through the preoperative period and for 5 to 7 days after&#xD;
      surgery. And other medication to control swelling and pain will be administered.&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine mouth rinse will be provided for all patient until removal of arch bars. Soft&#xD;
      diet will be strongly recommend for 2 weeks then Pasty diet will be gradually regained .&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Postoperative Evaluation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic follow-up (in the form of posteroanterior and panoramic radiographs) will used&#xD;
      to evaluate the patients immediately and 2 and 4 months postoperatively. Patients returned 7&#xD;
      days after surgery for clinical evaluation . The patients will be examined radiographically&#xD;
      for accuracy of the reduction, screw positioning, adverse reactions in the vicinity of screw&#xD;
      placement, and bone healing. the complications encountered will be recorded by treatment&#xD;
      scoring system and treated. The clinical evaluations will be performed by 1 surgeon at each&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will also evaluated clinically for infection, nonunion, pain, hypoesthesia, and&#xD;
      malocclusion. Malocclusion will assessed based on patient complaints. Criteria for infection&#xD;
      will based on either of the following conditions: 1) purulent discharge from an incision and&#xD;
      2) serosanguineous drainage and a wound culture positive for a known pathogen. All the&#xD;
      patients will evaluated postoperatively by a single assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Statically analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student's t test will be used to compare 3D and Champy's miniplate fixation. A value of P ≤&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
