      This study is designed to validate implementation of the CRI algorithm in the CypherOx CRI&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy human subjects will undergo progressive reduction in central blood volume to the&#xD;
      point of hemodynamic instability (defined by a precipitous fall in systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      (SBP) below 70 mmHg and/or voluntary subject termination due to discomfort (such as sweating,&#xD;
      nausea, or dizziness) to validate the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CypherOx CRI system will A. Trend intravascular volume changes (hemorrhage) B. Trend&#xD;
      stroke volume changes and C. The CRI trend value is not relative to an initial CRI reading,&#xD;
      instead it is an actual CRI trend value that does not require calibration or being placed&#xD;
      during normal physiological conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of death in both civilian and battlefield trauma.&#xD;
      Currently available medical monitors provide the capabilities to measure standard vital signs&#xD;
      that are often imprecise, subjective, intermittent and inconsistent. More importantly, the&#xD;
      appearance of hypotension and other signs and symptoms of shock represent a point in time&#xD;
      when it may be too late to apply effective lifesaving interventions. Understanding the&#xD;
      physiological signals that provide the best indicators of blood volume loss and impending&#xD;
      circulatory failure is critical to bridging the capability gap of identifying the need for&#xD;
      early intervention. Under a previous BAMC IRB-approved protocol, we used lower body negative&#xD;
      pressure (LBNP) as an experimental model of central hypovolemia to simulate progressive blood&#xD;
      loss that results in hemodynamic instability (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, presyncopal&#xD;
      symptoms) in conscious, healthy human subjects. From data collected within this original&#xD;
      protocol, we now understand that arterial waveforms (either blood pressure or pulse oximetry)&#xD;
      are important variables associated with hypovolemia. Feature extraction and machine learning&#xD;
      techniques were applied to these previously collected data and an algorithm was developed&#xD;
      called Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) which was designed to reflect progressive blood loss&#xD;
      and decreasing stroke volume. This algorithm was installed in a pulse oximeter in which the&#xD;
      photo-plethysmographic waveform (PPG) was used to calculate the CRI. Using this CRI Pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, a pretrial study of 24 subjects indicated a high correlation in trending of blood&#xD;
      volume loss (DOD study at Mayo Clinic) and a mean correlation of 0.96 when comparing CRI to&#xD;
      stroke volume (LBNP at AISR Laboratory). The work proposed herein will validate those&#xD;
      findings. During each experiment each test subject will wear 4 FDA cleared pulse oximeters&#xD;
      which transmit PPG data to an off-the-shelf handheld tablet (meets military specs) which will&#xD;
      calculate and display the CRI value. The subjects will also wear 2 FDA cleared Nexfin&#xD;
      hemodynamic monitors that display stroke volume. LBNP will be used to produce progressive&#xD;
      central hypovolemia in healthy human subjects until the point of hemodynamic decompensation&#xD;
      (presyncope). This approach will validate the correlation of CRI to stroke volume.&#xD;
