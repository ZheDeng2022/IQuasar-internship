  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conjunctivochalasis refers to loose redundant, non-edematous inferior conjunctiva that is&#xD;
      situated between the globe and lower eyelid, and usually it occurs bilaterally. It has been&#xD;
      reported to cause ocular discomfort, tear instability, alteration of tear spreading and&#xD;
      subsequently dry eye, which is a common condition that affects vision and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients. This condition has also been reported to be associated with aging and ocular&#xD;
      surface inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of conjunctivochalasis was traditionally based on silt lamp examination and&#xD;
      this may be cumbersome and highly subjective. Only recently, researchers have advocated the&#xD;
      use of imaging and more objective documentation by anterior segment optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (AS-OCT), using Fourier-Domain RTVue-100 OCT. The AS-OCT is an imaging method that&#xD;
      documents the tear meniscus and prolapse of conjunctiva into the tear meniscus in a safe,&#xD;
      rapid and non-invasive way. Image analysis on the area of prolapsed conjunctiva can then be&#xD;
      used to ascertain the severity of conjunctivochalasis. We propose the use of HD-Cirrus AS-OCT&#xD;
      for the imaging of conjunctivochalasis, since this technique provides more magnified and&#xD;
      colored digital images, which helps to delineate different tissues and serves as a better&#xD;
      education tool for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to investigative the inter and intra examiner reproducibility of&#xD;
      imaging conjunctivochalasis using HD-Cirrus AS-OCT, using patients from the dry eye clinic&#xD;
      from the Singapore National Eye Centre. These patients will be asked to come to the centre&#xD;
      for imaging and have three scans of the same eye performed in one session by two trained&#xD;
      investigators consecutively. The resulting limits of repeatability will be very useful for us&#xD;
      to follow up patients who undergo surgical or diathermy treatment for conjunctivochalasis,&#xD;
      and for sample size calculation in the planning of interventional studies.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, SGCP and the applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye is a condition that affects 5-35% of the population9. Common symptoms of this&#xD;
      condition include eye irritation, heaviness of the eyelids, visual disturbances, tearing and&#xD;
      light sensitivity9-11. This significantly impacts the quality of life and vision of dry eye&#xD;
      patients. In addition, there is a significant socio-economic burden. In 2009, 54,051 patients&#xD;
      sought treatment for dry eye in the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). In total, the costs&#xD;
      for dry eye medication amounted to $181,354.1712. Additionally, dry eye affects work&#xD;
      productivity which further adds on to the socio-economic burden9,12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnosis and assessment of dry eye is hindered by tests that have poor&#xD;
      repeatability, some of which cause discomfort due to their invasiveness. As a result most&#xD;
      clinical studies involving dry eye treatment rely on symptomatic improvements as a primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. However, symptomatic improvements are a poor measure in determining&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness. This may be a result of disease progression that damages nerves&#xD;
      which consequently desensitizes the eye. Also, it is not uncommon that patients feel a&#xD;
      reduction of discomfort of the eye before objective improvements can be noted by the&#xD;
      clinician. An assessment based on symptoms alone is therefore inappropriate11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, SNEC/SERI has built up a dedicated team of dry eye researchers for&#xD;
      trials and evaluation of diagnostic devices. There is an increasing interest internationally,&#xD;
      especially from industry, to partner us for testing of commercial products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is an imaging device that allows&#xD;
      clinicians to acquire images of the conjunctivochalasis in a safe and non-invasive manner.&#xD;
      The device utilizes infra-red light which is reflected on the eye surface. The reflection,&#xD;
      affected by the thickness of the tissue, is then used to generate an image. It also was found&#xD;
      to correlate with other less repeatable diagnostic tests, such as tear film break-up time&#xD;
      (TBUT), which measures tear film stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicability of the HD-Cirrus AS-OCT in dry eye research has not been extensively&#xD;
      tested. It is also not known if HD-Cirrus AS-OCT would be able to image repeatable and&#xD;
      reproducible results. It is highly cost effective for the study team here to evaluate the&#xD;
      HD-Cirrus ASOCT because it is already available in the trial center, being purchased from&#xD;
      other grant funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1 illustrates the high magnification coloured images taken from our preliminary study&#xD;
      of normal tear meniscus and conjunctivochalasis using the HD-Cirrus AS-OCT.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Clinical importance Should this modality of imaging be validated or shown to be reproducible,&#xD;
      it can then be incorporated into our protocol/workflow for assessment and monitoring of dry&#xD;
      eye treatment in our centre and will greatly enhance our capability to perform clinical&#xD;
      trials and increase our international reputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose The primary purpose is to evaluate inter and intra examiner&#xD;
      repeatability of the HD-Cirrus AS-OCT imaging system to capture conjunctivochalasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeatability is an important issue in the objective assessment of dry eye. There is lack of&#xD;
      studies that investigate the HD-Cirrus AS-OCT for assessment of conjunctivochalasis. The&#xD;
      HD-Cirrus AS-OCT is potentially useful as a non-invasive procedure for objective measurements&#xD;
      of the conjunctivochalasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and target sample size 10 patients with symptomatic dry eye and clinically&#xD;
      suspected conjunctivochalasis (presence of lid parallel conjunctival folds) from Singapore&#xD;
      National Eye Centre will be recruited for this study. 10 healthy volunteers with no symptoms&#xD;
      of dry eyes will be recruited for this study as controls. Each volunteer will also be given a&#xD;
      study serial number to ensure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 20 volunteers will participate in the AS-OCT study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedules One visit is required for paticipants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will need to stay for the study for 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of Dry Eye Symptoms Basic biodata such as age, race, gender will be recorded.&#xD;
           Participants' habitual visual acuity will also be documented. Participants will be asked&#xD;
           to score and fill up a dry eye questionnaire that assesses the symptomatic severity of&#xD;
           dry eyes and the extent of its disruption to daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HD-Cirrus AS-OCT for the assessment of proplasped conjunctiva Participants are randomly&#xD;
           assigned to first examiner, followed by the second examiner. Each examiner will capture&#xD;
           2 sets of scans from the randomly chosen eye of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the acquisition, the participants place their chins on a chin rest and look at a&#xD;
           fixation light/target. This whole procedure of should take about 10 minutes. The&#xD;
           participants are allowed to blink freely except for during the acquisition time of less&#xD;
           than 5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The eye is scanned at 3 vertical positions: inferior temporal (IT), inferior central&#xD;
           (IC) and inferior nasal (IN), as shown in figure 2. In milder case of&#xD;
           conjunctivochalasis, the prolapse of conjunctiva into the tear menicus is more prominent&#xD;
           in the IT scan than IC scan. Therefore, it is important to obtain prolapsed conjunctiva&#xD;
           at different region of the tear meniscus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Figure 2: Imaging prolapsed conjunctiva at different region of the tear meniscus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluorescein Dye Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) Fluorescein dye is introduced onto the lower&#xD;
           eyelid by a wetted fluorescein strip. The tear film will then be observed with blue&#xD;
           light using a slit lamp to the point where it breaks. The time from the previous blink&#xD;
           to the breaking of the tear film will be recorded to the nearest second.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fluorescein Dye Corneal Staining After fluorescein dye is introduced, the cornea will be&#xD;
           examined for green stains indicating epithelial erosion, a sign of damage due to&#xD;
           dryness. The number of green stains and their ocation on the cornea (superior, central,&#xD;
           inferior, temporal, nasal fields) will be recorded.&#xD;
