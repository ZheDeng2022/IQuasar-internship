  <brief_summary>

      As the name states, contact registries securely store contact information from groups of&#xD;
      reasonably well-characterized patients (or primary supporters/caregivers) who are interested&#xD;
      in being informed about ongoing or future research opportunities. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is&#xD;
      a condition for which effective therapies have remained elusive, making drug trials and&#xD;
      interventional research studies a mainstay in the PF arena over the last decade and for the&#xD;
      foreseeable future. A PF Contact Registry will be a conduit to collect, analyze, and&#xD;
      disseminate de-identified, group-level data on the clinical phenotypes of PF patients and&#xD;
      will house contact information from patients who wish to be informed about research&#xD;
      opportunities for which they may qualify. Data contained in the Registry will help inform&#xD;
      research hypotheses and guide investigators as they develop research protocols by providing&#xD;
      them with numbers of potential subjects who meet particular inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Who will be in the Registry?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone who is at least 18 years of age, can read and understand English, and either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. diagnosed with PF or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a primary supporter or caregiver of someone living with PF&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the Registry works&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PF consent to be enrolled in the Registry and may consent to be contacted by&#xD;
      Registry personnel about opportunities for them to participate in research studies. Some of&#xD;
      these studies (e.g., &quot;Observing the Effects of Supplemental Oxygen on Patients with Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis&quot;) will be conducted by Dr. Swigris and his research team-these studies will be&#xD;
      considered Registry-affiliated. Registry participants are free to enroll in any study they&#xD;
      wish-whether Registry-affiliated or conducted by investigators not affiliated with the&#xD;
      Registry-i.e., non-Registry-affiliated studies. It is assumed the investigators conducting&#xD;
      those studies will adhere to regulations governing the protection of human subjects in&#xD;
      research. Consider a hypothetical example: an investigator in Michigan is conducting a study&#xD;
      of the effects of oral honey on PF-related cough and would like Registry participants to&#xD;
      consider enrollment. The investigator would petition the Registry and, if approved by the&#xD;
      Registry Oversight Committee, Registry personnel would contact potentially eligible Registry&#xD;
      participants to inform them of the study. The participants would then decide whether or not&#xD;
      to contact the investigator in Michigan to be considered for enrollment. The investigatory in&#xD;
      Michigan would be responsible for discussing the study with any potential subject, obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent and conducting the study. All of these fall outside the purview of the&#xD;
      Registry or its personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How subjects will enroll in the Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants must fill out an intake questionnaire/consent form. Contact information&#xD;
      provided to receive a questionnaire is not stored by the Registry Data Coordinating Center&#xD;
      (DCC) or by the study coordinator. Subjects may obtain the intake questionnaire, complete it,&#xD;
      and submit it four different ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the questionnaire/consent form and submit it online at&#xD;
           https://dccweb.njhealth.org/sec/P3F_Swigris/Index.htm. Participants will be encouraged&#xD;
           to print a copy for their records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enter a mailing address onto an online form at&#xD;
           http://pulmonaryfibrosisresearch.org/contact and have a hard copy mailed to the subject.&#xD;
           Once a signed questionnaire/consent has been sent back to the study coordinator, a copy&#xD;
           will be made and mailed back to the participant for his/her records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out the form electronically at&#xD;
           https://dccweb.njhealth.org/sec/P3F_Swigris/Index.htm and print a copy of the form, or&#xD;
           print the form and fill it out by hand and mail or fax the completed questionnaire to&#xD;
           the study coordinator who will then hand it off to the DCC at National Jewish Health.&#xD;
           Participants will be encouraged to print a copy for their records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Call the study coordinator toll-free at 1-855-609-0010 and have him/her mail a hard copy&#xD;
           of the questionnaire/consent form to the subject. Once a signed questionnaire/consent&#xD;
           has been sent back to the study coordinator, a copy will be made and mailed back to the&#xD;
           participant for his/her records.&#xD;
