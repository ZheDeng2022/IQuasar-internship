  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two thirds of stroke survivors have profoundly impaired function of the upper&#xD;
      limb. Currently the main stay of the treatment for upper limb motor function is&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task practice (task-oriented&#xD;
      therapy) which has been shown to induce substantial functional reorganization in the&#xD;
      undamaged motor cortex and functional recovery. In spite of rehabilitation therapy,&#xD;
      functional recovery of arm and hand function is limited to one third of stroke survivors and&#xD;
      there is a great need for adjunct treatment to current practice. Repetitive Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial&#xD;
      areas of the brain and emerging as a novel method of modulating cortical excitability and&#xD;
      promoting functional recovery after stroke. There have been studies using rTMS to improve&#xD;
      motor function after stroke. However, whether 1Hz rTMS can enhance the effect of the&#xD;
      task-oriented therapy on upper limb function after stroke has not been investigated. In this&#xD;
      pilot proposal, we intend to investigate the feasibility of 1Hz rTMS on unaffected hemisphere&#xD;
      as an adjunct to task-oriented therapy to improve upper limb motor function among stroke&#xD;
      patients. The information obtained from this pilot study will provide a platform for the&#xD;
      future randomized control trials combining the rTMS and task-oriented therapy to enhance&#xD;
      motor recovery among stroke survivors.&#xD;
