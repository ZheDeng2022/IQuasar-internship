  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isoniazid (INH) is a drug commonly used to treat TB worldwide. Sometimes, the bacteria that&#xD;
      cause TB can become resistant to INH. Resistance means that bacteria have adapted to a drug&#xD;
      and are able to live in the presence of the drug. When TB becomes resistant to INH, INH does&#xD;
      not work as well at fighting the bacteria. This study will treat people with INH-resistant TB&#xD;
      with different doses of INH to see if INH can still fight the bacteria if we just increase&#xD;
      the dose. We will compare how well the drug works at higher doses for participants who have&#xD;
      resistant TB to how well the drug works at regular doses for participants who have TB that is&#xD;
      not resistant. The study will also compare the safety and tolerability of the different doses&#xD;
      of INH. Tolerability is how well people can put up with the side effects of a drug. Using&#xD;
      increased doses of INH to treat TB that is resistant to INH is experimental and has not been&#xD;
      approved by regulatory authorities. While there is some evidence that this approach will&#xD;
      work, this has not yet been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in two stages. Stage 1 is a pilot study to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of enrolling enough participants into Stage 2, the larger stage of this study. If Stage 1 is&#xD;
      successful, then Stage 2 will begin.&#xD;
