  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonoscopy is the reference examination for the diagnosis of neoplastic lesions in the&#xD;
      colon and rectum. Mass screening assessment studies have shown that colonoscopic detection&#xD;
      and removal of adenomas in patients selected through fecal occult blood test reduces&#xD;
      colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. However, the literature has reported interval&#xD;
      cancer cases or adenomas, probably &quot;missed&quot; by the colonoscopy. In theory, using coloured&#xD;
      warm water could improve colon preparation by mobilizing the residual faeces, decreasing the&#xD;
      colic spasm and increasing the visualization of the pit pattern. Preliminary American&#xD;
      studies, led by Leung et al, have shown a very clear increase in the adenoma detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' study involves 1 000 patients, treated in the Rhône-Alpes / Auvergne&#xD;
      region. The patients present an indication for colonoscopy following a positive fecal occult&#xD;
      blood test or symptoms or personal and family histories of pre-cancerous colonic lesions.&#xD;
      They will be randomized into two study groups:one of both groups of study: Group 1: patients&#xD;
      undergoing a colonoscopy wtih instillation of tepid water tinged with blue (Indigo Carmin®)&#xD;
      Group 2: patients undergoing a standard colonoscopy with insufflation of air. The main&#xD;
      objective is to show that the colonoscopy with blue water (Indigo Carmin®) enable detection&#xD;
      of more lesions than standard colonoscopy with insufflation of air. The two techniques will&#xD;
      be also compared in terms of tolerance, of duration of colonoscopy and type of detected&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of improved detection of colorectal lesions, the blue water instillation technique of&#xD;
      could dramatically change gastroenterologists' practice by becoming the reference method. The&#xD;
      expected clinical benefits are potential revealing of more neoplastic lesions and improvement&#xD;
      in abdominal discomfort after colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <measure>The rate of colonoscopy with at least one adenoma detected (or adenoma detection rate) confirmed by a histological reporting.</measure>

    <measure>Measure 1: The characteristics of the lesions detected by the two types of colonoscopy (diameter, macroscopic appearance, histological nature)</measure>
    <time_frame>within the first 20 days after colonoscopy.</time_frame>
    <description>We chose three classifications recognized by the medical field:&#xD;
The Paris endoscopic classification defines macroscopic appearance.&#xD;
The Kudo classification explains endoscopic appearance.&#xD;
The Vienna classification describes the histologic nature of the lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure 2 Comparison of the time of the endoscope during the colonoscopy between the two methods</measure>
    <time_frame>This data is available during the colonoscopy</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure 3 The comparison of the tolerance of the two colonoscopy procedures by assessing patient reported side effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>At patient's awakening the day of colonoscopy or one day after</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerance is measured using a Visual Analog Scale.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes four questions :&#xD;
Did you have any pains?&#xD;
How would you describe your bloating?&#xD;
How would you describe your sensations of abdominal discomfort?&#xD;
How would you describe your overall tolerance of the examination?&#xD;
In addition to this Visual Analog Scale, we administer a short multiple choice questionnaire:&#xD;
Would you be ready to redo the colonoscopy in the same conditions? (yes or no)&#xD;
For patients who have already had colonoscopies with insufflation of air in the past, which examination (tepid water or air) would you prefer during the next exam?</description>
