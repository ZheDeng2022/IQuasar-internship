      A Study to Evaluate the Contraceptive Effectiveness during the Third, Fourth and Fifth Year&#xD;
      of Sino-implant (II)Use and the Pharmacokinetics (PK) over Five Years of use in Chinese Women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: A total of 590 Chinese Sino-Implant (II) users between 20and 44 years of age&#xD;
      enrolled in one of four prospective cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: n=20 women with insertion dates 3-5months prior to enrollment and followed for 2-6&#xD;
      months Cohort 2:n=20 women with insertion dates 9-11 months prior to enrollment and followed&#xD;
      for 2-6 months Cohort 3: n=250 women with insertion dates 21-24 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
      and followed through month 36 Cohort 4:n=300 women with insertion dates 33-36 months prior to&#xD;
      enrollment and followed through month 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 33 total months in the field: 3 months of participant recruitment(all&#xD;
      cohorts); up to 27 months of pregnancy monitoring and PK blood sampling in Cohort 4 (up to 15&#xD;
      months in Cohort 3 and 6 months in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2);and 3 months of close-out&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary PK outcomes, blood samples will be taken 2 to 6 months apart from each woman in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 and Cohort 2; at enrollment, month 30 and month 36 from the first 20 consenting&#xD;
      women in Cohort 3; and at enrollment and months 42, 48, 54, and 60 from the first 30&#xD;
      consenting women in Cohort 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of Sino-implant (II) during&#xD;
      the third and fourth years of use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the contraceptive effectiveness of Sino-implant (II) during the fifth year&#xD;
           of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the total and free levonorgestrel (LNG) plasma concentration-time&#xD;
           profiles over five years following Sino-implant (II) insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) serum concentration-time profile&#xD;
           and its relationship to total LNG levels over five years following Sino-implant (II)&#xD;
           insertion&#xD;
