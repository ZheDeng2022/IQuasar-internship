  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out if AES ( Activation Energy Serum) , a blend of natural minerals ,&#xD;
      is effective and safe for the treatment of asthma if taken for 4 weeks . The efficacy will be&#xD;
      scientifically tested by symptoms scores, questionnaires, breathing and blood tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to compare the overall efficacy and safety of AES&#xD;
      ( Activation Energy Serum) by demonstrating a clinically significant improvement in morning&#xD;
      FEV1 in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma treated with 2 doses of AES for 4&#xD;
      weeks compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the effect of AES on a) clinical symptoms by&#xD;
      symptom scores and the Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ) , b) fractional exhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide ( FeNO) , c) blood eosinophil count and other biomarkers , and d) quality of life&#xD;
      through the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ) .&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study should fulfill all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Males and females of any race who are between 18 and 65 years old at the time informed&#xD;
             consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Physician diagnosis of asthma, as per NIH ( National Institutes of Health) guidelines,&#xD;
             for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second) value&#xD;
             of 40% to 90% of individual predicted value at screening and at randomization, and the&#xD;
             value at the randomization should be within 15% of the screening FEV1. The results of&#xD;
             spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS ( American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory&#xD;
             Society) criteria for acceptability and repeatability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients who are demonstrated to have reversible airway obstruction or airways hyper-&#xD;
        reactivity or have shown either of such responses in previous test(s) within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Reversible airway obstruction is defined as an increase of ≥12% and ≥200 ml in FEV1 over&#xD;
        the patient's pre-bronchodilator value in litres within 10-15 minutes after inhaling a&#xD;
        total of 360 µg of albuterol or 400 µg salbutamol via MDI (metered dose inhaler)&#xD;
        (reversibility test). The administration of albuterol or salbutamol for the reversibility&#xD;
        test is to be within 30 minutes after pre-bronchodilator spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. An ACQ ( Asthma Control Questionnaire) score ≥ 1.5 at randomization. 8. Total daily&#xD;
        asthma symptom score of &gt; 4 on 3 out of 7 days between the Screening and Randomization&#xD;
        Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. A fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level of &gt; 25 ppb 9. Blood eosinophil count of&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half- lives of enrollment, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of hypersensitivity to any AES products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether&#xD;
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU( milli&#xD;
             international unit)/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
        becoming pregnant, must use effective contraception during the study and for 4 days (5&#xD;
        half-lives) after treatment. Effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Barrier method: c) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap&#xD;
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
             suppository. Spermicides alone are not a barrier method of contraception and should&#xD;
             not be used alone. The following methods are considered more effective than the&#xD;
             barrier method and are also acceptable:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In&#xD;
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male partner sterilization. [For female study subjects, the vasectomised male partner&#xD;
             should be the sole partner for that patient]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of established, oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) 7. Patients with serious&#xD;
             co-morbidities including uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c ≥8%), heart failure, cancer,&#xD;
             neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, other&#xD;
             lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or&#xD;
             emphysema or other conditions characterised by eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms&#xD;
             (i.e. Churg-Strauss syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic&#xD;
             pneumonia, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Acute illness other than asthma at the start of the study. 9. History of&#xD;
             life-threatening asthma, including a history of significant hypercarbia (pCO2&gt;45mmHg),&#xD;

             10. History of alcohol or other substance abuse. 11. Patients who have had a&#xD;
             respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks of the screening visit. Patients who&#xD;
             develop a respiratory tract infection between screening and the randomization visit&#xD;
             must be screen failed, and may be permitted to re-enroll at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Patients who have been hospitalized due to their asthma, or that have required&#xD;
             treatment with systemic steroids, within 6 weeks of the screening visit.&#xD;
