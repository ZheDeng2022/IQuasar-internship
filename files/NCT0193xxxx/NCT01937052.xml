      The purpose of this project is to establish a repository of information and samples from&#xD;
      breast cancer patients or those at high risk of developing breast cancer, who are initiating&#xD;
      hormone therapy as part of standard clinical care or prevention. This repository will include&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes and other questionnaires, information on medication use, data about&#xD;
      adherence to the hormone therapy and tumor characteristics, including prospectively collected&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

      This research is being done to learn more about the side effects of breast cancer hormone&#xD;
      therapy and if a person's genetic information may help us to develop a way to predict the&#xD;
      side effects a patient may have and how best to treat them. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to look at how the side effects from hormone therapy influence a patient's willingness&#xD;
      to continue hormonal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women being prescribed hormone therapies including Tamoxifen, Raloxifene (Evista),&#xD;
      Anastrozole (Arimidex), Letrozole (Femara), or Exemestane (Aromasin), by their oncologist for&#xD;
      either prevention of breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer may join.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision of which hormone therapy to receive is the decision of the patient and&#xD;
      physician, this study will collect samples and patient-reported outcomes during this routine,&#xD;
      standard of care and will not direct any treatment decisions or interventions in any way.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Physically and cognitively able to complete the questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet one of the following categories: 1) Initiating hormonal therapy for breast cancer&#xD;
             prevention. All patients planned to initiate hormonal therapy with either Tamoxifen,&#xD;
             Raloxifene (Evista®), Anastrozole (Arimidex®), Letrozole (Femara®) or Exemestane&#xD;
             (Aromasin®) are eligible; concomitant use of Zoladex or Lupron is permitted; 2)&#xD;
             Patients with histologically proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS/stage 0) or stage&#xD;
             I-III invasive carcinoma of the breast that is estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone (PR)&#xD;
             positive by immunohistochemical staining, who are considering one of the above listed&#xD;
             SERMs or AIs. These patients must have completed any planned chemotherapy and local&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., lumpectomy or mastectomy); however, enrollment/initiation of hormonal&#xD;
             therapy on study may be done prior to completion of radiation and/or biologic therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., trastuzumab) at the discretion of the treating team; or, 3) The patient is&#xD;
             aware of the nature of her diagnosis, understands the study regimen, its requirements,&#xD;
             risks, and discomforts, and is able and willing to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients transitioning from one hormonal agent listed above to another may be enrolled&#xD;
             prior to initiation of the new medication.&#xD;
