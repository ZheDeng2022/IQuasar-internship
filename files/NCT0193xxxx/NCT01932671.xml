  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After having had a first cardiovascular event, there is a considerable risk of developing a&#xD;
      subsequent event. Only recently, a risk prediction model was developed for this group of&#xD;
      patients. Imaging techniques such as the coronary artery calcium score and contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) of the coronary and carotid arteries could be able to add improve&#xD;
      this model. Imaging may further improve the prediction of future manifestations of arterial&#xD;
      disease and personalize disease monitoring and treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a prior cardiovascular event exhibit an elevated risk for subsequent&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. The Second Manifestation of Arterial Disease Study (SMART) has&#xD;
      recruited over 10,000 patients since 1996 with clinically manifest cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary single center study involving primary care physicians, cardiologists,&#xD;
      neurologists, vascular surgeons, vascular medicine specialists and radiologists. Within this&#xD;
      study a prediction model was developed to accurately estimate the risk for new cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. It is now possible to acquire high-quality motion-free computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      images of the coronary and carotid arteries. Imaging biomarkers extracted from these images&#xD;
      may further improve the prediction of future manifestations of arterial disease and&#xD;
      personalize disease monitoring and medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SMART-ORACLE study is a prospective, single center, observational cohort study aiming to&#xD;
      include 1500 patients. The primary aim is to identify predictors of future cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. Eligible patients will be selected via the recruitment of the original SMART study.&#xD;
      Patients participating in the SMART-ORACLE study will undergo calcium scoring in multiple&#xD;
      cardiovascular beds and contrast-enhanced CT-scans of the coronary and carotid arteries in&#xD;
      addition to the regular SMART investigations. Patients with renal dysfunction will be either&#xD;
      excluded from the study or will receive pre-hydration (depending on eGFR) to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of contrast nephropathy. Follow-up with questionnaire-based assessment will take place&#xD;
      every 26 weeks until death of participant or end of the SMART study, asking participants&#xD;
      about possible new cardiovascular events. Endpoints will be adjudicated by a committee of&#xD;
      three experts. The aim is to collect 170 future events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis will consist of Cox proportional hazard analysis. Imaging biomarkers will&#xD;
      be added to the existing prediction model to assess their (independent) discriminatory&#xD;
      capacity for future events. The c-statistic will be used to measure the discrimination of&#xD;
      each model. Net reclassification improvement tables will be constructed to evaluate the added&#xD;
      value of imaging markers in terms of reclassification. Based on a one-year-occurrence rate of&#xD;
      subsequent cardiovascular events in the current SMART population database of 2.6%, about 6500&#xD;
      person years of follow-up are needed to obtain the adequate number of endpoints.&#xD;

Participants are re-invited after 4 years for a second screening. This screening is performed to study the progression of atherosclerosis and evaluate the effects of the advice of the multidisciplinary team.</description>
