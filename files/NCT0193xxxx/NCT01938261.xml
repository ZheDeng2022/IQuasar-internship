      Present randomized, controlled, double-blind trial investigates the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      early (&lt;24 h) intravenous paracetamol therapy for pain medication in very small premature&#xD;
      infants. This phase 2 drug study focuses on the efficacy and safety of short-term use. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of paracetamol, as well as the long-term effects, are&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study recruits preterm infants born less than 32 weeks gestational age and treated at&#xD;
      the neonatal intensive care unit of Oulu University Hospital. The informed consent is asked&#xD;
      from all parents. The first drug dose is given before 24 hours of age. Masked study drug is&#xD;
      paracetamol infusion solution 10 mg/mL or placebo, 0.45% saline solution. The loading dose is&#xD;
      20 mg/kg, and the maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days. The exact date of the&#xD;
      closure of ductus is studied by repeated echocardiographic examinations. The symptoms of pain&#xD;
      are screened by a pain scale of preterm infants (NIAPAS). Patients are monitored for signs of&#xD;
      possible side effects. After discharge from hospital, patients are examined at follow-up&#xD;
      clinic for the first year every 3 months and at 2 years of age.&#xD;

      1 Hypotheses and aims: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenous paracetamol in pain medication for small preterm infants in a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, double-blind trial. The primary outcome of the pain medication arm is the need&#xD;
      for morphine medication (doses). The secondary outcomes are paracetamol serum concentrations,&#xD;
      the side effects of paracetamol (possible hepatic dysfunction), neonatal and long-term&#xD;
      morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome in the phase 2 ductus study-arm was diminishing of the ductal caliber at&#xD;
      5 days postnatal age. This study arm has been finalized and the results were published on&#xD;
      2016 (Härkin et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Hypothesis. Early, intravenous paracetamol is effective and safe therapy in the relief of&#xD;
      pain and discomfort of a preterm infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Hypothesis. Paracetamol levels of a preterm infant remain in safety limits with study&#xD;
      dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Hypothesis. Early, intravenous paracetamol does not increase long-term morbidity in&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim: to evaluate in a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, the efficacy and&#xD;
           safety of the early (&lt;24 h), intravenous paracetamol in pain treatment of a preterm&#xD;
           infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim: to evaluate the safety of the early (&lt;24 h), intravenous paracetamol in preterm&#xD;
           infants requiring intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim: to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of paracetamol in a preterm infants&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aim: to evaluate the long-term effects of the early (&lt;24 h), intravenous paracetamol in&#xD;
           preterm infants requiring intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Study permissions: The research plan is registered to the investigational diary of the&#xD;
      Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital (diary number 100-2013). For the present&#xD;
      trial, the permissions from The Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital district's Ethical Board and&#xD;
      Oulu University Hospital's administrative officials have been applied and granted. The study&#xD;
      permission has been applied and granted from Fimea, the Finnish Medicines Agency. The&#xD;
      amendment of the research plan was approved on 30.4.2018. This project has been assigned to&#xD;
      EudraCT network (European Clinical Trials Database), Eudra CT number 2013-008142-33, and the&#xD;
      international ClinicalTrials.gov registry, identification number NCT01938261.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent is asked by the primary investigators of the study from all study&#xD;
      patients' parents. The present clinical trial is managed by the principles of Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, GCP (Fimea, act 2/2012, Clinical drug trials). The essential changes of the&#xD;
      research plan are announced to Fimea according to the Drug legislation act 87a, using the&#xD;
      European commission internet site (http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/eudralex/vol-10/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Sample size: The sample size calculation for the pain medication trial was checked after&#xD;
      the first randomization. According to our previous study (Härmä et al, 2016), non-exposed&#xD;
      premature infants received approximately 5 doses of morphine (SD 12) during their stay in the&#xD;
      NICU. In order to treat infants without opioids, the clinical difference was approximated to&#xD;
      be 6 doses. Therefore, with 20% power and 0.05 alpha-error, 126 infants (63/group) were&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Study patients and exclusion criteria: This study will recruit all the intubated premature&#xD;
      infants born less than 32 weeks of gestational age managed in Oulu University Hospital's&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit. The deadline for recruitment and administration of the first&#xD;
      dose of the study drug is postnatal age of 24 hours. The study exclusion criteria are severe&#xD;
      structural, or chromosomal abnormality, and other severe clinical situation, which&#xD;
      essentially affects the small premature infants' conventional early-stage treatment, e.g.&#xD;
      severe asphyxia or persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Randomization and blinding: As the informed consent is given, the study patient receives a&#xD;
      trial number from the list made prior to the entry of the study. The trial number will match&#xD;
      with an envelope where has been drawn a leaflet with the patient's study medication group&#xD;
      written on it. Placebo, 0.45 % saline, is similar to paracetamol, both being clear liquids,&#xD;
      so the staff will remain unaware which drug the patient receives. The study medication will&#xD;
      be kept and prepared at the ward 55 in a separate office, in a locked cabinet. The study drug&#xD;
      will be prepared by the study nurse, or by a nurse who does not participate in the study&#xD;
      patients' treatment in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Intervention: Masked study drug is 10 mg/ml paracetamol solution (Paracetamol Kabi&#xD;
      Pharmacia®). Placebo is 0.45% saline solution, which does not enhance the potential small&#xD;
      preterm infants' early-stage hypernatremia or hyperglycemia. Both are visually similar, clear&#xD;
      solutions. Loading dose, 20 mg/kg, is followed by a maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours,&#xD;
      for four days. According to the earlier phase 1 studies, this dose is considered to be safe&#xD;
      for small preterm infant. The drug is administered as a 15-minute infusion. No other&#xD;
      paracetamol preparations are allowed to be given simultaneously with the study drug. After&#xD;
      the intervention, the use of paracetamol should be restricted as far as it is possible. If&#xD;
      the patient's clinical condition requires starting of paracetamol medication, there should be&#xD;
      at least two days absence of paracetamol after the last dose of study medication. Half-life&#xD;
      of intravenous paracetamol in neonates is about 4.5 hours. No other restrictions on the&#xD;
      patient's therapy are set. After the study intervention, the patient is treated by the&#xD;
      attending physicians' clinical judgment. Whenever necessary, the patient will be given the&#xD;
      normal dose of morphine, 0.1 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Monitoring of the pain symptoms: The pain or discomfort of the patients will be screened&#xD;
      using NIAPAS scoring before and after the study drug administration. According to the NIAPAS&#xD;
      guidelines, values &gt;5 indicate the need for evaluation for pain relief, either with using the&#xD;
      non-medical pain relief methods, or increasing the pain medication dose. All the study&#xD;
      patients will receive necessary pain medication during the study which would be morphine ad&#xD;
      0.1 mg/kg single doses, or morphine infusion. All morphine doses given during and after the&#xD;
      intervention are recorded and calculated as the cumulative dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Paracetamol safety: Using the study drug dosage, no signs of liver or renal failure have&#xD;
      been described before. In addition, in the recent retrospective analysis among the study unit&#xD;
      patient population, none of the preterm infants who received paracetamol showed any clinical&#xD;
      or laboratory signs of either complication. No increased levels of liver transaminases,&#xD;
      bilirubin or creatinine were detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In paracetamol intoxication, the hepatic failure is caused by a paracetamol metabolite, not&#xD;
      paracetamol itself. Thus, the symptoms of intoxication are not immediately evident. The&#xD;
      hepatic tissue damage can be prevented administering the paracetamol antidote as soon as&#xD;
      possible. Even a suspicion of a possible intoxication in an otherwise symptom-free patient is&#xD;
      to be taken seriously. This situation should be cautiously clarified, and, if necessary, the&#xD;
      antidote started vigorously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signs and symptoms of paracetamol intoxication include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first 24 hours, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and perspiration&#xD;
           may be manifested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-48 h after the overdose, the signs of it may be seen in the laboratory examinations:&#xD;
           bilirubin and hepatic transaminase levels increase, and the prothrombin time lengthens&#xD;
           (INR increases; this may happen without hepatic failure if the synthesis of vitamin K&#xD;
           dependent coagulation factors is inhibited). Diuresis may be diminished due to possible&#xD;
           dehydration (vomiting), renal failure, and the antidiuretic action of paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-5 days later, the liver and renal tissue damage develops. In the patients with hepatic&#xD;
           failure, metabolic acidosis is usually seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early acetyl cysteine therapy (&lt;16 h after the overdose) may inhibit the hepatic failure, but&#xD;
      even when started later, the tissue damage may be restricted. If necessary, the Poison&#xD;
      Information Centre is consulted about the individualized instructions for treatment. The&#xD;
      initial treatment includes intravenous fluid therapy in order to correct the acidosis, and&#xD;
      the goal for the diuresis would be &gt;1.5 ml/kg/h. The intravenously administered study&#xD;
      medication cannot cause any harmful effects to the patients' relatives, the hospital staff,&#xD;
      or the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Monitoring, reporting and follow-up of the possible side effects: All study patients will&#xD;
      be monitored for signs of possible side effects, especially the signs of hepatic or renal&#xD;
      dysfunction. During the first postnatal days, serum bilirubin levels and diuresis will be&#xD;
      followed. If a patient had prolonged or otherwise pronounced jaundice, the abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound would be performed. Any evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunction would be an&#xD;
      indication to withdraw the study medication, and to measure the hepatic transaminases and&#xD;
      creatinine concentrations. Symptomatic hepatic or renal failure is defined as an emergency&#xD;
      when the blinding code could be opened and the study discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All harmful events and suspected side effects are individually evaluated for possible&#xD;
      association to the study drug. The associations are classified: certain - likely - unlikely -&#xD;
      not possible. The harmful events that are classified significant (SUSAR) are listed by the&#xD;
      responsible investigator. Of the serious and unexpected harmful events, death or mortal&#xD;
      danger are announced to Fimea within seven days after the incidence and the others within 15&#xD;
      days. The list of the harmful events is delivered to Fimea every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 Pharmacokinetics: From those study patients with an arterial cannula, a single 1 ml blood&#xD;
      sample at 48 hours postnatal age will be collected to evaluate paracetamol serum&#xD;
      concentrations and the biological effects of prematurity. Of all the routine blood samples,&#xD;
      any remaining droplets are retained for paracetamol concentration measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 Data collection: The study data will be collected using Centricity Critical Care Clinisoft&#xD;
      software (GE Healthcare). All the data is confidential. All the study personnel are involved&#xD;
      with confidentiality. The computed data is collected into the hospital's intranet station O.&#xD;
      Study papers are mapped, and kept in the room of the responsible investigator. The Office of&#xD;
      the Data Protection Ombudsman has been informed about the study register. The study results&#xD;
      will be published in international, peer-reviewed medical literature, and in medical theses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 Quality control: An external study monitor, observing the quality of the methods used and&#xD;
      the fulfillment of the study patients' rights, has been named.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 Long-term follow-up: For the first year after discharge from hospital, the patients will&#xD;
      be examined every three months at the follow-up clinic. Patients will be examined the&#xD;
      clinical status, basic laboratory parameters, and if necessary, radiographic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13 Statistical analyses: The intention-to-treat principle is applied in all analyzes. P-value&#xD;
      &lt;.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analyzes will be made using the IBM SPSS&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
