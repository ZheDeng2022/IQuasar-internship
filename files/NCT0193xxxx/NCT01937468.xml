      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cells and also tries to define the&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the investigational combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg&#xD;
      cells to use for further studies. IL-2 is involved with cell signaling and regulation of&#xD;
      white blood cells (WBCs). WBCs are part of the immune system. Treg cells are also part of the&#xD;
      immune system; they are involved with anti-inflammatory responses. &quot;Investigational&quot; means&#xD;
      that the combination of IL-2 and anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion is being studied. It&#xD;
      also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination&#xD;
      of IL-2 and anti-inflammatory Treg cell infusion for use in people with cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that may occur after you have received your bone marrow,&#xD;
      stem cell or cord blood transplant from a donor. The donor's immune system may recognize your&#xD;
      body (the host) as foreign and attempt to 'reject' it. This process is known as&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional standard therapy to treat cGVHD is prednisone (steroids). Participants on this&#xD;
      trial have not responded to steroid therapy. The investigators are looking to assess the&#xD;
      safety and optimal dose for the combination of IL-2 plus donor anti-inflammatory Treg cells,&#xD;
      that may help control cGVHD by stopping the donor's immune system from 'rejecting' your body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study: If you take part in this research study, you (and your donor) will have the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Lymphocytes Collection: Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell involved with the&#xD;
      immune system. Your original marrow/stem cell donor will undergo one white blood cell&#xD;
      collection procedures called leukapheresis. Blood from the vein in one arm will be circulated&#xD;
      through a special machine to remove the white blood cells, and the rest of the blood will be&#xD;
      returned to the donor's other arm. The cells collected from the leukapheresis will be sent to&#xD;
      the laboratory where the amount of white blood cells collected will be measured. A sample&#xD;
      will be removed for study testing, and the remaining lymphocytes will be set-aside for&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Lymphocyte Processing: Once the lymphocytes are collected from your donor, the&#xD;
      CliniMACS System device will enrich (preferentially select) the number of Treg cells. Samples&#xD;
      will be taken before and after processing by the CliniMACS System to examine the cells. After&#xD;
      completing the necessary safety tests, the Treg-enriched donor lymphocyte cells will be ready&#xD;
      for administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Cellular Infusion (DCI): The Treg-enriched donor lymphocytes will be infused through an&#xD;
      intravenous (I.V.) catheter over approximately 5-10 minutes. Prior to the infusion, you will&#xD;
      receive Tylenol and Benadryl to prevent transfusion related reactions. You will be observed&#xD;
      for about 1 hour after the infusion. The total anticipated time you will spend in the clinic&#xD;
      is approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the investigators are looking for the highest one-time dose of the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      donor cells that can be administered safely in combination with IL-2 without severe or&#xD;
      unmanageable side effects in participants that have cGVHD, not everyone who participates in&#xD;
      this research study will receive the same dose of the donor cells. The cell dose you get will&#xD;
      depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how&#xD;
      well they have tolerated their cell doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug: You will give yourself or be given IL-2 daily through an injection under your&#xD;
      skin. You will do this once every day for 8 weeks, starting from the day of donor Treg cell&#xD;
      infusion. You will then have 4 weeks off of IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 will be provided in single-use (one-time only) syringes to be refrigerated at home at 36&#xD;
      - 46°F (2 - 8°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 6 weeks of IL-2, you will continue to take steroids and other immune&#xD;
      suppressing medications without changing the dose your doctor has set for you while you are&#xD;
      on IL-2. After 6 weeks of IL-2 therapy, your doctor may reduce the amount of steroids you&#xD;
      take.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cGVHD improves after 8 weeks on IL-2, you may have the option of continuing&#xD;
      extended-duration therapy. Extended-duration therapy is daily IL-2 treatment starting at the&#xD;
      end-of-study visit after week 12. Your doctor will discuss this option with you. If you&#xD;
      continue with extended-duration IL-2 therapy after completing the week 12 evaluation, you&#xD;
      will be assessed on the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic visits for evaluation of toxicity and clinical benefit approximately every 4&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunologic assays approximately every 8 weeks. Immunologic assays will measure the&#xD;
           effect of IL-2 on immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Diary: Each day for the first 8 weeks you take IL-2 and each day during extend-duration&#xD;
      IL-2 (if applicable), you will be asked to document, in a drug diary, when you took the drug&#xD;
      and where you injected it. The diary will also include special instructions for taking the&#xD;
      study drug(s). The diary will also ask if the entire syringe was injected, and if there were&#xD;
      other issues related to IL-2. You will be asked to return your drug diary to clinic every 14&#xD;
      days while you receive IL-2. If you continue taking IL-2 in the extend-duration portion, you&#xD;
      will return your drug diary every 8 weeks (at your clinic visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic GVHD Assessments: While you are on study, a member of the study team will examine you&#xD;
      to evaluate your cGVHD. These assessments may include examination of your skin,&#xD;
      joints/muscles, eyes, mouth, lungs and gastrointestinal system (for example, whether you have&#xD;
      experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing). The investigators will&#xD;
      also look at the range of motion of different body parts (for example, your arms).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recipient of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have steroid-refractory cGVHD. Steroid-refractory cGVHD is defined&#xD;
             as having persistent signs and symptoms of cGVHD (Appendix D; section 17.4) despite&#xD;
             the use of prednisone at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least&#xD;
             4 weeks (or equivalent dosing of alternate glucocorticoids) without complete&#xD;
             resolution of signs and symptoms. Participants with either extensive chronic GVHD or&#xD;
             limited chronic GVHD requiring systemic therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of glucocorticoids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g.,&#xD;
             calcineurin-inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. The dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the&#xD;
             therapeutic range of that drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient age 18 years old. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
             available on the use of IL-2 in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded&#xD;
             from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 (Appendix A; section 17.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic: Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dl-exception permitted in&#xD;
             participants with Gilbert's Syndrome; AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2x ULN), unless hepatic&#xD;
             dysfunction is a manifestation of presumed cGVHD. For participants with abnormal LFTs&#xD;
             as the sole manifestation of cGVHD, documented GVHD on liver biopsy will be required&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Abnormal LFTs in the context of active cGVHD involving other&#xD;
             organ systems may also be permitted if the treating physician documents the abnormal&#xD;
             LFTs as being consistent with hepatic cGVHD, and a liver biopsy will not be mandated&#xD;
             in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary: FEV1 ≥ 50% or DLCO(Hb) ≥ 40% of predicted, unless pulmonary dysfunction is&#xD;
             deemed to be due to chronic GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than upper limit of normal institutional limits or&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above&#xD;
             institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function indicated by ANC&gt;1000/mm3 and platelets&gt;50,000/mm3&#xD;
             without growth factors or transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac: No myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or NYHA Class&#xD;
             III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction&#xD;
             system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at screening must be&#xD;
             documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of IL-2 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing prednisone requirement &gt;1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of calcineurin-inhibitor plus sirolimus (either agent alone is&#xD;
             acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic&#xD;
             thrombocytopenic purpura&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New chronic GVHD therapies (e.g. gleevec, extracorporeal photopheresis, rituximab,&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications) in the 4 weeks prior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low-dose IL-2 therapy in the 4 weeks prior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-transplant exposure to T-cell or alternative IL-2 targeted medication (e.g. ATG,&#xD;
             alemtuzumab, basiliximab, denileukin diftitox) within 100 days prior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donor lymphocyte infusion within 100 days prior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignant relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with IL-2 treatment regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ transplant (allograft) recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with the agents used after&#xD;
             allogeneic HSCT. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at&#xD;
             high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other investigational drugs within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, unless cleared by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued.&#xD;
