      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AD5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3&#xD;
      in patients with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2a clinical trial in subjects who are diagnosed with prostate cancer to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 in the treatment of localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1/T2)&#xD;
      having a Gleason score of 6 to 7 (3+4 or 4+3). Subjects will receive up to four (4)&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided IT treatments with Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 into the prostate&#xD;
      approximately 6-weeks apart. Each treatment cycle will be performed using a minimum of three&#xD;
      track injections through the prostrate using a total of 3 mL volume. Approximately 2 mL of&#xD;
      the total volume will be injected into the most dense areas of cancer based on biopsy and MRI&#xD;
      mapping (fusion biopsy) and 1 mL total volume will be injected into the opposite lobe of the&#xD;
      prostate or other areas to ensure complete saturation of the prostate over multiple&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are progressing at any time after the&#xD;
      second injection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 may be discontinued and will be treated according to&#xD;
      standard medical practice.&#xD;

    <description>Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3, was designed to increase intracellular production REIC protein. The adenovirus vector is a transport mechanism to infuse the REIC protein into the cell providing a temporary transfusion of protein that induces apoptosis in target cancer cells, but does not appear to have a significant effect on normal tissues.</description>
