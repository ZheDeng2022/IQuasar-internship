      The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) is an opportunity&#xD;
      to conduct methodology research relevant to many features of a large prospective study.&#xD;
      NICOLA will begin in earnest in Northern Ireland in 2013 and is being conducted by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team in the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University Belfast. It is&#xD;
      an omnibus programme of research on ageing that will continue for at least 10 years and will&#xD;
      recruit 8500 middle-aged people in Northern Ireland and follow them into old age, providing a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of their physical and mental health, their lifestyles, and their&#xD;
      social and economic decision making. NICOLA will look at how they perceive disability and&#xD;
      health, and how this differs between well-off and disadvantaged groups. NICOLA will also&#xD;
      study various genetic, biological and psychological factors, including how participants&#xD;
      perceive risk and value their time, and the effect of this on their retirement behaviour&#xD;
      (including how they manage their money and their health). People over the age of 50 will be&#xD;
      invited to take part and asked to complete detailed interviews and questionnaires every 2&#xD;
      years and health assessments every 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this research is to examine the impact of differing invitation letters&#xD;
      offered to participants on study recruitment rates.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recruiting, retaining and gathering complete data on participants in research projects, be&#xD;
      they patients or health professionals, can be extremely difficult. These problems increase&#xD;
      the risk that research will be abandoned before its true value is appreciated, or lead to&#xD;
      delays in resolving uncertainty for decision makers, while further studies are done. Poor&#xD;
      recruitment, retention and outcome collection frequently lead to many prospective studies&#xD;
      being extended, increasing costs. Researchers need to use strategies that are themselves&#xD;
      evidence-based. This study links with an existing longitudinal ageing study called NICOLA to&#xD;
      provide evidence on what research participants prefer in relation to providing personal&#xD;
      information through a self-completed questionnaire. NICOLA is a large study of people over&#xD;
      the age of 50 that is being conducted in Northern Ireland. NICOLA is aiming to recruit 8500&#xD;
      people and will ask them questions about participation in social activities, including&#xD;
      organised structured and informal activities; relationship quality; loneliness; stress;&#xD;
      resilience; quality of life; alcohol intake; food poverty and assess their health and&#xD;
      wellbeing. Participants in NICOLA agree to having an interviewer visit them at home to ask&#xD;
      questions about their lives, complete questionnaires in their own time and attend a health&#xD;
      assessment appointment. They also agree to being followed up over a course of at least 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research described here will examine the impact of differing invitation letters offered&#xD;
      to participants on study recruitment rates, with the following specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding if the gender of the person signing the invitation letter has an effect on&#xD;
           recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploring the potential impact of the use of describing the research as a 'study' or as&#xD;
           a 'project'&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understanding if discussing and guaranteeing confidentiality for the participants in the&#xD;
           invitation letter has an impact on recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will do this by randomly allocating each of the 13000 participants contacted by NICOLA to&#xD;
      receive invitation letter by one of the following three choices using a 3x2x2 factorial&#xD;
      design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gender of the signatory (male versus female versus neutral team signature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of NICOLA (study versus project)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Guarantee of confidentiality (inserted versus removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will then analyse the numbers of participants agreeing to join NICOLA and use this to&#xD;
      determine which invitation letter is the most acceptable to the participants. This research&#xD;
      will occur within the first 18 months of NICOLA, when all participants are being recruited.&#xD;

    <description>There are 12 versions of the invitation letter. Three aspects of the letter will be adapted: (1) Gender of the signatory i.e. male, female or gender neutral (signed from the NICOLA team) (2) Description of NICOLA as a 'study' or 'project' and (3) Inserting a sentence guaranteeing the participants confidentially or not having this in the letter (but will still appear in the Patient Information Sheet). The twelve versions are as follows:&#xD;
Male &amp; Study &amp; Confidentiality&#xD;
Male &amp; Study&#xD;
