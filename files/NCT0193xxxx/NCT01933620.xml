      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The intestines, mouth, and skin all contain billions of bacteria and some fungi. Every&#xD;
      person s body contains microorganisms like these. They normally do not make people sick.&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in how these microorganisms change when a person is hospitalized.&#xD;
      They want to find out if changes take place because of the hospitalization (such as&#xD;
      treatments used or changes in medical condition) or because of a person s biology (such as&#xD;
      their immune system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand which microorganisms are most likely to spread through hospitals and what&#xD;
      affects that spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People over 2 years of age who are going to be inpatients at the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Clinical Center (NIHCC) for at least 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Clinicians will take samples from participants up to once a day for as long as they are&#xD;
      hospitalized at NIHCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Blood will be taken from a needle in the arm. This will be done only once, unless the&#xD;
      participant gets a certain infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swabs will be taken with a cotton swab, from the rectal area, groin, throat, and armpit,&#xD;
           and possibly other areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may give a stool sample or be asked to spit into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinicians will collect some information from participants medical records. They may&#xD;
           request some samples of tissue that are left over from procedures already scheduled at&#xD;
           NIHCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After participants leave the NIHCC, samples may be taken when they return for follow-up&#xD;
           visits from their hospitalization, for up to 2 years. They will not have to return as a&#xD;
           follow-up for this study only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to explore changes to microbial communities during the course of&#xD;
      hospitalcare, and to determine the extent to which these alterations affect whether&#xD;
      hospitalized patients become colonized with healthcare-associated organisms. The study&#xD;
      enables collection of clinical specimens and associated medical data to evaluate the natural&#xD;
      history, epidemiology, and genomics of patients who might become colonized or infected with a&#xD;
      multidrug-resistant organism. Biological specimens including stool, sputum, and swabs will be&#xD;
      taken from Clinical Center inpatients at least 2 years of age as frequently as daily through&#xD;
      discharge, and at follow-up visits for up to 2 years from the date of enrollment. To&#xD;
      understand possible pathogen colonization and infection of hospitalized patients, this&#xD;
      protocol will assess the full complement of the microbial-host-environmental contributions&#xD;
      including: (1) microbial genome and community;(2) patient s genotype, underlying medical&#xD;
      condition, medical treatment; and (3) hospital practices and environment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Individuals must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be inpatients in the NIH CC with an expected hospitalization of at least 48 hours&#xD;
             beyond the date of referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 2 years of age or older&#xD;
