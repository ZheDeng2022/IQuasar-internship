    <textblock>
      Dry eye clinical research is limited to follow up of disease progression. While a large&#xD;
      catalogue of tests, such as corneal staining grading, tear break up time (TBUT) and&#xD;
      Schirmer's test, is available, objective assessments demonstrate poor to moderate&#xD;
      repeatability. Among these assessments, TBUT has the best repeatability while the Schirmer's&#xD;
      test shows good repeatability for more severe forms of the disease.1 As such, currently, most&#xD;
      research outcomes are based on subjective patient complaints rather than objective assessment&#xD;
      of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer (LipiView) is a HSA-approved imaging device that has&#xD;
      the ability to assess optical interference pattern produced by light reflected off the tear&#xD;
      film in a safe and non-invasive manner.2 Software analysis of the image then measures the&#xD;
      tear LLT, which is used to objectively quantify the diagnosis of lipid-deficient dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study aims to investigative the inter and intra-examiner reproducibility of&#xD;
      measuring tear lipid layer thickness (LLT) with LipiView, which is used in our current&#xD;
      clinical setting. LipiView has not been evaluated on its reproducibility of measuring tear&#xD;
      lipid layer thickness. The study will also assess for correlation between the magnitude of&#xD;
      tear LLT and the inter and intra-examiner reproducibility of LipiView.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this method is found to be repeatable, this can be used in future clinical settings and&#xD;
      trials as an additional tool to investigate dry eye treatments.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, SGCP and the applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye is a condition that affects 5-35% of the population.11 Common symptoms of this&#xD;
      condition include eye irritation, heaviness of the eyelids, visual disturbances, tearing and&#xD;
      light sensitivity.12 This significantly impacts the quality of life and vision of dry eye&#xD;
      patients. In addition, there is a significant socioeconomic burden. In 2009, 54,051 patients&#xD;
      sought treatment for dry eye in the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC). In total, the costs&#xD;
      for dry eye medication amounted to $181,354.17.14 Additionally, dry eye affects work&#xD;
      productivity which further adds on to the socioeconomic burden.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the diagnosis and assessment of dry eye is hindered by tests that have poor&#xD;
      repeatability, some of which cause discomfort due to their invasiveness. As a result most&#xD;
      clinical studies involving dry eye treatment rely on symptomatic improvements as a primary&#xD;
      outcome measure. However, symptomatic improvements are a poor measure in determining&#xD;
      treatment effectiveness because with disease progression, the eye becomes desensitized from&#xD;
      nerve damage. Also, it is common for patients to feel a reduction of discomfort of the eye&#xD;
      before objective improvements can be noted by the clinician. An assessment based on symptoms&#xD;
      alone is therefore inappropriate.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last few years, SNEC/SERI has built up a dedicated team of dry eye researchers for&#xD;
      trials and evaluation of diagnostic devices. There is an increasing interest internationally,&#xD;
      especially from industry, to partner us for testing of commercial products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer is a HSA-approved imaging device that allows&#xD;
      clinicians evaluate the characteristics and thickness of the tear lipid layer thickness (LLT)&#xD;
      in a safe and non-invasive manner. The device utilizes white light from a LED source that is&#xD;
      directed at the tear film over the inferior corneal region. Reflected light is captured by a&#xD;
      high resolution camera and the optical inference pattern is evaluated by software to&#xD;
      determine the LLT. 2 It also was found to correlate with other dry eye diagnostic tests, such&#xD;
      as tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer's test and corneal staining 3,4,5,6. LLT is also&#xD;
      reported to better correlate with symptoms than other objective dry eye tests. 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      While several studies have investigated and shown the association between dry eye syndrome&#xD;
      and low LLT 2,7,8,9, it is not known if LipiView would be able to make reproducible&#xD;
      measurements of LLT for the objective diagnosis of dry eye syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical importance Should this modality of imaging be shown to be repeatable, it can be&#xD;
      incorporated into current protocol/workflow for assessment and monitoring of dry eye and&#xD;
      treatment progress in our centre, as well as enhancing our capability to perform clinical&#xD;
      trials and increase our international reputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Purpose The primary purpose is to evaluate intra-examiner repeatability&#xD;
      of the LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer (LipiView) for imaging tear lipid layer&#xD;
      thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeatability is an important issue in the objective assessment of dry eye. There is lack of&#xD;
      studies that investigate LipiView for assessment of the tear film lipid layer thickness in&#xD;
      dry eyes. LipiView is potentially useful as a non-invasive procedure for objective&#xD;
      measurements of dry eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and target sample size 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
      During recruitment, a simple questionnaire is given to confirm for the absence of any dry eye&#xD;
      symptoms. Each volunteer will also be given a study serial number to ensure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 20 volunteers will participate in the LipiView repeatability and inter-rater agreement&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit schedules One visit is required for participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of Dry Eye Symptoms Participants will be asked to score and fill up a dry eye&#xD;
           questionnaire that assesses the symptomatic severity of dry eyes in the participant and&#xD;
           the extent of its disruption to daily activities. Basic biodata such as age, race,&#xD;
           gender will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Tear Lipid Layer Thickness Measurement During the&#xD;
           measurement of each eye, the participants place their chins on a chin rest and look at a&#xD;
           single white light source for 30 seconds. During this period, participants are&#xD;
           encouraged to blink freely at a comfortable rate which the assessor measures the LLT.&#xD;
           Afterwards, the aforementioned steps will be repeated for the same eye by another&#xD;
           assessor after a 5 minutes interval. Assessor 1 will perform the measurement at time 0&#xD;
           min, 10min and 20min while Assessor 2 will perform the measurement at time 5 min, 15&#xD;
           min, 25min.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Similar steps would be taken for the other eye. Therefore, 12 measurements would be&#xD;
           taken altogether per participant. Between measurements, participants are advised not to&#xD;
           rub or touch their eyes, or instill any eye drops or ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of fluorescein tear break up time and corneal staining will be conducted only&#xD;
           after LipiView LLT measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluorescein Dye Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) Fluorescein dye is introduced onto the lower&#xD;
           eyelid by a wetted fluorescein strip. The tear film will then be observed with blue&#xD;
           light using a slit lamp to the point where it breaks. The time from the previous blink&#xD;
           to the breaking of the tear film will be recorded to the nearest second.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Fluorescein Dye Corneal Staining After fluorescein dye is introduced, the cornea will be&#xD;
           examined for green stains indicating epithelial erosion, a sign of damage due to&#xD;
           dryness. The number of green stains and their location on the cornea (superior, central,&#xD;
           inferior, temporal, nasal fields) will be recorded.&#xD;
