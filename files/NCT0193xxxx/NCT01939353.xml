  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2 exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EB-1020 SR&#xD;
      (centanafadine sustained release [CTN SR]) in treating participants who met Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on the Mini International&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus, Version 6.0 (M.I.N.I.-Plus). Evaluations included&#xD;
      determining an effectiveness signal for ADHD and related symptoms and exploring dosing,&#xD;
      tolerability, onset of action, and duration of effect. Dose-response/tolerability&#xD;
      relationships with CTN SR were also explored. The 1-week placebo run-in [single-blind (SB)]&#xD;
      was also used for informal safety comparison purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, flexible-dosage, single-blind exploratory study of CTN SR in adult male&#xD;
      participants with ADHD consisted of a 1-week placebo run-in (SB), 4 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      CTN SR, and 2 weeks of follow-up. At the placebo run-in, participants must have had a score&#xD;
      of greater than or equal to 28 on the Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating&#xD;
      Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) to be eligible to continue participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of single-blind placebo run-in treatment (that is, beginning of CTN SR treatment),&#xD;
      the ADHD-RS-IV with adult prompts was re-administered. Participants who showed an improvement&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 30% over baseline values or who had a score of less than 28 on the&#xD;
      ADHD-RS-IV were withdrawn from the study prior to receiving any active drug. Those who showed&#xD;
      less than 30% improvement from the placebo run-in to the beginning of CTN SR treatment&#xD;
      continued the study. The consent form was phrased such that participants were not informed of&#xD;
      the exact timing of CTN SR versus placebo treatment in order to maintain the blinded nature&#xD;
      of the placebo treatment and reduce potential placebo effects. Dosing was flexible, with a&#xD;
      target maximum dosage of 500 milligrams (mg) daily in divided doses (morning and afternoon,&#xD;
      approximately 5 hours later) to be achieved if possible during Week 2 of CTN SR treatment.&#xD;
      The participants took a starting dose of 100 mg of CTN SR daily; the dose was titrated in 100&#xD;
      mg increments up to the maximum dosage of 500 mg daily. The treating physician escalated the&#xD;
      dose to the maximum dose if participants had not achieved remission of ADHD in his/her&#xD;
      judgment, and CTN SR was still well tolerated. If in the physician's judgment the participant&#xD;
      could not tolerate further dose escalation, or was not tolerating the current dose well, the&#xD;
      dose was maintained or reduced, with the goal of re-assessing dose and response at the&#xD;
      subsequent visit for a possible increase in dose, until study completion.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline-2 in the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-2, Weeks 1, 4, and 6 (Follow-up Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS is a brief method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events, and provides a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide. Severity of suicidal ideation is rated on a 6-point scale from 0=no ideation present to 5=active ideation with plan and intent. Suicidal behavior was collected as presence/absence of actual attempts, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempts, aborted attempts, preparatory acts or behavior, and any suicidal behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline-2 on the Profile of Mood States, Second Edition, Short Version 2A (POMS 2-A Short) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>POMS 2-A Short version consists of a subset of 35 items from the full-length version of 72 mood adjectives assessing 7 mood domains namely, anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, tension-anxiety, vigor-activity, and friendliness. High scores indicate better vigor-activity and friendliness, but more severe symptoms for the five other domains. In addition, the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score is calculated from anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, tension-anxiety, and vigor-activity. Participants rated each of the 35 items using 4-point Likert-type scale (0=much unlike this; 3=much like this). Items from each domain are summed T-score such that total scores were in the negative-mood direction (i.e., higher scores indicate greater experience of negative moods). Total scores range from 0 to 100. TMD is calculated based on a standard value (mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline-2 on the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>WRAADDS is used to measure the severity of symptoms in adults with ADHD. This structured interview consists of 28 items in 7 psychopathologic domains, which were rated by a clinical expert on a 0 to 2-point Likert scale. The psychopathologic 7 domains are inattention, hyperactivity, affective lability, hot temper, stress intolerance, disorganization, and impulsivity. The scale rated individual items from 0 to 2 (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=clearly present) and summarized each of the 7 categories on a 0-to-4 scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). The WRAADDS total score is defined as sum of all 28 item sub scores (range 0 to 56), higher scores indicate worsening of symptoms. Baseline-2 is defined as an end of 1-week SB placebo run-in and beginning of treatment with CTN SR. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Change from Baseline-2 for the WRAADDS scale is calculated using total scores.</description>

    <description>The WFIRS-S is a validated rating scale used to capture functional difficulties in the lives of individuals with ADHD. It investigates emotional or behavioral problems and is comprised of 69 items grouped into six domains: family (8 items), work (11 items), school (10 items, includes learning [4 items] and behavior [6 items]), life skills (12 items), self-concept (5 items), social (9 items), and risky (14 items). It uses a 4-point Likert scale where 0=never or not at all, 1=sometimes or somewhat, 2=often or much, and 3=very often or very much. Any item rating of 2 or 3 was considered in the clinically impaired range. A total score was derived by summing all scores from every domain, ranging from 0 to 207 with higher scores=greater ADHD-related functional impairment.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 3 investigative sites in the United States from 03 October 2013 to 20 February 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 45 male participants diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were enrolled at Baseline-1 in a 1-week single-blind (SB) placebo run-in treatment to receive placebo from Baseline-1 to Baseline-2. At Baseline-2, remaining 41 out of 45 participants who had &lt;30% improvement and ≥28 total score on Adult ADHD-RS-IV scale score received centanafadine (CTN) sustained release (SR) 100-500 mg, tablets from Week 1 to Week 4.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline-2 to Week 4 on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Adult Version (BRIEF-A) Scale</title>
        <description>BRIEF-A is a standardized self-administered scale that captures an adult's executive functions or self-regulation in their everyday environment, composed of 75 items within 9 nonoverlapping derived clinical scales and measures various aspects of executive functioning, including the following: inhibit, self-monitor shift, emotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organize, monitor, and organization of materials. Items are rated 1=never, 2=sometimes, and 3=often; total raw scale score ranges from 75-225, higher total scores=more problems with executive functioning. Raw scale scores are used to generate T-scores. Total T-scores range from 30 to 90, with broader composite indexes including Behavioral Regulation Index(BRI) and Metacognition Index(Ml). These indexes form overall summary score, the Global Executive Composite(GEC). Baseline-2 is defined as an end of 1-week SB placebo run-in and beginning of treatment with CTN SR. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>CGI-S is an observer-rated scale that is used to assess the severity of the participants condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7, where 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=among the most extremely ill. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days with a minimum score of 1 and maximum score of 7. Baseline-2 is defined as an end of 1-week SB placebo run-in and beginning of treatment with CTN SR. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline-2 in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) [ADHD Version] Scale Score</title>
          <description>CGI-S is an observer-rated scale that is used to assess the severity of the participants condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7, where 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=among the most extremely ill. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days with a minimum score of 1 and maximum score of 7. Baseline-2 is defined as an end of 1-week SB placebo run-in and beginning of treatment with CTN SR. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>Per-protocol Population included all participants who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and completed the trial (4 weeks of drug treatment with evaluable data after Week 4) without major protocol violations. Number analyzed is the number of participants with data available for analysis at the given timepoint.</population>

        <description>C-SSRS is a brief method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events, and provides a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide. Severity of suicidal ideation is rated on a 6-point scale from 0=no ideation present to 5=active ideation with plan and intent. Suicidal behavior was collected as presence/absence of actual attempts, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, interrupted attempts, aborted attempts, preparatory acts or behavior, and any suicidal behavior.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline-2 on the Profile of Mood States, Second Edition, Short Version 2A (POMS 2-A Short) at Week 4</title>
        <description>POMS 2-A Short version consists of a subset of 35 items from the full-length version of 72 mood adjectives assessing 7 mood domains namely, anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, tension-anxiety, vigor-activity, and friendliness. High scores indicate better vigor-activity and friendliness, but more severe symptoms for the five other domains. In addition, the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score is calculated from anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection, fatigue-inertia, tension-anxiety, and vigor-activity. Participants rated each of the 35 items using 4-point Likert-type scale (0=much unlike this; 3=much like this). Items from each domain are summed T-score such that total scores were in the negative-mood direction (i.e., higher scores indicate greater experience of negative moods). Total scores range from 0 to 100. TMD is calculated based on a standard value (mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline-2 on the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>WRAADDS is used to measure the severity of symptoms in adults with ADHD. This structured interview consists of 28 items in 7 psychopathologic domains, which were rated by a clinical expert on a 0 to 2-point Likert scale. The psychopathologic 7 domains are inattention, hyperactivity, affective lability, hot temper, stress intolerance, disorganization, and impulsivity. The scale rated individual items from 0 to 2 (0=not present, 1=mild, 2=clearly present) and summarized each of the 7 categories on a 0-to-4 scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). The WRAADDS total score is defined as sum of all 28 item sub scores (range 0 to 56), higher scores indicate worsening of symptoms. Baseline-2 is defined as an end of 1-week SB placebo run-in and beginning of treatment with CTN SR. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. Change from Baseline-2 for the WRAADDS scale is calculated using total scores.</description>

        <population>Per-protocol Population included all participants who met inclusion/exclusion criteria and completed the trial (4 weeks of drug treatment with evaluable data after Week 4) without major protocol violations.</population>

        <description>The WFIRS-S is a validated rating scale used to capture functional difficulties in the lives of individuals with ADHD. It investigates emotional or behavioral problems and is comprised of 69 items grouped into six domains: family (8 items), work (11 items), school (10 items, includes learning [4 items] and behavior [6 items]), life skills (12 items), self-concept (5 items), social (9 items), and risky (14 items). It uses a 4-point Likert scale where 0=never or not at all, 1=sometimes or somewhat, 2=often or much, and 3=very often or very much. Any item rating of 2 or 3 was considered in the clinically impaired range. A total score was derived by summing all scores from every domain, ranging from 0 to 207 with higher scores=greater ADHD-related functional impairment.</description>
