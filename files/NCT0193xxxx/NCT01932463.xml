      A feasibility Study to Evaluate Safety and Initial Effectiveness of ExAblate Transcranial MR&#xD;
      Guided Focused Ultrasound for Unilateral Thalamotomy in the Treatment of Tremor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound has been coupled with high resolution MRI&#xD;
      to provide precise, consistent treatments that can be monitored in real-time. The development&#xD;
      of phased array transducers allows for tightly focused treatment volumes and for the ability&#xD;
      to compensate for distortions by tissue inhomogeneities. The landmark advance in MRgFUS for&#xD;
      neurosurgeons occurred as the ability to sonicate through the intact cranium was achieved&#xD;
      with phased array transducers and acoustic modeling using CT reconstructions of the skull. By&#xD;
      coupling HIFU with MRI, detailed treatment plans can be generated and intra-procedure&#xD;
      real-time monitoring is available. Standard MR sequences have been shown to reliably predict&#xD;
      tissue damage during thermal lesioning with ultrasound. The precision of the technology has&#xD;
      already been demonstrated in animal models and is currently being investigated in humans with&#xD;
      brain tumors and neuropathic pain syndromes. Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery, the treatment&#xD;
      can be monitored continuously in real time with MRI and MR-thermography. We anticipate that a&#xD;
      MRgFUS non-invasive thermal lesioning is similarly as safe as DBS (or other current procedure&#xD;
      and will provide several years of benefit through reduction of contralateral motor symptoms&#xD;
      and potential medication side effects in ET, while still permitting subsequent treatment with&#xD;
      DBS should that become clinically desirable.&#xD;
