    <textblock>
      This study will advance several goals of the NIH Action Plan: 1) establish a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team to develop quantitative methodologies and imaging protocols for liver,&#xD;
      2) validate diagnostic criteria and methodologies for imaging in liver in both a&#xD;
      cross-sectional and a longitudinal dietary intervention study of patients with NAFLD, 3)&#xD;
      create a liver tissue bank with correlative imaging data, 4) develop reliable non-invasive MR&#xD;
      markers to distinguish simple steatosis from NASH, and 5) define the dynamic changes in&#xD;
      metabolism, energy homeostasis, and MR biomarkers as they relate to fructose-related liver&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Like obesity, NAFLD and NASH are closely linked to nutrition and the &quot;Western diet&quot; which is&#xD;
      rich in saturated fats and refined sugars. Although fat consumption has remained relatively&#xD;
      stable, the marked increase in dietary fructose consumption (more than doubling in the past&#xD;
      30 years alone) supports the role of fructose in NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome. Although&#xD;
      the mechanism(s) for fructose-related liver injury is not yet well defined, fructose-related&#xD;
      hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion may contribute to liver injury. Observations&#xD;
      in animals suggest that fructose induces metabolic syndrome and NAFLD independent of energy&#xD;
      intake. One key difference in fructose metabolism (as opposed to glucose) relates to ATP&#xD;
      depletion and the necessity of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase to replenish ATP stores.&#xD;
      As opposed to glucose, initial fructose metabolism involves phosphorylation of fructose to&#xD;
      fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase (ketohexokinase, KHK) using the substrate ATP. Unlike&#xD;
      glucokinase, the phosphorylation of fructose by KHK is specific for fructose and not rate&#xD;
      limited. Replenishment of ATP stores requires phosphorylation of AMP back to ATP via AMP&#xD;
      kinase (which is inhibited in insulin resistance (common in patients with NAFLD) or&#xD;
      conversion to uric acid via xanthine dehydrogenase resulting in hyperuricemia. The high&#xD;
      activity of KHK in phosphorylating fructose to fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, could&#xD;
      result in hepatic ATP depletion with habitual fructose consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published animal and human studies support our hypothesis that fructose is a risk factor for&#xD;
      NAFLD and NAFLD-related liver disease progression. In animal models, diets high in fructose&#xD;
      induce features of the metabolic syndrome including weight gain, insulin resistance,&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. Similar effects are not observed with the&#xD;
      administration of other simple sugars such as glucose. Fructose (or sucrose) administration&#xD;
      to humans also causes features of metabolic syndrome which are quite typical of patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD. Fructose is lipogenic, stimulates triglyceride synthesis and causes hepatic steatosis.&#xD;
      As previously reported in animals, our group reported that increased fructose consumption&#xD;
      (assessed as fructose-containing beverages only) is a risk factor of metabolic syndrome and&#xD;
      biopsy-proven NAFLD and that patients with NAFLD consume 3-4 times more fructose than age,&#xD;
      gender, and mass index (BMI) matched controls without liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to increased fructose consumption being a risk factor for NAFLD, fructose has&#xD;
      been implicated in NAFLD disease progression. The administration of a diet with 25% of total&#xD;
      energy as sucrose (which contains 50% fructose) resulted in a rise in liver aminotransferase&#xD;
      levels within 18 days. This study, performed nearly 25 years ago, is all the more alarming as&#xD;
      current sugar intake of Americans is in this same range. In our study of 427 patients with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven NAFLD, increased consumption of fructose-containing beverages was univariately&#xD;
      associated with decreased age (P &lt; 0.0001), male sex (P &lt; 0.0001), hypertriglyceridemia (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.04), low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (&lt;0.0001), decreased serum glucose (P &lt;&#xD;
      0.001), increased calorie intake (P &lt; 0.0001), and hyperuricemia (P &lt; 0.0001). After&#xD;
      controlling for age, sex, BMI, and total calorie intake, daily fructose consumption was&#xD;
      associated with lower steatosis grade and higher fibrosis stage (P &lt; 0.05 for each). Being&#xD;
      that triglyceride synthesis requires ATP, we hypothesize that lower hepatic steatosis may&#xD;
      reflect deceased ATP availability. Additionally, in older adults (age â‰¥ 48 years), daily&#xD;
      fructose consumption was associated with increased hepatic inflammation (P &lt; 0.05), and&#xD;
      hepatocyte ballooning (P&lt; 0.05). However, the mechanism(s) by which fructose causes liver&#xD;
      injury remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In support of our hypothesis that ATP depletion underlies liver injury in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD, our group has demonstrated that patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD have increased&#xD;
      hepatic mRNA expression of KHK compared to matched controls. Indeed, in human pilot studies,&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) fructose administration is associated with hepatic ATP depletion which can&#xD;
      be assessed by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Reduced hepatic ATP stores are more&#xD;
      prevalent in overweight and obese subjects than in lean subjects. Furthermore, recovery from&#xD;
      fructose-induced ATP depletion was found to be delayed in patients with NAFLD (n=8). However,&#xD;
      a limitation to this existing work is the small sample size and the inability to assess a&#xD;
      cause-effect relationship(s) between BMI, NAFLD, energy homeostasis, and histologic features&#xD;
      of liver injury. In liver cells, ATP depletion could perpetuate chronic liver injury by&#xD;
      making fatty hepatocytes less proliferative. Hepatic ATP depletion also encourages the&#xD;
      expansion of liver progenitor populations, causes arrest in protein synthesis, induces&#xD;
      inflammatory and prooxidative changes, increases endoplasmic reticulum stress, promotes&#xD;
      activation of stress-related kinases, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and increases&#xD;
      apoptotic activity. This supporting data suggests that fructose may be associated with NAFLD,&#xD;
      NASH, and progressive fibrosis. Further, a study by Loguercio et al. demonstrated that&#xD;
      increased uric acid levels above the basal level after IV fructose infusion was significantly&#xD;
      higher (p &lt; 0.01) in patients with cirrhosis (3 mg/dl) and NASH (1.9 mg/dl) than in healthy&#xD;
      controls (1.2 mg/dl). This effect was completely reversed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate which&#xD;
      could replenish the ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP. Therefore, an IV fructose challenge&#xD;
      could effectively differentiate healthy subjects, from chronic hepatitis, from cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD lacks accurate and robust non-invasive biomarkers to grade and stage histologic disease&#xD;
      activity. This is a critical barrier to understanding the influence of this important&#xD;
      environmental risk factor (increased/habitual fructose consumption) on the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      progression of NAFLD. Currently, reliable assessment NAFLD requires liver biopsy and&#xD;
      interpretation of histology. Serum aminotransferase levels and conventional imaging methods&#xD;
      can detect liver fat but cannot grade or stage NAFLD. Furthermore, current developments in&#xD;
      biomarker are cross-sectional in nature and do not characterize the dynamic changes which&#xD;
      underlie liver injury in patients with NAFLD. In vivo 31P MRS permits the evaluation of&#xD;
      dynamic changes of individual phosphorus-containing metabolites in the liver parenchyma, such&#xD;
      as phosphomonoester (PME), ATP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). Intravenous fructose load&#xD;
      alters phosphorus metabolites and allows assessment of liver function by 31P MRS. Other&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated that fructose loading could be used effectively as a tool to&#xD;
      investigate change in metabolic steps of hepatic metabolism in humans with alcohol-related&#xD;
      liver disease. Further, IV fructose loading causes significantly higher ATP degradation and&#xD;
      uric acid production in cirrhotic patients than in healthy controls. The associations between&#xD;
      fructose, increased uric acid, and hepatic ATP depletion has been previously described.&#xD;
      Increased uric acid is an independent risk factor for NAFLD and in keeping with our&#xD;
      hypothesis, hyperuricemia may be a surrogate marker of impaired hepatic energy homeostasis in&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD. The proposed mechanism for fructose-related hepatic ATP depletion,&#xD;
      NAFLD, NASH and the associated hyperuricemia is depicted in Figure 1 is novel, innovative,&#xD;
      scientifically rigorous and address an important public health concern-the impact of fructose&#xD;
      on the rising epidemic of NAFLD.&#xD;
