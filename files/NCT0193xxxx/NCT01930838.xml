      The number of obese is increasing rapidly. Bariatric surgery is used to a greater and greater&#xD;
      extent as treatment of obesity to obtain a greater and more permanent weight loss. The&#xD;
      currently most commonly used surgical method is the gastric bypass (RYGB), which so far has&#xD;
      proved to be the most effective way to achieve a greater and more permanent weight loss,&#xD;
      reduction and maybe even elimination of many of the obesity-related health complication&#xD;
      (diabetes, sleep apnea, pain due to osteoarthrosis etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery, including RYGB is also associated with medical and nutritional&#xD;
      complications. This will be a natural consequence of the fact that the food bypasses&#xD;
      virtually the entire ventricle and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the small intestine after&#xD;
      a RYGB. Therefore, problems with uptake of for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin,&#xD;
      fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E and K) copper, zinc and selenium are expected. In the&#xD;
      light of this, it is decided that all RYGB operated patients must take vitamin B12, iron and&#xD;
      vitamin D substitution. In spite of this, many develop various nutritional problems after&#xD;
      RYGB. In addition to these nutritional complications are complications such as hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      and gallstone attacks after RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless there is no comprehensive inventory of the occurrence of nutritional&#xD;
      complications after bariatric surgery neither in Denmark nor in an international context.&#xD;
      Thus there is no consensus on an optimal postoperative prevention of complications. An&#xD;
      overview of the occurrence of these problems will be important for assessing and determine&#xD;
      the indications for bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enlighten this the investigators will conduct a clinical trial concerning complications&#xD;
      after RYGB. The investigators will examine 350 RYGB operated patients the Central Denmark&#xD;
      Region. From a medical interview, blood tests, Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry etc. it will&#xD;
      be possible to give a good estimate of the incidence of medical complications. The&#xD;
      investigators will explore complications such as: anemia, hypoglycemia, peripheral nerve&#xD;
      problems (especially neuropathies), vitamin D / osteoporosis and other mineral / vitamin&#xD;
      deficiencies that may be identified through blood tests. A control group of 30-40 age, sex&#xD;
      and body mass index matched individuals will go through the same examinations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing both in Denmark and in most&#xD;
      other countries, and as conventional treatment of obesity with lifestyle changes (hypocaloric&#xD;
      diet, physical activity and behavior modification) rarely leads to large and sustained weight&#xD;
      loss, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery has taken over more and more of the&#xD;
      treatment of the most severe cases of obesity. Weight losses are greater than with other&#xD;
      treatments, and importantly the relatively large weight loss is permanent. The currently most&#xD;
      commonly used surgical method is the gastric bypass (RYGB), which has proven to be a highly&#xD;
      effective method of achieving a great and permanent weight loss with an approximately 30-40%&#xD;
      reduction in the weight, which is equivalent to 40-60% reduction of the overweight. Moreover&#xD;
      RYGB has shown to provide complete remission of prior type 2 diabetes in up to 80% of cases&#xD;
      at short observation time (up to 2 years after surgery) and about 50% remission at longer&#xD;
      time follow-up (&gt; 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover data suggest that after GRYGB there is a reduced consumption of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs in 51 % an of lipid-lowering drugs in 59 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International studies have shown that mortality of bariatric surgery ranges between 0.24 and&#xD;
      2.77% depending on the operator and the hospital, and perioperative morbidity ranges between&#xD;
      6.92 and 8.85% also depending on the operator and the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are conflicting results in the literature when examining the consumption of&#xD;
      antidepressants. Some studies find a reduced consumption of antidepressants after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery within the first two years, others show that consumption is almost unchanged overall&#xD;
      and cohort follow-up studies show an increased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is an increased incidence of suicide after bariatric surgery, which&#xD;
      argues against an unambiguous improvement in psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery including RYGB is also connected with some medical and nutritional effects&#xD;
      or complications. This is not surprising since RYGB &quot;bypasses&quot; virtually the entire ventricle&#xD;
      and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the small intestine, so problems with the inclusion of,&#xD;
      for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin, fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E and K) copper,&#xD;
      zinc and selenium are expected. Therefore, it is recommended that all RYGB operated patients&#xD;
      substitute vitamin B12, iron and vitamin D. Despite this many develop various nutritional&#xD;
      problems after RYGB, which is sparsely registered in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications are often developed long time after the operation, at a time when the&#xD;
      patients are no longer followed in specialized departments which report all complications to&#xD;
      the Danish Obesity Register, in the same way as surgical complications are reported. There is&#xD;
      no international consensus on postoperative vitamin substitution, which may be due to the&#xD;
      previous lack of evidence of nutritional complications. This can in the long term result in&#xD;
      irreversible neurological damage, osteoporosis and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other classic side effects are early and late dumping, manifested by weakness after a meal or&#xD;
      symptoms of moderate degrees of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Frequent bowel movements are&#xD;
      an expected result of a RYGB, but for some patients as much that they are hampered in their&#xD;
      daily activities. Moreover complications such as abdominal pain of varying degree and the&#xD;
      development of gallstones are frequently seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still unresolved how extensive a problem these nutritional complications after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in Denmark are, we want to clarify the occurrence of these complications in&#xD;
      Denmark. This will provide an overview of the positive as well as the negative impact of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and thus will be decisive to assess and determine the indications for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will in this project make a clinical trial by a randomly selected group of&#xD;
      approximately 350 persons in the period 2006-2011, have had RYGB in the Central Region of&#xD;
      Denmark. From a medical interview, blood tests, etc. the investigators will be able to give a&#xD;
      good estimate of the incidence of medical complications. The investigators will explore&#xD;
      complications such as: anemia, hypoglycemia, peripheral nerve problems (especially&#xD;
      neuropathies), vitamin D / osteoporosis and other mineral / vitamin deficiencies that may be&#xD;
      identified through blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators wish to achieve a better documentation of both the positive effects&#xD;
      after GYP (weight loss, remission of diabetes, quality of life, etc.) and the negative health&#xD;
      effects (mortality, surgical and nutritional) in order to provide a better founded approach&#xD;
      to this form of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Of the patients who responded to the questionnaire in the second part of the project&#xD;
      450 will be selected randomly to participate in the clinical trial, which will consist of a&#xD;
      thorough medical interview and physical examination including neurological examination&#xD;
      performed by a physician. On suspicion of neurological complications a neurological&#xD;
      examination will performed of a neurological specialist. This part will be conducted in&#xD;
      cooperation with the Neurology Department, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be taken blood samples of the participants including potassium, sodium,&#xD;
      creatinine, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, albumin, calcium, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH,&#xD;
      β-carotene, vitamin A (retinol), vitamin K (phytomenadione), pp, copper, zinc and selenium,&#xD;
      iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, leukocytes, liver count, and blood and urine investigation of&#xD;
      bone turnover. In addition, patients will be DXA scanned for assessment of bone mineral&#xD;
      content and composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get an appropriate control group, an age / gender / BMI matched control group will also be&#xD;
      established of people who have not been RYGB operated, and this control group of 30-40 people&#xD;
      will undergo exactly the same examinations as the RYGB group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and power calculation In the clinical trial we will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 350 patients. Due to practical and financial constraints, this will be the&#xD;
      maximum number of participants it is possible to examine since all will undergo a thorough&#xD;
      individual examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of participants In our study the investigators will invite 350 patients who have&#xD;
      undergone gastric bypass gastric bypass surgery patients in the Central Denmark Region to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition a healthy control group consisting of 30 to 40 age-, gender-and BMI-matched&#xD;
      individuals who have not undergone RYGB will be examined clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of the project will be carried out in cooperation with the Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Metabolism Department, Viborg Regional Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages The investigators will make a physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests and Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry which only in rare cases will create a risk&#xD;
      or cause side effects on the subjects. This little risk will largely be offset by the&#xD;
      valuable knowledge that will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respect for the subjects' physical and mental integrity The project is reported to the&#xD;
      region's joint notification to The Danish Data Protection Agency. We hereby declare that the&#xD;
      project is carried out in accordance with the protocol and applicable regulatory /&#xD;
      legislative. The study has been approved of The Regional Committee on Biomedical Research&#xD;
      Ethics in the Central Denmark Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Act on Processing of Personal Data will be respected. The study will also be reported to&#xD;
      The Clinical Trials and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results Both positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published and&#xD;
      sought to be published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals as original publications&#xD;
      and with the PhD student as first author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The investigators expect to identify positive and negative consequences for RYGB&#xD;
      and thus optimize the basis on which patients and physicians in the future will be able to&#xD;
      decide on surgery. This will also better prevention of complications and thus save patients&#xD;
      and communities of loss, economic as well as social and personal. The project will hopefully&#xD;
      form the basis for the continuation of longer follow-up studies. Moreover, the results set&#xD;
      the stage for the development of new more &quot;gentle&quot; obesity surgery.&#xD;
