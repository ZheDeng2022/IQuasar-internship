    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the blood profile of the N-methylnicotinamide&#xD;
      (MNA) following administration of TRIA-662 (N-methylnicotinamide Chloride). The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of TRIA-662 and to&#xD;
      assess any potential gender-related differences in the plasma profile of MNA. Changes in&#xD;
      serum lipid parameters with particular reference to triglycerides, lipoprotein lipase, and&#xD;
      blood pressure effects will also be noted.&#xD;

      A total of 20 subjects volunteers (10 male and 10 female) will receive the following&#xD;
      treatments administered in a randomized fashion with 2 embedded placebo dosages in each group&#xD;
      (8 active Males and 8 active females with 2 placebo males and females):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DRUG (Low Dose): Single therapeutic dose of MNA administered as a 90 mg oral dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DRUG (High Dose): Single therapeutic dose of MNA administered as a 270 mg oral dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PLACEBO: Placebo for MNA administered as an identically appearing oral dose Each&#xD;
           treatment period will consist of a 3-day two-night confinement cycle with admission on&#xD;
           day 1, treatment on day 1 with a single dose of active or placebo with discharge 24&#xD;
           hours following the last assessment the next morning. A washout period of 5 days will&#xD;
           separate each treatment period. Standard biochemical and clinical baseline medical&#xD;
           background and physical examination will occur at screening and at Day -1 to&#xD;
           assess/confirm entry criteria. During each treatment period, serial plasma samples&#xD;
           (n=12) for MNA assay will be collected on the treatment day. Safety assessments,&#xD;
           including vitals signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and oral body&#xD;
           temperature), will be performed at screening, at baseline, and at 4 times throughout&#xD;
           each treatment period. Physical examinations and standard clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
           (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) will be obtained at screening, and at&#xD;
           admission for each treatment period, and prior to subject's final discharge from the&#xD;
           study. The Lunch meals on the dosing day will be identical in each subject on each&#xD;
           occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic and safety assessments will be performed at specified times prior to and&#xD;
      after study MNA administration.&#xD;
