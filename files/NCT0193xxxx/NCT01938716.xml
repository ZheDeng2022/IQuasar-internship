  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if gemcitabine given during surgery can&#xD;
      enter pancreas cancer cells in patients who have already received chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is a drug used to treat pancreatic cancer. However, it has not previously been&#xD;
      studied if gemcitabine can enter pancreatic cancer cells. Gemcitabine is designed to block&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;

      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, your surgery will be performed in the same way as it&#xD;
      would be even if you were not taking part in this study. You will sign a separate consent&#xD;
      form for surgery. The length of the surgery and the time you are under anesthesia will not be&#xD;
      changed by taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, you will have routine procedures to learn if the disease has spread to other&#xD;
      areas. If the disease has spread beyond the pancreas, surgical removal will not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no signs of spread or other reasons the cancer cannot be removed, the surgeon&#xD;
      will begin the process of removing the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive gemcitabine by vein during surgery. Gemcitabine will be given through an&#xD;
      infusion catheter that is placed in your arm or chest in the operating room after you are&#xD;
      asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion catheter is a standard-of-care procedure for all participants who are having&#xD;
      this surgery. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for the infusion catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infusion will take either 50 or 75 minutes, depending upon when you joined the study. The&#xD;
      first 5 participants will receive gemcitabine over 50 minutes and the rest of the&#xD;
      participants will receive gemcitabine over 75 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and Tissue Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 8 blood samples (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn over 70-95 minutes for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) testing on the day of surgery. PK testing measures the levels of study&#xD;
      drug in your blood at different time points. The blood will also be used for biomarker&#xD;
      testing. Biomarkers are chemical markers found in the blood and tissue that may be related to&#xD;
      your reaction to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the tumor tissue and normal tissue removed during surgery will be collected to learn&#xD;
      if gemcitabine is able to enter the tissue cells and for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for any reason during the surgery the surgeon decides that removal of the pancreas is not&#xD;
      possible, you will not receive gemcitabine and your participation in this study will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your active participation in this study will be over once you have had surgery and completed&#xD;
      the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each day while you are in the hospital recovering from the surgery and then at&#xD;
      the time of a routine clinic visit or by phone call at least 1 time a week, for up to 30 days&#xD;
      after surgery, you will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Its use during surgery is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is required. Patients&#xD;
             with Islet cell tumors are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients do not have known metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have potentially resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer&#xD;
             and have agreed to undergo surgical resection at MD Anderson Cancer Center if&#xD;
             operable. They will have undergone staging (physical examination, chest x-ray,&#xD;
             contrast enhanced CT or MRI (if CT contraindicated) and/or angiogram) to determine&#xD;
             resectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients have completed radiation and chemotherapy with either fluoropyrimidines (5-FU&#xD;
             or capecitabine) or gemcitabine as a radiosensitizing agent as part of their&#xD;
             preoperative therapy. Previous systemic chemotherapy alone is not allowed.&#xD;
             Preoperative therapy will be completed at least 4 weeks prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. There will be no upper age restriction. Patients less than 18 years of age are&#xD;
             excluded from the protocol because adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is rarely seen in&#xD;
             the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate renal and bone marrow function: Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL; Absolute neutrophil&#xD;
             count &gt;= 1,500/uL; Platelets &gt;= 100,000/Ul; Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL; Creatinine&#xD;
             clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min (calculated by the Cockcroft -Gault equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate Hepatic function (endoscopic or percutaneous drainage as needed): Total&#xD;
             bilirubin &lt; = 3 X institutional upper limits of normal (ULN); AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;=&#xD;
             5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have no fever or evidence of infection or other coexisting medical&#xD;
             condition that would preclude administration of gemcitabine. Patients with&#xD;
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable angina and myocardial infarction&#xD;
             within 3 months will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient is not pregnant. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., women who are&#xD;
             pre-menopausal or not surgically sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods&#xD;
             (abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device)&#xD;
             and refrain from breast-feeding, as specified in the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Major cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidity that precludes use of general anesthesia&#xD;
             (NYHA [New York Heart Association] Class III and IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Identification of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients &lt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
