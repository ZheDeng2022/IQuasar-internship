      Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate which is not digested in the human small intestine.&#xD;
      Whole grains are a source of dietary fiber that are used to promote health; however, using&#xD;
      whole grains in commercial products results in a different taste and/or texture than the&#xD;
      usual products made from refined grains. Thus, other types of high-fiber ingredients have&#xD;
      been developed which can be incorporated into food products with less effect on their taste&#xD;
      and/or texture. An example of this is resistant starch, defined as starch which is not&#xD;
      digested in the human small intestine. The digestibility of starch is usually determined&#xD;
      in-vitro; however, there is evidence that such methods may overestimate the amount of&#xD;
      resistant starch by as much as 100%. The measurement of the amount of carbohydrate in the&#xD;
      ileal effluent, digestive waste, of subjects with an ileostomy is considered to be the best&#xD;
      in-vivo method of starch digestibility. The subjects collect ileal effluent during the day&#xD;
      during which time they consume a polysaccharide-free diet. There is evidence that resistant&#xD;
      starch consumed at breakfast is completely recovered in ileal effluent 8-10hr after&#xD;
      consumption. The purpose of this study will be to compare the carbohydrate content recovered&#xD;
      in ileal effluent of 10 subjects with a conventional ileostomy.&#xD;

      Dietary fiber consists mainly of carbohydrates which are not digested in the human small&#xD;
      intestine. A high intake of dietary fiber is associated with many health benefits including,&#xD;
      but not limited to, improved bowel function and reduced risk of weight gain, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and diabetes. Therefore, there is great interest in the food industry to produce&#xD;
      products enriched with dietary fiber to promote health. One way to achieve this is to use&#xD;
      more whole grains (wheat, rice, oats, barley) as ingredients in products such as breakfast&#xD;
      cereals, breads and food bars. However, the use of whole grains results in products which&#xD;
      have a different taste and/or texture than the usual products made from refined grains. Thus,&#xD;
      other types of high-fiber ingredients have been developed which can be incorporated into food&#xD;
      products with less effect on their taste and/or texture. Examples of such ingredients are&#xD;
      inulin (an oligosaccharide containing fructose) and resistant starch. Resistant starch,&#xD;
      defined as starch which is not digested in the human small intestine, is present in small&#xD;
      amounts (2-5% of total starch) in many normal foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starch is the most abundant energy containing nutrient in the human diet; it consists of 2&#xD;
      types of polysaccharides: amylose, is a linear polymer consisting of long chains of glucose&#xD;
      molecules joined by 1-4 linkages; and amylopectin, a highly branched polymer consisting of&#xD;
      long chains of glucose molecules joined by 1-4 linkages with numerous 1-6 linkage branch&#xD;
      points. Most (70-80%) of the starch in normal starchy foods (eg. cereals and potatoes) is&#xD;
      amylopectin. Amylopectin is highly digestible because its branched structure makes it readily&#xD;
      able to gelatinize, the process whereby adjacent starch molecules swell and separate from&#xD;
      each other under the influence of moist heat (ie. cooking). By contrast amylose is less&#xD;
      digestible because its linear structure allows adjacent molecules to associate by hydrogen&#xD;
      bonding which reduces their ability to gelatinize. Some types of commercially available&#xD;
      resistant starch come from strains of corn which produce starch containing 70 to 100%&#xD;
      amylose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digestibility of starch is usually determined in-vitro using methods involving digestion&#xD;
      of the starch with α-amylase under pH and temperature conditions thought to mimick digestion&#xD;
      in the human small intestine. However, there is evidence that such methods may overestimate&#xD;
      the amount of resistant starch by as much as 100%. Methods used to estimate starch&#xD;
      digestibility in-vivo include the breath hydrogen method and the measurement of the amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrate in the ileal effluent of subjects with an ileostomy. The latter is considered to&#xD;
      be the best in-vivo method which involves preparation of subjects with a polysaccharide-free&#xD;
      diet the day before then consumption of the test carbohydrate with breakfast. Subjects&#xD;
      collect ileal effluent during the day during which time they consume a polysaccharide-free&#xD;
      diet. There is evidence that resistant starch consumed at breakfast is completely recovered&#xD;
      in ileal effluent 8-10hr after consumption. The objective of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      amount of carbohydrates in 3 commercially available starches (Hi-Maize® 260, Hylon® VII and&#xD;
      Amioca corn starch) which escape digestion in the human small intestine.&#xD;
