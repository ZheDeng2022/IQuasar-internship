    <textblock>
      The number of obese is increasing rapidly. Bariatric surgery is used to a greater and greater&#xD;
      extent as treatment of obesity to obtain a greater and more permanent weight loss. The&#xD;
      currently most commonly used surgical method is the gastric bypass (RYGB), which so far has&#xD;
      proved to be the most effective way to achieve a greater and more permanent weight loss,&#xD;
      reduction and maybe even elimination of many of the obesity-related health complication&#xD;
      (diabetes, sleep apnea, pain due to osteoarthrosis etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery, including RYGB is also associated with medical and nutritional&#xD;
      complications. This will be a natural consequence of the fact that the food bypasses&#xD;
      virtually the entire ventricle and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the small intestine after&#xD;
      a RYGB. Therefore, problems with uptake of for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin,&#xD;
      fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E and K) copper, zinc and selenium are expected. In the&#xD;
      light of this, it is decided that all RYGB operated patients must take vitamin B12, iron and&#xD;
      vitamin D substitution. In spite of this, many develop various nutritional problems after&#xD;
      RYGB. In addition to these nutritional complications are complications such as hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      and gallstone attacks after RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless there is no comprehensive inventory of the occurrence of nutritional&#xD;
      complications after bariatric surgery neither in Denmark nor in an international context.&#xD;
      Thus there is no consensus on an optimal postoperative prevention of complications. An&#xD;
      overview of the occurrence of these problems will be important for assessing and determine&#xD;
      the indications for bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enlighten this we will conduct a cohort study of complications by investigating&#xD;
      hospitalizations and deaths after RYGB. Moreover we will get an overview on medication use&#xD;
      before and after RYGB operation in the Central Denmark Region and in the North Denmark Region&#xD;
      2006-2011 (about 5000 patients).&#xD;

      Background Prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing both in Denmark and in most&#xD;
      other countries, and as conventional treatment of obesity with lifestyle changes (hypocaloric&#xD;
      diet, physical activity and behavior modification) rarely leads to large and sustained weight&#xD;
      loss, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery has taken over more and more of the&#xD;
      treatment of the most severe cases of obesity. Weight losses are greater than with other&#xD;
      treatments, and importantly the relatively large weight loss is permanent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive effects of gastric bypass The currently most commonly used surgical method is the&#xD;
      gastric bypass (RYGB), which has proven to be a highly effective method of achieving a great&#xD;
      and permanent weight loss with an approximately 30-40% reduction in the weight, which is&#xD;
      equivalent to 40-60% reduction of the overweight.Moreover RYGB has shown to provide complete&#xD;
      remission of prior type 2 diabetes in up to 80% of cases at short observation time (up to 2&#xD;
      years after surgery) and about 50% remission at longer time follow-up (&gt; 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover data suggest that after RYGB there is a reduced consumption of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs in 51 % and of lipid-lowering drugs in 59 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric complications after gastric bypass There are conflicting results in the&#xD;
      literature when examining the consumption of antidepressants. Some studies find a reduced&#xD;
      consumption of antidepressants after bariatric surgery within the first two years, others&#xD;
      show that consumption is almost unchanged overall and cohort follow-up studies show an&#xD;
      increased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is an increased incidence of suicide after bariatric surgery, which&#xD;
      argues against an unambiguous improvement in psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional complications after gastric bypass Bariatric surgery including RYGB is also&#xD;
      connected with some medical and nutritional effects or complications. This is not surprising&#xD;
      since RYGB &quot;bypasses&quot; virtually the entire ventricle and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the&#xD;
      small intestine, so problems with the inclusion of, for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin,&#xD;
      fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E and K) copper, zinc and selenium are expected.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is recommended that all RYGB operated patients substitute vitamin B12, iron and&#xD;
      vitamin D. Despite this many develop various nutritional problems after RYGB which in the&#xD;
      long term can result in irreversible neurological damage, osteoporosis and anemia. Such&#xD;
      complications are sparsely registered in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications are often developed long time after the operation, at a time when the&#xD;
      patients are no longer followed in specialized departments which report all complications to&#xD;
      the Danish Obesity Register, in the same way as surgical complications are reported. There is&#xD;
      no international consensus on postoperative vitamin substitution, which may be due to the&#xD;
      previous lack of evidence of nutritional complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical complications after gastric bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
      International studies have shown that mortality of bariatric surgery ranges between 0.24 and&#xD;
      2.77% depending on the operator and the hospital, and perioperative morbidity ranges between&#xD;
      6.92 and 8.85% also depending on the operator and the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover complications such as abdominal pain of varying degree and the development of&#xD;
      gallstones are frequently seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still unresolved how extensive a problem these nutritional complications after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in Denmark are, we want to clarify the occurrence of these complications in&#xD;
      Denmark. This will provide an overview of the positive as well as the negative impact of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and thus will be decisive to assess and determine the indications for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will in this project make a cohort study in which all RYGB operated&#xD;
      patients in the Central Denmark Region and the North Denmark Region during the period 2006 -&#xD;
      2011 (about 5000 patients) will be included and from the combination of the various registers&#xD;
      (see research plan) we will be able to estimate e.g. mortality, readmissions in the surgical&#xD;
      department (reoperations), length of stay in the surgical department / intensive care unit&#xD;
      and the length of patient follow-up in a medical context, referrals and readmissions in&#xD;
      medical wards,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this cohort study is to describe the prognosis for patients who have had a&#xD;
      RYGB in the Central and North Denmark Region 2006-2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective is to compare the Danish data for the occurrence of complications and&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of RYGB with international data in order to demonstrate the quality of&#xD;
      RYGB made in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a Mortality after RYGB surgery (30-day mortality, 90-day mortality and total follow-up&#xD;
      period: 2-7 years after surgery) b Surgical complications of RYGB by studying such as of&#xD;
      anastomosis ulcers, bowel obstruction, ileus / internal herniation, peritonitis, gallstones,&#xD;
      kidney stones, abdominal pain and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c Consumption of drugs two years leading up to the surgery compared with consumption 2-7&#xD;
      years after RYGB. Here the focus will be on the consumption of antidiabetics,&#xD;
      antihypertensives, statins, aspirin, antidepressants and analgetics on prescription to&#xD;
      illuminate the psychological, medical and nutritional complications following RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators wish to achieve a better documentation of both the positive effects&#xD;
      after RYGB (weight loss, remission of diabetes, quality of life, etc.) and the negative&#xD;
      health effects (mortality, surgical and nutritional) in order to provide a better founded&#xD;
      approach to this form of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method The investigators will include all RYGB-operated persons in the period 2006-2011&#xD;
      residing in Central Denmark Region (CDR) and in the North Denmark Region (NDR). These&#xD;
      patients' social security numbers will be provided by the CDR and NDR (agreed). This is&#xD;
      considered to be about a total of approximately 5,000 people (about 3,300 from CDR and&#xD;
      approximately 2,000 from RN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables the investigators want to focus on in relation to this epidemiologic study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality after bariatric surgery: Information about death and cause of death will be&#xD;
           provided from relevant registries (The Danish Register of Causes of Death etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical complications after bariatric surgery: Surgical hospital readmissions after&#xD;
           bariatric surgery with diagnoses that can be related to the original obesity surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will use data from the The Danish National Database of Reimbursed&#xD;
           Prescriptions on the consumption of prescription drugs in this group of people as&#xD;
           antidiabetics, vitamin substitution as B12/thiamin, iron supplements and&#xD;
           antidepressants. As a control group will be used consumption of drugs in a sex and age&#xD;
           matched group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data and data directly from The National Bariatric Surgery Register we will&#xD;
      get an overview of possible predictors of complications of RYGB such as age, gender,&#xD;
      preoperative BMI, previous gastric banding surgery and preoperative comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a stratified analysis of data from people in Central Denmark&#xD;
      Region which will be involved in the second subproject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of the project will be carried out in close collaboration with the Department of&#xD;
      Clinical Epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital, who has access to the necessary&#xD;
      databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and power calculation In the cohort study, the investigators&#xD;
      expect a cohort of approximately 5000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical evaluation of the data will be performed in collaboration with the Department&#xD;
      of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be conducted statistical analysis to identify possible predictors of complications&#xD;
      of RYGB such as BMI before surgery, age, comorbidity, etc. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out by the philosophiae doctor (PhD) student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of participants We will include all patients who have undergone gastric bypass&#xD;
      surgery in the Central Denmark Region and the North Denmark Region in the years 2006-2011&#xD;
      (about 5000 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages There is not considered to be any risks, side effects&#xD;
      or disadvantages associated with participation in the epidemiological study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respect for the subjects' physical and mental integrity The project has been approved by the&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection Agency (no. 1-16-02-153-13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Act on Processing of Personal Data will be respected. The study will also be reported to&#xD;
      the Clinical Trials and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results Both positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published and&#xD;
      sought to be published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals as original publications&#xD;
      and with the PhD student as first author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The investigators expect to identify positive and negative consequences for RYGB&#xD;
      and thus optimize the basis on which patients and physicians in the future will be able to&#xD;
      decide on surgery. This will also better prevention of complications and thus save patients&#xD;
      and communities of loss, economic as well as social and personal. The project will hopefully&#xD;
      form the basis for the continuation of longer follow-up studies. Moreover, the results set&#xD;
      the stage for the development of new more &quot;gentle&quot; obesity surgery.&#xD;
