      A study to investigate if the gekoTM device improves flow through vascular bypass grafts&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The geko™ device, (CE 558928;British Standards Institute notified body 0086), wearable,&#xD;
      discrete, self-contained stimulation unit that adheres to the skin (see www.gekodevices.com).&#xD;
      The, geko™ produces small electrical impulses that gently activate the common peroneal nerve&#xD;
      within the popliteal fossa, behind the knee, in turn activating the venous muscle pumps of&#xD;
      the calf and foot. Substantive increases in lower limb blood flow have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      improve arterial, venous and microcirculatory blood flow with no reported morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE Early infra-inguinal graft failure, i.e. occurring within 30 days of surgery occurs&#xD;
      in approximately 5% of patients16. It is known that the predominant cause of this is&#xD;
      thrombosis. The geko™ is an electrical device placed over the common peroneal nerve alongside&#xD;
      the knee. The device activates muscle contraction in the peronei using low intensity, low&#xD;
      frequency (1Hz) stimulation. The muscle contraction expresses blood from the deep venous&#xD;
      system. Application of the stimulation device over the peroneal nerve is suitable for&#xD;
      practical purposes. Previous studies have shown that the geko™ substantively increases&#xD;
      arterial, venous and microcirculatory blood flow in healthy volunteers. A significant&#xD;
      decrease in Tissue Plasminogen Activator antigen has also been demonstrated which indicates&#xD;
      increased fibrinolytic activity3. Application of the geko™ device should therefore decrease&#xD;
      stasis and increase flow though the graft and as such reduce the risk of thrombosis and as&#xD;
      such graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental Conditions The examinations will be carried out in a designated temperature&#xD;
      controlled clinical room in the Vascular Lab at Hull Royal Infirmary. Participants will be&#xD;
      required to abstain from vigorous exercise, nicotine, caffeine and fatty foods prior to their&#xD;
      examination. They will be required to wear light garments with their legs exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The geko™ device will be applied to outer/ posterior aspect of the knee whilst the subjects&#xD;
      are semi-recumbent, with their knees flexed. The participants will be given 30 minutes in the&#xD;
      quiet, environmentally controlled room prior to commencement of measurement to enable&#xD;
      equilibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Participants will complete the McGill Pain questionnaire prior to device&#xD;
      activation Participants will have the geko™ device applied whilst semi-recumbent with their&#xD;
      knees flexed. The intensity will be increased until visible muscle stimulation is evident&#xD;
      (concentric isotonic contractions) or until patient tolerance is reached&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laser Doppler imaging will be used to assess microcirculation flow on the dorsum of both&#xD;
           feet at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline (rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 5 minute intervals while the geko™ device is active&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 30 minutes following removal of the device Laser Doppler flowmetry is a&#xD;
                reproducible, objective, non-invasive measurement which can be used to evaluate&#xD;
                real time cutaneous blood flow. The low powered light is conducted via glass fibres&#xD;
                to a probe attached to the skin and is scattered by the movement of blood cells&#xD;
                inducing a Doppler shift. This allows information on flux and cell velocity to be&#xD;
                recorded. The system to be used for this trial is the Moor Instruments DT-4 mains&#xD;
                unit with integrated bilateral lasers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound Doppler arterial flow velocity and blood volume flow within the femoral&#xD;
           artery (mid thigh) bilaterally at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline (rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 30 minutes while the device is active&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound Doppler flow velocity in femoral vein (mid thigh) bilaterally at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline (rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 40 minutes while the geko is active&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vicorder measurements of arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity and stroke volume at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline (rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Immediately following removal/ deactivation of the device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Tissue Plasminogen Activator antigen (TPA&#xD;
           antigen), Full blood count (FBC) and Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1): 15 mls&#xD;
           of blood to be taken from both femoral veins at:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline (rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 45 minutes while the geko™ device is active ELISA analysis will be carried out on&#xD;
                samples (see appendix). Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor - Therapies which can&#xD;
                lead to the development of new, collateral blood vessels, are of particular&#xD;
                interest in the field of peripheral arterial disease where narrowing or blockages&#xD;
                in existing blood vessels result in tissue ischaemia. Vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
                factor (VEGF) is a signal protein produced by cells that stimulates the growth of&#xD;
                new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Several previous studies have shown&#xD;
                that electrical stimulation increases VEGF levels and in turn increases vessel&#xD;
                density in muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a protein involved in the breakdown of blood clots. As&#xD;
      a result it has therapeutic uses in clinical medicine to treat thromboses and emboli.&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation has been previously shown to provoke an acute release of tPA into the&#xD;
      circulation, although it appears that this response decreases with repeated stimulations. Use&#xD;
      of the geko™ device has been shown to result in a significant decrease in Tissue Plasminogen&#xD;
      Activator (tPA) antigen which is indicative of increased fibrinolytic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI-1) is the primary inhibitor of plasminogen activators&#xD;
      and inactivates tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator&#xD;
      (u-PA). PAI-1 is an important inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system, and elevated levels could&#xD;
      suppress fibrinolysis and result in an increased risk of thrombosis. Increased PAI-1 levels&#xD;
      have been shown to be associated with a number of atherosclerotic risk factors, PAI-1 has&#xD;
      been shown to act as a prothrombic factor in both arterial and venous thromboembolic&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle Brachial Pressure Index at baseline and post removal of geko™- utilising both&#xD;
           Posterior Tibial Artery and Anterior Tibial Artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum calf circumference at baseline and post removal of geko™&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be taken bilaterally at baseline&#xD;
           and @ 30 minutes while the device is active. The mean of the three values will be used&#xD;
           for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient tolerance/ acceptability + Nurse tolerance/ ease of application Questionnaire&#xD;
           using Visual Analogue Scores and Verbal Rating Scores to be completed following removal&#xD;
           of geko™ device (see appendix)&#xD;
