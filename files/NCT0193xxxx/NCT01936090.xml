    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given&#xD;
      together with melphalan, and total-body irradiation before stem cell transplant and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Giving chemotherapy and&#xD;
      total-body irradiation before a stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing or killing them. The stem cells that were collected from the&#xD;
      patient's blood or bone marrow are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells&#xD;
      that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and total-body irradiation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib that can be added to high dose&#xD;
      melphalan and low dose total body irradiation as part of conditioning chemotherapy for&#xD;
      myeloma. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the bortezomib added to high dose&#xD;
      melphalan and low dose total-body irradiation (TBI) in patients with myeloma undergoing stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation, as defined by achievement of complete response (CR). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the toxicities associated with addition of bortezomib to high dose melphalan&#xD;
      and TBI in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      negative status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days -5 and -2, TBI&#xD;
      twice daily (BID) on days -5 and -2, and melphalan IV over 1 hour on days -4 and -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant&#xD;
      on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and then every 90&#xD;
      days for up to 3 years.&#xD;
