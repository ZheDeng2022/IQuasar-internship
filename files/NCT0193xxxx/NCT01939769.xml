      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research has shown that one exercise session may improve a person s ability to recall&#xD;
      information they learned before the exercise. Knowing how exercise changes brain activity to&#xD;
      improve memory can help researchers understand how memory works and how to improve it in&#xD;
      people with memory problems. This study compares two kinds of exercise on a stationary bike&#xD;
      for their ability to temporarily improve memory on certain tests. Researchers will look at&#xD;
      the effect of exercise on body chemistry by drawing blood and collecting saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand how a single session of exercise affects memory testing in healthy people and&#xD;
      people who have had traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 18 through 45 with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adult volunteers, ages 18 through 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. This will take&#xD;
           about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with TBI will also be screened with a test of their memory. This will take&#xD;
           another hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 will take about 3 hours. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Have a tube inserted in their arm for drawing blood during the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Take memory tests. They will look at pictures, symbols, and words, then answer&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Give a saliva sample by chewing on a small sponge for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Exercise on a stationary bike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Take the memory tests again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visit 2 will take place 1 week later. Participants will take the memory tests only.&#xD;

      Objective: The goals of this study are to 1. replicate the finding that exercise after&#xD;
      exposure to images enhances their subsequent recall, 2. extend the question to words and&#xD;
      logical rules, 3. examine the mechanism of the effect using exercise biomarkers and fMRI and&#xD;
      4. explore its usefulness as an aid to memory in individuals with traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy adult volunteers and individuals with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The main, clinical, experiment has a parallel, repeated-measures design, where four&#xD;
      groups (two each of healthy subjects and participants with TBI) will encode pictures, words&#xD;
      and rules and then exercise at either a high or very low (placebo) intensity. Recall will be&#xD;
      tested one hour and again at seven days after exercise. Blood and saliva will be collected&#xD;
      before and immediately after exercise and assayed for biomarkers of exercise, thought to be&#xD;
      possible mediators of the memory effect. In a parallel-design fMRI experiment, intended to&#xD;
      explore the brain basis of the effect of exercise on memory, healthy volunteers will view&#xD;
      pictures, exercise at a high or low intensity, and then perform a recall task in the scanner.&#xD;
      The analysis will look for differences in location and extent of evoked brain activations&#xD;
      evoked by picture recall after low and high intensity exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is recall of visual material one hour after&#xD;
      exercise. Secondary measures will be the recall of word lists and letter/digit symbol&#xD;
      matching (logical memory) and activations on fMRI. The blood and saliva biomarkers will are&#xD;
      included as exploratory outcomes.&#xD;
