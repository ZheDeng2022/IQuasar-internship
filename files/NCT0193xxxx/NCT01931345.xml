  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2009, a team of researchers from Montreal, Canada, implemented SPOT, an intervention aimed&#xD;
      at reducing HIV transmission among men who have sex with men by offering rapid HIV testing in&#xD;
      a community setting. During the first phase, counseling based on Quebec guidelines for rapid&#xD;
      HIV testing was offered (standard counseling - SC) and in the second phase, counseling based&#xD;
      on motivational interviewing (MIC) was developed and validated. The current phase of the&#xD;
      project aims to strengthen the work undertaken during previous phases. The objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the short and medium term effect of MIC on the occurrence of at-risk anal&#xD;
      intercourse and its cognitive determinants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      SC or MIC, and will respond to a baseline questionnaire documenting their sexual behavior and&#xD;
      psychosexual profile prior to the intervention at the start of their initial visit (T0). The&#xD;
      effect of counseling will be assessed following the intervention at the end of the initial&#xD;
      visit (T1), at 3 months after the initial visit (T2) and at 6 months after the initial visit&#xD;
      (T3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the prevalence and incidence of HIV remain high among men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM). Moreover, epidemiological data show that a significant proportion of transmission can&#xD;
      be attributed people who are unaware of their HIV status. To address these challenges, HIV&#xD;
      testing has the potential to be a major prevention strategy. Indeed, the combination of&#xD;
      testing and treatment (test &amp; treat) is now seen to be one of the most promising strategies&#xD;
      in terms of its potential contribution to the eradication of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize testing among MSM, it has been recommended that services be diversified by&#xD;
      offering HIV testing in close proximity to areas where people most at risk for HIV reside and&#xD;
      socialize. Rapid HIV testing can also help reduce barriers in access to testing by reaching&#xD;
      those most at risk more effectively in non-traditional venues. In addition, testing offers an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity and psycho-affective context within which to provide individualized&#xD;
      counseling in order to explore preventive practices and testing routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since July 2009, the SPOT project has combined a number of strategies (testing services in&#xD;
      close proximity to a residential area; free, anonymous, and rapid HIV testing; individualized&#xD;
      preventive counseling) in an original way at an innovative community site located in the&#xD;
      heart of Montreal's Gay Village. In the first phase of the study, standard counseling (SC)&#xD;
      based on Quebec guidelines for rapid HIV testing was used. During the second, counseling&#xD;
      based on a motivational interviewing approach (MIC) was developed and has been provided to&#xD;
      participants since May 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking advantage of the existing infrastructure, the objective of the current phase of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the short and medium term impact of MIC and its cognitive determinants in&#xD;
      comparison to SC. The occurrence of at-risk anal intercourse (unprotected anal sex with an&#xD;
      HIV-positive partner or partner of unknown HIV status) will be measured at baseline and&#xD;
      followed over six months. Four cognitive determinants of at-risk anal sex will also be&#xD;
      measured: the importance that participants accord to taking the necessary steps to protect&#xD;
      themselves from HIV, perceived personal efficacy in achieving this, intention to do so, and&#xD;
      the extent to which participants have planned to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this objective, a 24 months randomized trial will be implemented SPOT's community&#xD;
      site. Participants who present for HIV testing will be randomized between the two conditions,&#xD;
      MIC and SC, alternated at a ratio of 1/1 (experimental condition: MIC offered by a community&#xD;
      worker; control condition: SC offered by a nurse). Outcome measures will be collected by&#xD;
      means of questionnaires. Four measurement times are planned. A baseline questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered prior to pre-test counseling at the start of the initial visit. Outcome measures&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline (T0), and in follow-up questionnaires administered after&#xD;
      post-test counseling at the end of the initial visit (T1), at 3 months after the initial&#xD;
      visit (T2) and at 6 months after the initial visit (T3). Target enrolment at T0 is 900, for a&#xD;
      final sample of 508 participants at T3, representing 254 participants per group (MIC, SC).&#xD;
      Mechanisms will be put in place to ensure the integrity of both MIC and SC interventions as&#xD;
      well as to retain participants and involve community members in the research process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the wake of the recommendations of the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada,&#xD;
      this study will provide data on the effectiveness of different forms of preventive counseling&#xD;
      tailored for use in conjunction with rapid HIV testing. If MIC proves to be effective, the&#xD;
      training and clinical supervision offered to intervention staff as well as the tools and&#xD;
      quality control procedures developed during the implementation of this approach to counseling&#xD;
      will be made available in other settings where testing is offered. Important lessons may also&#xD;
      be learned with regards to the organization of services and the benefits and challenges&#xD;
      associated with the implementation of this type of HIV prevention infrastructure. Ultimately,&#xD;
      this study will contribute to efforts to more effectively combat the HIV epidemic amongst MSM&#xD;
      in Canada and reduce the direct and indirect costs associated with HIV in these communities.&#xD;
