      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together&#xD;
      with cetuximab and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated stage III-IVB head and neck cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      ipilimumab and cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain&#xD;
      cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as IMRT, that delivers a high dose of radiation&#xD;
      directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      Giving ipilimumab together with cetuximab and IMRT may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the starting dose of ipilimumab, in combination with standard cetuximab-IMRT&#xD;
      in patients with high- or intermediate-risk, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC), for use in a future clinical efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the clinical response of patients with high- or intermediate-risk, locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC treated with above regimen using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with high- or&#xD;
      intermediate-risk, locally advanced HNSCC treated with the above regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate serum, lymphocyte and tissue biomarkers as predictors of progression-free&#xD;
      survival, toxicity and other outcome parameters in patients with high- or intermediate-risk,&#xD;
      locally advanced HNSCC treated with above regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the association by dose-response modeling between dose of ipilimumab,&#xD;
      clinical response and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
      Treatment with cetuximab repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Beginning in week 2 of course&#xD;
      1, patients undergo concurrent IMRT 5 days per week for 7 weeks. Beginning in week 4 (day 1&#xD;
      of course 2) patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes once every 21 days for 3&#xD;
      courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients achieving disease progression may undergo surgery after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then every 12 months for 3 years.&#xD;
