  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to investigate the effects of topical diclofenac on tumor&#xD;
      metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis is that topical diclofenac lowers lactate level in skin biopsies of actinic&#xD;
      keratoses. Planned number of patients is 38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a monocenter study investigating the effects of 3% diclofenac in 2.5%&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid gel on tumor metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses. Treatment&#xD;
      duration is 3 months. Skin biopsies will be obtained before treatment, at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment and four weeks after the treatment. Control biopsies at visit 1 and 3 are performed&#xD;
      in healthy, sun damaged and untreated skin. Evaluation of efficacy will be performed at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment and four weeks after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment is 3 months (±4 weeks). Approximately 0,5g Solaraze® 3% gel is applied&#xD;
      on a 5cm x 5cm lesion. Solaraze® 3% gel is applied twice daily on the study lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoplastic cells show an increased glucose metabolism and glycolysis which is associated with&#xD;
      high lactate concentrations. There is also data for several tumor entities that high levels&#xD;
      of lactate in the tumor are associated with tumor progression, metastasis and poor clinical&#xD;
      outcome. Kreutz et al. demonstrated that diclofenac inhibits tumor cell proliferation in&#xD;
      vitro and tumor growth in vivo via COX-independent effects on glucose metabolism. Diclofenac&#xD;
      is taken up by tumor cells and inhibits tumor cell proliferation through inhibition of the&#xD;
      oncogene MYC and subsequently glycolysis and block of lactate transport. MYC regulates genes&#xD;
      involved in glycolysis and is upregulated in neoplastic cells, which is in line with the&#xD;
      metabolic switch to glycolysis, the so called &quot;Warburg effect&quot;, that cancer cells show.&#xD;
      Although these results were found in vitro using human melanoma cells and in vivo in a mouse&#xD;
      model, a similar mechanism of action is assumed to be relevant for the treatment of actinic&#xD;
      keratoses with topical diclofenac. However tumor metabolism in diclofenac-treated actinic&#xD;
      keratoses has never been investigated. To investigate the mechanism of action of diclofenac&#xD;
      in the treatment of actinic keratoses, a clinical study analyzing particularly lactate&#xD;
      levels, glycolysis and inflammatory infiltrate is needed.&#xD;
