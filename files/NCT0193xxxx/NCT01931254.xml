  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past 70 years antibiotics have served as the first line of defense against infectious&#xD;
      diseases. However, antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections and are not&#xD;
      the solution for infections caused by viruses such as common colds or flu. Despite their&#xD;
      contribution to healthcare, antibiotics are currently recognized as the most misused drugs in&#xD;
      the world with global overuse estimated at 40%-70%, mostly due to the ineffectiveness of&#xD;
      current diagnostic solutions to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.&#xD;
      Antibiotics misuse often causes preventable adverse events that impact patient care and lead&#xD;
      to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the major threats to global health&#xD;
      today. To address these challenges, MeMed has been developing the ImmunoDx™, a novel&#xD;
      technology that relies on the best available detection system for differentiating between&#xD;
      viruses and bacteria - the body's own immune system. The ImmunoDx™ technology employs a&#xD;
      simple blood test that provides the physician, within two-hours, the information he needs to&#xD;
      decide whether to treat the patient with antibiotics or not. This technology has been tested&#xD;
      on over 1000 patients of different ages and diseases and was found to be highly accurate and&#xD;
      safe. The current study is a non-interventional study and the participants do not receive any&#xD;
      investigational drug nor any experimental examination or procedure. Therefore, the collected&#xD;
      data in this study will not affect the diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of the&#xD;
      participants. Participation includes the collection of a teaspoon of blood and collection of&#xD;
      a specimen using a nasal swab. These procedures are common in the clinical practice and are&#xD;
      widely performed and possess no significant risk. By participating in the study, the subjects&#xD;
      impact the development of the ImmunoDx™ technology, which is expected to enable a future&#xD;
      faster and more accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases as well as more appropriate&#xD;
      prescription of antibiotics. This will open the way to improve treatment decisions in&#xD;
      millions of patients around the world.&#xD;

      This is a prospective clinical validation study of a novel in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay&#xD;
      that will enroll 830 pediatric patients. The study will be conducted in two stages: In stage&#xD;
      A 50 patients will be enrolled with the aim of verifying proper protocol execution including&#xD;
      proper collection of patient samples, accurate data retrieval and precise etiology&#xD;
      determination. In stage B 780 patients will be enrolled with the aim of blinded validation of&#xD;
      the host-response based diagnostics using a fresh independent cohort of patients. Patients&#xD;
      enrolling into the study will be managed according to the current standard of care (GCP) and&#xD;
      per standard institutional procedures. Participation in this study requires the collection of&#xD;
      an additional blood sample and a nasal swab sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigated assay requires the measurement of three host-related, blood-based, protein&#xD;
      biomarkers that are being integrated using a logistic regression formula into a single score.&#xD;
      Based on this score, each patient is classified into one of three categories: (i) bacterial&#xD;
      immune response (i.e., pure bacterial infections and mixed bacterial and viral co-infection),&#xD;
      (ii) viral immune response, and (iii) marginal immune response (inconclusive or&#xD;
      non-infectious). It is estimated that 10-20% of the infected patients will have a marginal&#xD;
      immune response. A composite reference standard will be used in order to determine the&#xD;
      diagnosis of each patient. Specifically, all the clinical, radiological, microbiological and&#xD;
      laboratory data of each patient, will be recorded in a dedicated eCRF. Based on this data,&#xD;
      the diagnosis of each patient will be determined by a panel of three independent&#xD;
      pediatricians. Each pediatrician will be blinded to the diagnosis of his peers and to the&#xD;
      assay results. In the current study, unanimous agreement between the experts (&quot;consensus&#xD;
      agreement&quot;) will be considered as the true diagnosis for the purpose of computing the assay&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

        The study population will include eligible subjects aged 1 to 60 months of age from both&#xD;
        genders that attend the hospital or the emergency department (ED) due to a suspected LRTI,&#xD;
        FWS or due to a non-infectious disease. These subjects are expected to fall into one of the&#xD;
        following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with an acute bacterial infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an acute viral infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with an acute mixed co-infection (bacterial and viral)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with an undetermined disease etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a non-infectious disease (control group; n=140) We estimate that&#xD;
             approximately 75% of the patients will fall into categories number 1-3 (i.e.,&#xD;
             bacterial, viral or mixed infections).&#xD;
