      The best timing for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients&#xD;
      with acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown. The investigators will conduct a multicenter&#xD;
      prospective randomized open-label trial to compare two strategies in ICU patients&#xD;
      (mechanically ventilated and/or receiving catecholamine infusion) with severe AKI defined as&#xD;
      RIFLE F classification. These patients will be randomly allocated to one of the following&#xD;
      strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an &quot;early&quot; strategy where RRT is started immediately when a RIFLE F status is documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a &quot;delayed&quot; strategy where RRT (in patients who also present RIFLE F renal failure) is&#xD;
           started only in case of occurrence of one or more of the following events (&quot;Alert&#xD;
           Criteria&quot;): oliguria or anuria lasting for more than 72 hours after randomization, serum&#xD;
           urea concentration &gt; 40 mmol /L, serum potassium concentration &gt; 6 mmol /L, serum&#xD;
           potassium concentration &gt; 5.5 mmol /L that persists despite well-conducted medical&#xD;
           treatment with at least sodium bicarbonate and / or glucose-insulin infusion, arterial&#xD;
           pH &lt; 7.15 in the context of pure metabolic acidosis (PaCO2 &lt;35 mmHg) or in the context&#xD;
           of mixed acidosis with PaCO2&gt; 50 mmHg without possibility of lowering this PaCO2 value,&#xD;
           acute overload pulmonary edema generating severe hypoxemia requiring oxygen flow&gt; 5L/min&#xD;

           noninvasive) ventilated to maintain SpO2&gt; 95%, despite diuretic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is overall survival, measured from the date of randomization to the date&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.&#xD;
      Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is the major supportive treatment of AKI. Despite progress in&#xD;
      RRT management, mortality remains high and the timing of its initiation remains open to&#xD;
      debate when no metabolic disorder (severe hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis) or major fluid&#xD;
      overload threaten short-term prognosis. Such abnormalities mandate RRT and are non-inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of our study. Whereas many studies have focused on RRT modalities, no prospective&#xD;
      randomized study has evaluated the criteria for initiating RRT in ICU in the absence of the&#xD;
      above-mentioned life-threatening disorders. In other words, whether duration of&#xD;
      oliguria/anuria and/or value of serum urea/creatinine are an adequate indication for RRT is&#xD;
      unknown. Given the lack of high quality data, it is not surprising that survey of practices&#xD;
      showed wide variation in the timing of RRT initiation and that no precise guidelines could be&#xD;
      drawn by expert recommendation as to the optimal start of RRT, making a randomised controlled&#xD;
      study of timing of RRT both desirable and ethical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare two strategies of RRT initiation in terms of&#xD;
      overall survival in ICU patients (mechanically ventilated and/or receiving catecholamine&#xD;
      infusion) with severe AKI defined as RIFLE F classification. These patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of the following strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an &quot;early&quot; strategy where RRT is started immediately when a RIFLE F status is documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a &quot;delayed&quot; strategy where RRT (in patients who also present RIFLE F renal failure) is&#xD;
           started only in case of occurrence of one or more of the following events (&quot;Alert&#xD;
           Criteria&quot;): oliguria or anuria lasting for more than 72 hours after randomization, serum&#xD;
           urea concentration &gt; 40 mmol /L, serum potassium concentration &gt; 6 mmol /L, serum&#xD;
           potassium concentration &gt; 5.5 mmol /L that persists despite well-conducted medical&#xD;
           treatment with at least sodium bicarbonate and / or glucose-insulin infusion, arterial&#xD;
           pH &lt; 7.15 in the context of pure metabolic acidosis (PaCO2 &lt;35 mmHg) or in the context&#xD;
           of mixed acidosis with PaCO2&gt; 50 mmHg without possibility of lowering this PaCO2 value,&#xD;
           acute overload pulmonary edema generating severe hypoxemia requiring oxygen flow&gt; 5L/min&#xD;
           in spontaneously breathing patients or FiO2&gt; 50% in mechanically (invasive or&#xD;
           noninvasive) ventilated to maintain SpO2&gt; 95%, despite diuretic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial comparing two RRT initiation&#xD;
      strategies in terms of overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival, measured from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of&#xD;
      the cause. The minimum duration of each patient's follow-up will be 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival rate at day 28, percentage of patients requiring who did not require RRT in the&#xD;
      &quot;delayed&quot; strategy, time until cessation of RRT therapy, rate of adverse events potentially&#xD;
      related to the AKI or to RRT (e.g; RRT catheter-related complications, hemorrhage due to&#xD;
      anticoagulation required for RRT etc…), rate of nosocomial infections, number of&#xD;
      ventilator-free days of RRT-free days and of vasopressors free days, length of stay in ICU&#xD;
      and hospital, rate of limitations of treatment for futility, total cost of consumables&#xD;
      (including RRT catheters and lines among others) related to RRT between day 1 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the &quot;delayed&quot; strategy would prove beneficial to the patients and would&#xD;
      translate into increased survival. The study is designed to prove superiority (and not&#xD;
      noninferiority) of this strategy over the &quot;early&quot; one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 60 days survival rate with the &quot;early&quot; strategy is estimated to be 45%. It is necessary&#xD;
      to include 620 patients (310 per arm) to obtain a power of 90% to detect a survival&#xD;
      improvement of 14% at day 60 with the &quot;delayed&quot; strategy (log-rank two tailed test, global&#xD;
      significance level of 5%), with two blind interim analyses by independent observers at 90 and&#xD;
      180 deaths (group sequential approach of O'Brien-Fleming), and a estimated dropout rate of&#xD;
      10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: 18 months Minimum participation of each patient: 60 days Analysis and report: 10&#xD;
      months&#xD;
