      This study is evaluating the effects of two brain training exercises on: memory, cognitive&#xD;
      processing and depression symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent public health need to develop more effective and well tolerated treatments&#xD;
      for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD); cognitive training interventions aiming to&#xD;
      modify cognitive and affective processing abnormalities underlying MDD represent a promising&#xD;
      new strategy. This research project translates a well established cognitive bias in major&#xD;
      MDD, working memory bias, into a novel intervention target. In a double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled study, MDD participants undergo 6 weeks of cognitive training sessions, with three&#xD;
      sessions per week.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary, current Axis I diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV&#xD;
             criteria and Ham-D-17 score between 16-27&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-55&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (DSM-IV criteria) within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual impairment that would affect the ability to observe the computerized&#xD;
             presentation of faces.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Motor impairment that would affect the ability to provide a response by quickly&#xD;
             pressing a button.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lifetime history of Bipolar spectrum disorders or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary, current Axis I diagnosis other than Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary, current Axis II personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently attending a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute suicidal or homicidal risk (evidenced by suicidal or homicidal attempt within 6&#xD;
             months of screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy in women. Pregnant women are excluded from the study because research has&#xD;
             shown that hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy can mimic and/or influence&#xD;
             symptoms of depression. Including patterns of mood and cognition. These mood and&#xD;
             cognitive changes could mask the effect of the cognitive training in this study, so&#xD;
             pregnant women will be excluded for that reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrolled participants can be currently taking medication but must be stabilized on&#xD;
             their medication regimens before enrolling in the study (i.e., no medication has been&#xD;
             started within 8 weeks, stopped within 6 weeks or titrated up or down within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of study entry). Accordingly, if a patient's medication status must change during the&#xD;
             course of the study, we will discontinue them in the study. We do not anticipate that&#xD;
             this will occur frequently, as again, patients' medication regimens must be stable&#xD;
             before enrolling in the study. No medications will be discontinued for the purpose of&#xD;
             enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use. Subjects with current excessive use&#xD;
        of alcohol (&gt; 8 ounces/day for men and &gt; 6 ounces/day for women) are ineligible for&#xD;
        participation, as such drug use could confound the results.&#xD;
