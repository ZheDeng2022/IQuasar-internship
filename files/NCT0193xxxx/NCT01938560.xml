    <textblock>
      As part of a post-marketing commitment, GSK will conduct a survey of prescribers' and&#xD;
      pharmacists' understanding of the risk of urinary retention with retigabine products. This is&#xD;
      to address the effectiveness of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) as&#xD;
      outlined in the REMS approved by the FDA on 10th June 2011. The objectives of this survey are&#xD;
      to assess prescribers' and pharmacists' understanding of the risk of urinary retention and&#xD;
      the symptoms of acute urinary retention potentially associated with retigabine use as&#xD;
      evaluated by a survey instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study of approximately 200 physicians (e.g.&#xD;
      neurologists/epileptologists/neurosurgeons) who have prescribed retigabine at least once in&#xD;
      the last 12 months, and 200 pharmacists who have dispensed an anti-epileptic drug (AED) at&#xD;
      least once in the last 3 months. The primary outcome of the survey is the proportion of&#xD;
      physicians and pharmacists providing correct responses to a series of questions concerning&#xD;
      the risk of urinary retention and the symptoms of acute urinary retention that may be&#xD;
      associated with retigabine. The risks captured will be those described in the retigabine Dear&#xD;
      Healthcare Provider (DHCP) letters, specifically risks of urinary retention.&#xD;
