      Background: Patients with indwelling urinary catheter for chronic retention due to&#xD;
      obstructive BPH refractory to medical therapy are candidates for prostatectomy still&#xD;
      considered as the gold standard of treatment. Urinary tract infection, strictures,&#xD;
      postoperative pain, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, anesthesiologist risk and blood loss&#xD;
      are complications associated with surgery. Minimally invasive treatments were originally&#xD;
      conceived as an attempt to offer equivalent efficacy without the burden and risk of operative&#xD;
      morbidity. Recently, it was suggested that prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) to treat BPH&#xD;
      might follow uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas. Animal studies in pigs and&#xD;
      dogs have shown that PAE is safe and can induce prostatic volume reduction. The first report&#xD;
      of this technique in the management of BPH in humans was by DeMeritt et al, who reported a&#xD;
      single case of BPH with obstructive symptoms and blood loss refractory to other treatments&#xD;
      that was successfully managed by PAE with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective : We investigate whether PAE might be a feasible procedure as an alternative&#xD;
      treatment option to treat urinary retention due to obstructive BPH. The primary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the success rate of procedure defined when selective prostatic arterial&#xD;
      catheterization and embolization were achieve and patients can be able to urinate after their&#xD;
      urinary catheter has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods : A monocentric prospective study is undertaken in 25 patients aged&#xD;
      50-85 years who present with indwelling urinary catheter due to obstructive BPH refractory to&#xD;
      medical treatment with a clinical indication for surgery who agreed to undergo PAE. The study&#xD;
      is approved by the hospital ethical committee and an informed consent form for PAE as an&#xD;
      alternative treatment is signed by all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis : The sample size has been calculated in order to have an estimated&#xD;
      probability of success (corresponding of primary objective) of 50% (worst case) with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals of 30 to 70. The two-sample t-test (and Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is used&#xD;
      to compare the mean changes of the variables from baseline to 10, 30 and 90 days. Finally,&#xD;
      the Chi-square test is used to test for adverse events at the end of follow-up. P ≤ 0.05 is&#xD;
      indicative of statistically significant.&#xD;

      Embolization is performed under local anesthesia in one day surgery unit by unilateral&#xD;
      approach, usually the right femoral artery. Initially, pelvic angiography is performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the iliac and prostatic arteries. Then, a 5-F catheter is introduced in right&#xD;
      femoral artery to catheterize the left hypogastric artery and reach its anterior division.&#xD;
      The inferior vesical artery and finally the prostatic vessels are selectively catheterized&#xD;
      with a 3-F coaxial microcatheter. For embolization, nonspherical 100-300 μm PVA particles is&#xD;
      used. The endpoint chosen for embolization is slow flow or near-stasis in the prostatic&#xD;
      vessels with interruption of the arterial flow and prostatic gland opacification. When&#xD;
      embolization of the left prostatic arteries was finished, the right prostatic arteries were&#xD;
      embolized in the same way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary catheter is removed 10 days after the embolization procedure. Voiding trials is&#xD;
      performed and the successfull urination after urethral catheter removal is defined as three&#xD;
      consecutive spontaneous micturitions with postvoid residual less than 100% of each&#xD;
      micturition volume. If the patient is unable to urinate, a urethral catheter will replace&#xD;
      before hospitalization discharge and the patient will return to our outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      another voiding trial until the end of protocol. Assessments were carried out 10, 30 and 90&#xD;
      days after initial embolization allocation.&#xD;
