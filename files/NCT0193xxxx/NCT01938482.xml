  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed indication for GSK1940029 is topical treatment of acne, the early clinical plan&#xD;
      will evaluate the irritation potential of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study); and&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK1940029 (Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study),&#xD;
      after topical administration on healthy subjects and acne patients. Study SCD117226 will be a&#xD;
      randomized, single-blind, dose-rising study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary pharmacokinetics of single and 14 day repeat topical applications of GSK1940029&#xD;
      gel on the intact skin of healthy human subjects. Part 1: (single-dose) subjects will receive&#xD;
      0.3% or 1% GSK1940029 (or matching vehicle), as a single approximately (App) 24 hour (h)&#xD;
      (22.5h) application to a surface area of 400 square centimeter (cm^2) (0.3%), 400 cm^2 (1%)&#xD;
      or 1200 cm^2 (1%), respectively, in each of three sequential cohorts. Part 2: (repeat-dose)&#xD;
      subjects will receive 0.3% or 1% GSK1940029 (or matching vehicle), as 14 daily App24h (22.5h)&#xD;
      application to a surface area of 400 cm^2 (0.3%), 400 cm^2 (1%) or 1200 cm^2 (1%),&#xD;
      respectively, in each of three sequential cohorts. Parts within Study SCD117225 and Study&#xD;
      SCD117226 will have interdependencies. No significant primary irritation signal in Study&#xD;
      SCD117225 Part 1 (primary irritation) would allow initiation of Study SCD117226 Part 1. Once&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and exposure information are determined in Study SCD117226 Part 1, then&#xD;
      Part 2 (cumulative irritation) of Study SCD117225 may be initiated along with Part 2 of Study&#xD;
      SCD117226. No significant cumulative irritation signal (study SCD117225 Part 2) in&#xD;
      combination with adequate 14-day safety (study SCD117226 Part 2) would allow initiation of&#xD;
      Part 3 (facial irritation) of Study SCD117225.&#xD;
