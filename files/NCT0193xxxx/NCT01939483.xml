      This pilot clinical trial studies irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer and brain metastases that progressed after whole brain radiation therapy or&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of irinotecan (irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride) in breast cancer patients with brain metastases who progressed after radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate central nervous system (CNS) objective response and clinical benefit rate in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate progression free survival. IV. To estimate overall survival. V. To assess&#xD;
      the toxicity of Irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, 22, and 29. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may be on oral corticosteroids at stable dose (no dose change within two&#xD;
             weeks of enrollment), and may be on antiepileptic medication (except for cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, lactation, immunosuppression other than corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may be on hormonal therapy or Herceptin, but no other concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
             is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had progression of their breast cancer after prior administration of&#xD;
             irinotecan are excluded&#xD;

             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, other&#xD;
             malignancies considered disease-free&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using valproic acid within the last two weeks and patients with&#xD;
             contraindications to anticholinergic agents will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent administration of CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medications (e.g.&#xD;
             phenytoin) will not be allowed (if patients are taking one of these agents, they must&#xD;
             switch to a non- enzyme-inducing antiepileptic medication prior to start of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of immediate or delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to gadolinium&#xD;
             contrast agents or other contraindication to gadolinium contrast, and no other known&#xD;
             contraindication to MRI&#xD;

          -  Homozygous for uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide&#xD;
             A1 (UGT1A1)*28 allele * All patients will be tested for UGT1A genotype prior to&#xD;
             starting treatment and be excluded if they are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele&#xD;
             (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype); irinotecan's active metabolite glucuronidation of&#xD;
             7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) is inactivated through glucuronidation by&#xD;
             uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) mainly in the liver and is&#xD;
             excreted through the bile ducts; a meta-analysis demonstrated that the UGT1A1*28&#xD;
             genotype is moderately predictive of severe irinotecan induced hematologic toxicity at&#xD;
             moderate doses and strongly predictive at high doses, and in 2005, the Food and Drug&#xD;
             Administration (FDA) added a warning to the irinotecan packaging label that patients&#xD;
             with the UGT1A1*28 genotype were at increased risk for neutropenia&#xD;
