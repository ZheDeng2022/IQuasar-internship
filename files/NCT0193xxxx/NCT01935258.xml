  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are a common and important problem in primary care.&#xD;
      Patients repeatedly presenting MUS to their general practitioner (GP) suffer from their&#xD;
      symptoms, are functionally impaired, and are at risk of unnecessary and possibly harmful&#xD;
      tests, referrals and treatment. Evidence indicate that specific interventions for patients&#xD;
      with MUS, such as reattribution therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy are of limited&#xD;
      help. According to experts in this field a multi-component approach is most helpful for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial aims to test the systematic identification of eligible patients, to assess&#xD;
      the acceptability of the intervention and to estimate potential treatment effects for a&#xD;
      larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a randomised pilot study consisting of patients with MUS in primary care. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to intervention (usual care and additional psychosomatic therapy) or control&#xD;
      condition (usual care alone). Patients will be followed for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are patients consulting their GP more than once with MUS and in which the GP&#xD;
      presumes that psychosocial distress is an underlying cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is the psychosomatic therapy delivered by a psychosomatic therapist,&#xD;
      consists of a combination of information and education, relaxation therapy and mindfulness,&#xD;
      cognitive approaches and activating therapy. This multi-component approach is captured into a&#xD;
      protocol in which therapists are able to modify the treatment in order to deliver a&#xD;
      tailor-made treatment for patients with MUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are: the number of patients identified and recruited, perceived&#xD;
      symptom severity, measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and patients' self-rated symptoms&#xD;
      of distress, depression, anxiety and somatization (4DSQ: The Four Dimensional Symptom&#xD;
      Questionnaire). Other primary outcome measures are the time needed to include the eligible&#xD;
      patients, the number of withdrawals in the intervention and control group, compliance in the&#xD;
      therapy group and the number of patients who complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are: symptoms of hyperventilation (NHL: Nijmegen Hyperventilation&#xD;
      List), physical and mental health status and quality of life (SF-36), and level of&#xD;
      functioning (MAF: measure of general functioning). Patient satisfaction with the received&#xD;
      therapy is rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Medical consumption will be measured by the&#xD;
      Cost Diary for medical consumption.&#xD;

      Recruitment and signed informed consent:Participating GPs (n=6) were asked to enrol each&#xD;
      consecutive eligible patient and include 10 patients with MUS each. The GPs presented written&#xD;
      information and an informed consent form to these patients. Patients had the opportunity to&#xD;
      read the information to consider participation before signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Participating patients (n=60) are equally randomised over two groups, the&#xD;
      intervention group (usual care and psychosomatic therapy delivered by a psychosomatic&#xD;
      therapist) and the control group (usual care of the GP). For the randomisation we used a&#xD;
      random number table, whereas a central and blinded allocation procedure was applied.For the&#xD;
      randomisation we used a random number table, whereas a central and blinded allocation&#xD;
      procedure was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group were asked to complete a questionnaire at baseline, at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention (+/- 3 months)and at 6 and 12 months. Patients in the control group&#xD;
      completed a questionnaire at baseline, at 3 (equals end of intervention), 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The number of patients identified and recruited by the GP as well as the&#xD;
      number of eligible patients who declined to enter the trial were analysed using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Furthermore, at each stage of the study, we recorded the number of trial&#xD;
      participants who completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the intervention on the primary outcome measures (VAS and 4DSQ) and the&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures (NHL, SF-36 and MAF) were estimated using analysis of covariance&#xD;
      with baseline value as a covariate. Data analysis was be performed according to the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle. Medical consumption was measured using the Cost Diary for&#xD;
      medical consumption. Patients recorded their absenteeism and healthcare consumption, such as&#xD;
      consulting a GP, hospital, paramedic facilities and alternative medicine. Medication intake&#xD;
      was recorded at the start and the end of the study. We used standardised Dutch prices (guide&#xD;
      cost research 2009), whereas medication costs were calculated according to the Dutch Pharmaco&#xD;
      Therapeutic Compass. Costs by absenteeism were calculated according to the Friction Cost&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference in cost of medical consumption between the control and intervention group were&#xD;
      estimated using analysis of covariance with baseline value as a covariate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference in baseline characteristics were analysed with the student's t-test for continue&#xD;
      variables and the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. P-values&#xD;
      of &lt; 0.05 were considered statistical significant.&#xD;
