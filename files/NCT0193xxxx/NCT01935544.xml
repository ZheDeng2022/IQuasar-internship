  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin injections are an effective treatment of limb spasticity after stroke.&#xD;
      Different tracking techniques are used to locate a proper injection spot. Palpatory technique&#xD;
      is barely effective and induces a high risk of error. Localization by electro stimulation is&#xD;
      frequently used in adults, but often requires multiple painful repositioning of the needle.&#xD;
      Ultrasound tracking is sometimes used in children but not much in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injections are a painless localization&#xD;
      and greater injection accuracy. Safety is therefore enhanced since intravascular injection is&#xD;
      easily avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The few existing publications on the subject are essentially case reports. Few studies have&#xD;
      focused on comparing different injection techniques and so far, no well-conducted study has&#xD;
      highlighted superior efficiency of ultrasound-guided injections.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the efficiency of botulinum toxin injections depending on&#xD;
      the localization technique: ultrasound vs. electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to demonstrate less painful localization associated to&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the variation of passive range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion at&#xD;
      slow speed and high speed (&quot;Tardieu scale&quot;) while keeping knee straight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The other components of the &quot;Tardieu scale&quot;: quality of muscle reaction (X) at slow&#xD;
           speed and fast speed, angle of apparition of the muscle reaction (Y) at slow speed and&#xD;
           fast speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of spasticity of the triceps surae on the modified Ashworth scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The extent of pain at the injection site by visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of tracking and injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, single-center, single-blind, cross-over, study will be&#xD;
      conducted in chronic stroke patients with spasticity of the triceps surae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive two injections during the protocol, each with a different technique of&#xD;
      localization. Randomization will determine which technique will be used in the first and the&#xD;
      second place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the cohort of patients supported by consultation of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand.&#xD;
      Injections of botulinum toxin and assessments will take place in the same department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period is five months for each patient. This study does not present a major risk&#xD;
      for the subjects. The main inconvenience is injection pain or side effects of botulinum toxin&#xD;
      (increase of motor deficits or dysphagia).&#xD;
