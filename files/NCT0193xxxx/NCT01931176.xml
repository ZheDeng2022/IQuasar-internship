    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other more serious illnesses. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to a dengue virus vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and the more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic&#xD;
      fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization and death in children in at least 8 tropical Asian countries. There are 4&#xD;
      types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which can cause dengue&#xD;
      illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      experimental rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine for the prevention of illness due to DENV-2. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in healthy adults&#xD;
      with no history of previous flavivirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the dengue virus&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo. They will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the&#xD;
      injection for monitoring. Study visits will occur at Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28,&#xD;
      56, and 180. All study visits will include a blood collection, and most study visits will&#xD;
      include a physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at select&#xD;
      visits. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day for the first 16&#xD;
      days; study researchers will review these readings during the study visits.&#xD;
