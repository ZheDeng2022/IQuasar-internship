    <textblock>
      This study is an 8-week open-label trial testing oxytocin nasal spray (Syntocinon) as a&#xD;
      treatment for social impairment in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that oxytocin nasal spray will be safe, tolerable, and effective in improving the&#xD;
      core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders in adolescents ages 11-17.&#xD;
