  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively and prospectively the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events) of standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international&#xD;
      guidelines as standard therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer.&#xD;

      In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response,&#xD;
      progression free survival and estimation of overall survival&#xD;
