  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an Advisory/Automated Adaptive (AAA) Control system for&#xD;
      insulin delivery in adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in an outpatient setting to evaluate&#xD;
      the system's ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels. One component of this&#xD;
      study is evaluating if the AAA Control system run on the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system can&#xD;
      prevent hypoglycemia during and following exercise more efficiently during a 40 hour trial.&#xD;
      Another component of this study is evaluating AAA Control overnight only in 5 consecutive&#xD;
      overnights. This protocol represents a culmination of prior clinical trials in development of&#xD;
      this AAA system and benefits from the synthesis of those components.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to test an Advisory/Automated Adaptive (AAA) Control&#xD;
      system, which includes three interacting control modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 1 - Automated Safety Supervision (SSM) responsible for prevention of&#xD;
           hypoglycemia, which can be adapted (individualized) with prior data for each subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 2 - Advisory Module (AM) responsible for pre-meal boluses and postprandial&#xD;
           corrections, which can be adapted (individualized) with prior data for each subject;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 3 -- Automated Basal Rate Module (BRM) responsible for augmentation of basal rate&#xD;
           to compensate for changes in insulin sensitivity, particularly overnight (e.g. dawn&#xD;
           phenomenon), which can be adapted with prior data for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daytime control (40hour studies) includes all 3 modules (n=36). Overnight only closed loop&#xD;
      control (5 consecutive overnights) includes Module 1 and 3 (n=5-7).&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will use their home insulin pump along with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) receiver. A CGM will be worn for 7 days prior to the study admission. Four fingersticks completed each day and carbohydrates will be recorded in bolus calculator of their insulin pump prior to each meal.&#xD;
Subjects will be asked to provide the study team their insulin pump data on Day 2 or 3 to ensure accuracy of data collection. Subjects will be asked to submit insulin pump, glucometer, and CGM data 1-2 days prior to their admission and again the evening prior to the study admission at a Research House.&#xD;
During the Experimental Admission, the AAA system will be tested using the DiAs platform. Subjects will participate in 45 minutes of exercise during the 40 hour admission (n=36). A subset (n=5-7) will continue with 5 nights of consecutive closed loop control (23:00-07:00).</description>

    <description>The experimental and control admissions (40hr admissions) are exactly the same except for the study admission. During the Control Admission, subjects will use their home insulin pump along with a continuous glucose monitor receiver without running any specialized mathematical equations.&#xD;
The active comparator for subjects participating in 5 consecutive nights of closed loop control will be the sensor-augmented pump therapy at home.</description>

    <intervention_name>AAA control</intervention_name>
    <description>AAA control is a method to determine insulin dosing to keep glucose in range. AAA control is run on the DiAs which is a medical platform that uses a smart-phone to connect to a continuous glucose sensor to insulin pump. The cell phone runs the AAA control and is connected to work with the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to help keep the blood sugar in a desired range.&#xD;
AAA control will be tested in 40 hours sessions and 5 consecutive overnight sessions.</description>
