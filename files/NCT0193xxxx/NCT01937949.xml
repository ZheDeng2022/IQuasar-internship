    <description>The study will include patients treated by endovascular aortic repair of juxtarenal, suprarenal and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using custom-made Cook Zenith® Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft. The graft includes combinations of scallops, holes (fenestrations) or cuffs (side branches) . These small holes or branches are the investigational part of this research study. The arteries to the liver, intestine, and kidneys will be have a stent (small tubular stainless steel structures) to help keep the arteries open and aligned with the fenestrations or branches.&#xD;

    <description>The graft will be inserted through arteries in the groin (called endovascular repair). Endovascular repair is a procedure that uses catheters that go inside your blood vessel to place a stent graft above and below the aneurysm. This procedure lines the aneurysm with a new lining (stent) so blood does not fill the artery any more.</description>
