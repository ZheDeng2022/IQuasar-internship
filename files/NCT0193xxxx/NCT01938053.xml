  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to improve the process for contacting patients that test&#xD;
      positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the emergency department by using text&#xD;
      messaging. We believe patients that are contacted by both a phone call and a text message&#xD;
      will be reached more often and they will be reached sooner than those that only receive a&#xD;
      phone call or only a text message. In addition, patients will be given reminder cards at the&#xD;
      time of testing to remind them that they will be contacted within 7 days if they test&#xD;
      positive. Half of the reminder cards will have a number to call for test results. We believe&#xD;
      patients that receive a card with a number are more likely to be contacted within 7 days.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To improve the results notification system among all female adolescents who test&#xD;
      positive for STIs in the ED using mobile phone texting technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: We will increase our contact rate for STI positive adolescents in the ED from&#xD;
      65-82%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: We will decrease the time interval between testing and appropriate STI&#xD;
      treatment by the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: We will decrease the recidivism rates for STI positive patients diagnosed in&#xD;
      the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To explore qualitatively the barriers to and preferences for partner notification and&#xD;
      treatment among 14-21 year-old females and males being tested for STIs in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine baseline rates of partner notification and preferences around partner&#xD;
      notification among STI-positive females in the ED, and to explore the feasibility of ED&#xD;
      personnel notifying their sexual partners.&#xD;
