    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare human embryo in vitro development in sequential and&#xD;
      single-step culture medium using time-lapse imaging.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To study whether a culture medium that allows undisturbed culture supports human&#xD;
      embryo development to the blastocyst stage equivalently to a well-established sequential&#xD;
      media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double-blinded sibling trial. Setting: Independent in vitro fertilization&#xD;
      (IVF) clinics. Patient(s): One hundred twenty-eight patients, with 1,356 zygotes randomized&#xD;
      into two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention(s): Embryos from each patient were randomly allocated into two study arms to&#xD;
      compare embryo development on a time-lapse system using a single-step medium or sequential&#xD;
      media.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study was a two-arm, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial performed at four independent IVF clinics. Ovarian stimulation and oocyte collection and fertilization were performed as per each clinic's practice. If &gt;6 oocytes from the patient were fertilized, the resulting zygotes underwent stratified randomization into the two different media.&#xD;
Allocation was performed in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomization list for each couple, which was provided in sealed and numbered envelopes to each clinic.&#xD;
Zygotes randomized into G-1/G-2 underwent a media change from G-1 to G-2 on day 3 and subsequent culture until days 5-6. The zygotes randomized to G-TL were cultured continuously without any media change until days 5-6.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>To minimize the possible bias for the primary outcome, the embryologist performing the morphologic evaluation on day 3 and 5-6 was blinded to the treatments. The physician, the embryologist, and the couple were also blinded to the culture group from which the embryo had been selected for transfer.</masking_description>
