    <textblock>
      A study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Direct Flow Medical aortic valve&#xD;
      system. This is for people with severe aortic stenosis who are not well enough to undergo a&#xD;
      surgical repair. The delivery of this device is done via the femoral artery.&#xD;

      The Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System is indicated for symptomatic&#xD;
      patients who require replacement of their native aortic valve and have a predicted operative&#xD;
      mortality or serious morbidity risk of equal or greater 50% at 30 days with surgical aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement or are deemed unsuitable for surgery.&#xD;

             or dobutamine stress echocardiogram and Doppler, or simultaneous pressure recordings&#xD;

             &gt;4.0 m/s and an aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 or aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has moderate to severe symptoms from aortic valve stenosis (NYHA&#xD;
             Functional Class ≥III).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient must have a predicted risk of operative mortality or serious irreversible&#xD;
             morbidity of &gt;50% at 30 days, or be deemed not suitable for surgery for other reasons.&#xD;
             This conclusion shall be based on consensus of one cardiologist and two cardiac&#xD;
             surgeons at the investigational site after careful consideration of the patient's STS&#xD;
             risk score and co-morbidities, and after at least one of the surgeons participating in&#xD;
             the decision has personally examined the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, is&#xD;
             willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluations and has provided&#xD;
