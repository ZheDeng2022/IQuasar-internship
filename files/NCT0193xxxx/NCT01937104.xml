    <textblock>
      Increase of intracerebral pressure (ICP) during laparoscopic surgery has known to be&#xD;
      associated with positional changes. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has correlation with&#xD;
      ICP and ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is known to be a&#xD;
      noninvasive and rapidly applicable technique for evaluating ICP. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the change of ONSD according to the positional change during laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      1. Purpose There can be many physiologic changes during laparoscopic surgery. Increase of&#xD;
           intracerebral pressure (ICP) is one of them, which has known to be associated with&#xD;
           arterial concentration of carbon dioxide or positional changes. Changes of ICP can be&#xD;
           measured directly by invasive method. However, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has&#xD;
           correlation with ICP and ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter&#xD;
           (ONSD) is known to be a noninvasive and rapidly applicable technique for evaluating ICP.&#xD;
           The aim of this study is to investigate the change of ONSD according to the positional&#xD;
           change during laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis Changes of ONSD will be shown according to the positional change during&#xD;
           laparoscopic surgery, and these can reflect the changes of ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives Female patients who are scheduled to undergo laparoscopic surgery, American&#xD;
           society of anesthesiologist class (ASA) I-II, aged between 19 to 65 years, are allocated&#xD;
           into 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: Laparoscopic gynecological surgery, (Trendelenburg position)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, (Reverse trendelenburg position)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Methods Patients are premedicated with midazolam 0.5 mg/kg before transported to the&#xD;
           operating room. Once in the operating room, patients were monitored with&#xD;
           electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry (Datex-Ohmeda S/5,&#xD;
           Planar Systems, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) and BIS (Aspect 2000, Aspect Medical Systems,&#xD;
           Inc., Newton, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anesthesia are induced with propofol (2mg/kg) and followed by administering rocuronium&#xD;
           0.6 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, the lungs of the patients were then ventilated&#xD;
           with oxygen in air (1:2) using a tidal volume of 8-10 mL/kg and a respiratory rate of&#xD;
           10-12/min, and the ventilation rate was adjusted to maintain the end-tidal carbon&#xD;
           dioxide partial pressure between 35 and 40 mmHg and peak inspiratory pressure below 30&#xD;
           cmH2O. Anesthesia is maintained with desflurane in addition to the continuous infusion&#xD;
           of remifentanil. Radial arterial cannulation is done for invasive arterial blood&#xD;
           pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After induction of anesthesia, when stabilization of cardiovascular status is achieved,&#xD;
           optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is measured by ultrasonographic measurement. Patients&#xD;
           were placed in the supine position with their eyes closed, and a thick gel layer was&#xD;
           applied to the closed upper eyelid. The 7.5-MHz linear probe was placed on the gel&#xD;
           without excessive pressure and adjusted to the proper angle for displaying the entry of&#xD;
           the optic nerve into the globe. The intensity of the ultrasound was adjusted to display&#xD;
           optimal contrast between the retrobulbar echogenic fat tissue and the vertical&#xD;
           hypoechoic band. An ultrasound beam was focused on the retrobulbar area (4 cm deep)&#xD;
           using the lowest possible acoustic power that could measure ONSD. The ONSD was measured&#xD;
           3 mm behind the optic disc. Measurements were performed in the transverse and sagittal&#xD;
           planes of both eyes, and the final ONSD value was calculated by averaging 4 measured&#xD;
           values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ONSD was measured at 7 serial time points during surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Preinduction (prior to the induction of anesthesia in the operating room)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 5 minutes after introducing pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 5 minutes after positional change&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. 15 minutes after positional change&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. 30 minutes after positional change&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. 5 minutes after discontinuing pneumoperitoneum Arterial blood gas analysis is&#xD;
                performed to evaluate the arterial carbon dioxide concentration (PaCO2) level at&#xD;
                each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as numbers (%) or mean ± standard deviation.&#xD;
           Repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to compare the parameters at specific time&#xD;
           points during surgery.&#xD;
