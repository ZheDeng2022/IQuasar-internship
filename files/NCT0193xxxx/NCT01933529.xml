  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a non-hematopoietic erythropoietin&#xD;
      analogue, ARA 290, exerts beneficial effects on blood glucose levels and insulin secretion in&#xD;
      persons with prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance, IGT, or impaired fasting glucose, IFG),&#xD;
      or drug-naive type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate effects of ARA 290 on insulin sensitivity and serum levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory agents, e.g. cytokines. In addition, safety will be monitored by following&#xD;
      parameters related to hematology, kidney and liver function and lipid levels.&#xD;

      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this double blind study is to determine in individuals with&#xD;
      pre-diabetes (IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; or IFG, impaired fasting glucose) and&#xD;
      drug-naïve type 2 diabetes whether ARA 290 reduces disease activity by improving oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance, and insulin secretion, and thereby improves long-term glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of ARA 290 on insulin sensitivity; serum&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory agents, e.g. cytokine levels; serum levels of gluco-regulatory&#xD;
      hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon; and safety by registering&#xD;
      reported adverse events, and by monitoring clinical chemistry parameters related to&#xD;
      hematology, kidney function, liver function and lipid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of ARA 290 on glucose homeostasis in persons with pre-diabetes or early,&#xD;
      dietary treated type 2 diabetes. The trial has two parallel arms with 12 subjects in each&#xD;
      group, and with a 4-week-intervention period. At screening, a baseline investigation will&#xD;
      include a physical examination and the following tests: oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT),&#xD;
      and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational medicinal product (ARA 290, 4.0 mg) or placebo will be self-administered&#xD;
      by a once daily injection s.c. for 28 days. Participating subjects meeting inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and not fulfilling any exclusion criterion on screening, will be randomized&#xD;
      double-blind within one week following screening 1:1 to either treatment with ARA 290 or with&#xD;
      placebo. Before the first treatment, serum for determination of cytokines, adipokines, and&#xD;
      hormones will be collected. Participants will be investigated further with OGTT, HbA1c and&#xD;
      clinical assessment after 2 weeks and at study end, after 4 weeks. They should also perform a&#xD;
      self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) curve once weekly during the treatment period, e.g.,&#xD;
      altogether 6 blood glucose tests during one day. Four weeks after the last dose, patients&#xD;
      will return for HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to test whether there is a significant difference&#xD;
      between persons receiving ARA 290 vs. persons receiving placebo in: glucose tolerance,&#xD;
      evaluated by OGTT at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks. . The secondary endpoints of the&#xD;
      study include effects of ARA 290 on: insulin sensitivity, evaluated by HOMA-IR (homeostasis&#xD;
      model assessment of insulin resistance); insulin secretion, examined both by measuring the&#xD;
      early insulin response (at 15 and 30 min) in OGTT, and using the HOMA-beta (homeostasis model&#xD;
      assessment of beta cell function); and long-term glucose control, determined as glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin, HbA1c; assessment of serum levels of inflammatory agents, e.g. cytokine levels;&#xD;
      serum levels of gluco-regulatory hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and&#xD;
      glucagon; and safety by registering reported adverse events, and by monitoring clinical&#xD;
      chemistry parameters related to hematology, kidney function, liver function and lipid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 patients will be enrolled in one single center; 12 patients will be administered ARA 290&#xD;
      active ingredient product as daily doses for 28 days, and 12 patients will be administered a&#xD;
      placebo as daily doses for 28 days. Individuals with IGT (impaired glucose tolerance), IFG&#xD;
      (impaired fasting glucose) or drug-naïve type 2 diabetes will be included in the study. The&#xD;
      population will consist of individuals of either gender, males aged 40-75 years; women aged&#xD;
      50-75 years and menopausal.&#xD;
