      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of heated humidified high flow nasal cannula&#xD;
      (HHHFNC) as compared to noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) on lung&#xD;
      function as a measure of lung injury in preterm infants born at 28 to 37 weeks gestation&#xD;
      requiring continuing respiratory support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress and the need for respiratory support continues to be a common problem&#xD;
      for preterm infants. Presence of the breathing tube and duration of respirator provided&#xD;
      breaths have been shown to be associated with increased risk for secondary lung injury and&#xD;
      subsequent development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Early application of&#xD;
      noninvasive nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) has been shown to be an&#xD;
      effective, non-invasive, mode of respiratory support in preterm infants and to be associated&#xD;
      with a lower incidence of chronic lung disease. A recently published large randomized&#xD;
      multicenter study concluded that, among infants born at 28 weeks and longer gestation, heated&#xD;
      humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) had similar clinical efficacy and safety as&#xD;
      compared to NCPAP. Both NCPAP and HHHFNC are currently used to assist infants with breathing&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of HHHFNC as compared to NCPAP on lung function&#xD;
      as a measure of lung injury in preterm infants born at 28 to 37 weeks gestation requiring&#xD;
      continuing respiratory support. In this study, infants will remain on the assigned treatment&#xD;
      of either NCPAP or HHHFNC until they require more support as provided by a respirator or&#xD;
      until a treatment cross-over from NCPAP to HHHFNC, or the reverse, as decided by their&#xD;
      attending physician. The infant's respiratory support will be managed according to his/her&#xD;
      attending doctor as per accepted standards of care. A pulmonary function test will be&#xD;
      performed twice weekly on each enrolled infant while receiving either NCPAP or HHHFNC&#xD;
      support, followed-up by once weekly lung function measurements post respiratory support while&#xD;
      infants are breathing only room air until discharge.&#xD;
