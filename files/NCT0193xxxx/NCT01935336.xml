  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ponatinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage III-IV lung cancer. Ponatinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      This study will look at the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug ponatinib in&#xD;
      lung cancer. The investigators hope that ponatinib will work against tumors that have certain&#xD;
      biomarkers. Therefore, the study will pre-screen patients for these certain biomarkers before&#xD;
      enrolling them into the main treatment study. Different doses of ponatinib may be tested in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
