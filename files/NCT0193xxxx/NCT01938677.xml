  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on hearing loss, in patients with vestibular&#xD;
      schwannoma (VS) and preserved hearing is still unclear. Retrospective data indicate that the&#xD;
      hearing is preserved in most patient years after the gamma knife treatment. Recent&#xD;
      prospective data suggests that radiosurgery could be a hearing preserving treatment for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate if GKRS can inhibit progression of hearing&#xD;
      loss in patients with VS. Patients with preserved hearing will be offered to participate in&#xD;
      the study and randomized ether to GKRS or initial conservative treatment for their vestibular&#xD;
      schwannoma. They will then be followed with scheduled magnetic resonance image(MRI) and&#xD;
      audiometry and evaluated after one, three and five years after treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients newly (&lt;6 months) diagnosed with Vestibular schwannoma less than 20 mm in&#xD;
             diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Vestibular schwannoma with or without evidence of growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients between 18 and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Karnofsky performance score &gt;70&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with vestibular schwannoma and preserved hearing according to Gardner&#xD;
             Robertson class 1-2, and speech discrimination (SD) scores between 50-100% will&#xD;
             participate in the hearing preservation part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 will be excluded to achieve a homogenous&#xD;
             study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients who had other treatments prior to the GKRS (usually microsurgery (MS),&#xD;
             GKRS or external beam radiation) for their tumour will also be excluded for the same&#xD;
             reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients who are not citizens in the country where they will be followed will be&#xD;
             excluded, to reassure the same follow up within the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Hearing loss due injury or to active ear disease, such as MeniereÂ´s disease,&#xD;
             otosclerosis or chronic otitis media.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients with poor comprehension of the the language in the country where they are&#xD;
             followed, such that adequate performance on speech tests, are unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Claustrophobia, making MR follow up impossible without sedation. 7. Alcohol- or&#xD;
             narcotic abuses that effect compliance to the follow up. 8. Uncontrolled neoplastic&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
