      This study compared the bioavailability of two formulations 100 mg (one capsule or other&#xD;
      respectively) of each one of the products, of Minocycline, under fasting conditions, in&#xD;
      healthy Mexican volunteers of both sexes. The single dose study under fasting (10 hours prior&#xD;
      to study) conditions, cross, with two treatments, two periods, two sequences (2x2) randomized&#xD;
      sequence, balanced, and with a washout period of at least 7 days between each dose, in 24&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
