    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the value of deep neuromuscular block (NMB) (using&#xD;
      rocuronium) in laparoscopy versus high dose opioids (using remifentanil) or 1 minimum&#xD;
      alveolar concentration (MAC) inhalation (using sevoflurane) for the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that laparoscopic workspace is larger when using rocuronium versus&#xD;
      opioids or inhalation. Laparoscopic workspace is measured as the abdominal compliance and the&#xD;
      pressure at volume zero (PV0) using the abdominal pressure volume relation. Three points&#xD;
      allow to calculate the abdominal compliance and the pressure at zero volume (PV0).&#xD;

      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of administering a deep neuromuscular block (NMB) to reach a post-tetanic count&#xD;
      (PTC) of &lt; 4 during laparoscopy is not clear. Some anesthesiologists claim that certain&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures do not need NMB at all and that surgeons cannot objectivize the&#xD;
      existence of insufficient workspace and the effect of NMB. They assume that deep anesthesia&#xD;
      with remifentanyl improves also the workspace. This assumption may be based on the fact that&#xD;
      deep anesthesia prevents spontaneous active muscle contractions. However, preventing an&#xD;
      active contraction through deep anesthesia is different from blocking the &quot;active tonus&quot; with&#xD;
      a NMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the difficulties in evaluating the surgical access, surgical workspace (1) should be&#xD;
      measured as the inflated carbon dioxide (CO2) volume for a given intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      during pneumoperitoneum. Abdominal compliance (C or its reciprocal the elastance: E) and the&#xD;
      pressure at zero volume (PV0) are calculated by measuring three or more pressure volume&#xD;
      points to construct the abdominal pressure volume relation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the value of deep NMB (using rocuronium) in&#xD;
      laparoscopy versus high dose opioids (using remifentanil) or 1 Minimum alveolar concentration&#xD;
      (MAC) inhalation (using sevoflurane) for the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Efficacy Objective: To compare the impact of the following agents on the&#xD;
           reduction in active muscle tonus during laparoscopy (time frame: during surgery beig&#xD;
           maximum 90 minutes) : remifentanyl &gt; 0.50 µg/kg/min; sevoflurane &gt; 1 MAC and deep&#xD;
           neuromuscular block (rocuronium given with PTC &lt; 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Safety Objective: To compare the adverse events ( time frame: during&#xD;
           hospitalisation maximum 3 days after surgery) among the patient groups who receive the&#xD;
           different agents listed above in the &quot;primary efficacy objective,&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High dose remifentanyl does not increase laparoscopic surgical workspace compared to&#xD;
           deep NMB (PTC &lt; 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1 MAC inhalation with sevoflurane does not increase laparoscopic surgical workspace&#xD;
           compared to deep NMB ( PTC &lt; 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgeons will encounter more workspace problems when no NMB is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open randomized blinded clinical trial including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery in a patient older than 18 years of age without previous&#xD;
      laparotomy. Examples of laparoscopic bariatric procedures are gastric band, sleeve&#xD;
      gastrectomy, gastric bypass, gastric bypass after lap band, and revision of a gastric bypass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      and excluding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Allergies or contraindications to the use of one or more of the following drugs:&#xD;
           propofol, rocuronium, sugammadex, remifentanyl, or sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History of a laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emergency laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained. The following patient characteristics will be&#xD;
      noted: body weight, length, body mass index, age, sex, previous laparoscopic surgery, and&#xD;
      gravidity for woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced in all patients with Propofol 3 mg/kg ideal body weight (IBW),&#xD;
      Ketamine 0,25 mg/kg IBW, Dexmedetomidine 1 ug/kg IBW loading dose, Lidocaine 1,5 mg/kg IBW&#xD;
      and Succinylcholine 1 mg/kg total body weight (TBW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three Syringes with drugs (I II III) used in all patients (no investigation drugs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: Ketamine 50 mg (1cc); Lidocaine 300 mg (2% 15 cc), Dexmedetomidine 200 ug (1cc), 3 cc NaCl&#xD;
      0,9% in 20 cc syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II: Propofol (10 mg/ml) not diluted in 50 cc syringe. III: Succinylcholine 200 mg (4cc) 16 cc&#xD;
      NatriumChloride (NaCl) 0,9% in 20 cc syringe. (10 mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: 1 ml/10 kg IBW II: 3 mg/ kg IBW or 3 ml/10 kg IBW III: 1 mg/kg TBW or 1ml /10 kg TBW&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: 1 ml/10 kg IBW/ h. II: 0,5 tot 1 ml/ kg IBW/ h&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syringes or drugs used according to study group. Group A: 5 mg Remifentanyl in 50 cc (100&#xD;
      ug/ml). Bolus of 2 ug/kg IBW (0,2 ml / 10 kg IBW) followed by 10 - 50 ug/kg IBW/h (1 - 5 ml /&#xD;
      10 kg IBW / h) Group B: Sevoflurane inhalation 1 MAC in O2/air Group C: 200 mg rocuronium in&#xD;
      20 cc (10 mg/ml). Bolus of 1 ml / 10 kg IBW followed by 1 ml / 10 kg IBW/h&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with Propofol infusion at 5 - 10 mg/kg IBW/hour, lidocaine at&#xD;
      0,75 - 2,25 mg/kg IBW/h, Dexmedetomidine 0,5 - 1,4 ug/kg IBW/h and Ketamine 0,125 - 0,375&#xD;
      mg/kg IBW/h adapted according to Bispectral analysis (BIS) value ( keep below 60) and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters (keep heart rate below 100 and SAP below 140mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum infusion rate for propofol: 10 mg/kg/h; for lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h; for ketamine 0,5&#xD;
      mg/kg/h and for dexmedetomidine 1,4 mg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be ventilated with O2/air and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &gt; 7&#xD;
      to an end tidal CO2 below 35 mmHg to prevent diaphragmatic activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A verres needle will be placed minimum 15 minutes after induction. If the surgeon is not able&#xD;
      to place the verres needle in two attempts, every patient will be given a rocuronium bolus of&#xD;
      0.6 mg/kg IBW and the surgeon is asked after 5 minutes to repeat the trocar positioning. This&#xD;
      will be noted as a failure to position the verres needle and to inflate the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the abdomen is inflated the first trocar is placed and the positions of the trocar and&#xD;
      gastric tube verified, and the stomach confirmed to be empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first abdominal pressure volume relation (APVR) will be measured using the following&#xD;
      procedure by the surgeon:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The abdomen is deflated of all air by manual palpation of the abdomen and turning the&#xD;
           trocar. The abdomen is re-inflated successively to 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 liters (IAV), and,&#xD;
           at each volume, the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is measured while inflation is&#xD;
           stopped. A maximum pressure of 15 mmHg is used. The lowest IAP or end expiration value&#xD;
           is taken. This allows the drawing of the first APVR, the calculation of the E, PV0, and&#xD;
           inflated volume at 15 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the end of insufflation, the insufflator is stopped and the insufflation line is&#xD;
           closed with a clamp. The IAP is recorded while pressure stabilizes. If no stabilization&#xD;
           is achieved in 15 seconds, a leak is possible and the patient is not included in the&#xD;
           study or the step-wise inflation is repeated after the leak is closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing against the ventilator or pressing is diagnosed when the IAP rises 5 mmHg above the&#xD;
      set pressure not by a surgical act, when capnography shows irregularities in the waveform, or&#xD;
      when the respiratory rate is higher than the set value. These patients are not included in&#xD;
      the randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All remaining patients will be randomly assigned to three groups. A randomization number will&#xD;
      be generated by the secretary of anesthesia at the moment of the patient's enrollment, using&#xD;
      a random number generator. The anesthesiologist will be informed of the number when ready to&#xD;
      prepare the drugs available from the pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesiologist will not be blinded (i.e., he/she will know what drug he/she gives),&#xD;
      because the administration routes are different: iv infusion, iv bolus, or inhalation. The&#xD;
      surgeon and OR nurses will be blinded to the drugs used as iv infusion and bolus will always&#xD;
      be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: A bolus of remifentanyl 2 µg/kg IBW (0,2 ml/ 10 kg IBW) will be given and followed&#xD;
      by 10 - 50 ug/kg IBW/h remifentanyl infusion (1 - 5 ml / 10 kg IBW / h). The propofol and&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine infusion will be continued but adapted in dose when needed after the&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Desflurane inhalation at 1 MAC N2/O2 will be started with a fresh gas flush of the&#xD;
      ventilator ( using et tidal control function) until the end tidal concentration reaches 1 MAC&#xD;
      while the propofol infusion is stopped. The Ketamine Lidocaine Dexmedetomidine infusion is&#xD;
      continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: A bolus dose of rocuronium 1 mg/kg IBW will be given while the propofol and&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine infusion is continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the above drugs are administered, there will be a waiting period of 5 minutes while the&#xD;
      abdomen remains deflated in all groups. The BIS value should stay below 40% in all groups&#xD;
      until the second APVR is measured, using the same setup as the first measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the second APVR measurement the pressure needed to reach 4 liter is calculated and the&#xD;
      insufflator is set to this value with a maximum of 15 mmHg in every patient. If during the&#xD;
      second APVR the patient presses or breathes against the ventilator this will be noted as a&#xD;
      failure to measure the APVR. A dose of rocuronium 1 mg/kg IBW is given followed by an&#xD;
      infusion to keep PTC &lt; 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia is continued with propofol/remifentanyl/Dex in group A, with sevoflurane/Dex&#xD;
      in group B, and with Propofol/Dex/Rocuronium in group C. A bolus of sufentanil can be added&#xD;
      in any patient after the two APVR measurements, at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon is asked 5 minutes after second APVR if he has sufficient workspace to reach all&#xD;
      places he need to operate. He is asked to grade this on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 excellent&#xD;
      and 1 impossible. If the grade is less than 3 and patient didn't get yet any NMB until that&#xD;
      time a bolus of rocuronium 1 mg/kg IBW is given. The NMB will be kept in these patients at&#xD;
      train of four (TOF) = 0 and PTC &lt; 4 until release of the pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex will be given before awakening the patient. Any&#xD;
      inadvertent event will be noted. TOF monitoring will be used in all patients to verify when&#xD;
      and how deep NMB is given and to verify that sugammadex returns the TOF to a minimum of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external statistical group revealed that an enrollment of 12, 14 and 16 patients in the&#xD;
      first, second and third group would be sufficient. The difference between the three groups is&#xD;
      due to the fact that a comparison is needed between NMB and the other drugs, not between&#xD;
      remifentanyl and sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two way Anova will be used to evaluate the different effect of remifentanyl, sevoflurane&#xD;
      versus rocuronium on the abdominal workspace (pressure needed to achieve 4 l) and on the&#xD;
      surgical incidence of having an insufficient workspace. ( 2 independent variables, three&#xD;
      conditions)&#xD;
