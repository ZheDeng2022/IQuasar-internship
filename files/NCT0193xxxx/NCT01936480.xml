      I. Background and Significance A. Historical Background and Scientific Basis Background The&#xD;
      most common cause of withdrawal or restriction of drugs that are already on the market is&#xD;
      prolongation of the QT interval, and the consequent, potentially fatal, arrhythmia, torsade&#xD;
      de pointes1. First described in the 1960s with quinidine therapy2, torsade de pointes occurs&#xD;
      most commonly with antiarrhythmics3, although sudden cardiac death risk is increased 270%&#xD;
      with use of a non-cardiac QT-prolonging medication4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QT interval of the electrocardiogram reflects ventricular myocardial repolarization, and&#xD;
      abnormalities in the duration of the QT interval are the most common indicator of abnormal&#xD;
      repolarization. Although a number of hypotheses exist for how abnormal repolarization, and&#xD;
      specifically QT prolongation, results in ventricular arrhythmias, the most consistent finding&#xD;
      appears to be that during prolonged depolarization sodium channels recover from inactivation&#xD;
      and reactivate, causing what are termed early afterdepolarizations. When combined with&#xD;
      heterogeneity in repolarization as well, these early afterdepolarizations create a favorable&#xD;
      myocardial substrate for reentry, resulting in propagation of intramyocardial reentry waves&#xD;
      and torsade de pointes5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a cellular level, the ion channels most directly associated with repolarization are&#xD;
      potassium-conducting, and thus most medications and genes associated with QT prolongation&#xD;
      have effects on potassium currents. Specifically, blockade of the HERG/KCNH2 (IKr) ion&#xD;
      channel has been implicated in the majority of drug-induced QT prolongation6, although other&#xD;
      ion currents are involved in congenital long QT syndrome, including the IKs (KCNQ1 and&#xD;
      KCNE1), INa (SCN5A), and IK1 (KCNJ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden cardiac death as a result of QT interval prolongation and subsequent ventricular&#xD;
      arrhythmia (torsade de pointes) is a devastating adverse effect of many common medications7,&#xD;
      8. Drug-induced QT prolongation is the number one barrier for new therapeutic agents making&#xD;
      it to market. While a number of medications, environmental factors, and genetic factors have&#xD;
      been associated with QT prolongation, our ability to predict on an individual basis who will&#xD;
      develop QT prolongation, not to mention torsade de pointes, is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human genetics has provided an opportunity to change this paradigm by enabling the discovery&#xD;
      of individuals at risk for toxicity. The continuous QT interval is heritable9, with multiple&#xD;
      environmental and genetic contributors. We have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS)&#xD;
      to identify over 60 common polymorphisms that collectively explain more of QT interval than&#xD;
      all known clinical factors combined. However, our knowledge of the application of this&#xD;
      information to the patient level is incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A personalized genetic approach to toxicity prevention would be important because cardiotoxic&#xD;
      drug response is not specific to a single class of drugs; risk prediction for&#xD;
      arrhythmogenicity can be applied across medications used in a variety of conditions.&#xD;
      Narrowly, this research can enable drugs with currently marginal risk/benefit profiles to be&#xD;
      brought to market, sparing those at-risk and providing access to new therapies for those who&#xD;
      are not. From a public health perspective, it will reduce potentially fatal toxicity and thus&#xD;
      improve human health through identification of particular at-risk individuals. But more&#xD;
      broadly the application of human genetics requires rigorous definitions of association and&#xD;
      well-powered and -designed tests of pharmacogenetics before broad application can be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Previous Studies In a meta-analysis of three prospective cohorts--Cardiovascular Health&#xD;
      Study, the Framingham Heart Study, and the Rotterdam Study--in 13,685 white people of&#xD;
      European descent as part of the QTGEN consortium, Newton-Cheh and colleagues identified&#xD;
      common variant associations (p &lt; 5x10-8) at five loci previously associated with QT interval:&#xD;
      NOS1AP, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNH2, and SCN5A, as well as new associations in 5 other loci&#xD;
      previously unrecognized to influence myocardial repolarization10. At these 10 loci, 14&#xD;
      independent variants explained 5.4 - 6.5% of the variation of the QT interval, which was more&#xD;
      than is explained by sex or age, the strongest non-genetic clinical factors10. A QT genotype&#xD;
      score based on these variants was associated with a 9.7 - 12.4ms longer QTc in the top&#xD;
      quintile compared with the bottom quintile in the meta-analysis samples, which included&#xD;
      heterogeneous age, risk factor and drug exposure profiles10-12. These effects were consistent&#xD;
      in individuals of both European and African American ancestry. This QT score was&#xD;
      independently validated in a Finnish population sample in which complete medication&#xD;
      ascertainment enabled excluding those on QT-altering therapy, and in which the QT score was&#xD;
      associated with a 15.6ms QT interval difference between the top and bottom quintiles13. In&#xD;
      this analysis, the correlation of the measured effect estimates to those of the original&#xD;
      association study from which they were obtained was 0.99. The QT based on the genotype score&#xD;
      was a significant predictor of the actual QT interval measured (P &lt; 10-107). This study is&#xD;
      important for the current proposal because a) it demonstrates the consistency of genetic&#xD;
      effect estimates derived from meta-analysis of heterogeneous studies when applied to&#xD;
      independent samples and b) it confirms that excluding individuals with QT-altering drug&#xD;
      therapy can reduce the noise from non-genetic sources of QT variation and improve the genetic&#xD;
      signal and thereby increase power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin is well-suited to study drug-induced QT prolongation, as it is known to cause&#xD;
      transient and mild QT prolongation. Compared to placebo, 400mg of oral moxifloxacin is&#xD;
      associated with an approximately 10 msec increase in the heart rate-corrected QT interval14,&#xD;
      15. Despite this increase in QT interval, there is no reported increased risk of sudden death&#xD;
      with oral administration of a single dose of moxifloxacin16, so it is a safe and&#xD;
      well-validated drug to use in the study of cardiotoxic drug response in healthy human&#xD;
      subjects. Moreover, it has been widely used by the pharmaceutical industry as a positive&#xD;
      control as required by the FDA to demonstrate a sufficiently sensitive method to detect QT&#xD;
      prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have demonstrated QT interval prolongation to moxifloxacin in a pilot study of 20 subjects&#xD;
      recruited at Massachusetts General Hospital. Apparently healthy male and female volunteers&#xD;
      between 18 and 50 years old were eligible if they: were free of known cardiovascular, renal,&#xD;
      hepatic disease, had no personal or family history of sudden cardiac death, used no&#xD;
      prescribed or over-the-counter medications, had no bradycardia or QTc prolongation on&#xD;
      electrocardiography, and had a normal potassium and magnesium. Subjects received 400 mg of&#xD;
      oral moxifloxacin or placebo on different days at exactly 9AM in the morning (diurnal&#xD;
      variation in QT interval is well recognized17) in the fasting state (to avoid interference&#xD;
      with absorption) and had six ten-second electrocardiograms after a minimum of ten minutes of&#xD;
      rest, recorded every half hour for six hours. Mass spectrometric analysis of moxifloxacin&#xD;
      levels in plasma at 2 and 6 hours after administration closely matched prior reports18 with&#xD;
      tight ranges consistent with its known high bioavailability (2hr: 2.8 (SD 0.47) and 6hr 2.64&#xD;
      (SD 0.48) ng/μL). We observed a 12.3 msec increase in heart rate-adjusted QT interval&#xD;
      averaged over hours 2-6 compared to baseline after moxifloxacin exposure compared to placebo&#xD;
      exposure (ΔΔQTc = +12.3 msec, SD 8.3; Noseworthy, manuscript in preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Rationale of Proposed Benefit of Research Drug-induced QT prolongation is a significant&#xD;
      public health risk and a major barrier to drug development19-21. For example, cisapride, an&#xD;
      esophageal motility agent used for gastro-esophageal reflux, may have resulted in more than&#xD;
      80 deaths before it was pulled from the market22. In addition to identification of culprit&#xD;
      medications, there are also characteristics of the vulnerable patient, including female&#xD;
      sex23, bradycardia24, hypokalemia25, and genetic predisposition by rare mutations3, 6, 26,&#xD;
      that place certain individuals at higher risk of fatal arrhythmia. Identification of these&#xD;
      at-risk individuals with the use of genetic markers would represent a critical advance toward&#xD;
      safer pharmacotherapy7. The basis of this study is to expand the use of genetics beyond rare&#xD;
      family mutations that predispose to risk of QT prolongation to large-scale screening of the&#xD;
      general population by genotyping (assaying for specific variants) for relatively common&#xD;
      polymorphisms that could increase risk of QT prolongation, and subsequent torsade de pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Specific Aim We hypothesize that common genetic variants with intermediate effects on&#xD;
      resting QT, when examined in aggregate, can identify a subgroup of individuals at risk of&#xD;
      exaggerated prolongation of the QT interval in response to a QT-prolonging medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the ability of common genetic variants in aggregate to predict drug-induced QT&#xD;
      prolongation in healthy subjects. We will recruit 80 healthy volunteers drawn from the top&#xD;
      and bottom quintiles of a QT genotype score for assessment of QT response to moxifloxacin&#xD;
      compared to placebo at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Subject Selection A. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Through a separate protocol, Dr.&#xD;
      Newton-Cheh has recruited to date over 1000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 40 with consent for&#xD;
      re-contact on the basis of genotypes determined after an initial screening visit, all of whom&#xD;
      have undergone DNA extraction. From the existing collection of 1000 subjects, approximately&#xD;
      75% are self-described European/Caucasian and 8% are African Americans. These are otherwise&#xD;
      healthy individuals ages 18 and older. For this study, we will genotype 68 independent QT&#xD;
      SNPs using the Sequenom genotyping array in the MGH Center for Human Genetic Research&#xD;
      Sequenom core on these samples. The genotype score is the sum of the predicted effects on QT&#xD;
      interval for each genotype. For example, SNP rs12143842 is a C/T SNP; for each copy of the T&#xD;
      allele the QT interval is 3.50 msec higher such that individuals with the TT genotype have a&#xD;
      QT interval 7 msec higher than those with CC genotype and individuals with the CT genotype&#xD;
      have a QT interval 3.5 msec higher. These predicted effects are then determined for all 68&#xD;
      SNPs and summed to create a single number, the predicted change in QT interval on the basis&#xD;
      of those genetic variants. From the genotype score, we will determine the set of individuals&#xD;
      who belong to the top or bottom quintile of QT genotype risk score to be eligible for our&#xD;
      moxifloxacin study (see below for details of the genotype score calculation). Apparently&#xD;
      healthy male and female volunteers of European and African American ancestry, between 18 and&#xD;
      50 years old, will be eligible if they are free of known cardiovascular, renal, hepatic&#xD;
      disease, have no personal or family history of sudden cardiac death; use no prescribed or&#xD;
      over-the-counter medications as well as recreational drugs; have no bradycardia (defined as&#xD;
      resting heart rate &lt; 50 bpm), conduction disease (QRS &gt; 100ms) or QTc prolongation on&#xD;
      electrocardiography (QTc &gt; 500msec); and have a normal serum potassium (K&gt;3.3) and magnesium&#xD;
      (Mg&gt;1.8), as well as renal and liver function tests. We will exclude woman who are nursing,&#xD;
      pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period, counsel them on the&#xD;
      importance of using birth control during the study period, and check a serum HCG on the&#xD;
      screening visit. We estimate that 266 individuals (133 in the highest and lowest quintiles,&#xD;
      respectively) will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Subject Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Methods of Enrollment and Procedures for Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      See above for details of subject identification for enrollment. Eligible individuals will be&#xD;
      invited to come in for a screening visit for the moxifloxacin study with a target enrollment&#xD;
      of 40 in each genotype group. We plan to contact up to 266 individuals who are in the upper&#xD;
      and lower quintiles of QT genotype score to come in for the screening visit. We anticipate&#xD;
      inviting approximately 160 individuals for the screening visit, with a goal enrollment sample&#xD;
      size of 80 individuals. These subjects will be contacted by phone about participation in this&#xD;
      study, and then informed consent will be obtained on arrival for the screening visit, and&#xD;
      verified at subsequent visits if they are eligible for the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study Protocol A. Data Collection: Subjects will be brought to the MGH Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center for an initial screening visit in which eligibility criteria will be reviewed (with&#xD;
      exclusion/inclusion as applicable), and they will be given an ECG recording. Eligible&#xD;
      individuals for the study visits will be brought back later to the MGH Clinical Research&#xD;
      Center on two separate days separated by at least one week (to ensure washout). On each&#xD;
      visit, they will receive study drug (either 400 mg oral moxifloxacin or placebo) allocated by&#xD;
      double blinded block randomization (by sex and genotype group separately) at 10AM in the&#xD;
      fasting state (statistician will hold the randomization key; all other study personnel will&#xD;
      be blinded until study closure). Women will be screened for pregnancy using a urine HCG at&#xD;
      the time of both study visits. They will undergo 6 ECGs at time 0 and at 30 min intervals&#xD;
      thereafter, in the seated position after at least 15 min rest using fixed electrode placement&#xD;
      for a total of 6 hours following administration of study drug. At 2, 4 and 6 hours we will&#xD;
      draw a blood sample for plasma moxifloxacin determination by mass spectrometry. All ECGs are&#xD;
      uploaded to a research partition of the GE MUSE 7 ECG database of the Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital, and the 12 SL algorithm applied for interval measurement, as used in prior studies&#xD;
      by our group. We will monitor the QT every 30 minutes throughout the protocol and will&#xD;
      identify any subjects with marked QT prolongation. Any subject who has a QTc &gt;500 ms will be&#xD;
      kept in the HCRC for further observation, with the decision to either follow-up at the HCRC&#xD;
      every morning until it is less than 500ms or be admitted to the hospital for telemetry based&#xD;
      on the degree of prolongation and clinician's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Venipuncture: Venipuncture will be performed using standard techniques to obtain plasma&#xD;
      for quantification of moxifloxacin levels. We will collect 10 mL of blood at 2hrs, 4hr and&#xD;
      6hrs after study drug administration (Total 30mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Genotyping: Genotyping will be performed by the Sequenom genotyping array in the MGH&#xD;
      Center for Human Genetic Research Sequenom core on existing genomic DNA isolated in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Biostatistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      QT Genotype Score. We plan to use a modification of the QT genotype score that has been&#xD;
      previously established11, 12 and validated by us in a separate Finnish cohort13. The score is&#xD;
      constructed using allele copy number and effect estimates using the following formula (Table&#xD;
      1, next page):&#xD;
&#xD;
      QTscore = [(SNP1 allele copy number)*(SNP1 effect estimate in ms)] + [(SNP2 allele copy&#xD;
      number)*(SNP2 allele effect estimate in ms)] + … [(SNP68 allele copy number)*(SNP68 allele&#xD;
      effect estimate in ms)] From the genotype score, we will determine the set of individuals who&#xD;
      belong to the top or bottom quintile of QT genotype risk score (of whom, we expect 75% (n=133&#xD;
      per quintile)) to be eligible for our moxifloxacin study, based on our prior pilot work. We&#xD;
      will invite these individuals to come in for a screening visit (see above) for the&#xD;
      moxifloxacin study with a target enrollment of 40 in each genotype group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment. Any individual with sinus arrhythmia present in over 50% of ECGs during&#xD;
      the two study visits will be dropped from analysis. ECGs with premature ventricular or atrial&#xD;
      beats will be dropped from analysis (these are very uncommon in healthy volunteers). The QTc&#xD;
      using Fridericia's heart rate correction (QTc = QT/3√RR) will be taken as the average of all&#xD;
      eligible ECGs from each time point. The ΔQTc will be calculated as the difference in QTc from&#xD;
      baseline (after study drug/placebo administration) for each time point. From the ΔQTc, the&#xD;
      difference between the post-moxifloxacin and post-placebo ΔQTc will then be calculated at&#xD;
      each time point (ΔΔQTc) as well. The mean ΔΔQTc from the 180-300 minute time points (which&#xD;
      from our pilot work and published reports is expected to be 10 msec) will then be compared&#xD;
      between the two genotype groups (top and bottom and quintile) using an unpaired t-test. We&#xD;
      estimate that 40 people in each group will be needed to have adequate power to detect a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful (6.3 msec) difference in QT-prolongation between the two groups based&#xD;
      on our pilot data (Table 2). An increase of 6 msec after exposure to a drug compared to&#xD;
      placebo is the threshold at which the FDA raises concern for the potential of a drug to cause&#xD;
      torsade de pointes and is thus clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses. We plan to perform three secondary analyses. First, we will examine the&#xD;
      influence of single SNPs of stronger effect on QT response to moxifloxacin. As power&#xD;
      calculations, and study enrollment are based on the aggregated genotype score, we expect&#xD;
      these secondary analyses to be underpowered. Second, if we observe a significant difference&#xD;
      in QT response between top and bottom quintiles of QT genotype score, we will examine the&#xD;
      influence of deciles on observed results comparing the 9th (80-90%ile) and 10th deciles&#xD;
      (&gt;90%ile) of score to the bottom decile or quintile, although given the composite nature of&#xD;
      the genotype score and additive nature of the variants, we do not expect a threshold effect.&#xD;
      Lastly, we will determine the impact of baseline QTc on QT response and test whether&#xD;
      additional adjustment for baseline QTc alters any observed effect of genotype score on QT&#xD;
      response to moxifloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results. Successful completion of the primary analysis of Specific Aim 1 would&#xD;
      identify that individuals in the top quintile of QT genotype score demonstrate greater QT&#xD;
      prolongation in response to exposure to moxifloxacin than those in the bottom quintile. This&#xD;
      would have important implications for the use of genetic predictors in understanding and&#xD;
      management of drug-induced QT prolongation. For one, it would demonstrate in principle that a&#xD;
      simple genetic test is predictive of risk of drug-induced QT prolongation. Such an analysis&#xD;
      could be performed on patients prior to the use of currently approved QT-prolonging&#xD;
      medications. Second, it would demonstrate that genes associated with QT prolongation at&#xD;
      baseline are also associated with risk of drug-induced QT prolongation. This finding would&#xD;
      have implications at both a risk-predictive level, as above, but also in our physiological&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced QT prolongation.&#xD;
