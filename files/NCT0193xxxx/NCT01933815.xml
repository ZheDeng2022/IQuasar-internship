    <textblock>
      This trial is divided into two parts, a dose-escalation study (phase 1) and a randomized&#xD;
      study (phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the dose-escalation study (phase 1) is to determine the safety, maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), and efficacy of TPI 287 in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) in&#xD;
      subjects who have glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) that has progressed following prior radiation&#xD;
      therapy and temozolomide (TMZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the randomized study (phase 2) is to determine the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      phase 1 MTD of TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in subjects&#xD;
      who have GBM that has progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center trial is a phase 1/2 study that will be conducted in two sequential phases,&#xD;
      phase 1 and phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of the trial is a dose-escalation study of the safety, tolerability (MTD), and&#xD;
      efficacy of TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab in subjects who have GBM that has&#xD;
      progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will be administered TPI 287 as an intravenous (IV) infusion (target&#xD;
           duration of 1 hour) once every 3 weeks (Days 1 and 22 of a 42-day cycle) and bevacizumab&#xD;
           as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of the 42-day&#xD;
           cycle). The subsequent cycle will start 3 weeks after the last TPI 287 infusion and 2&#xD;
           weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion, maintaining the once every 3 week and once&#xD;
           every 2 week schedule, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose of TPI 287 will be escalated in sequential dose cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects,&#xD;
           while the dose of bevacizumab remains constant (10 mg/kg). The initial cohort of 3&#xD;
           subjects will be treated at a TPI 287 dose of 140 mg/m2. The next four dose levels will&#xD;
           be 150, 160, 170, and 180 mg/m2. Dose levels beyond 180 mg/m2 will be increased in&#xD;
           increments of 20 mg/m2 (i.e., 200, 220, 240 mg/m2, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a dose level is identified that exceeds the MTD, dose de-escalation will be used to&#xD;
           further refine the MTD. Specifically, 3 subjects will be treated at an intermediate dose&#xD;
           level, halfway between the dose level that exceeded the MTD and the dose level&#xD;
           immediately prior (e.g., 230 mg/m2, if 240 mg/m2 exceeded the MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be assigned to dose cohorts in the order that they are enrolled; there is&#xD;
           no randomization for phase 1. Approximately 20 to 32 subjects are planned for enrollment&#xD;
           in phase 1, depending on the dose level at which dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are&#xD;
           observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose modifications and delays will be required as described in the protocol. Subjects&#xD;
           may continue on treatment unless they meet one or more of the discontinuation criteria&#xD;
           outlined in the protocol. Subjects who are discontinued prior to completing Cycle 1 for&#xD;
           any reason other than toxicity will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
           Subjects will be given a diary to record any AEs or concomitant medications taken&#xD;
           between visits. Additional safety evaluations will include physical examination&#xD;
           (including neurologic examination), Karnofsky performance status (KPS), weight (body&#xD;
           surface area, BSA), vital signs, hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy evaluations will include magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, including both pre&#xD;
           and post-gadolinium T1-weighted scans and T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)&#xD;
           images], corticosteroid usage, and neurologic status (as measured by neurologic exam and&#xD;
           KPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the trial is a randomized study of the safety and efficacy of the phase 1 MTD of&#xD;
      TPI 287 in combination with bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in subjects who have GBM&#xD;
      that has progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TPI 287 in combination with&#xD;
           bevacizumab or bevacizumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the combination arm, the subjects will be administered TPI 287 as an IV infusion&#xD;
           (target duration of 1 hour) once every 3 weeks (Days 1 and 22 of a 42-day cycle) and&#xD;
           bevacizumab as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of&#xD;
           the 42-day cycle). The dose of TPI 287 will be the MTD determined in phase 1, and the&#xD;
           dose of bevacizumab will be the same as phase 1 (10 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects randomized to the bevacizumab alone arm will be administered 10 mg/kg&#xD;
           bevacizumab as a 30 to 90 minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks (Days 1, 15, and 29 of&#xD;
           the 42-day cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same dose modifications and delays required in phase 1 will apply to phase 2.&#xD;
           Subjects may continue on treatment unless they meet one or more of the discontinuation&#xD;
           criteria outlined in the protocol. There will be no subject replacement for phase 2 of&#xD;
           the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety and efficacy evaluations during phase 2 will be the same as those in phase 1.&#xD;
           In addition, subjects participating in phase 2 will be telephoned every two months&#xD;
           following the final study visit (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug) for up to&#xD;
           two years after randomization to follow survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects that participate in phase 1 of the trial will not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
           phase 2 of the trial.&#xD;
