  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that had recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme. The first part (phase Ib) was to investigate the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose/Recommended phase ll dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with&#xD;
      every-three-week carboplatin or buparlisib once daily in combination with every-six-week&#xD;
      lomustine (CCNU) using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established in either of the 2&#xD;
      arms, the corresponding phase II portion of the study was to start. Phase II was to assess&#xD;
      the treatment effect of buparlisib in combination with carboplatin in terms of Progression&#xD;
      Free Survival (PFS) and was to compare the treatment effect of buparlisib with lomustine&#xD;
      versus lomustine plus placebo in terms of PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary assessment for both combinations (buparlisib plus carboplatin or lomustine)&#xD;
      demonstrated that there was not enough antitumor activity compared to historical data with&#xD;
      single agent carboplatin or lomustine. Based on the overall safety profile, and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity observed in this study, Novartis decided that no additional patients&#xD;
      would be enrolled into this study. As a consequence, the Phase II part of the study was not&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (21 days carboplatin combination or 42 days lomustine combination )</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the highest BKM120 dosage that does not cause medically unacceptable Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in more than 35% of the treated patients during the first cycle of treatment. DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity occurring during the phase Ib cycle 1 and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria. The information will be integrated in a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control to estimate the MTD.</description>
