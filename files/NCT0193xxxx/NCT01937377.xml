  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this part of the Registry Program patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at&#xD;
      risk for stroke are enrolled to characterize the target population and to collect real world&#xD;
      data on important outcome events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For administrative purposes the study is divided into three protocol numbers: 1160.129 for&#xD;
      all non-EU (European Union) and non-EEA (European Economic Area) countries, 1160.136 for EU&#xD;
      and EEA countries and 1160.171 for Switzerland. The total number of patients enrolled in&#xD;
      three protocols is estimated to be 48,000 patients, and all these patients will be included&#xD;
      in the data analysis for study 1160.129.&#xD;
