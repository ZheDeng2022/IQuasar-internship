      The purpose is to use Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and&#xD;
      resting state functional MRI to examine tissue damage in the brains of people who have had a&#xD;
      concussion, both acute and 3 months after the accident. A secondary purpose is to examine&#xD;
      whether the results of the scans are associated with physical, cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      problems after concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that there will be a change in the diffusion signal measured with DKI in&#xD;
      the thalamus (THA) and with DTI in the corpus callosum (CC), in the acute stage and at&#xD;
      follow-up of the mTBI subjects compared with the healthy controls. Secondary it is expected&#xD;
      that there will be changes in the diffusion signal measured with DKI and DTI in other WM and&#xD;
      GM area in both the acute stage and at follow up with mTBI subjects compared with healthy&#xD;
      controls. Also rs-fMRI markers are secondary expected to differ in the two groups. Moreover&#xD;
      secondarily the MRI markers are tested for correlation with the severity of PCS acutely and&#xD;
      at follow up after mTBI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 25,000 people in Denmark, are each year diagnosed with commotio cerebri as a result&#xD;
      of head trauma (National Patient Registry, 1996), and foreign studies report that up to 5 to&#xD;
      15% of these have symptoms that persist beyond 3 months (5). Post commotio symptoms (PCS) are&#xD;
      typically divided into physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms and include headache,&#xD;
      fatigue, memory loss, stress, etc.. It is known from previous studies of traumatic brain&#xD;
      injuries that the cost of the disabling process and the failure to intervene in the long term&#xD;
      are very costly (11). In Denmark there are to date no systematic or consistent treatment for&#xD;
      people with persistent symptoms 3 months after commotio cerebri, and a lack of general&#xD;
      knowledge about the pathology and standardization with regard to diagnosis and prognosis are&#xD;
      also missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commotio cerebri, also known as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is often defined as an&#xD;
      exogenous traumatic stimulus that causes a physiological disruption of brain function&#xD;
      (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine). This includes a biochemical cascade, edema,&#xD;
      micro-haemorrhages, diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and changes in activity between internal&#xD;
      networks in the brain (12, 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In severe trauma, conventional scanning methods such as Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) can detect bone rupture, edema and micro-haemorrhages, but in mTBI,&#xD;
      it is often difficult to detect edema or micro-hemorrhages, and the conventional methods is&#xD;
      often not sensitive enough to show pathology especially beyond the acute period, although&#xD;
      patients continue to have physical symptoms as well as cognitive and emotional problems (6,&#xD;
      12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More MRI techniques, which are not routinely used in the clinic, has verified both DAI and&#xD;
      changes in cortical network as compared to healthy controls (12). One of these is the method&#xD;
      Diffusional tensor imaging (DTI) which can be used to detect the DAI in white matter (WM).&#xD;
      DTI studies confirm DAI in several WM areas after mTBI (12). Other studies have shown that&#xD;
      DAI detected by DTI in several places of WM correlates with cognitive problems after mTBI&#xD;
      (1,2,6,13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent and less studied MRI method is Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) which can&#xD;
      display DAI in WM and prove to be more sensitive than the DTI for the detection of damage in&#xD;
      gray matter (GM) (3, 4). A study in humans showed significant differences between individuals&#xD;
      with mTBI and healthy controls, in the thalamus and several WM areas (3). This study also&#xD;
      showed a correlation between DKI markers in the thalamus and the capsula interna with&#xD;
      cognitive problems in multiple domains after mTBI. DKI is therefore suggested to be used in&#xD;
      addition to DTI in relation to detect tissue damage in both WM and GM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another MRI method that has shown promising results in relation to mTBI is resting state&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI-rs). Rs-fMRI has shown differences between brain network connectivity in&#xD;
      mTBI patients compared to healthy controls (9). A study based on the theory Default Mode&#xD;
      Network (DMN) has also shown a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in a patient&#xD;
      classification in the subacute phase (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally more longitudinal studies, larger publications with more participants and consensus&#xD;
      on which areas that are associated with MRI verified pathology are still missing. Also the&#xD;
      correlations between MRI markers with the physical, cognitive and emotional problems are&#xD;
      still to be solved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the purpose to use three research based scan methods to detect tissue damage in the&#xD;
      brains of persons after concussion, both acute and 3 months after the accident. Moreover the&#xD;
      correlation between MRI makers and the registered physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms&#xD;
      after concussion are to be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that there will be a change in Mean Kurtosis in the thalamus, corpus&#xD;
      callosum and hippo campus from baseline to follow-up. Secondary we examine change in Mean&#xD;
      Diffusivity and Fractional Anisotropy in the thalamus, corpus callosum and hippo campus from&#xD;
      baseline to follow-up and for both DKI and DTI we examine the difference between the mTBI&#xD;
      subjects and healthy controls in the acute stage and at follow-up. Moreover we examine&#xD;
      correlation of MRI markers the severity of PCS acutely and at follow up. Finally rs-fMRI and&#xD;
      default mode network is expected to differ between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a controlled observational trial with follow up. 35 individuals with mTBI&#xD;
      and 35 matched healthy controls (age and sex) are examined. Persons with mTBI are scanned&#xD;
      within the first 14 days after mTBI and at follow-up 3 months after. Controls are scanned&#xD;
      only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scans will be performed on CE-approved MRI scanners at Aarhus University Hospital,&#xD;
      Noerrebrogade 44, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. A standard protocol for MRI will be used containing&#xD;
      a structural T1, a susceptibility weighted image (SWI) and T2 FLAIR sequence with the purpose&#xD;
      to visualize anatomy, micro hemorrhages and edema. It is expected that the findings from the&#xD;
      standard protocol will be present in the acute stage but only for some at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novelty of the current study is the use of a optimized and newly developed faster DKI&#xD;
      scan sequence, which makes it possible to use DKI in a clinical setup. In addition, to date&#xD;
      there has not been provided a follow-up at 3 months after mTBI with DKI (9 months Grossman&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both at baseline and at 3 months follow-up three questionnaires are to be filled out &quot;The&#xD;
      Rivermead postconcussion symptom questionnaire&quot;, &quot; The Symptom Checklist&quot; (SCL-8AD) and The&#xD;
      Brief Illness Perception questionnaire&quot; (BIPQ). Control Persons will also fill out these&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations of the upcoming study is based upon a previous studies by Grossman et.&#xD;
      al.(3) MK in THA at Baseline: 35 mTBI subjects (mean 0.74, sd 0.08), 35 healthy controls&#xD;
      (mean 0.89, sd 0.04), power = 100% MK in THA at Follow up: 25 mTBI (mean 0.78, sd 0.06), 25&#xD;
      healthy controls (mean 0.89, sd 0.12) power = 96% An ANOVA will be used to test the&#xD;
      difference in signal to the two times (&lt;14 days and 3 months after mTBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there will be made paired comparison between mTBI individuals. Both primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will showed in uncorrected and Bonferroni corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regions and parameters which show significant differences, will be compared with symptom&#xD;
      scores using Spearman rank correlation, controlled for age and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All project participants will review a checklist compared with contraindications for. There&#xD;
      is no evidence of harmful effects of MRI, if these precautions are followed. Additionally&#xD;
      subjects are provided with earplugs to protect from the noise from the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical scans will be seen by a neuroradiologist and if abnormality is suspected,&#xD;
      pictures will be evaluated further. If the abnormality is real the subject will get an&#xD;
      additional examine and appropriate guidance will be conducted by the involved&#xD;
      neuroradiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the images from the research part is not primarily used for clinical use, there will&#xD;
      not be made any clinical diagnostic evaluation from these brain scans and they are not&#xD;
      necessarily evaluated by a person with clinical radiological competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Ethics statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The techniques used are non-invasive and does not include methods like intravascular&#xD;
      catheters, injection of contrast agents or any medication. There is no radiation danger, and&#xD;
      the studies are not associated with significant side effects, risks or disadvantages for the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project involves only competent subjects participating voluntarily after adequate verbal&#xD;
      and written information and written consent. The participation may at any time leave the&#xD;
      study and the investigation without having to justify it. The study itself does not involve&#xD;
      treatment and if the subject withdraws his agreement, this does not affect his right to&#xD;
      present or future treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with concussions will be recruited from the Department of Radiology at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital. Controls are recruited in the recruitment system Sona Systems and by&#xD;
      posters with contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
