    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 700 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine&#xD;
      administered at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with and&#xD;
      without MF59 adjuvant and without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL&#xD;
      dose). Subjects will receive two doses via intramuscular injection, approximately 21 days&#xD;
      apart. Safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity data will be collected at standard time&#xD;
      points with safety follow-up to continue through one year post dose 2. The duration of the&#xD;
      study for each subject will be approximately 13 months.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blinded, controlled study in up to 700 males and&#xD;
      non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. The study is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur&#xD;
      administered to healthy adults at different dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)&#xD;
      given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics and without&#xD;
      adjuvant (15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose and 45 mcg of HA/0.75 mL dose). The A/H7N9 vaccine was&#xD;
      made with HA antigen derived from the influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 7 groups (up to 100 subjects per group) to receive two doses of the&#xD;
      A/H7N9 vaccine with and without MF59 adjuvant delivered intramuscularly approximately 21 days&#xD;
      apart. The same dosage of A/H7N9 vaccine will be given to subjects at both their first and&#xD;
      second study vaccinations. The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine following receipt of two doses&#xD;
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant; and 2) assess new-onset chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions following receipt of two doses of a monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine&#xD;
      administered with and without MF59 adjuvant. The duration of the study for each subject will&#xD;
      be approximately 13 months.&#xD;
