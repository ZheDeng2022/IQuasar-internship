  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 2, open-label randomized, multicenter trial to compare CC-486 in combination with&#xD;
      Abraxane administered weekly with respect to overall survival, objective tumor response rate&#xD;
      and Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in participants diagnosed with metastatic malignant&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (Baseline) Assessments: Performed within 21 days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: Subjects will be randomized within 21 days of starting their Baseline&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Therapy may continue in the absence of clinically significant disease&#xD;
           progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response Assessments: Subjects will be evaluated by investigators for CR, PR, stable or&#xD;
           progressive disease every 6 weeks from the start of treatment until progressive disease&#xD;
           is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders and subjects with stable disease (SD) should continue on study unless they develop&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, they start a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, physician&#xD;
      decision or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of Study (EOS)/Treatment Evaluation: At the time subjects are removed from study,&#xD;
           laboratory and clinical evaluations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up for Disease Progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Subjects who stop treatment prior to developing disease progression should be followed&#xD;
           without further treatment until progressive disease is documented or until the treating&#xD;
           physician feels additional treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up for Survival:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post study, subject survival status will be monitored on a monthly basis for 6&#xD;
                months from discontinuation from the study and every 3 months thereafter, until&#xD;
                death or study termination in all subjects.&#xD;
