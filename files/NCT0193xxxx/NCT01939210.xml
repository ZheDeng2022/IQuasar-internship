  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies the effects of meditation-based breathing&#xD;
      training on patients' control of their breathing patterns and breathing-related movement, as&#xD;
      well as on their psychological distress and treatment experience during radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Meditation-based breathing training may decrease breathing-related movement and the amount of&#xD;
      stress by improving breathing patterns in patients with abdominal or lung cancer undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the influence of regular breathing cycles using breathing relaxation&#xD;
      techniques on efficacy of the respiratory-gated treatment as measured by: (1) real-time&#xD;
      position management (RPM) parameters; (2) end inspiration or expiration length; (3) changes&#xD;
      in gate width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of breathing relaxation techniques on: (1) psychosocial outcomes;&#xD;
      (2) treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients and staff members complete structured interviews at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients participate in 3 50-minute breathing training sessions, including a&#xD;
      psycho-educational component and meditation-based breathing training, over 10 days. Patients&#xD;
      then undergo four dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) on day 14 and undergo image-guided&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for&#xD;
      up to 5 fractions or 25 fractions, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard care over 10 days. Patients then undergo 4D-CT on day 14&#xD;
      and undergo image-guided SBRT or standard radiation therapy 5 times a week for up to 5&#xD;
      fractions or 25 fractions, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 or 5 weeks.&#xD;
