    <textblock>
      The number of obese is increasing rapidly. Bariatric surgery is used to a greater and greater&#xD;
      extent as treatment of obesity to obtain a greater and more permanent weight loss. The&#xD;
      currently most commonly used surgical method is the gastric bypass (RYGB), which so far has&#xD;
      proved to be the most effective way to achieve a greater and more permanent weight loss,&#xD;
      reduction and maybe even elimination of many of the obesity-related health complication&#xD;
      (diabetes, sleep apnea, pain due to osteoarthrosis etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery, including RYGB is also associated with medical and nutritional&#xD;
      complications. This will be a natural consequence of the fact that the food bypasses&#xD;
      virtually the entire ventricle and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the small intestine after&#xD;
      a RYGB. Therefore, problems with uptake of for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin,&#xD;
      fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E and K) copper, zinc and selenium are expected. In the&#xD;
      light of this, it is decided that all RYGB operated patients must take vitamin B12, iron and&#xD;
      vitamin D substitution. In spite of this, many develop various nutritional problems after&#xD;
      RYGB. In addition to these nutritional complications are complications such as hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      and gallstone attacks after RYGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless there is no comprehensive inventory of the occurrence of nutritional&#xD;
      complications after bariatric surgery neither in Denmark nor in an international context.&#xD;
      Thus there is no consensus on an optimal postoperative prevention of complications. An&#xD;
      overview of the occurrence of these problems will be important for assessing and determine&#xD;
      the indications for bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To enlighten this we will conduct a questionnaire survey of complications such as pain,&#xD;
      dumping and hypoglycemia after RYGB. Moreover we will the quality of life after RYGB&#xD;
      operation. We will invite 3500 RYGB operated patients the Central Denmark Region who have&#xD;
      been operated 2006-2011.&#xD;

      Background Prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing both in Denmark and in most&#xD;
      other countries, and as conventional treatment of obesity with lifestyle changes (hypocaloric&#xD;
      diet, physical activity and behavior modification) rarely leads to large and sustained weight&#xD;
      loss, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery has taken over more and more of the&#xD;
      treatment of the most severe cases of obesity. Weight losses are greater than with other&#xD;
      treatments, and importantly the relatively large weight loss is permanent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive effects of gastric bypass The currently most commonly used surgical method is the&#xD;
      gastric bypass (RYGB), which has proven to be a highly effective method of achieving a great&#xD;
      and permanent weight loss with an approximately 30-40% reduction in the weight, which is&#xD;
      equivalent to 40-60% reduction of the overweight. Moreover RYGB has shown to provide complete&#xD;
      remission of prior type 2 diabetes in up to 80% of cases at short observation time (up to 2&#xD;
      years after surgery) and about 50% remission at longer time follow-up (&gt; 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover data suggest that after RYGB there is a reduced consumption of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs in 51 % and of lipid-lowering drugs in 59 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric complications after gastric bypass There are conflicting results in the&#xD;
      literature when examining the consumption of antidepressants. Some studies find a reduced&#xD;
      consumption of antidepressants after bariatric surgery within the first two years, others&#xD;
      show that consumption is almost unchanged overall and cohort follow-up studies show an&#xD;
      increased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is an increased incidence of suicide after bariatric surgery, which&#xD;
      argues against an unambiguous improvement in psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional complications after gastric bypass Bariatric surgery including RYGB is also&#xD;
      connected with some medical and nutritional effects or complications. This is not surprising&#xD;
      since RYGB &quot;bypasses&quot; virtually the entire ventricle and 100-150 cm of the upper part of the&#xD;
      small intestine, so problems with the inclusion of, for example B12, iron, folate, thiamin,&#xD;
      fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamin A, D, E and K) copper, zinc and selenium are expected.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is recommended that all RYGB operated patients substitute vitamin B12, iron and&#xD;
      vitamin D. Despite this many develop various nutritional problems after RYGB which in the&#xD;
      long term can result in irreversible neurological damage, osteoporosis and anemia. Such&#xD;
      complications are sparsely registered in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications are often developed long time after the operation, at a time when the&#xD;
      patients are no longer followed in specialized departments which report all complications to&#xD;
      the Danish Obesity Register, in the same way as surgical complications are reported. There is&#xD;
      no international consensus on postoperative vitamin substitution, which may be due to the&#xD;
      previous lack of evidence of nutritional complications. Other classic side effects are early&#xD;
      and late dumping, manifested by weakness after a meal or symptoms of moderate degrees of low&#xD;
      blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Frequent bowel movements are an expected result of a GYP, but for&#xD;
      some patients as much that they are hampered in their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical complications after gastric bypass&#xD;
&#xD;
      International studies have shown that mortality of bariatric surgery ranges between 0.24 and&#xD;
      2.77% depending on the operator and the hospital, and perioperative morbidity ranges between&#xD;
      6.92 and 8.85% also depending on the operator and the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover complications such as abdominal pain of varying degree and the development of&#xD;
      gallstones are frequently seen. Moreover complications such as abdominal pain of varying&#xD;
      degree and the development of gallstones are frequently seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still unresolved how extensive a problem these nutritional complications after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in Denmark are, we want to clarify the occurrence of these complications in&#xD;
      Denmark. This will provide an overview of the positive as well as the negative impact of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and thus will be decisive to assess and determine the indications for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery as well as to optimize the prevention of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project will be made a questionnaire survey where all GYP patients in the Central&#xD;
      Denmark Region in the period 2006 - 2011 (about 3500 people) will receive an invitation to&#xD;
      participate. This part includes thus measurement of self-reported complications that would&#xD;
      otherwise not be detected through other registers or records, and measurement of quality of&#xD;
      life after GYP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe serious complications (readmissions, reoperations etc) related to&#xD;
           complications after GYP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate incidence (prevalence) of the most common nutritional complications after&#xD;
           GYP in Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate incidence (prevalence) of neurological complications after GYP in Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the quality of life in patients who have undergone GYP including improvement&#xD;
           of disease (e.g. diabetes, sleep apnea, joint pain) after GYP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators wish to achieve a better documentation of both the positive effects&#xD;
      after GYP (weight loss, remission of diabetes, quality of life, etc.) and the negative health&#xD;
      effects (mortality, surgical and nutritional) in order to provide a better founded approach&#xD;
      to this form of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method From the Central Denmark Region, the investigators will obtain social security numbers&#xD;
      of all gastric bypass operated persons in the Central Denmark Region (approximately 3500&#xD;
      patients). From the State Serum Institute will be obtained information on their address from&#xD;
      the social security number and they will be invited by letter to participate in the survey.&#xD;
      The letter will contain a numbered questionnaire hence the answer is anonymous. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will include questions relating to weight loss, surgical complications,&#xD;
      possible remission of diabetes, substitution treatment, nutritional complications,&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, quality of life (SF-12), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the questionnaires will be entered electronically and we will conduct statistical&#xD;
      analysis based on the patients' responses. Prior to the publication of the questionnaires&#xD;
      will be conducted a pilot project with a small group of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and power calculation In the questionnaire survey the&#xD;
      investigators expect a cohort of approximately 3500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here is performed an overall statement of self-reported complications, quality of life and&#xD;
      symptoms of dumping partially based on validated scales and partly from questionnaire&#xD;
      designed specifically for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages In the questionnaire survey, participation neither is&#xD;
      associated with risks, side effects or disadvantages apart from a small time consumption&#xD;
      associated with completing the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respect for the subjects' physical and mental integrity The project is reported to the&#xD;
      region's joint notification to the Danish Dataprotection Agency. We hereby declare that the&#xD;
      project is carried out in accordance with the protocol and applicable regulatory /&#xD;
      legislative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Act on Processing of Personal Data will be respected. The study will also be reported to&#xD;
      the Clinical Trials and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results Both positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published and&#xD;
      sought to be published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals as original publications&#xD;
      and with the PhD student as first author.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The investigators expect to identify positive and negative consequences for GYP&#xD;
      and thus optimize the basis on which patients and physicians in the future will be able to&#xD;
      decide on surgery. This will also better prevention of complications and thus save patients&#xD;
      and communities of loss, economic as well as social and personal. The project will hopefully&#xD;
      form the basis for the continuation of longer follow-up studies. Moreover, the results set&#xD;
      the stage for the development of new more &quot;gentle&quot; obesity surgery.&#xD;
