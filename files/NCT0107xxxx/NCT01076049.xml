  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether Irrisept can effectively prevent the&#xD;
      progression of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) as compared to treatment by the&#xD;
      current Standard of Care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the trial and potential risks, subjects completed an informed&#xD;
      consent form prior to participation. After eligibility criteria was verified, an initial&#xD;
      wound assessment examination was performed. Subjects were then randomized to the Irrisept or&#xD;
      Standard of Care treatment group. Forty-eight hours later, wound progression and signs of&#xD;
      infection were assessed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound State at 48-Hour Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was overall wound progression and signs of infection 48 hours post-treatment. This was measured via a blinded investigator's discretion and recorded as 'improved', 'no change', 'progression of signs or symptoms of infection', or 'immediate treatment required' if an infection had progressed to a certain extent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Performance of Irrisept to the Current SoC</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The study tracked any instance of a subject's conditions worsening compared to their baseline measurements. This included a worsening in the size (length and width) and clinical signs (erythema, area, induration, tenderness, warm, pain, cellulitis and other) of the infection.&#xD;
While the protocol states the overall prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) colonization is the secondary objective, this information was not collected by the site. Therefore, worsening of clinical outcomes is considered the secondary objective.</description>

    <description>Irrisept is a manual, self-contained irrigation device capable of producing 7-8 psi of pressure for effective wound cleansing and irrigation. Irrisept contents include the Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) solution, a 450 mL bottle, and Irriprobe applicator or an abscess irrigation tip. The bottle design allows users to control the pressure of the solution through manual bottle compression.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>From January 2010 to December 2011, patients with skin and soft tissue infections were recruited from the Tampa General Hospital, University of South Florida emergency department.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 114 subjects consented to the study. Of these, 107 subjects were randomized as six (6) failed screening and one (1) subject had no randomization information available, but still completed the study. In total, 98 subjects completed the study. Of those 98 subjects, 52 subjects were enrolled in the Irrisept arm and 45 subjects were enrolled in the SoC control arm. There are records of an additional subject completing the study, but no randomization information was available.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The primary endpoint was overall wound progression and signs of infection 48 hours post-treatment.

Standard of Care (SoC): The preferred irrigation solution and method was chosen by the site's emergency department physician(s) and could vary between subjects.

Irrisept Delivery System: Irrisept is a manual, self-contained irrigation device capable of producing 7-8 psi of pressure for effective wound cleansing and irrigation. Irrisept contents include the Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) solution, a 450 mL bottle, and Irriprobe applicator or an abscess irrigation tip. The bottle design allows users to control the pressure of the solution through manual bottle compression.&#xD;

Irrisept is a manual, self-contained irrigation device capable of producing 7-8 psi of pressure for effective wound cleansing and irrigation. Irrisept contents include the Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) solution, a 450 mL bottle, and Irriprobe applicator or an abscess irrigation tip. The bottle design allows users to control the pressure of the solution through manual bottle compression.</description>
