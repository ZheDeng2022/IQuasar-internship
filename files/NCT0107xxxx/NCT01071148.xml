      The primary objective of this observational study is to assess the cumulative rate of ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy at 10 ±2 weeks after hCG administration in a new series of IVF-treatment cycles in&#xD;
      a total of 176 subjects, who have undergone three or more previous IVF-treatment cycles&#xD;
      without live birth. Secondary objectives include subgroup analysis on the effect of age on&#xD;
      the likelihood of pregnancy at 10 ±2 weeks after hCG administration in a new series of&#xD;
      IVF-treatment cycles in patients &lt; 35 years and ≥ 35 years, who have undergone three or more&#xD;
      previous IVF-treatment cycles without live birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained from this trial will be helpful for subjects who are considering&#xD;
      further IVF treatments and for IVF centres, as well as for the formulation of governmental&#xD;
      policies regarding healthcare reimbursement in Norway.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since IVF processes were established in 1978, there has been a dramatic increase in the&#xD;
      numbers of IVF treatment cycles performed worldwide. In 2003, the total numbers of reported&#xD;
      IVF cycles were 132,932 from 725 clinics in 28 European countries, 7,535 IVF/intra&#xD;
      cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles from 24 centres in Canada, and over 100,000 IVF&#xD;
      cycles from 399 centres in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of all the assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures available, IVF leads to the&#xD;
      highest pregnancy rate per cycle. The degree to which governments reimburse subjects for IVF&#xD;
      treatment varies widely among countries in Europe and North America. In Norway, infertile&#xD;
      subjects are offered a maximum of three IVF-cycles reimbursed by the government. If three&#xD;
      cycles are unsuccessful, subjects must pay for further treatments. This policy might lead&#xD;
      subjects to believe that the probability of achieving pregnancy after four or more cycles is&#xD;
      very low and, therefore, not worth the cost or effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a number of published studies show evidence of successful outcomes for additional&#xD;
      IVF-cycles after three (or more) cycles with negative results. Many studies show only a&#xD;
      modest decline of success with repeated IVF cycles. In addition, a preliminary retrospective&#xD;
      analysis of the clinical pregnancy rate in subjects treated at the trial centre during 2007&#xD;
      showed that subjects, who underwent additional one to three IVF-treatment cycles, had a&#xD;
      cumulative success rate of 52% (based on clinical experience from 62 subjects at the Hausken&#xD;
      clinic in 2007). Thus, these studies indicate that there is a reasonable chance of achieving&#xD;
      a healthy pregnancy and live birth after three previous IVF-treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, age is likely to be a more important factor than the number of previous IVF&#xD;
      treatment failures in determining a successful outcome. Several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that older women have lower rates of conception and live births, and higher rates of&#xD;
      pregnancy failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subfertility and infertility by ART such as IVF and embryo transfer (ET)&#xD;
      requires multiple follicular development to increase the number of female gametes, and the&#xD;
      chances of a successful treatment outcome. Ovarian stimulation in IVF/ICSI currently includes&#xD;
      suppression of endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) secretion by administration of a&#xD;
      gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue, followed by stimulation of multiple&#xD;
      follicular development by exogenous follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) administration. When&#xD;
      adequate follicular development is achieved, a single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
      (hCG) or LH is administered to mimic the endogenous LH surge and induce oocyte maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 176 subjects who had previously undergone three or more IVF-treatment cycles that&#xD;
      did not result in live birth will undergo a new series of IVF-treatment cycles using Gonal-f&#xD;
      or Pergoveris or Gonal-f and Luveris. Subjects both &lt; 35 years and ≥ 35 years will be&#xD;
      included. Subgroup analysis will take into account the effect of age on the likelihood of&#xD;
      success after repeated cycles of IVF. The investigators will systematically follow-up these&#xD;
      subjects to observe their cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period (≤-4months) during which the following trial&#xD;
      assessments will be made: demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, clinical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, number of antral follicles and a subject diary will be handed out&#xD;
      to the subjects. Between screening and the beginning of treatment, there will an optional&#xD;
      telephone consultation during which any screening information or changes in concomitant&#xD;
      medications will be updated. Down-regulation treatment will start within 3 months following&#xD;
      the screening visit during the pre treatment period with GnRH daily agonist or antagonist&#xD;
      commercially available in Norway, for pituitary gonadotrope cell desensitisation. FSH&#xD;
      treatment will begin by administering either Gonal-f or Pergoveris or Gonal-f and Luveris&#xD;
      after at least 2 weeks of GnRH agonist down-regulation. If a GnRH antagonist protocol is&#xD;
      used, FSH injections will start on Day 2 of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular development will be monitored according to the centre's standard practice by&#xD;
      ultrasound and/or estradiol (E2) levels, until the protocol hCG requirement is met (i.e. at&#xD;
      least 1 follicle ≥18 mm and 2 follicles ≥16 mm) at which time the subject will receive hCG&#xD;
      (Day 0), according to the routine practice of the centre, in order to induce final oocyte&#xD;
      maturation. Ovum Pick Up (Day 2), IVF, ET (Day 4-7) and luteal phase support will be&#xD;
      performed as per the centre's standard practice. During the treatment period several&#xD;
      assessments will be made and any adverse events (AEs) observed during the trial will be&#xD;
      recorded. A urine pregnancy test will be performed 16 days post hCG administration. In case&#xD;
      of negative urine pregnancy test, the subject will be assessed for the post-treatment safety&#xD;
      follow-up and the cycle will be considered as 'completed'. The post-treatment safety&#xD;
      follow-up can take place simultaneously with the next cycle's screenings visit. If subject&#xD;
      drops out, the early termination visit will replace the post-treatment safety follow-up. If&#xD;
      the urine pregnancy test is positive, clinical and later ongoing pregnancy will be&#xD;
      subsequently confirmed by ultrasound scan according to the centre's routine practice. At this&#xD;
      last visit, all subjects will be assessed for the post-treatment safety follow-up and will be&#xD;
      considered 'completed'. Pregnancy outcome in pregnant subjects will be optionally followed up&#xD;
      until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed if spontaneously reported&#xD;
      by the subjects at all study visits: during an optional telephone consultation between&#xD;
      screening and the beginning of treatment, ultrasound scan (Day -7-0), OPU (Day 2), telephone&#xD;
      consultation (Day 3), embryo transfer (Day 4-7), telephone consultation (Day 16), scan week&#xD;
      12 (assessed 10 weeks after hCG administration), post-treatment safety follow-up, 1-Year&#xD;
      follow-up, and at early termination (if applicable).&#xD;
