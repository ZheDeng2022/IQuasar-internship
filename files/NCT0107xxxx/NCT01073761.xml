  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications darunavir,&#xD;
      ritonavir and atazanavir in the blood after the drug intake has been stopped in order to&#xD;
      understand how long these drugs persist in blood for. The study will specifically look at&#xD;
      these three drugs blood levels after taking them for 10 days everyday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to provide information on the potential safety (in terms of preventing&#xD;
      virological failure and the development of resistance)of delaying drug doses occasionally by&#xD;
      providing information on the decline in drug concentration after dosing has stopped.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term use of and success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is constrained by many&#xD;
      factors including poor adherence and drug intolerance. Poor adherence (missing ART doses) may&#xD;
      lead to the achievement of sub therapeutic drug plasma concentrations and virological&#xD;
      failure. This could also be complicated by the development of resistance to ART which&#xD;
      compromises future therapeutic options because of cross resistance within antiretroviral drug&#xD;
      classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In medicine, successful adherence is supposed to mean taking at least 80% of doses. This is a&#xD;
      concept, which has been inherited from the antihypertensive literature and anti-infective&#xD;
      prescribing for therapeutic areas which from that of HIV prescribing in fundamental&#xD;
      principles. The current absence of a curative therapy for HIV infection, means that in order&#xD;
      to be effective, suppressive therapies need to be taken on an indefinite lifelong basis. The&#xD;
      capacity for development of resistance of the virus means that successful adherence equates&#xD;
      to a much higher rate of adherence than 80%. Moreover, in HIV therapy, successful adherence&#xD;
      also means attention to a maximum interval between doses as well as dietary restriction at&#xD;
      the time of dose intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, to guarantee long-term virological response, HIV-infected patients should take their&#xD;
      ART every day at the same time. However, ART is for life and doses can be forgotten or&#xD;
      delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent survey confirmed the reasons why people miss their antiretroviral doses: they&#xD;
      forget, they fall asleep, they are too busy, they are depressed, they are away from home, and&#xD;
      their medicines make them sick (Mascolini www.thebody.com 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug persistence (the presence of drug at a detectable level high enough to work) in plasma&#xD;
      mainly depends on the half-life. Long half-life antiretroviral agents may allow for forgotten&#xD;
      doses, if they are able to delay the decline of the drug level to sub-therapeutic&#xD;
      concentrations for long enough for the patient to remember to take the drug. Boosted PI are&#xD;
      characterized by different half lives, and therefore different abilities to persist in&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, data on drug persistence in plasma are limited and whether drug doses can be&#xD;
      forgotten and dosing delayed is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main objective of this study is to provide information on the potential safety&#xD;
      (in terms of preventing virological failure and the development of resistance) of delaying&#xD;
      drug doses occasionally by providing information on the decline in drug concentration after&#xD;
      dosing has stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for pharmacogenomic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetics holds promise in HIV treatment because of the complexity and potential&#xD;
      toxicity of multi antiretroviral drug therapies that are prescribed for long periods. Thus&#xD;
      far, few candidate genes have been examined for a limited number of allelic variants, but a&#xD;
      number of confirmed associations have already emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a public health perspective, as antiretroviral medications become increasingly available&#xD;
      to racially and ethnically diverse populations worldwide, understanding the genetic&#xD;
      structures of each population may allow us to anticipate the impact of adverse responses,&#xD;
      even in groups that were not represented in drug registration trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing literature on pharmacogenetic determinants of antiretroviral drug exposure, drug&#xD;
      toxicity, as well as genetic markers associated with the rate of disease progression&#xD;
      underline the recent advances which occurred in the past few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is expected that larger-scale comprehensive genome approaches will profoundly&#xD;
      change the landscape of knowledge in the future. Additional studies are needed to assess the&#xD;
      implications for long-term responses to antiretroviral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason we plan to collect a single blood sample from each participant in our&#xD;
      intensive pharmacokinetic studies, such as this one, in order to be able to investigate the&#xD;
      association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes (such as those encoding&#xD;
      for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes or transmembrane transporters) and drug exposure. A candidate&#xD;
      gene approach will be utilised to examine loci of interest. This procedure will provide&#xD;
      potentially important information on genetic influences on plasma drug concentrations and&#xD;
      give insight into how to improve the management of HIV-infected patients by individualising&#xD;
      therapy. These studies will not be powered for genetic associations but will enable us to&#xD;
      build a data base of genotype-phenotype associations. Prospective genetic studies would need&#xD;
      to be planned based on these preliminary data.&#xD;
