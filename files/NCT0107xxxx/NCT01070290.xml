      This will be a multi-center, open-label randomized phase 2 study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced gastric cancer following treatment&#xD;
      with either ARQ 197 or one of three standard regimens (investigator's choice). Patients with&#xD;
      unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) gastric carcinoma who have progressive&#xD;
      neoplastic disease following treatment with a prior regimen consisting of at least two of the&#xD;
      drugs 5-FU, cisplatin and docetaxel. The study will also evaluate other efficacy and safety&#xD;
      parameters including overall response rate, overall survival and adverse events in the two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;

      This will be a multi-center, open-label randomized phase 2 study designed to evaluate the PFS&#xD;
      of ARQ 197 versus investigator's choice of second-line chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) gastric carcinoma who have progressive&#xD;
      neoplastic disease following treatment with a prior regimen consisting of at least two of the&#xD;
      drugs 5-FU, cisplatin and docetaxel. Patients will be randomized to ARQ 197 arm or&#xD;
      investigator's choice arm in a 1:1 ratio. The study will also evaluate other efficacy and&#xD;
      safety parameters including ORR, OS and adverse events in the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the investigator's choice arm may receive any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 i.v. every two weeks (each cycle = 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 p.o. twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days of no therapy&#xD;
           every 3 weeks (each cycle = 3 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 i.v. weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of no therapy every 6&#xD;
           weeks (each cycle = 6 weeks) Treatment will continue unless one of the treatment&#xD;
           discontinuation criteria is met. Dose reductions should occur based on the current&#xD;
           labels for each of the investigator choice agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomly assigned to the ARQ arm will receive 120 mg of ARQ 197 twice daily (240&#xD;
      mg/day) throughout the treatment period. The treatment of ARQ 197 can be continued until&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, documented progression of disease, or another discontinuation&#xD;
      criterion is met. A cycle of ARQ 197 treatment will be defined as 21 days and cycles may be&#xD;
      repeated every 3 weeks (21 days) based on toxicity and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assigned treatment should continue until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression&#xD;
      (clinical or radiological) or another discontinuation criterion is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor evaluations: Tumor evaluations will be performed at 6-week or 8-week intervals. Tumor&#xD;
      response will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival: The time of disease progression-free will be calculated from date&#xD;
      of randomization until disease progression per RECIST or death due to any cause. Patients who&#xD;
      are alive and progression free will be censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall response rate: The ORR will be calculated for the intent to treat patient population&#xD;
      as the number of patients with a confirmed complete response or partial response divided by&#xD;
      the number of randomized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival: Overall survival time will be calculated from the date of randomization&#xD;
      until death due to any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments: Data on vital signs, physical examination, adverse events, serum&#xD;
      chemistry, hematological laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data for irinotecan, it is estimated that the median PFS in the second-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy arm will be 4 months. In order to demonstrate an improvement in median PFS to&#xD;
      5.5 months (37.5% improvement, hazard ratio of 0.73) based on a two-sided log rang test, 338&#xD;
      patients (169 per arm) will be required, assuming an 18 month enrollment and a 12 month&#xD;
      follow-up, an alpha of 0.05 and 90% power. The sample size assumes a 10% loss to follow-up&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A futility analysis will be performed when 33% of the events required for the final analysis&#xD;
      have occurred by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The futility boundary will be&#xD;
      described in the full statistical analysis plan for the study.&#xD;
