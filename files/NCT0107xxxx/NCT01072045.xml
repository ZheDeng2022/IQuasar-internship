      Infantile Hemangioma (IH) is infancy's most common vascular tumor of infancy and most&#xD;
      frequent benign neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of IHs is indicated for approximately 10 to 20% of the cases. Two groups can be&#xD;
      defined amongst indications for treatment: patients with absolute indication for treatment&#xD;
      and patients with relative indication for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute or emergency indications comprise function or life threatening situations such as&#xD;
      obstruction of airways, obstruction of vision, congestive heart failure, hepatic and&#xD;
      coagulation problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are considered relative indications: cases of large and disfiguring facial&#xD;
      hemangiomas; locations that can result in a deformity and/ or permanent scar (nose, ear, lip,&#xD;
      glabellar area); extensive face hemangiomas, mainly when there is dermal damage (more&#xD;
      probable to scar); local complications such as ulceration, infection and bleeding as well as&#xD;
      small hemangiomas in exposed areas (hands and face), mainly if pedunculated due to its ease&#xD;
      of excision2,7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modalities vary according to the extension, location, presence of complications and&#xD;
      the evolutional phase. A combination of various treatments is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta blockers are being used in children for approximately 40 years, with proven clinical&#xD;
      safety and no cases of death or cardiovascular disease resulting from its direct use.&#xD;
      Recently it was reported the use of beta blockers (propanolol) for IH treatment, with&#xD;
      significant reduction of tumor volume after introduction of the beta blocker, in a short&#xD;
      period of time, with stable results after the end of treatment, which suggested evidences of&#xD;
      the benefits of this drug in the tumor treatment The proposal of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      use of propanolol in IH treatment, quantifying its effectiveness and safety under continuous&#xD;
      monitoring and comparing it to the use of oral corticosteroid. The investigators propose the&#xD;
      assessment of the betablockers' use in comparison to the use of corticosteroids in infants&#xD;
      with IH in the proliferative or involuting phases, with indication for clinical treatment,&#xD;
      and that are not alarming nor urgent; in other words, the current relative indications for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Introduction Infantile Hemangioma (IH) is infancy's most common vascular tumor of&#xD;
           infancy and most frequent benign neoplasm. In 1996 the &quot;International Society for the&#xD;
           Study of Vascular Anomalies&quot; has defined the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
           of vascular anomalies. Hemangioma is one of the many vascular tumors that were&#xD;
           classified. Clinically, it presents well defined characteristics and a natural history&#xD;
           divided into three phases. The proliferative phase represents an initial growth phase&#xD;
           through hyperplasia and hypertrophy, followed by a spontaneous regression phase called&#xD;
           the involuting phase. The involuted phase represents a final phase with no more&#xD;
           biological activity; however, it doesn't necessarily corresponds to the complete tumor&#xD;
           disappearance once there is a replacement by fibro-fatty tissue. IH affects one in every&#xD;
           10 to 20 Caucasian infants.There is a predilection for females at a 3:1 to 5:1&#xD;
           proportion, a higher incidence in premature infants, in newborns with low birth weight,&#xD;
           in those whose pregnancy presented placentary anomalies and in neonates from mothers&#xD;
           with multiple pregnancies. Fifty to sixty percent of IH affect the head and neck area.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the proliferative phase the tumor may reach considerable dimensions and depending on&#xD;
           its location and proximity to vital structures, it may result in the obstruction or&#xD;
           invasion of organs. This would cause a functional problem and even impose a threat to&#xD;
           infant's life. There is a variable incidence of local complications such as necrosis,&#xD;
           repetitive ulcerations, bleeding and infections, apart from systemic complications such&#xD;
           as coagulopathy and high output cardiac failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After involution, IHs may leave scars or contour deformities resulting in deformities&#xD;
           and eventual psychological damage. Treatment of IHs is indicated for approximately 10 to&#xD;
           20% of the cases. Two groups can be defined amongst indications for treatment: patients&#xD;
           with absolute indication and patients with relative indication for treatment. Absolute&#xD;
           or emergency indications comprise function or life threatening situations such as&#xD;
           obstruction of airways, obstruction of vision, congestive heart failure, hepatic and&#xD;
           coagulation problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following are considered relative indications: cases of large and disfiguring facial&#xD;
           hemangiomas; locations that can result in a deformity and/ or permanent scar (nose, ear,&#xD;
           lip, glabellar area); extensive face hemangiomas, mainly when there is dermal damage&#xD;
           (more probable to scar); local complications such as ulceration, infection and bleeding&#xD;
           as well as small hemangiomas in exposed areas (hands and face), mainly if pedunculated&#xD;
           due to its ease of excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment modalities vary according to the extension, location, presence of&#xD;
           complications and the evolutional phase. A combination of various treatments is&#xD;
           possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In cases of relative indication, surgical treatment is mostly indicated for lesions in&#xD;
           growing areas with disfiguring potential. For the other cases, pharmacological therapy&#xD;
           is being the routine. The mostly used option is prednisone, a systemic corticosteroid&#xD;
           administered orally. The therapeutic response to corticosteroids is variable and its&#xD;
           effectiveness rates fluctuate between 30 to 84%. Clearly effective responses or just a&#xD;
           reduction in the lesion's growth rate are possible. The effective response, when&#xD;
           observed, occurs on average a week after the beginning of use of medication. Side&#xD;
           effects are frequent, being the most common the cushingoid appearance, alterations of&#xD;
           personality, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, decrease in growth speed and head&#xD;
           circumference and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For cases with no response to the corticosteroid, the most frequently used drug as a&#xD;
           second treatment line is subcutaneous alpha-interferon 2b. In spite of being very&#xD;
           effective, this medication presents a higher rate of side effects, being spastic&#xD;
           diplegia the most fearsome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other drugs are being used, such as chemotherapeutic drugs and immunomodulators.&#xD;
           However, published studies cover small casuistics, with no great population studies or&#xD;
           long term follow up to justify its routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently, Léauté-Labrèze et al. reported the use of beta blockers (propanolol) for IH&#xD;
           treatment. The casual finding of a significant reduction in hemangiomas volume was&#xD;
           observed when this drug was used as an antihypertensive for the treatment of side&#xD;
           effects resulting from the use of systemic corticoids in the treatment of infantile&#xD;
           hemangioma. A significant reduction of tumor volume was observed after introduction of&#xD;
           the beta blocker, in a short period of time, with stable results after the end of&#xD;
           treatment, which suggested evidences of the benefits of this drug in the tumor&#xD;
           treatment. Other authors also reported the successful use of the medication. Recent&#xD;
           initial studies show the effectiveness of the isolated use of propanolol, suggesting the&#xD;
           presence of specific action mechanisms for this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beta blockers are being used in children for approximately 40 years, with proven&#xD;
           clinical safety and no cases of death or cardiovascular disease resulting from its&#xD;
           direct use. Side effects are already well established, such as bradycardia and&#xD;
           transitory hypotension, requiring monitoring from the beginning of treatment. Besides,&#xD;
           beta blockers reduce lipolysis, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, predisposing to&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia. It has to be used with special attention in neonates, who can present&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia without medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Beta blockers, and more precisely propanolol, appear as one more therapeutic option with&#xD;
           apparent good results. So far in literature there are just some case reports and initial&#xD;
           protocols about the use of this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lesions located on the cervicofacial region with relative indication for treatment are&#xD;
           more susceptible to visual exposure, causing discomfort to the patient and family, apart&#xD;
           from the possibility of distortion of growing anatomical structures which will&#xD;
           eventually evolve into deformities. The best management for these cases is debatable: on&#xD;
           one hand the possibility of pharmacological treatment with corticosteroids with a&#xD;
           variable success rate and significant side effects; on the other hand the conservative/&#xD;
           expectant treatment, in other words, waiting for evolution, expecting a complete&#xD;
           spontaneous regression. Therefore, a drug with known reduced side effects could be a&#xD;
           good alternative of treatment, accelerating tumor involution and allowing a quick&#xD;
           problem solution in comparison to the expecting conduct and to the conventional&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this context, the proposal is to assess the use of propanolol in IH treatment,&#xD;
           quantifying its effectiveness and safety under continuous monitoring and comparing it to&#xD;
           the use of oral corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present study we propose the assessment of the betablockers' use in comparison to&#xD;
           the use of corticosteroids in infants with IH in the proliferative or involuting phases,&#xD;
           with indication for clinical treatment, and that are not alarming nor urgent; in other&#xD;
           words, the current relative indications for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The absence of effective response after the initial 60-day period is going to be considered&#xD;
      as treatment failure; Group A patients' medication (propanolol) is going to be suspended and&#xD;
      Group B (prednisone) patients are going to begin a progressive dose reduction regimen until&#xD;
      the suspension of the medication.&#xD;
