  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High variability of blood sugar levels and high incidence of night-time hypoglycaemia (low&#xD;
      blood sugar) in young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) make achieving the treatment goals in&#xD;
      this population extremely challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ongoing research focuses on the development of a closed-loop glucose control in children&#xD;
      and adolescents with T1D. The three components of the closed-loop system are a continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a computer-based algorithm. The studies performed thus&#xD;
      far evaluated the efficacy and safety of overnight closed-loop glucose control. The results&#xD;
      showed that overnight closed-loop improved control of blood glucose and prevented nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, as compared to the conventional insulin pump therapy. The next objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of closed-loop insulin delivery over a prolonged time&#xD;
      period, including the daytime, when normal living activities occur. This will pave the way&#xD;
      for a more comprehensive use of closed loop systems to control glucose levels in T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study adopts an open-label, randomised, 2-period cross-over design whereby the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of closed-loop insulin therapy will be compared with the conventional&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy in 12 adolescents with T1D. Participants aged 12 to 18 years will be&#xD;
      randomised for two 36 hour studies in a clinical research facility, during which glucose&#xD;
      levels will be controlled by either the computer-based closed-loop algorithm (intervention&#xD;
      arm) or by conventional insulin pump therapy (control arm). During both studies participants&#xD;
      will perform normal daily activities, i.e. playing, reading, snacking and physical activity.&#xD;
      On both occasions, the Actiheart, a combined heart rate and movement sensor will be used to&#xD;
      accurately quantify each subject's individual physical activity energy expenditure during the&#xD;
      36 hour study period and for 36 hours of free living during weekday.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, randomised, 2-period crossover study comparing the closed-loop&#xD;
      insulin therapy with the conventional insulin pump therapy in 12 adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consented to take part in the study will attend the Clinical Research Facility&#xD;
      on two occasions, each lasting 36 hours. Approximately 1-3 days prior to each Study Visit, a&#xD;
      subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each Study Visit subjects will arrive between 17:30 and 18:00 and will stay in the&#xD;
      clinical research facility for two nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortly after arrival the subjects will have Actiheart monitor fitted and a cannula inserted&#xD;
      into a vein of one arm for blood sampling purposes. Blood sampling for plasma glucose and&#xD;
      plasma insulin will start at 18:30 and will be carried out at 30 minutes intervals during the&#xD;
      day and at 60min intervals during the night throughout the study period. Plasma glucose&#xD;
      measurements will be done in real time every 30min during the day and every 60min during the&#xD;
      night except when when plasma glucose &lt; 3.5mmol/L or following treatment for hypoglycaemia,&#xD;
      when the measurements will be carried out every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Study Visit 1 the subjects will be randomised on arrival to receive either the&#xD;
      conventional insulin pump therapy or the closed-loop intervention. At 18:30 subjects will&#xD;
      perform 5 to 10 minutes exercise on a bicycle to determine the settings needed to achieve a&#xD;
      heart rate of 140 bpm corresponding to an exercise level at 55%60% of peak VO2. In the&#xD;
      closed-loop intervention arm the insulin pump therapy will be driven by the computer-based&#xD;
      algorithm from 19:30 until the end of the study. The basal insulin infusion rate on the&#xD;
      insulin pump will be adjusted manually at 15min intervals following the computer-based&#xD;
      algorithm advice. During the control arm, the subject will carry on with their usual insulin&#xD;
      pump regimen. In both groups CGM will be continued throughout the whole of the study period.&#xD;
      Subjects who completed Study Visit 1 will cross over to the alternative Study Visit schedule&#xD;
      after an interval of 1 to 6 weeks.&#xD;
