      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow provided by healthy&#xD;
           volunteers. Volunteer bone marrow donors for BMSCs are generally required to meet the&#xD;
           same healthy history and infectious disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood&#xD;
           donors. BMSCs are being used to treat a number of immune system and cardiovascular&#xD;
           disorders, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), heart disease, and vascular&#xD;
           disease. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center is interested in collecting&#xD;
           bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to produce clinical-grade&#xD;
           BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will also collect bone marrow from autologous donors (donors who will later&#xD;
           receive their own BMSCs) for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy subjects and autologous donors&#xD;
      in order to produce BMSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are either healthy volunteers or individuals who&#xD;
      will need to receive their own BMSCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective healthy volunteers will be asked a series of questions designed to identify&#xD;
           exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C, or other&#xD;
           transfusion-transmitted diseases. A blood sample will be collected and tested for the&#xD;
           abovementioned diseases and for other problems that may prevent bone marrow donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective autologous donors will also have blood tests to evaluate their own&#xD;
           suitability for bone marrow donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be scheduled to provide a marrow aspirate/biopsy, taken from&#xD;
           the upper part of the thigh bone, using standard bone marrow donation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The collected bone marrow will be processed into BMSCs at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be grown from bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and&#xD;
      are being used to treat a number of disorders including: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD),&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of&#xD;
      this protocol is to collect bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      produce clinical grade BMSCs to treat Clinical Center patients and to develop new methods for&#xD;
      producing and assessing the quality of BMSCs. In some cases, the donors will be the&#xD;
      recipients of the ex vivo expanded cells (autologous transplantation). In other cases, no&#xD;
      matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the marrow donor and the BMSC&#xD;
      recipient, so the donors will be required to meet the same healthy history and infectious&#xD;
      disease marker screening criteria as volunteer blood donors. The BMSCs will be produced in&#xD;
      the GMP Clinical Cell Processing Laboratory, located in the Cell Processing Section (CPS),&#xD;
      Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center. After the BMSCs are produced by&#xD;
      the Cell Processing Laboratory, they will be infused directly into Clinical Center patients&#xD;
      on protocol, or cryopreserved and stored, and used as they are needed to treat Clinical&#xD;
      Center patients. Up to 250 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This protocol will&#xD;
      provide a mechanism for banking fresh and frozen BMSC products that can be used for patient&#xD;
      care and research. This is not a treatment protocol. Subjects receiving these BMSC products&#xD;
      will be enrolled in specific BMSC treatment protocols.&#xD;
