  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary outcome: to evaluate the effect of elective induction of labor (IOL), at 39 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, on cesarean delivery rates in nulliparous women compared to expectant management&#xD;
      (EM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: to evaluate differences in the mean number of clinic visits/antepartum&#xD;
      tests avoided with IOL, to compare the differences in utilization of inpatient resources&#xD;
      (mean duration of inpatient stay, mean duration of labor), and to evaluate the effect of IOL&#xD;
      on the risk of urinary/anal incontinence and sexual dysfunction as analyzed using previously&#xD;
      validated measurements. We will evaluate differences in the rate of cervical change once&#xD;
      active labor is diagnosed, and the time from completion of active labor, defined as complete&#xD;
      dilation and complete effacement, to the delivery of fetus (definition of second stage of&#xD;
      active labor). Furthermore, other secondary outcomes to be evaluated include comparisons&#xD;
      between IOL and EM in regards to the occurence of chorioamnionitis, stillbirth, operative&#xD;
      vaginal delivery, and meconium stained amniotic fluid. An evaluation of the predictive value&#xD;
      of cervical length and Bishop score for vaginal delivery will also be examined.&#xD;

      A research nurse will screen patients at the 38 week visit through chart review and potential&#xD;
      candidates will be identified. One of the study investigators or research nurse will&#xD;
      interface with the patient at the 38 week visit and written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      after the study protocol is explained and eligibility determined. Since eligibility&#xD;
      determination cannot be made without performing a digital cervical examination, the patient&#xD;
      will be offered a cervix exam with Bishop score determination. If the Bishop score meets&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, the patient will be offered participation in the study. Women who consent&#xD;
      to the study will be randomized using a computer-generated list by means of sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes which reveal the allocation of the subject to either&#xD;
      induction or expectant management. All subjects will then receive the following evaluation:&#xD;
      transvaginal cervical length measurement, and completion of a standard urinary/rectal&#xD;
      incontinence/sexual function questionnaire. Patients randomized to induction will be&#xD;
      scheduled not earlier than 39 weeks gestation and in coordination with the labor and delivery&#xD;
      physician and nursing leadership. The method of induction will be dependant on whether or not&#xD;
      a cervical foley bulb can be placed at the time of admission for induction of labor. If&#xD;
      cervical foley bulb placement is possible, the foley bulb will remain in place until either&#xD;
      spontaneously removed or after 12 hours, whichever is earlier. If placement is not possible,&#xD;
      cervical ripening with misoprostol 25 mcg per vagina every 4 hours (maximum of 4 total doses)&#xD;
      will be initiated. Cervical examination will occur every 4 hours (coincident with vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol placement). Repeat doses of misoprostol will be given only if foley bulb&#xD;
      placement is not possible and/or if palpably firm uterine contractions are less than 6 in 10&#xD;
      minutes in consecutive 10 minute intervals. Once placement of a cervical foley bulb can be&#xD;
      performed this will be accomplished and initiation of oxytocin administration will begin at 2&#xD;
      mIU/minute and increasing by 2 mIU/minute every 20 minutes to ensure adequate contractions&#xD;
      (maximum oxytocin infusion rate 36 mIU/minute). Adequate contractions will be defined as 7&#xD;
      contractions in 15 minutes in consecutive 15 minute intervals that palpate moderate to firm.&#xD;
      Oxytocin infusion will begin not earlier than 4 hours after the last misoprostol dose (if&#xD;
      given). Subjects expectantly managed (EM) will be scheduled for routine follow-up&#xD;
      appointments and delivered for obstetric indications but not later than 42 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A routine 6-8 week immediate postpartum and 1 year follow-up examinations will be scheduled&#xD;
      for all subjects following delivery. In addition to the routine examinations, all subject&#xD;
      evaluations during these visits will include completion of a standard urinary/rectal&#xD;
      incontinence/sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be entered into a password protected Excel file on a DoD government computer&#xD;
      accessible only to study investigators and a clinical research nurse. Withdrawal from the&#xD;
      study will be voluntary and results will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will focus on the primary outcome: to evaluate the effect of elective induction&#xD;
      of labor, at 39 weeks gestation, on cesarean delivery rates in nulliparous women compared to&#xD;
      expectant (typical) management. Also evaluation of secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      determination of the predictive value of cervical length and Bishop score for successful&#xD;
      vaginal delivery; the risk of urinary/anal incontinence and sexual dysfunction with labor&#xD;
      induction compared to spontaneous labor; number of clinic visits/antepartum tests avoided&#xD;
      with elective induction compared with potential increased utilization of inpatient resources;&#xD;
      evaluation of the labor curve with induction compared to spontaneous labor. Other secondary&#xD;
      outcomes to be evaluated include comparisons between IOL and EM in regards to the rate of&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, rate of stillbirth, rate of operative vaginal delivery, and rate of&#xD;
      meconium stained amniotic fluid. Students t-test will be used to compare continuous variables&#xD;
      and the Chi-square test will be used to compare proportions between the groups. Analysis is&#xD;
      by intent-to-treat with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered significant.&#xD;
