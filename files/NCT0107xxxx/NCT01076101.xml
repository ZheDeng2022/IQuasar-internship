      This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These&#xD;
      unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation&#xD;
      and is accompanied by the development of autoantibodies. The inflammation caused by SLE may&#xD;
      affect the skin, joints, lungs, blood, kidneys and nervous system. The cause of SLE is&#xD;
      unknown, but research has indicated that it is caused by a combination of genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoimmune diseases often run in families. Close relatives of people with these diseases are&#xD;
      at greater risk of developing the same or another autoimmune disease. The study is designed&#xD;
      to determine several things: If sisters of people with SLE make the same antibodies that are&#xD;
      present in people with SLE, whether or not environmental factors affect the chances of&#xD;
      developing these antibodies and if so what these environmental factors may be, if the&#xD;
      presence of these antibodies in healthy people leads to increased risk for the development of&#xD;
      SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These&#xD;
      unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is voluntary and participants can stop participating at any time.&#xD;

      We will use your DNA blood sample to study the function of genes and biomarkers and gain&#xD;
      understanding of their role in protection against disease or the role they play in increasing&#xD;
      the risk factors of developing lupus. No, you will not get test results since the information&#xD;
      we gather is only useful for research and is not diagnostic. Participation in this study is&#xD;
      not a substitute for regular medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information and blood sample that is collected for research will be analyzed for many&#xD;
      years and it is not possible to know how long this analysis and follow-up will take.&#xD;
      Therefore, participation allows the information and banking of your blood sample to be&#xD;
      indefinite.&#xD;
