      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and very disabling symptom in people with Parkinson s&#xD;
      disease, significantly affecting their quality of life. It has been defined as a sudden break&#xD;
      or block in the walking motion, or as an inability to start walking. Although certain neural&#xD;
      connections or neurological processes might contribute to FOG, more research is needed to&#xD;
      produce consistent findings. Researchers are interested in investigating brain function&#xD;
      involved in FOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To obtain more information on brain function in individuals with freezing of gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between the ages of 45 and 80 who have been diagnosed with Parkinson s&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to go off their current Parkinson s disease medications for&#xD;
           up to 12 hours at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups: those who do have freezing of gait (more&#xD;
           than about once a day) and those who have not experienced this symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will involve a screening visit (1 hour) and a study visit (2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the screening visit, participants will be asked about medical history, and will&#xD;
           have physical, neurological, memory, and walking tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants should not take their Parkinson's disease medications for 12 hours before&#xD;
           the study visit. Participants who cannot come to the clinic safely without their&#xD;
           medications will be allowed to stay in the hospital overnight before the visit, and&#xD;
           should bring their medications to the study in order to take them as soon as needed&#xD;
           after the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to perform several tasks before the imaging study: (1)&#xD;
           walking 10 yards back and forth down a hallway, (2) walking 10 yards back and forth&#xD;
           while following horizontal lines on the floor, (3) walking 10 yards back and forth while&#xD;
           listening to a metronome, and (4) being pushed back and forth in a wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After participants perform the actual tasks, participants will be asked to imagine&#xD;
           performing the tasks and fill out questionnaires about how well they can imagine the&#xD;
           tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan&#xD;
           while imagining the four tasks they have just performed.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and very disabling symptom in Parkinson s disease (PD). It&#xD;
      has been defined as a sudden transient break (motor block) in the walking motion or as an&#xD;
      inability to generate effective stepping. It significantly affects PD patients, resulting in&#xD;
      a decline in Quality of Life (QOL). Although certain neural substrates or neuronal&#xD;
      connectivity might contribute to FOG, no consistent findings have been established. Our major&#xD;
      goal is to investigate the pathophysiology of the brain as it relates to FOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to study 46 PD patients (23 with freezing and 23 without).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that certain neural networks or brain regions are associated with FOG, we are&#xD;
      planning to investigate its mechanism by measuring the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      effect with functional MRI (fMRI) during motor imagery (MI) of gait in PD patients with and&#xD;
      without FOG, and compare the results with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a block design in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will examine brain&#xD;
      activity and brain connectivity of PD patients with and without freezing while they execute&#xD;
      four tasks: normal gait imagery; gait imagery with lines on the floor (visual cue); gait&#xD;
      imagery with sounds of the metronome (auditory cue); and imagery of being moved by the&#xD;
      experimenter while sitting in a wheelchair. The last condition is done to control for the&#xD;
      visual flow which should be experienced during MI of gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the motor ability of PD patients, both those with and without FOG, improves&#xD;
      with exposure to certain visual stimuli. Using a treadmill combined with a virtual reality&#xD;
      environment, we will test the effect of different visual stimuli on the gait performance of&#xD;
      PD subjects with and without FOG. In particular, we will examine gait performance as it&#xD;
      relates to FOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the fMRI experiment, the primary outcome measure is the change of BOLD-MRI signals and&#xD;
      the functional connectivity of the activated regions during different conditions and between&#xD;
      groups. In addition, the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ) score (Isaac A,&#xD;
      1986) will also be collected as a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary outcome measure involves the treadmill experiment. In this test, the&#xD;
      outcome measure is the motion analysis data, such as stride length and speed, which are&#xD;
      derived from the VICON system. Using this test, we hope to determine when the FOG phenomenon&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
