  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) when given together with vismodegib in treating&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. RO4929097 may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as vismodegib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving RO4929097 and vismodegib together may slow the growth of tumor cells and&#xD;
      may be a more active treatment for advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of continuous daily administration of 150 mg/day&#xD;
      of GDC0449 (vismodegib) in combination with escalating doses of RO4929097&#xD;
      (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) administered on a repeated&#xD;
      schedule of days 1-3, 8-10 every 21 days (for a total of 6 days of RO4929097 administration&#xD;
      per 21 day cycle) in patients with advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and identify the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this administration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenetics (PG) of GDC0449 and RO4929097,&#xD;
      each alone and in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To attempt to evaluate select pharmacodynamic (PD) stem cell differentiation biomarkers&#xD;
      in the hedgehog and notch signaling pathways (e.g. GLI family zinc finger [Gli]1/2/3, patched&#xD;
      [Ptch] 1/2, hairy and enhancer of split 1, [Drosophila] [Hes1], huntingtin interacting&#xD;
      protein 1 [Hip1], hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif 1 [Hey1], Notch4, Jagged1,&#xD;
      numb homolog [Drosophila] [numb], BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene [Bmi-1], cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation [CD]44/CD24, aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH] proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein&#xD;
      kinase [Src] family kinases) and the percentage of breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) in serial&#xD;
      breast tumor biopsies before and after GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of&#xD;
      treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine tumor response in patients with measurable disease as assessed by the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform molecular profiling of the tumor cell and BCSC populations before and after&#xD;
      GDC0449 or RO4929097 alone and after 1 cycle of treatment with the combination of GDC0449 and&#xD;
      RO4929097 at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) on&#xD;
      day 1 or days -2, -1, and 1 of course 1 and days 1-3 and 8-10 of course 2 and all subsequent&#xD;
      courses. Patients also receive vismodegib PO once daily (QD) beginning day 8 of course 1.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

                       have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not&#xD;
                       begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she&#xD;
                       is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time&#xD;
                       forward&#xD;

             or RO4929097&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within the preceding&#xD;

             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for&#xD;
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but may potentially have an&#xD;
             anti-cancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must&#xD;
             have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior history of seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known active brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial;&#xD;
             patients with prior treated brain metastases (treated and stable for &gt;= 1 month) are&#xD;
             allowed, providing that they were not accompanied by seizures and that a baseline&#xD;
             brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to study entry demonstrates no&#xD;
             current evidence of progressive brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient requiring chronic maintenance of white blood cell counts or granulocyte&#xD;
             counts through the use of growth factor support (e.g. Neulasta, Neupogen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with GDC-0449 or RO4929097&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with&#xD;
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically active liver disease, including active viral or other&#xD;
             hepatitis or cirrhosis, are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,&#xD;
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the&#xD;
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  GDC is a cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) inhibitor; CYP2C9 is an enzyme that metabolizes&#xD;
             warfarin sodium (Coumadin) into an inactive metabolite; patients who are on warfarin&#xD;
             anticoagulation are allowed to participate as long as they fit the following 4&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They are therapeutic on a stable warfarin dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Their international normalized ratio (INR) target range is no greater than 3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They are monitored with weekly INR testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They have no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries high risk of&#xD;
                  bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other anticoagulants, including enoxaparin (Lovenox) and fondaparinux (Arixtra)&#xD;
                  are also permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 and GDC-0449 concurrently with&#xD;
             CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 substrates; furthermore, patients who are taking&#xD;
             concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP2C8,&#xD;
             CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize&#xD;
             any potential risk; investigators will make every effort to switch to another agent&#xD;
             and assess the eligibility of the patient to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QTc &gt; 450 msec in males and QTc &gt; 470 msec in females by ECG using Bazett's&#xD;
             formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without accessible tumor or who refuse serial biopsies&#xD;
