  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of otelixizumab in rheumatoid arthritis subjects will provide safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information which will enable the&#xD;
      identification of appropriate safe and well-tolerated dosage regimens to be used in clinical&#xD;
      efficacy studies. This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by a treatment&#xD;
      period where four cohorts of subjects will receive 5 daily intravenous infusions of&#xD;
      otelixizumab. The cumulative dose will increase in each successive cohort and infusion rates&#xD;
      can be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and to ensure the&#xD;
      specified maximum infusion rate is not exceeded. Serial blood samples will be obtained for&#xD;
      clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum otelixizumab PK&#xD;
      parameters, exploratory biomarkers and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from&#xD;
      the previous cohort(s) will be evaluated prior to dosing subsequent cohorts to ensure safety.&#xD;
      Adverse events, laboratory values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during&#xD;
      this study. All subjects in the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to&#xD;
      monitor patient safety.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of: a. non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females&#xD;
             with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12&#xD;
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with&#xD;
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml&#xD;
             (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
             in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they&#xD;
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method. b. Child-bearing potential&#xD;
             and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1 of the&#xD;
             protocol for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the risk of&#xD;
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least&#xD;
             2 weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1&#xD;
