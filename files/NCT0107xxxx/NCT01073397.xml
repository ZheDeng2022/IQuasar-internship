  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare yoga and health and wellness classes for&#xD;
      helping perimenopausal or newly postmenopausal women who are experiencing hot flashes. The&#xD;
      investigators want to learn about the effects of yoga and health and wellness classes on&#xD;
      symptoms and other quality of life issues. The results of this study may provide important&#xD;
      knowledge to women and clinicians who counsel women with menopausal hot flashes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes and/or night sweats are the most common and troubling symptoms associated with&#xD;
      menopause. It is estimated that 64% to 87% of women report experiencing hot flashes for an&#xD;
      average of about 4 years. For many women, these symptoms are frequent and severe enough to&#xD;
      become debilitating and interfere with daily activities. They often occur at night,&#xD;
      disturbing sleep and leading to daytime irritability, fatigue and depressed mood. About&#xD;
      30-40% of menopausal women seek medical help for hot flashes. Relief from hot flashes has&#xD;
      been shown to be the primary reason that women initiate hormone therapy (HT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HT is currently the gold standard for treatment of vasomotor symptoms. A Cochrane Database&#xD;
      systematic review showed a 75% reduction in hot flash frequency with hormone therapy compared&#xD;
      to placebo.1 However, recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial indicate&#xD;
      that benefits of HT are outweighed by risks, such as coronary heart disease, stroke,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, breast cancer, and probable dementia. The wide publicity of the WHI&#xD;
      results has heightened women's concerns about taking HT and many women have sought&#xD;
      alternative treatments for hot flashes. These alternatives include other pharmaceutical&#xD;
      agents, herbal or dietary remedies, and behavioral therapies. Unfortunately, many of these&#xD;
      agents have a high incidence of side effects or have not been shown to be effective. A recent&#xD;
      NIH conference has called for more research on alternative treatments for hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions involving relaxation and slow deep, abdominal breathing have been&#xD;
      found to be useful for reducing mild- to moderate-intensity hot flashes. Although the&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms for the effectiveness of these interventions are not completely&#xD;
      understood, there is some suggestion that they may help reduce sympathetic activity which is&#xD;
      related to the narrowing of the thermoneutral zone. It is currently thought that hot flashes&#xD;
      are linked to a disruption in thermoregulation and that elevated levels of brain&#xD;
      norepinephrine may be the primary mechanism for altered thermoregulation. Breathing&#xD;
      techniques form the most integral core of any yoga practice which involves the combination of&#xD;
      physical postures (asanas), breathing (pranayama), and deep relaxation (savasana). Despite&#xD;
      suggestions that yoga may be beneficial for the relief of hot flashes, these potential&#xD;
      benefits have not been well-studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, treatment efficacy for hot flashes has been limited to self-reported, subjective&#xD;
      symptoms. While subjective hot flashes are important from a woman's perspective in her&#xD;
      decision-making with respect to treatment, research has shown that they can be influenced by&#xD;
      mood and reporting biases. Objective measures are not subject to these biases and have the&#xD;
      advantage of providing insight as to whether an intervention has a physiological effect.&#xD;
      However, until recently, reliable objective measures that could be used in an ambulatory&#xD;
      setting were not available. NCCAM has recently funded the development of new technologies to&#xD;
      monitor objective hot flashes in an ambulatory setting, as measured by skin conductance. This&#xD;
      technology greatly enhances our ability to fully evaluate the impact of treatment on both&#xD;
      subjective and objective hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this R21 pilot grant is to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of&#xD;
      Integral Yoga for reducing self-reported menopausal hot flashes. Secondary aims are to&#xD;
      determine the impact of yoga on objective hot flashes and other outcomes and study&#xD;
      feasibility. Our primary hypothesis will be a greater reduction in subjective hot flash&#xD;
      frequency and severity in the yoga group than in two control groups. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include a greater reduction in objective hot flash frequency; a greater decrease in hot flash&#xD;
      interference; and greater improvement in sleep, other symptoms, mood, perceived stress, and&#xD;
      overall quality of life in the yoga group.&#xD;
