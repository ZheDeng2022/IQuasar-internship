    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioavailability study comparing acetaminophen extended&#xD;
      release gelcaps 650 mg (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of OHM Laboratories Inc. with&#xD;
      TYLENOLÒ arthritis pain caplets 650 mg (containing acetaminophen 650 mg) of McNeil Consumer &amp;&#xD;
      specialty Pharmaceuticals in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fed condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single oral dose of acetaminophen 650 mg was administered (except Subject No. 17) with 240&#xD;
      mL of drinking water during each period under supervision of trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,&#xD;
      serology parameters and urine analysis) at base line. Laboratory parameters of hematology and&#xD;
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of study (except Glucose and cholesterol).&#xD;
