  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot project for this seed grant focuses on the role of intestinal&#xD;
      serine-proteases in the pathogenesis of diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS). In this study we&#xD;
      will further assess serine-protease activity in patients with D-IBS and also explore a&#xD;
      possible mechanism by which these proteases can lead to alterations in intestinal physiology&#xD;
      and symptoms in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general hypotheses for the proposed research are that (A) the levels of fecal&#xD;
      serine-protease in patients with D-IBS are abnormally increased (B) this abnormal&#xD;
      serine-protease activity leads to/is associated with an abnormal increase in intestinal&#xD;
      permeability and therefore enables (C) chronic stimulation and activation of the mucosal&#xD;
      immune system in these patients. In addition, it is aim to determine whither periodontal&#xD;
      inflammation is associated with intestinal permeability and serine protease activity.&#xD;

        Men and women of any race or ethnicity at least 18 years or older who have Diarrhea&#xD;
        predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (D-IBS, n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any sex, race, or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age (no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  D-IBS patients must meet Rome III criteria for IBS and must have been evaluated by a&#xD;
             physician to exclude other diseases that could explain the symptoms. For the latter,&#xD;
             patients self statement is acceptable (no official document is required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in Dr. Whitehead's 'heterogeneity of IBS' and/or Dr. Ringel's&#xD;
             'intestinal inflammation in patients with D-IBS' research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy controls must have no significant or recurring gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls should not have a serious, unstable medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls must have had no gastrointestinal tract surgery other&#xD;
             than appendectomy or cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls must not be pregnant (by self-report). Pregnant women&#xD;
             will not be allowed to participate as pregnancy can affect gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls must not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
             celiac disease, or other diagnosis that could explain chronic or recurring bowel&#xD;
             symptoms in IBS patients or controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls should have no history of lactose malabsorption (by&#xD;
             self-report).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls should have no history of clinical symptoms of acute&#xD;
             infections during the last 8 weeks prior to enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls should have no history of anti-inflammatory agents&#xD;
             including aspirin, non-aspirin, non-steroid anti-inflammatory (NSAID) or steroids in&#xD;
             the last four weeks prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not intentionally consume probiotics or undergo antibiotic treatment&#xD;
             during the last 4 weeks prior to enrolment in the study. If the subject consumed any&#xD;
             of these medications, a washout period of 4 weeks will be required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no history of fainting or light headedness during periods of&#xD;
             fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have diabetes mellitus, or any similar conditions, that would cause&#xD;
             an adverse reaction to the sugar drink.&#xD;
