  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the roles of two specific gene families (the&#xD;
      chitinase gene family and the TGFB family). We hypothesize that chitinases and TGFb pathway&#xD;
      genes will be differentially expressed in the airways of non-asthmatic subjects and subjects&#xD;
      with asthma. We further hypothesize that genetic variants in CHIT1, AMCase, and TGFb pathway&#xD;
      genes that show associations with asthma and related phenotypes will change the expression&#xD;
      and/or function of the protein of these genes in the airway in several ways, including the&#xD;
      transcript numbers for full length genes and splice variants and, for the chitinase genes,&#xD;
      the levels of chitinase activity in airway secretions.&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional study in patients with asthma and healthy controls in which we will&#xD;
      analyze how the expression or function of CHIT1, AMCase, and TGFb pathway genes in the&#xD;
      asthmatic airway is affected by genetic variation in these genes. We propose detailed&#xD;
      phenotyping of the asthmatic subjects and the healthy controls, including collection of&#xD;
      induced sputum, exhaled air and detailed physiologic measures including measures of airflow,&#xD;
      lung volumes, and methacholine responsiveness as well as collection of airway cells and&#xD;
      tissues by bronchoscopy. We will determine the relative expression of CHIT1 and AMCase in&#xD;
      specific lung compartments (large airways, small airways, epithelial cells, macrophages) and&#xD;
      the effects of genetic variants in CHIT1 and AMCase on expression of splice variants and&#xD;
      levels of chitinase activity in the airway. These human samples will also allow us to&#xD;
      determine if any of the multiple TGFb pathway genes analyzed show differential expression in&#xD;
      the lung in asthma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma in the past 6&#xD;
             weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperreactivity to methacholine (PC20FEV1 Methacholine â‰¤ 8.0 mg/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one of the following symptoms, beta agonist use, or FEV1 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asthma symptoms on at least two days per week, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Beta agonist use on at least two days per week, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1 &lt; 85% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be non-smokers (patients who have never smoked or patients who have not&#xD;
             smoked for 1 year and have a total pack-year smoking history &lt; 10 packs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cigarette smoking: Subjects must be non-smokers. Non smokers are defined as subjects&#xD;
             who have never smoked or who have not smoked for 1 year and have a total pack-year&#xD;
             smoking history &lt; 10 packs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of a medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             may put the subject at extra risk from study-related procedures or because the disease&#xD;
             may influence the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy control subjects must have no history of asthma or allergic rhinitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upper respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
