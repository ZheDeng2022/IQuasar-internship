  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an assessment protocol that measures the need&#xD;
      for support with smoking cessation and that will be administered by primary health care&#xD;
      nurses helps patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) quit smoking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with COPD continue to smoke despite the importance of quitting. A specially&#xD;
      developed assessment protocol for such patients may support nurses in their discussions with&#xD;
      the patients about smoking cessation. In a previous qualitative study involving in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with patients with COPD, the assessment protocol &quot;Trying to quit smoking&quot; (TTQ)&#xD;
      was developed. The protocol consists of approximately 21 statements that the patient responds&#xD;
      to on a scale ranging from 1 (agree entirely) to 4 (disagree). The purpose of the protocol is&#xD;
      to identify areas in which the patient may need extra support in order to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to validate the TTQ by testing it in a clinical setting. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at approximately 40 primary health care centers in Stockholm County. The&#xD;
      nurses will identify 5 consecutive patients who have COPD and smoke. All nurses will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire for each patient at baseline (after visit 1) and after 3 months describing&#xD;
      treatment provided. The nurses will ask each patient to fill in the TTQ and will provide&#xD;
      individual counseling on the basis of the answers. After 3 months, the nurses will ask all&#xD;
      patients if they still smoke and to fill in the TTQ again. Appropriate statistical methods&#xD;
      will be used to analyze the questionnaire data.&#xD;

    <description>40 participating primary health care nurses will be randomly assigned to this arm. Each nurse will identify 5 consecutive patients with COPD who smoke (n = 200 total patients). The nurses will ask the patients to fill in the assessment protocol, TTQ. The nurses will then provide an intervention to each patient in the form of individual treatment on the basis of that patient's answers to the TTQ.</description>
