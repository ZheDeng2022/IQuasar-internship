  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project addresses the following hypotheses (A) the normal balance of beneficial&#xD;
      and detrimental commensal intestinal bacteria is deranged in IBS, with selective alterations&#xD;
      in clinically defined patient subsets i.e., diarrhea predominant IBS (D-IBS) and&#xD;
      post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS); (B) these changes in intestinal microflora are associated with&#xD;
      sub-clinical mucosal inflammation and activation of the mucosal immune system; and (C)&#xD;
      activation of the mucosal immune system leads to alterations in gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      functions (i.e., motility and sensation) and functional symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two main aims in the research study. The first aim is to determine whether&#xD;
      sub-clinical mucosal inflammation occurs in patients with D-IBS by identifying alterations in&#xD;
      mucosal markers for inflammation (inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related mediators).&#xD;
      The second aim is to investigate whether the identifiable alterations in inflammatory markers&#xD;
      are associated with specific abnormalities in intestinal motor and sensory functions that are&#xD;
      relevant to the pathophysiology of IBS.&#xD;

        This research plans to study 33 diarrhea predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome and&#xD;
        IBS-mixed/alternators patients with current symptom activity (abdominal pain at least once&#xD;
        a week in the past month) and 33 healthy controls. The subjects will be of any gender, race&#xD;
        or ethnicity and at least 18 years of age. Recruitment for the proposed study takes&#xD;
        advantage of an ongoing NIH-supported research study on the heterogeneity of IBS (NIDDK&#xD;
        Grant DK 31369, WE Whitehead - PI, IRB#01-1397, GCRC# 1846) currently conducted at UNC.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  D-IBS and M-IBS patients must meet Rome II criteria for IBS and must have been&#xD;
             evaluated by a physician to exclude alternative diseases that could explain the&#xD;
             symptoms. For the latter, patients' self statement is acceptable (by self-report, no&#xD;
             official document is required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  D-IBS and M-IBS subjects older than 50 years old must have had a colonoscopy in the&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy controls must have no significant or recurring gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and healthy controls should not have a serious, unstable medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;

             than appendectomy or cholecystectomy, or any abdominal surgery within the past 3&#xD;
             months. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are allowed if done more than 2 years ago and&#xD;
             symptoms were not changed following the surgery.&#xD;
