      RATIONALE: SB939 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB939 works in treating patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy, as measured by PSA response and progression-free survival, of&#xD;
           HDAC inhibitor SB939 in patients with recurrent or metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the objective response and response duration in patients with measurable&#xD;
           disease at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the tolerability and toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the number of circulating tumor cells at baseline and after 6 weeks (and 12&#xD;
           weeks if patient is still on study treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore potential molecular factors predictive of response by assessment of archival&#xD;
           prostate tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore ERG and PTEN expression on circulating tumor cells as a potential prognostic&#xD;
           and predictive marker for response to this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine time to PSA and time to objective progression in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral HDAC Inhibitor SB939 once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and&#xD;
      19. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. Blood samples and Archival&#xD;
      tumor tissue are analyzed for TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and PTEN deletion status by FISH;&#xD;
      TMPRSS2-ERG fusion by RT-PCR; and for the number of circulating tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
