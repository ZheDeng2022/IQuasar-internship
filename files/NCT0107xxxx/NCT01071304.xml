  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of midazolam given alone&#xD;
      and midazolam given after multiple oral doses of 40 mg ridaforolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of this study is designed for evaluating CYP3A4 activity following 5 days of dosing of&#xD;
      ridaforolimus and is not designed with efficacy endpoints. Part 2 is a compassionate-use&#xD;
      extension to give patients an opportunity to receive a clinically active dose of&#xD;
      ridaforolimus. Part 2 dosing is open ended with limited data collection.&#xD;

    <description>In Part 1, all participants received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day -2. On Days 1-5, all participants received daily single oral doses of ridaforolimus 40 mg ( 4 x 10 mg tablets). On Day 5, all participants received a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam coadministered with the dose of ridaforolimus. Participants had the option to continue into Part 2 of this study.</description>
