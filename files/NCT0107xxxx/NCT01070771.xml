  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of coronary angiography to investigate patients at risk of coronary artery narrowings&#xD;
      has become universal. In most cases, this investigation leads to a successful treatment plan&#xD;
      with revascularisation recommended where appropriate. However in a substantial number of&#xD;
      patients, the images taken of the coronary arteries can lead to diagnostic uncertainty.&#xD;
      Increasingly, doctors are using devices called pressure wires to clarify the significance of&#xD;
      coronary artery narrowings in order to tailor patient treatment on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Radi pressure wire is well recognised as a reliable tool in assessing whether a narrowing&#xD;
      is significant in functional terms, that is, does it significantly restrict blood flow to the&#xD;
      heart muscle.It consists of a fine wire that is fed into individual major coronary arteries&#xD;
      to measure pressure within the vessel itself. In conjunction with the images taken of the&#xD;
      arteries, it is very useful in deciding how best to treat patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolls volunteers who are being investigated for stable cardiac-sounding chest&#xD;
      pain and are undergoing a coronary angiogram. It will investigate whether the extra&#xD;
      information gained from pressure wire assessment will change patients' treatment plan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The choice of management in an individual patient is determined largely by the presence and&#xD;
      distribution of significant coronary narrowings. Usually, this significance is judged by the&#xD;
      visual estimation of a narrowing on an angiogram. However, although this is the standard way&#xD;
      of assessing coronary narrowings, it is now widely published that pressure wire measurements&#xD;
      are more accurate because they assess the true physiological consequences of the narrowing.&#xD;
      Interventional cardiologists now frequently use Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measurements to&#xD;
      help them decide if arteries require stenting.The hypothesis for this study is that routine&#xD;
      measurement of FFR in the main coronary arteries could provide diagnostic information above&#xD;
      and beyond that obtained by an angiogram alone. This additional information may well then&#xD;
      affect the choice of management in a proportion of these patients. For example, a narrowing&#xD;
      considered to be significant angiographically may be shown to be insignificant with FFR, or&#xD;
      vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. It accounts for approximately half of all cardiovascular related deaths annually&#xD;
      and, according to statistics from the British Heart Foundation, CAD related expenditure was&#xD;
      Â£3,500 million in 2003 alone. Much effort has been placed on improving methods that detect&#xD;
      and assess the severity of CAD and facilitate more rapid and appropriate management for CAD&#xD;
      patients. Once diagnosed, CAD may be treated in 3 ways: (1)tablets alone, (2)tablets plus&#xD;
      angioplasty with stents or (3) tablets plus coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). The&#xD;
      method of choice depends primarily on the extent and severity of disease at the time of&#xD;
      coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is the current conventional method for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of CAD and is used in the assessment of disease severity. For the angiographic&#xD;
      procedure,vascular access is secured via the femoral artery or radial artery route and a dye&#xD;
      is injected into the coronary artery blood vessels. The progress of the dye through the&#xD;
      coronary blood vessels provides a visual assessment of where narrowings are present in the&#xD;
      coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where there is thought to be significant flow obstruction, particularly in symptomatic&#xD;
      patients, one of the above three treatments will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While coronary angiography has revolutionised the management of CAD, the procedure is not&#xD;
      without limitation. The purely visual assessment of disease severity with coronary&#xD;
      angiography is subjective and patient management can depend on the cardiologist reviewing the&#xD;
      films. Many such narrowings can be graded 'moderate' severity and deciding whether these are&#xD;
      of haemodynamic significance is notoriously difficult by angiography alone. In recent years,&#xD;
      the Radi pressure wire has been shown to provide accurate physiological haemodynamic data&#xD;
      about coronary narrowings. Furthermore, the FFR measurement derived predicts clinical&#xD;
      outcome, hence giving a 'cut-off' measurement for severity of disease that correlates with&#xD;
      the requirement for revascularisation with either stents or surgery. Thus FFR is now&#xD;
      frequently used in clinical practice by interventional cardiologists to decide if narrowings&#xD;
      require treatment. However, the majority of diagnostic angiography in the UK is performed by&#xD;
      non-interventional cardiologists who do not currently have access to the pressure wire&#xD;
      technology. In this study, we speculate that if we measure the FFR routinely in all the main&#xD;
      coronary arteries of patients undergoing coronary angiography the FFR data obtained may&#xD;
      affect the angiogram-derived management of some patients in terms of the choice of&#xD;
      tablets/stents/CABG. For example, some narrowings that look significant angiographically may&#xD;
      not be haemodynamically important by FFR and vice versa. Clearly this could make a difference&#xD;
      between revascularising a patient or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The degree of correlation between standard angiographic assessment of the coronary&#xD;
           arteries and pressure wire assessment of the main arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the FFR data would influence the management strategy for patients&#xD;
           as derived only on the basis of the angiogram (which represents clinical practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 200 patients listed for diagnostic coronary angiography performed by a&#xD;
      non-interventional cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology 1: In Catheter Laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive an information sheet after initial invitation to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo coronary angiography in a routine manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The non-interventional cardiologist in charge of the patient's care will analyse the&#xD;
           pictures and grade the outcome in the manner shown in table 1. He/she will formulate a&#xD;
           management plan consistent with their routine clinical practice and independent of&#xD;
           subsequent pressure wire data. This management plan will be documented in the CRF.&#xD;
           He/she will then take no further part in the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there significant stenoses (&gt;70% by eyeball) in the major epicardial vessels (i.e.&#xD;
           main coronaries or any branch of &gt;2.25mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recommend revascularisation or medical/conservative treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If revascularisation: recommended strategy for referral (Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
           Intervention (PCI) or CABG?) and which vessels (i.e. LAD + RCA etc) represent targets&#xD;
           for that revascularisation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The management strategy will be recorded according to the following options:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. medical;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data will also be collected in regard to vessels as targets (i.e. which vessels&#xD;
                require stent/graft)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the non-interventional cardiologist cannot make a plan they can allocate the&#xD;
                patient to a fourth category in which &quot;more data are required&quot;. Such patients are&#xD;
                generally then referred for further non-invasive stress imaging or even for a&#xD;
                pressure wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FFR measurements will then be undertaken by a consultant interventional&#xD;
                cardiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional screening time and contrast use accrued during FFR measurements will be&#xD;
                recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The patient will be given 70units/kg heparin i.a. or i.v. prior to passage of the&#xD;
                pressure wire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A pressure wire will be introduced into the distal third of all patent major&#xD;
                epicardial coronary arteries and branches of &gt;2.25mm with TIMI 3 flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FFR measurements will be taken using either intracoronary or intravenous adenosine&#xD;
                according to local conventional practice and operator preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The protocol mandates i.v. adenosine for ostial LM stem and ostial RCA stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Where i.c. adenosine bolus is employed, the minimum data required by the study is:&#xD;
                1 baseline FFR without adenosine and 2 boluses with at least 50mcg adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An angiogram will be acquired before the first adenosine measurement to document&#xD;
                satisfactory engagement of the guiding catheter and the position of the measurement&#xD;
                in each vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The minimum FFR reading will be taken in each case&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FFR readings of &lt;0.8 will be considered as representing haemodynamic significance&#xD;
                as per FAME protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Once the FFR data are derived the procedure will be finished and haemostasis will&#xD;
                be achieved in the normal manner&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provided the angiogram-derived management plan has been recorded in the CRF then&#xD;
                the FFR data can then be revealed to the non-interventional cardiologist. The&#xD;
                management plan will then be recorded in the light of the FFR data using the same&#xD;
                categories and dataset as previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The non-interventionalists will then manage the patient as they see fit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT Estimation of number of cases where FFR data results in a change in the&#xD;
      management strategy the revascularisation strategy (number of vessel requiring treatment&#xD;
      and/or PCI vs medical vs CABG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Clinical Value&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study proves its hypothesis, it will suggest that coronary angiography would be&#xD;
      better supported by routine pressure wire assessment in order to tailor revascularisation&#xD;
      strategies for individual patients more accurately. The result of this study will carry&#xD;
      important clinical implications if the study hypothesis is proven.... not least in terms of&#xD;
      potential patient benefit. The current widely held practice of diagnostic test followed by&#xD;
      either (i) referral for revascularisation or, (ii) in the case of equivocal angiographic&#xD;
      results, referral for stress imaging to look for objective evidence of ischaemia followed by&#xD;
      referral for revascularisation where positive could be rendered obsolete by diagnostic&#xD;
      angiography performed by interventional cardiologists with FFR availability and the ability&#xD;
      to perform PCI at the same sitting where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may generate the hypothesis that such routine FFR measurement will not only be of&#xD;
      benefit to patients but also be cost-effective if there would have been fewer interventions&#xD;
      overall (ie less CABG + PCI) or fewer expensive interventions (i.e. less CABG versus PCI)?&#xD;

        <description>This compared the number of vessels in which there was a discrepant result in relation to angiographically and FFR defined significance. Angiographic significance was visually assessed by operators whereas the pressure wire provided objective data as to a narrowing's significance: an FFR reading of &lt;0.8 indicated a significant restriction in blood flow with a recommendation for revascularisation.&#xD;
The difference in indication for revascularisation of each major coronary artery was also judged according to angiogram alone compared with angiogram plus FFR dtaa.</description>
