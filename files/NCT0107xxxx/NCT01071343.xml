  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of critically ill patients survive intensive care to be discharged from&#xD;
      hospital. However, critical illness and prolonged bedrest are associated with muscle wasting&#xD;
      with subsequent implications for recovery of normal physical function. Thus, one year after&#xD;
      discharge, survivors of septic shock have reported prolonged and severe impairment of&#xD;
      physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early interventions employed in the ICU to counteract loss of muscle mass may potentially&#xD;
      improve physical outcome and reduce the overall burden of critical illness. As a potential&#xD;
      supplement to physical therapy, transcutaneous electric muscle stimulation (TEMS) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive method directed at maintaining skeletal muscle function through artificially&#xD;
      induced contractions that are independent of patient efforts. TEMS has previously proven&#xD;
      effective at preventing loss of muscle mass and force in a number of non-ICU patient groups,&#xD;
      but has only been assessed sparsely in an ICU population where both immobilisation and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of early TEMS on muscle&#xD;
      volume in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that this intervention would preserve muscle volume during septic shock.&#xD;

      To ensures baseline comparability, eliminates many of the inter-individual confounding&#xD;
      factors often present in ICU patients and enhances statistical strength we designed a study&#xD;
      where we included a well-defined group of patients with septic shock in a single-legged&#xD;
      exercise design, using the contralateral leg as the (paired) control and used a two-channel&#xD;
      stimulation approach with 3-D evaluation of muscle volume changes based on CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization of the quadriceps muscles TEMS is applied on the intervention side for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days, 60 minutes per day. All patients undergoes CT scans of both thighs before&#xD;
      and immediately after the 7-day treatment period. The quadriceps muscle is then manually&#xD;
      delineated on the transverse CT slices, and muscle volumes are calculated after 3-D&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
