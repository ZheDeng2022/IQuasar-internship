      The purpose of the study is to see whether a single vaccination (injection) with the&#xD;
      investigational HIV vaccine is safe and effective in patients who are HIV positive but have&#xD;
      not yet begun anti-retroviral therapy. As this is an exploratory study, four different dose&#xD;
      formulations of HIV vaccine will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether or not the HIV vaccine is able to reduce the HIV viral load&#xD;
      (number of HIV virus particles in the blood) and increase or slow the decline in CD4 T cell&#xD;
      count.&#xD;

      The study will consist of a screening period of 3 to 21 days before vaccination on Day 0 and&#xD;
      a double-blind treatment period of 28 days with a follow up period of 5 months. Prior to&#xD;
      conducting any study-related procedures, subjects will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
      During screening, eligibility will be assessed, a medical history will be taken, a complete&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed and vital signs will be measured. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be taken for the assessment of HCV and HBV status. Further samples will be taken for CD4 and&#xD;
      HIV load, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and a 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG)&#xD;
      assessment will be carried out. A self-assessment diary card will be used by subjects between&#xD;
      Day 0 and Day 28 to record any AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 7, 14, 21 and 28 an AE interview will be conducted, concomitant medications and vital&#xD;
      signs will be recorded and a physical examination will be performed. Samples will be&#xD;
      collected for haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis. In addition, samples will be&#xD;
      collected for CD4 T cell count and HIV viral load at days 14 and 28 after vaccination. A&#xD;
      sample will be collected for immunogenicity on Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will attend follow-up visits at Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 at which a physical&#xD;
      examination and examination of the injection site will be performed and vital signs measured.&#xD;
      Samples will be collected for haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis CD4 T-cell count and HIV&#xD;
      viral load. Blood samples for immunogenicity testing will be collected at Weeks 12 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Sequential, non-randomised, single blind, parallel group. Five male HIV-1 positive&#xD;
      volunteers will be vaccinated in a sequential, non-randomised single blind fashion. They will&#xD;
      each receive one of the five possible active study treatments (WFI only, adjuvant only, low&#xD;
      dose + WFI, low dose + adjuvant, high dose + WFI and high dose + adjuvant). Each of these&#xD;
      five patients will be observed as in-patients for 24 hours after vaccination and vaccinations&#xD;
      will be performed in a sequential manner with at least 48 hours observation of each patient&#xD;
      before vaccination of the next patient is commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the '28 day treatment follow up' by the five Stage I subjects a&#xD;
      Safety Committee will review the safety and tolerability data for these subjects and will&#xD;
      make a recommendation for continuing or discontinuing recruitment and any changes that may be&#xD;
      required in the conduct of the study. Subject to a positive decision from the Safety&#xD;
      Committee the remaining subjects will be recruited into Stage II of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: randomised, double-blind group 50 male HIV-1 positive volunteers will be randomised&#xD;
      to one of five possible treatment groups. Following completion of the Day 1 Visit by the&#xD;
      first five subjects in Stage II the Safety Committee will review the blinded safety and&#xD;
      tolerability data for these subjects. Subject to acceptable safety and tolerability, the&#xD;
      centres will be allowed to continue recruitment for the rest of the planned cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 25 Stage II subjects have completed the Day 1 Visit a Safety Committee will review the&#xD;
      blinded data generated and will make a recommendation for continuing or discontinuing&#xD;
      recruitment and any changes that may be required in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
