  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuous cohort study consisting of 200 participants (one third 6 months old to 5&#xD;
      years, one third 6 to 15 years old, one third ≥ 15 years old) i.e. a new patient will be&#xD;
      recruited (from the same age group) for any patient who develops a Pv infection so that the&#xD;
      cohort will always have 200 patients for 3 years. Each patient will be actively followed-up&#xD;
      every 8 weeks until Plasmodium vivax infection occurs but the duration of follow up and the&#xD;
      number of follow up visits for each patient will vary depending on when or if a vivax&#xD;
      infection occurs and when the patient is recruited. Therefore, the minimum follow up period&#xD;
      for each patient will be 6 months or time to vivax infection and the maximum will be 3 years&#xD;
      if a patient does not get vivax infection and is recruited at the beginning of the study.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the most likely approach to malaria elimination; the administration&#xD;
      of a radical curative dose of primaquine to the entire potentially infected population. In&#xD;
      this study we will focus on patients who have had vivax malaria in the past year and so are&#xD;
      very likely to harbour liver hypnozoites. Radical treatment is not given on the Thai-Burmese&#xD;
      border because risks are considered to outweigh benefits, but it is recommended in Thailand.&#xD;
      We believe that this policy could be changed if there was sufficient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received chloroquine only treatment could be considered as incompletely&#xD;
      treated. We plan to conduct a carefully documented evaluation of radical treatment in such&#xD;
      patients. Through this we aim to determine the incidence of vivax malaria in patients living&#xD;
      in a vivax endemic area following radical treatment. This will provide information on the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of primaquine, used in the context most likely during an elimination&#xD;
      programme, and also will provide information on the incidence of vivax malaria. Adults and&#xD;
      children &gt; 6 months old with a documented P.vivax infection in the last 12 months will be&#xD;
      recruited. In conjunction with a parallel study evaluating epidemiology in treated vivax&#xD;
      malaria, we will be able to characterize the relapse history of P vivax. This will provide&#xD;
      the foundation for further studies evaluating the efficacy of primaquine regimens.&#xD;
