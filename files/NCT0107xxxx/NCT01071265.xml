      Main Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is a large trial of patients undergoing heart surgery comparing a simple procedure of&#xD;
           temporarily stopping blood flow to the leg with a blood pressure cuff (called remote&#xD;
           ischemic preconditioning) to a sham procedure possible?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the remote ischemic preconditioning procedure before heart surgery help protect the&#xD;
           heart and kidneys?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is Being Studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple procedure known as remote ischemic preconditioning. The procedure is performed by&#xD;
      inflating a pressurized cuff the thigh to temporarily stop blood flow to the arm or leg. This&#xD;
      procedure causes the body to have a stress response that, at the cellular level, may protect&#xD;
      major organs like the heart and kidney from the damage caused to them by the much larger&#xD;
      stress of cardiac surgery. Reducing this damage may improve patient's recovery after surgery&#xD;
      and help them live longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is this study important?:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is important because up to 1 in every 20 patients that undergo heart surgery&#xD;
      die before even leaving hospital. Preventing heart and kidney damage at the time of surgery&#xD;
      with remote ischemic preconditioning may reduce patient deaths.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annually, 2 million patients worldwide undergo heart surgery. Although this procedure can&#xD;
      prolong life, 1 in 20 patients will not survive their hospital stay. Acute heart and kidney&#xD;
      injuries are important causes of death after heart surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning&#xD;
      (RIPC) is a promising and simple therapy that may simultaneously reduce heart and kidney&#xD;
      damage. RIPC involves the inflation of a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff on a limb to&#xD;
      briefly stop blood flow to that limb. This period of no blood flow activates the body's own&#xD;
      protective systems and releases protective chemicals into the blood that also protect the&#xD;
      heart and kidneys. RIPC is a particularly attractive potential treatment because it may&#xD;
      protect several organs at once, it has no known adverse effects and costs almost nothing.&#xD;
      RIPC could therefore very easily be used globally to improve outcomes for all patients&#xD;
      undergoing heart surgery. Although RIPC appears very promising in several small studies using&#xD;
      different RIPC regimens there are no studies large enough to definitively evaluate whether&#xD;
      RIPC improves patient important outcomes (e.g. survival, kidney failure, major heart attack,&#xD;
      or stroke). Before performing a large trial to determine whether RIPC is effective, we must&#xD;
      demonstrate that such a trial is feasible. We will determine the recruitment rate and&#xD;
      adequacy of follow-up in an international group of centres to ensure that an adequately&#xD;
      powered trial of RIPC compared to a sham procedure is possible. Further, we will ensure that&#xD;
      our RIPC regimen is consistent with other trials in terms of effects on cardiac and kidney&#xD;
      injury. This pilot trial will enroll 250 patients and randomize half to RIPC and half to a&#xD;
      sham procedure. We call this trial the Remote IscheMia Preconditioning in cArdiaC surgery&#xD;
      Trial (Remote IMPACT).&#xD;
