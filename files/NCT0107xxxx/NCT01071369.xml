      To study improvements or lack thereof with the interlaminar epidural patients with or without&#xD;
      steroids experiences mid back, upper back or neck pain with or without chest wall and upper&#xD;
      extremity pain of at least 6-months duration non-responsive to conservative management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Single-center, prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized study in thoracic&#xD;
      and cervical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are studied in 2 groups in each region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I-local anesthetic only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II-local anesthetic with 6 mg of non-particulate Celestone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be unblinded at 12 or 24 months. Non-responsive patients will be unblinded&#xD;
      after 3 months and will be crossed over to a different group, if patient consents.&#xD;
      Non-responsive patients may be unblinded and withdrawn from the study at any time.&#xD;
