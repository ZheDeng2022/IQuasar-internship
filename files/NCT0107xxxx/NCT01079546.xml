    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study proposal is derived from previous case series demonstrating that&#xD;
      up to 60% of patients with HNSCC, especially in the oropharynx are associated with high risk&#xD;
      HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will characterize the association between HPV infection and HNSCC in Israel&#xD;
      and establish a program for its diagnosis and management based on HPV as a biomarker. The&#xD;
      rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known which types of HPV are&#xD;
      associated with HNSCC, this information can be used to direct diagnosis and screening effort&#xD;
      to high risk population. Our approach is based on establishing a multicenter consortium of&#xD;
      leading researchers that will establish a joint database of demographic, clinical and&#xD;
      biological data from various regions in Israel. For this we have assembled a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary research team with the scope and breath (surgical oncology, pathology,&#xD;
      virology and molecular biology) needed to complete all phases of the research successfully.&#xD;
      The research will be coordinated and performed at the Applied Cancer Research Laboratory, Tel&#xD;
      Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. The patients will be recruited from 7 tertiary medical centers&#xD;
      in Israel: Ichilov, Bellinson, Hadassa, Rambam, Soroka, Sheba and Nazeret..&#xD;

      To determine the prevalence and classify the high risk human papillomavirus types associated&#xD;
      with head and neck cancer in Israel. We will determine the HPV genotype distribution in&#xD;
      Israel in order to study the ethnic uniqueness of the region. Many studies have shown HPV 16&#xD;
      to be the most prevalent type in HNSCC (NEJM). In Israeli Jewish women the HPV types 16, 39,&#xD;
      52, and 18 were the most prevalent genotypes found (15). In our aim, we will determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of various HPV genotypes in HNSCC specimens.Study population The group will&#xD;
      include patients treated with primary surgery or biopsy, with or without adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy between 1998 and 2010 for SCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,&#xD;
      larynx and paranasal sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomic site and extent of the primary tumor will be documented. The TNM classification&#xD;
      of will be based on the staging system revised by the American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
      (AJCC). Patients will be recruited from seven national cancer referral hospitals, including&#xD;
      Soroka Medical Center in the Negev (Beer Sheva), Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv), Rabin&#xD;
      Medical Center (Petach Tikva), Hadassa Medical (Jerusalem), Rambam Medical Center (Haifa),&#xD;
      Sheba medical center (Ramat- Gan) and French Hospital Nazareth (Nazareth). These centers&#xD;
      cover almost the entire population in Israel, including Israeli Jews, Bedouins, Druze and&#xD;
      Israeli Arab population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry Data will be entered into a commercially available spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      2000, Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA) and statistical analysis will perform using a&#xD;
      computerized software package (SPSS). We have previously used a similar system to report the&#xD;
      results of 146 patients with skull base sarcomas in an international multicenter study&#xD;
      including 17 cancer centers (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor specimens Specimens will be collected retrospectively, and comprise of paraffin&#xD;
      sections of primary tumors or biopsies retrived from the pathology department archives at&#xD;
      each center. Transportation of paraffin blocks to Tel Aviv for deparaphinization and HPV&#xD;
      testing will take place personally by the investigators. Histopathological analysis Primary&#xD;
      tumor specimens will be first evaluated by pathologists at each participating cancer. All&#xD;
      specimens will be than re-analyzed and evaluated by head and neck pathologist, Dr. Kaplan&#xD;
      Ilana. Specimen dissection and tissue sampling of the primary tumor will be in accordance&#xD;
      with the current guidelines for the histopathological assessment of head and neck cancer&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV detection at the laboratory Tissue sections will be subjected to deparaffinization,&#xD;
      heatinduced target retrieval, and digestion with proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Indianapolis, IN), as described previously (18). DNA is then purified from paraffin by&#xD;
      deparaffinization, proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol&#xD;
      precipitation. We will use the HPV genotyping system using a PCR based HPV GenoArray test kit&#xD;
      for genotyping of 37 HPV taypes (Hybribio Limited, Hong Kong). Specimens are placed into&#xD;
      PreservCytR LBC medium (ThinPrep liquid Pap vial; Cytyc Corporation). The Amplicor HPV test&#xD;
      kit contains a pool of HPV-specific primers designed to amplify HPV DNA from 13 HR genotypes&#xD;
      (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). According to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's specification, the Amplicor HPV test detects HPV genotypes 31, 52, 58, and 59&#xD;
      at 240 copies/ml and HPV genotypes 16, 18, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, and 68 at 100 copies/ml&#xD;
      with a positivity rate greater than 95%. All genotypes are detected with a 100% positivity&#xD;
      rate at 480 copies/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV genotyping HPV genotyping is performed by using a commercially available PCR based HPV&#xD;
      GenoArray test kit (Hybribio Limited, Hong Kong), which makes use of both DNA amplification&#xD;
      and HybriBio's proprietary flowthrough hybridization technique to simultaneously identify 21&#xD;
      HPV genotypes, including 5 low-risk types (types 6, 11, 42, 43, and 44), 14 HR types (types&#xD;
      16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68), and 2 intermediate-risk types&#xD;
      (types CP8304 and 53).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test employs a macroarray format with a nylon membrane onto which HPV genotype-specific&#xD;
      oligonucleotides probes have been immobilized. In Situ Hybridization system will be performed&#xD;
      with Amplicor HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems) for validation of the results. This kit is&#xD;
      designed for the detection and discrimination of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA in&#xD;
      paraffinembedded tissue. An HPV16-positive tumor specimen will be used as a positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      p16 Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression status of p16 is strongly correlated with tumor HPV status (19) and therefore&#xD;
      we will evaluate the presence of this protein by immunohistochemistry (20). After 5- Î¼ m&#xD;
      sections are deparaffinized, antigen retrieval is performed by use of heat-induced epitope&#xD;
      retrieval with 10 mM citrate buffer. Immunostaining will be performed with a Ventana&#xD;
      automated stainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations. Cervical specimen known to be positive for HPV will be used as positive&#xD;
      control and normal tissues as baseline controls. A mouse monoclonal antibody against p16 (MTM&#xD;
      Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany) at 1:500 dilution will be utilized. The p16 antibody is&#xD;
      detected using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique (Dako LSAB Kit, Dako). On&#xD;
      histopathologic review, the pattern of p16 expression is generally dichotomous according to&#xD;
      tumor sample, with p16 staining either absent (negative) or present with strong and diffuse&#xD;
      nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (positive). Relative protein expression will be estimated&#xD;
      using dedicated software (Metamorph, Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), which analyzed the&#xD;
      intensity and area of positive staining. Immunohistochemical interpretation will be performed&#xD;
      by two investigators blinded to the HPV status and identity of the patient from whom the&#xD;
      tumor originated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation the association between HPV status and therapeutic response or survival in&#xD;
      patients with oropharyngeal/laryngeal SCC Prospective analyses of case series in the United&#xD;
      States and Europe have consistently demonstrated that patients with oropharyngeal SCC which&#xD;
      are HPV-positive have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors are HPV negative (21,22).&#xD;
      We will evaluate the effect of tumor HPV status on treatment response and survival outcomes&#xD;
      among patients with oropharyngeal and laryngeal SCC who were treated with primary&#xD;
      chemoradiation or radiation therapy (organ preservation regime).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Each center will collect data from patients charts. The data will include:&#xD;
      age, sex, ethnic group, area of birth and residence, religion, education (ever attendance at&#xD;
      school, number of years of school attendance, and age at leaving school), longest occupation,&#xD;
      use of tobacco in its different forms, alcohol drinking habits, dietary habits, marital&#xD;
      status, sexual history (number of lifetime sexual partners, visits to prostitutes, and&#xD;
      frequency of oral sex), histories of various diseases, family history of cancer, and oral&#xD;
      cavity health. A &quot;smoker&quot; is defined as an individual who reports having smoked tobacco daily&#xD;
      for at least 1 year, and smokers will be asked about duration of smoking and amount and type&#xD;
      of tobacco smoked (cigarettes, cigars, pipes or any form of tobacco chewing). A &quot;drinker&quot; is&#xD;
      defined as an individual who reports drinking alcoholic beverages at least once a month.&#xD;
      Details will be obtained on types of beverages, amounts and duration of habitual drinking.&#xD;
      information on tumor-node-metastasis classification and staging will be obtained from the&#xD;
      study patients. This classification will be converted into stage according to the American&#xD;
      Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual. We will evaluate the outcome of each&#xD;
      therapy in terms of response (complete response, partial response and progressive disease&#xD;
      according to the RECIST classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survive al (DSS) and&#xD;
      locoregional control rates will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the&#xD;
      difference in survival rate will be assessed by a log rank test (17). OS will be measured&#xD;
      from the date of surgery to the date of death or last follow-up. For DSS, the patients who&#xD;
      died from causes other than SCC will be censored at the time of death. The variables that&#xD;
      will have prognostic potential suggested by univariate analysis will be subjected to&#xD;
      multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. All statistics will&#xD;
      be two-sided. A value of P&lt; 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.&#xD;
      Comparison of HPV/p16 classification (three-class model) will be performed by Kruskal-Wallis&#xD;
      analysis followed by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni corrections. Comparison of&#xD;
      protein expression by HPV/p16 classification will be made using one-way analysis of variance&#xD;
      (ANOVA) with post hoc comparisons by Dunnett's T3 test. Comparison of HPV - three class model&#xD;
      classification status with specific clinical and pathologic variables (sex, TNM stage, T&#xD;
      stage, N stage, histologic grade, management, radiotherapy, chemoradiation, alcohol use,&#xD;
      tobacco use and clinical response), will be performed by Fisher's exact test. Clinical&#xD;
      response will be recorded as complete response versus no response/partial response after&#xD;
      completion of treatment. All calculations and analyses will be performed with the Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Sciences version 11.5 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), by a&#xD;
      qualified statistician at Tel Aviv Souraky Medical Center (Esther Shabtai PhD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and its justification The prevalence of HNSCC in Israel is estimated to be 52&#xD;
      oropharyngeal and 250 laryngeal cancer new cases per year (Middle East cancer consorcium,&#xD;
      www.mecc.cancer.gov). The medical centers that will participate in this study cover 80% of&#xD;
      the population of the State of Israel. we estimate that the participation rate among case&#xD;
      patients will be 89% (range from 76 to 99.0%) (REF JNCI International). Therefore it is&#xD;
      estimated a study period of 6 months approximately 100 samples will be recruited.&#xD;
