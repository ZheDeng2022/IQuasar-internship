      Experimental evidences supported the benefit of Simvastatin in subarachnoid haemorrhage.&#xD;
      Moreover, Simvastatin is a potent agent in achieving low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction&#xD;
      with a proven safety profile. However, there is no clinical data to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      different dosage regimens (namely whether high-dose regimen is better) and related&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis, although biochemical actions and related neuroprotective&#xD;
      mechanisms were thought to be dosage-related. This gap in knowledge is important, on how to&#xD;
      implement the use of statin and interpret different trial results. With these in mind, the&#xD;
      investigators designed the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Simvastatin 80mg (high dose) treatment given within 96 hours of the ictus over three&#xD;
      weeks will reduce incidence and duration of delayed ischemic deficits following subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage when compared to daily Simvastatin 40mg (normal dose) treatment, leading to&#xD;
      improvement in clinical outcome, which translates into advantage in terms of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

      Title: High-Dose Simvastatin for Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (HDS-SAH): A multicentre&#xD;
      randomised controlled double-blinded clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment&#xD;
      of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Simvastatin is also a potent agent for reducing low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL). However, no clinical data are available to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      different dosage regimens (specifically, whether a high-dose regimen is more effective than a&#xD;
      normal-dosage regimen) or conduct related cost-effectiveness analyses, even though the&#xD;
      biochemical actions and related neuroprotective mechanisms are thought to be dosage-related.&#xD;
      This gap in our knowledge of how to use statins and interpret trial results is very&#xD;
      important, and motivated the investigators to conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: We hypothesized that eighty milligrams of simvastatin daily (high dose) over three&#xD;
      weeks initiated within 96 hours of the ictus will reduce the incidence of delayed ischaemic&#xD;
      deficits following subarachnoid haemorrhage when compared to 40mg of simvastatin daily&#xD;
      (normal dose), leading to improvements in clinical outcomes and thus cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study design is a randomised controlled double-blinded clinical trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01077206). Two hundred and forty aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage patients (presenting within 96 hours of the ictus) from six neurosurgical centres&#xD;
      are being recruited over three years. Primary outcome measure is Presence of delayed&#xD;
      ischaemic deficits (DIDs). Secondary outcome measures include Modified Rankin Disability&#xD;
      Score (mRS) at three months (favourable if 0-2) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in terms of&#xD;
      overall direct cost per patient and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: This will be the first study to clarify whether high-dose simvastatin is&#xD;
      better than normal-dose simvastatin for patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage in terms of neurological outcomes and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Rationale and Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) accounts for only 3-5% of strokes, its&#xD;
      profound consequences and unique window of intervention justify its classification as a&#xD;
      separate entity. Early aneurysm occlusion, expert endovascular neurosurgery and microsurgery,&#xD;
      the use of oral nimodipine and neuro-intensive care are now the standards of care.1-3&#xD;
      Nevertheless, aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage is still associated with mortality at one&#xD;
      month for half of all patients, and the other half are left with disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental evidence indicates the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid&#xD;
      haemorrhage.4-15 Simvastatin is also potent in reducing LDL, with a proven safety profile.&#xD;
      Three randomised placebo-controlled pilot trials have supported the use of statins (two with&#xD;
      80mg of simvastatin and one with 40mg of pravastatin) for the treatment of aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage.17-19 A systemic review has suggested that simvastatin may also&#xD;
      reduce delayed cerebral ischaemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage,20 and another&#xD;
      meta-analysis has recommended the routine use of statins in the care of patients with&#xD;
      aneurysmal SAH.21 Finally, there is an ongoing multicentre, placebo-controlled phase III&#xD;
      trial assessing the clinical benefits of treatment with 40mg of simvastatin daily&#xD;
      [http://www.stashtrial.com/home.html].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no clinical data are available to compare the efficacy of different dosage regimens&#xD;
      (specifically, whether a high-dose regimen is more effective than a normal-dosage regimen) or&#xD;
      conduct related cost-effectiveness analyses, even though the biochemical actions and related&#xD;
      neuroprotective mechanisms are thought to be dosage-related. This gap in our knowledge of how&#xD;
      to use statins and interpret trial results is very important, and motivated the investigators&#xD;
      to conduct this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goal and Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to determine whether a high dose of simvastatin for aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid haemorrhage is superior to a normal dose in terms of clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. We hypothesized that eighty milligrams of simvastatin daily (high dose)&#xD;
      over three weeks initiated within 96 hours of the ictus will reduce the incidence of delayed&#xD;
      ischaemic deficits following subarachnoid haemorrhage when compared to 40mg of simvastatin&#xD;
      daily (normal dose), leading to improvements in clinical outcomes and thus&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a multicentre randomised controlled double-blinded (participants and&#xD;
      outcome assessors) clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients aged 18-70 years for whom the admitting neurosurgeon has a high index of&#xD;
           suspicion of a spontaneous aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage with convincing CT scan&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any clinical grade, provided there is a reasonable prospect of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The delay from the time of the presenting ictus until randomisation and the initiation&#xD;
           of trial medication does not exceed 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unsalvageable patients: those with fixed and dilated pupils after resuscitation, and/or&#xD;
           a devastating scan that preludes definitive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Current course of Warfarin-type drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Known renal or hepatic impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Suspected or known additional disease process that threatens life expectancy (e.g.&#xD;
           malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Known or strong suspicion of drug abuse or alcoholism, or the likelihood of being&#xD;
           amendable to either at the 3-month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Current course of amiodarone, verapamil or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of delayed ischaemic deficits (DIDs): a fall of two or more points on the&#xD;
           modified Glasgow Coma Scale, new focal neurological deficit lasting more than 2 hours,&#xD;
           new cerebral infarction or CT perfusion evidence of cerebral ischaemia unrelated to&#xD;
           surgery/embolisation, rebleed, hydrocephalus, infection, electrolyte or metabolic&#xD;
           disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified Rankin Disability Score (mRS) at three months (favourable if 0-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost-effective analysis in terms of overall direct cost per patient and incremental&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the high-dose group versus normal-dose group, i.e.,&#xD;
           the cost difference per patient divided by the difference in the percentage of (a)&#xD;
           favourable outcomes and (b) delayed cerebral ischaemia. Sensitivity analyses for ICER&#xD;
           will be carried out using the percentages of favourable outcomes and delayed cerebral&#xD;
           ischaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval has been obtained from the respective institutional review boards. The study&#xD;
      is adhering to the international quality standards provided in the Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      guidelines. After informed consent from patients or their next of kin, subjects are being&#xD;
      randomised to receive 80mg of simvastatin (two tablets of 40mg each) or 40mg of simvastatin&#xD;
      (one tablet of 40mg and one placebo tablet) per day for 21 days orally or through a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Once the eligibility criteria have been fulfilled, a permuted-block&#xD;
      randomisation is carried out using a computer system with an allocation list in random order&#xD;
      generated by a statistician not related to the project team to protect the blinding and&#xD;
      integrity of the study. The study drug assignments are concealed within sealed envelopes.&#xD;
      These envelopes are only opened by site study investigators not involved in the clinical&#xD;
      management of the recruited patients. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Both the clinical team&#xD;
      (medical and nursing) and the patients are blinded to the study drug allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming that the high-dose group has a 35% delayed cerebral ischaemia risk with&#xD;
      a 20% absolute reduction in delayed cerebral ischaemia as compared to the standard dose group&#xD;
      with a 55% delayed cerebral ischaemia, a total of 212 patients will be required (80% power&#xD;
      and 2-sided alpha=0.05). However, further assuming a 10% loss to follow up, 236 patients will&#xD;
      need to be recruited. The study was designed with the expectation of 30 patients ¬being&#xD;
      recruited at each of four centres per year22-23; a total of 240 patients is thus expected to&#xD;
      be recruited over a 24 month period. Because of delays in starting patient recruitment in&#xD;
      some centres, two extra centres (a total of six) were initiated for patient recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be completed in March 2013, and the last recruited patient will be&#xD;
      due for final outcome assessment in June 2013. Data archiving, data analyses and the&#xD;
      dissemination of study results will take place in early 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-related morbidities including rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis have been rare. In the two&#xD;
      reported pilot studies, only one patient withdrew due to elevated liver parenchymal enzymes,&#xD;
      which reversed on cessation of medication. Plasma creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are being monitored for early&#xD;
      signs of hepatitis or myositis every 7 days or on clinical suspicion. Administration of the&#xD;
      study drug ceases if ALT/AST is more than three times the normal level of &gt;180U/L or CPK&#xD;
      &gt;1,000U/L. Cholesterol levels are also monitored weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the laboratory tests mentioned above, the patients are followed up daily by&#xD;
      the clinical team for any adverse events during acute admission and weekly for the first&#xD;
      three weeks if discharged. A three-month clinical visit is arranged for outcome assessment&#xD;
      and possible adverse event. A contact number is available for the enrolled patients for&#xD;
      queries and suspected adverse event report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are being collected on handwritten forms and archived in a password-protected electronic&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to perform an intention-to-treat analysis using two-sided probability, with P&lt;0.05&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. Proportions with (a) DCI and (b) favourable outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared with chi-square statistics. A sensitivity analysis for ICER will be carried&#xD;
      out to find the limits of proportions of groups with (a) DCI and (b) favourable outcomes that&#xD;
      show threshold values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned exploratory analyses of DCI and favourable outcomes will include multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression using presentation SAH grade, age and the presence or absence of&#xD;
      immediate post-procedural neurological deficits as the key covariates. Additional exploratory&#xD;
      analyses with similar multivariate logistic regressions are planned, with the extra&#xD;
      post-randomisation variables of the development of hydrocephalus, timing of hydrocephalus&#xD;
      treatment and timing of aneurysm treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conforms to the guideline of Good Clinical Practice. Data are managed in a secured&#xD;
      computer system by a dedicated research assistants supervised by the principal investigator.&#xD;
      The site investigators are contacted in case of doubt or uncertainty in data forms. The&#xD;
      safety and data monitoring committee is being led by Professor Wai Sang Poon, Professor of&#xD;
      Surgery, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The committee is responsible for issues arising&#xD;
      from the drugs used in the study, the interpretation of unexpected major adverse events,&#xD;
      reviewing the study's progress and the submission of related recommendations to the study&#xD;
      steering committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study to clarify whether high-dose simvastatin is more effective than&#xD;
      normal-dose simvastatin for patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms&#xD;
      of neurological outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This gap in our knowledge of how to use&#xD;
      statins and interpret trial results is very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initially targeted 24-month patient recruitment period has been extended to 30 months,&#xD;
      with an additional 6 months required to complete the patient follow up and data archive. The&#xD;
      total study period will thus be 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study steering committee is being led by the principal investigators. The committee is&#xD;
      responsible for the study design, study implementation, ethics and health authority&#xD;
      applications, protocol amendments, eventual data interpretation and the dissemination of&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design and randomisation are being supervised by Professor Benny Zee, Division of&#xD;
      Biostatistics, the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care, the Chinese&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site study investigators are responsible for patient recruitment, reporting adverse&#xD;
      events and completing the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Joint CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Hong Kong SAR, China. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review boards of&#xD;
      the six neurosurgical centres. Written informed consent was obtained from eligible patients&#xD;
      or next of kin for recruitment into the study.&#xD;
