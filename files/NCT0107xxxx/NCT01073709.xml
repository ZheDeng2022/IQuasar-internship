      The study was conducted as an open labeled, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study comparing acetaminophen extended&#xD;
      release gelcaps 650 mg of OHM Laboratories Inc. with Tylenol速 Arthritis Pain caplets 650 mg&#xD;
      of McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty Pharmaceuticals, in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under&#xD;
      fasting condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, all subjects were administered a single&#xD;
      oral dose of acetaminophen 650 mg extended release tablet was administered with 240 mL of&#xD;
      drinking water during each period of the study under supervision of trained study personnel.&#xD;
      Both test (T) and reference (R) products were administered to the study subjects, one in each&#xD;
      period (except subject no 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,&#xD;
      serology parameters, urine analysis and urine drug screening) were measured at base line.&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters of haematology and biochemistry (except glucose and cholesterol) were&#xD;
      repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
