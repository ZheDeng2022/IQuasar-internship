      The approach we will use is to employ measurement of the activation of white blood cells, to&#xD;
      look at patterns of responses during a controlled infection of the gut with Mycobacterium&#xD;
      bovis. M. bovis can be conveniently obtained in a safe and pure form as an oral vaccine. By&#xD;
      giving three challenges of M bovis to the gut, we will simulate repeated gut infections with&#xD;
      this organism. We can then compare the activation of cells in the blood to the immune&#xD;
      responses seen after each challenge, to determine whether the non-specific defences of the&#xD;
      gut can block each subsequent infection.&#xD;

      The approach we will use is to employ immune readouts and genomics to look at patterns of&#xD;
      responses during a controlled infectious challenge of the human gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomics uses 'Affymetrix' gene arrays, and other techniques to determine the profile of gene&#xD;
      expression. When a gene is 'switched on' it makes mRNA that the body uses as a template to&#xD;
      make proteins. We will extract all the mRNA from white blood cells before, during and after&#xD;
      an infection. The gene chips have hundreds or thousands of mini-sensors that can measure how&#xD;
      much mRNA from any particular gene is present in the sample. Thus we can begin to see which&#xD;
      genes are switch on or off, or unaffected, inside white blood cells during the stages of a&#xD;
      developing innate immune response. This allows us to monitor the body's response to an&#xD;
      infection and to see which families of genes are important at the different stages of gut&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BCG vaccine is derived from Mycobacterium bovis (the full name of the organism is&#xD;
      Mycobacterium bovis Baccille Calmette Guérin). In this study we propose to use an oral BCG&#xD;
      preparation, produced as a prophylactic and therapeutic oral vaccine, as a safe model for&#xD;
      natural gut infection with pathogenic Mycobacterium bovis. The cell wall of mycobacteria such&#xD;
      as BCG is a powerful immune adjuvant (an adjuvant is a substance that enhances an immune&#xD;
      response) as the lipids, sugars and proteins in the cell wall interact strongly with the&#xD;
      molecules of the innate immune system. It therefore provides a safe but highly effective way&#xD;
      to stimulate innate immunity under 'natural' conditions of gut infection. This first model&#xD;
      has been selected as it reflects a 'real world' high priority area of disease prevention,&#xD;
      while having a high level of safety and reproducibility in the oral BCG model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By carefully delivering oral BCG challenges to healthy volunteers under controlled&#xD;
      conditions, we can reduce the noise and background activity in the proteomic and genomic&#xD;
      assays we will use to profile the developing innate immune response. We can check that the&#xD;
      BCG has indeed colonised and 'infected' the subject by measuring the specific adaptive T cell&#xD;
      and antibody responses using sensitive assays we have developed in previous studies to detect&#xD;
      these immune responses. This is a critical aspect of the study: if we detect the BCG-specific&#xD;
      T cell responses we can be assured that the 'infection' has taken place, and so can interpret&#xD;
      the profiles we see in the immunology and genomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we see an immune response we can relate any innate immune activation to colonisation with&#xD;
      BCG. In contrast, even if we see no immune responses, but can be sure that the vaccine was&#xD;
      delivered properly in a viable formulation (which we will do by adhering to strict Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice) then we can look at features in the genomic and proteomic profiles in the&#xD;
      baseline measurements before infection that may predict the failure of the organisms to&#xD;
      infect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By collecting data of other events such as intercurrent illnesses, or other adverse events we&#xD;
      can also determine whether changes in the proteomic or gene expression profiles are indeed&#xD;
      due to the model infection, or extraneous events. This preliminary study will enable us to&#xD;
      refine expensive techniques, protocols and assays to let us focus in more detail in&#xD;
      subsequent studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of the St&#xD;
      George's Vaccine Institute. Up to 10 subjects will be included in this study. The study will&#xD;
      consist of a pre-study screening visit and 23 visits over a period of 12 month at the times&#xD;
      indicated in the schedule for investigation.&#xD;
