      A Stage 2 randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a 9-session model of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (MI) for methamphetamine (MA) dependence. Stage 1 pilot testing&#xD;
      indicated the intervention could be easily learned and implemented with fidelity. The&#xD;
      tailored treatment approach draws upon our previous conceptual papers on MI as well as our&#xD;
      experience with a variety of MI protocols, including two Clinical Trials Network (CTN)&#xD;
      studies of MI. An innovative feature of the &quot;Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy&quot;&#xD;
      manual is that it comprehensively addresses the issues of clients who have achieved sustained&#xD;
      sobriety as well as those still using substances. Thus, it is designed to facilitate&#xD;
      treatment entry and engagement as well as maintenance of the gains made in treatment. MA&#xD;
      dependent clients (N=220) were recruited from New Leaf outpatient treatment in Lafayette,&#xD;
      California. Study participants were randomly assigned to 1) a single session of Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) plus 8 hours of health/nutrition education, or 2) the intensive 9-session&#xD;
      MI intervention. In addition to the study interventions, both groups received standard&#xD;
      outpatient treatment services at New Leaf. Study participants were assessed weekly during the&#xD;
      first 9 weeks of treatment for MA use. More extensive assessments were conducted at treatment&#xD;
      entry and 2-, 4-and 6-month follow-ups. Two therapists were &quot;crossed&quot; to treat clients in&#xD;
      both conditions. Primary outcome measures included Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) for MA use, MA&#xD;
      urinalysis results, and retention in treatment. Secondary outcomes include Addiction Severity&#xD;
      Index scales and the TLFB for alcohol and other drugs. A mediation model will build upon MI&#xD;
      research proposed by Moyers (2005) and our construct of &quot;supportive confrontation&quot; by testing&#xD;
      whether feedback enhanced with warnings about the potential harm of MA use facilitates the&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance, and whether this in turn facilitates better outcome. Clients with MA&#xD;
      dependence are good candidates for a more intensive dose of MI because of their severe&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This proposal responds to PA-07-111, &quot;Behavioral &amp; Integrative Treatment Development Program&quot;&#xD;
      issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Based on promising pilot data, we propose to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of a 9-session Motivational Interviewing (MI) manual for treating&#xD;
      methamphetamine (MA) dependence (Galloway, Polcin, Kielstein, Brown &amp; Mendelson, 2007;&#xD;
      Polcin, Galloway, Palmer &amp; Mains, 2004; Polcin, Brown &amp; Galloway, 2005). (See Appendix A for&#xD;
      a copy of the Intensive and Standard Manuals and Appendix B for our papers describing the&#xD;
      rationale for its structure). The study builds upon a progression in our work from initial&#xD;
      conceptualization of a more intensive model of MI (Polcin, et al., 2004), to development of&#xD;
      the &quot;Higher Dose Motivational Enhancement Therapy Manual&quot; (Polcin, et al., 2005), to&#xD;
      presentation of very promising stage 1 pilot data (Galloway, et al, 2007). The proposed study&#xD;
      represents a logical next step in this research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a meta-analysis of MI studies, Burke, Arkowitz &amp; Menchola (2003) found that higher doses&#xD;
      of MI were associated with better outcome. Based on this finding, they called for new studies&#xD;
      to compare the effectiveness of standard low dose and more intensive MI. This proposal&#xD;
      responds to that call. To date, no direct comparisons between high and low intensity MI have&#xD;
      been published, and we are not aware of any intensive manuals other than the one presented&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposal addresses the aims of the NIDA Program Announcement (PA-07-111) well because the&#xD;
      announcement calls for innovations and refinements of behavioral therapies for understudied&#xD;
      populations. Clients with MA dependence are specifically identified as an understudied&#xD;
      population in need of behavioral therapy trials. MA use is rampant in the Western U.S. and is&#xD;
      growing in other parts of the country as well as oversees (Anglin et al., 2007; Rawson &amp;&#xD;
      Condon, 2007). Studies have shown MA dependent individuals frequently present serious medical&#xD;
      and psychiatric conditions that complicate treatment efforts (Rawson, et al., 2000, 2004).&#xD;
      Based on excellent retention of clients during our pilot testing (see Pilot Study outcomes in&#xD;
      the Preliminary Studies section), we hypothesize intensive MI will be particularly useful in&#xD;
      improving high treatment dropout rates and low engagement among MA dependent clients.&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions are particularly needed because there are currently no evidence&#xD;
      based pharmacological protocols for treating MA dependence (Vocci &amp; Appel, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, our &quot;standard&quot; MI condition is a single session of manual based MI (Martino&#xD;
      et al., 2006) plus eight hours of health/nutrition education using a structured educational&#xD;
      format (Harris, 2003, 2006). A copy of both MI interventions can be found in Appendix A and a&#xD;
      draft version of the nutrition/health intervention can be found in Appendix D. Our&#xD;
      &quot;intensive&quot; MI condition refers to our 9-session manual intervention. As detailed in the&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies Section, the development of our manual, methods for stage 1 pilot&#xD;
      testing, and procedures for training therapists have followed recommendations made by&#xD;
      Rounsaville, Carroll, and Onken (2001) and Carroll et al. (2006). As a stage 2 behavioral&#xD;
      trial, the study includes an assessment of dose-response relationships and has a high&#xD;
      likelihood of illuminating potential mechanisms of action within a single data collection&#xD;
      site. Positive findings here will lead to stage 3 applications examining the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention in community-based settings using multi-site designs that would allow&#xD;
      broader generalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MA dependent participants will be recruited from the New Leaf outpatient treatment program in&#xD;
      Lafayette, California. This data collection site has a history of successfully recruiting MA&#xD;
      dependent clients into research protocols (e.g., Galloway, et. al., 2000; Rawson et. al.,&#xD;
      2004). In addition to receiving one of the MI interventions, all participants will receive&#xD;
      standard outpatient treatment offered at New Leaf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses are detailed below. In addition to comparing treatment&#xD;
      conditions on outcome measures, in an overlaid naturalistic design we will build upon MI&#xD;
      research examining mediators of outcome conducted by Moyers, Miller &amp; Hendickson (2005). We&#xD;
      propose to assess the impact of a modified definition of feedback on the therapeutic alliance&#xD;
      and in turn on MA use. Our definition of feedback includes providing objective information&#xD;
      and personalized feedback to clients, but we add to this our construct of supportive&#xD;
      confrontation (Polcin, 2006a; Polcin, Galloway &amp; Greenfield, 2006; Polcin, Galloway, Bostrom&#xD;
      &amp; Greenfield, 2007; Polcin &amp; Greenfield, 2006). This concept entails providing warnings to&#xD;
      the client about potential harm that might result if action is not taken to address problem&#xD;
      areas. Supportive confrontation is an integral part of feedback in our MI interventions and&#xD;
      we provide data in our Preliminary Studies (see the Measuring Confrontation during Recovery&#xD;
      subheading) indicating that this type of confrontation is experienced as supportive, accurate&#xD;
      and helpful (e.g. Polcin et al., 2006). We also suggest that our findings are consistent with&#xD;
      the work of Moyers, et al. (2005), who found some confrontational interventions were&#xD;
      associated with an enhanced therapeutic alliance when they were delivered from therapists&#xD;
      with a high degree of skill. To avoid destructive interactions that Miller, Benefield and&#xD;
      Tonigan (1993) found to be counterproductive (e.g., argumentation) therapists will &quot;roll with&#xD;
      resistance&quot; when encountering clients who react defensively or reject confrontational&#xD;
      statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To compare MA use and retention in treatment among clients receiving intensive and&#xD;
      standard MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: The intensive MI condition will demonstrate longer retention in treatment,&#xD;
      fewer days of MA use, and fewer positive urine tests than the standard MI condition during&#xD;
      the first 9 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: The intensive MI condition will demonstrate fewer days of MA use and fewer&#xD;
      positive urine tests than the standard MI condition at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To compare Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scales among clients receiving intensive and&#xD;
      standard MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: ASI scores for clients in the intensive condition will be significantly lower&#xD;
      than scores in the standard condition at 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To assess whether feedback enhanced with supportive confrontation directly impacts&#xD;
      outcome and impacts outcome indirectly through a stronger therapeutic alliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.1: Higher Frequency/Extensiveness and Skill Level of Feedback enhanced with&#xD;
      supportive confrontation will decrease MA use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.2: Higher Frequency/Extensiveness and Skill Level of Feedback enhanced with&#xD;
      supportive confrontation will enhance the therapeutic alliance, which will in turn impact MA&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will make repeated measures comparisons between the two treatment conditions for use&#xD;
           of alcohol and other drugs in addition to MA. These will include self-report measures as&#xD;
           well as urine screens and breathalyzer results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will compare intensive and standard MI on services utilization, which assesses use of&#xD;
           additional formal treatment and informal recovery services such as self-help groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will compare longitudinal measures of motivation between the two conditions and&#xD;
           assess whether higher motivation is associated with better outcome. 4) We will compare&#xD;
           HIV risk behaviors among clients receiving intensive and standard MI.&#xD;
