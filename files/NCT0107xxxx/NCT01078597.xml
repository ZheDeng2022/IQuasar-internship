    <textblock>
      A key challenge in the management of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the early&#xD;
      identification of patients that are at risk of developing a severe and destructive disease. A&#xD;
      better understanding of prognostic factors such as anti-CCP and anti-MCV biomarkers, is&#xD;
      needed in order to better identify patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis that are at risk&#xD;
      of developing aggressive diseases. At the present time the prevalence of one such biomarker,&#xD;
      namely anti-MCV, is unknown in an Irish Rheumatoid Arthritis population. This study will&#xD;
      establish the prevalence of anti-MCV in such a population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second challenge in the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis patients is the determination of&#xD;
      the best treatment strategy tailored to individual patient's needs. In routine practice,&#xD;
      treatment approaches are based on the patient history and the availability of clinical&#xD;
      parameters, such as a positive anti-CCP status, which is associated with worst prognostics.&#xD;
      At the present time, the impact of a positive anti-CCP status on patients' management has not&#xD;
      been formally studied in Ireland The proposed study will provide data on the prevalence of&#xD;
      anti-MCV in an Irish RA population and the use of anti-CCP and other clinical parameters&#xD;
      currently used in routine care. In addition, the present study will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      the known anti-CCP status on patients' management. Associations between the anti-CCP and&#xD;
      anti-MCV status and clinical outcome measures will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the present study will have significant implications not only for the&#xD;
      individual patient but also from the societal perspective, since it will enhance the overall&#xD;
      understanding and applications of different treatment approaches based on individual&#xD;
      patients' profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from clinical studies suggest that approximately 73% of patients with Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis present evidences of erosions within 2 years of the diagnosis. Early interventions&#xD;
      with Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapies have been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. Significant differences in mean Sharp scores were observed two&#xD;
      years after the initiation of such treatment regimens. These data support the existence of a&#xD;
      &quot;therapeutic window&quot;, during which the rheumatoid process should be stopped or retarded in&#xD;
      order to prevent further articular damages. Importantly, these observations constituted the&#xD;
      premise of subsequent researches aiming at evaluating the benefits of TNF inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients with early and aggressive rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of soluble biomarkers indicates the occurrence of active changes in the&#xD;
      underlying disease processes. Recently, the OMERACT group has undertaken the task of&#xD;
      developing validation criteria for biomarkers. Validated biomarkers will be considered&#xD;
      reliable surrogate measures of radiological endpoints. C Reactive Protein (CRP) has recently&#xD;
      been validated using those newly developed criteria (ACR 2006). Noteworthy, the association&#xD;
      of CRP with damage endpoints appears to vary based on the use of different anti-rheumatic&#xD;
      medications. Other soluble biomarkers, which are being used in routine care, will be soon&#xD;
      evaluated against those same criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several other biomarkers of interest, including serum MMP-3, urinary CTX-II, serum OPG/RANKL,&#xD;
      serum CEC, and the CPII/C2C ratio, are being extensively evaluated in various clinical&#xD;
      studies. A recent study evaluated antibodies against modified citrullinated vimentin&#xD;
      (anti-MCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors/prognostic markers indicate the presence of a change in the underlying disease&#xD;
      processes. However, their value is mainly related to their reliability at predicting future&#xD;
      changes, such as the clinical onset of the disease, the severity of the disease or associated&#xD;
      complications. In this respect, they are early indicators of future events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies directed towards the Fc portions of IgG. RFs are&#xD;
      found in multiple immunoglobulin isotypes (IgE, IgM, IgA and IgG), however, IgM is the&#xD;
      isotype that is preferentially measured in clinical assays. RFs have long been associated&#xD;
      with the development and the severity of RA. The sensitivity and the specificity of RF in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of RA have been shown to be close to 60% and 79%, respectively. This is rather low&#xD;
      comparatively to other prognostic markers. This is mainly because RF is also detected in&#xD;
      normal healthy individuals as well as in various infections and other rheumatological&#xD;
      illnesses. As a result, its individual diagnostic value appears to be unsatisfactory. This&#xD;
      may be an issue in patients with early and undifferentiated arthritis. In this regard, IgM&#xD;
      RFs has been shown to be positive in 19.3% of RA patients prior to the onset of their&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibodies targeting determinants resulting from the deamination of peptidylarginine to&#xD;
      peptidyl citrulline residues have recently received a great deal of attention. These include&#xD;
      antibodies directed against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and antibodies targeting&#xD;
      in vivo citrullinated proteins, such as anti-keratin antibodies, antiperinuclear factor,&#xD;
      anti-citrullinated (pro)filaggrin and anti-Sa/citrullinated vimentin. The prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive values of anti-CCP antibodies have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. These&#xD;
      results indicate that anti-CCP antibodies are highly predictive of the future development of&#xD;
      RA in both healthy individuals and patients with undifferentiated arthritis. A more recent&#xD;
      study evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic value of determination of levels&#xD;
      of anti-MCV as compared with anti-CCP in an inception cohort of patients with early RA The&#xD;
      findings showed that analysis of anti-MCV yields greater sensitivity and unchanged&#xD;
      specificity as compared with analysis of anti-CCP. And also appears to perform better than&#xD;
      anti-CCP in identifying poor radiographic prognosis in patients with early RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations suggest that different antibodies targeted against citrullinated agents&#xD;
      may differ in their ability to predict poor outcomes. Collectively, these observations&#xD;
      indicate that the predictive values of various predictors may be enhanced when combined with&#xD;
      other predictors/prognostic markers of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the prevalence of anti-MCV in an Irish RA population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the association of anti-MCV with RF and anti-CCP in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of known anti-CCP status (positive or negative) and anti-MCV on&#xD;
           clinical decision-making and the management of patients recently diagnosed with RA.&#xD;
