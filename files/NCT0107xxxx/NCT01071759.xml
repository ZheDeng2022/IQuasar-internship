  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is considered one of the main nutritional deficiency disorders despite the&#xD;
      apparent availability of a high-quality diet even in developed countries, and Iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia (IDA) is the most common form of anemia in the world. IDA during pregnancy has been&#xD;
      associated with adverse health consequences for both the mother and her developing fetus.&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori (Hp) may be the most common bacterial infection worldwide, infecting&#xD;
      almost half of people in developed countries and 80% of people in developing countries. The&#xD;
      available data on the prevalence of Hp infection in Taiwan population was 54.4%. We all know&#xD;
      that infection with Hp is strongly associated with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer, but&#xD;
      recent evidence suggests that Hp is associated with iron deficiency and anemia, although the&#xD;
      mechanisms remain unclear. Till now, only few previous studies specifically have addressed a&#xD;
      potential role of Hp infection on anemia or iron deficiency during pregnancy. Our previous&#xD;
      Research showed, between the Hp infection (+) and Hp infection (-) gravidas, the associations&#xD;
      between the Hp infection and iron deficiency were stronger, although not statistically&#xD;
      significant. This might be due to that we needed more cases and evidences to prove the&#xD;
      relationship between maternal Hp infection and serum iron, ferritin and hemoglobin levels, or&#xD;
      we should further consider the interactions of the particular customs or diet preference of&#xD;
      the Taiwanese gravidas. This longitudinal study will recruit 140 women from the antenatal&#xD;
      care clinics of E-Da Hospital to examine the association between Hp infection and maternal&#xD;
      IDA. The standardized interviews of mothers (anthropometric data, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      medical history, obstetric history, alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and history and&#xD;
      duration of iron supplementation during pregnancy) will be conducted, Hp infection status&#xD;
      will be determined by the urea breath test and IgG enzyme immunoassay, and the measurement of&#xD;
      hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels will be obtained 5 times at various antepartum and&#xD;
      postpartum points of time during pregnancy (routine prenatal visits of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd&#xD;
      trimester, puerperium and 2 weeks after delivery). We hope that we could investigate the&#xD;
      possible role of Hp infection in iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy&#xD;
      in Taiwan, and that early detection and treatment of anemia may reduce the risk of blood&#xD;
      transfusion and perinatal and maternal mortality.&#xD;
