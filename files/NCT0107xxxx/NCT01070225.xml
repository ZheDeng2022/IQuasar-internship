      Current therapies for the management of asthma include inhalers. Types of these medications&#xD;
      (beta agonists), improve asthma symptoms by stimulating areas (receptors) within the human&#xD;
      airway resulting in dilation of the human airway. Whilst these drugs are highly effectively&#xD;
      in the immediate setting their longterm use, constantly stimulation of receptors within the&#xD;
      airway has been associated with increased asthma exacerbations and rare cases of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely medications that block receptors within the human airway (betablockers)have been&#xD;
      avoided in asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reason for this is because of the possible acute airway narrowing that can occur&#xD;
      after soon after administration. However chronic use of betablockers in asthma has recently&#xD;
      been shown to be of benefit in reducing airway inflammation which is of great importance in&#xD;
      improving asthma control and reducing symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this early evidence supporting chronic use of beta blockers in asthma, there is&#xD;
      concern in 2 major regards:their potential to cause acute airway narrowing (irrespective of&#xD;
      longterm benefit) and the possibility that they could block the reliever action of beta&#xD;
      agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to establish how best to reverse the short term effects of a&#xD;
      single dose of beta blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a single centre study, with participants attending the department&#xD;
      on approximately 3 separate visits (including a screening visit) at approximately 1 weekly&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma was originally thought to be associated with an intrinsic defect of β2- adrenoceptor&#xD;
      function tipping the balance towards parasympathetic bronchoconstriction. While β2-agonists&#xD;
      are highly effective for the acute relief of bronchoconstriction, their chronic use is&#xD;
      accompanied by an adaptive reduction in β2ADR numbers and associated desensitisation of&#xD;
      response, resulting in increased exacerbations and rare cases of death. Conversely the&#xD;
      chronic use of β blockers have been shown in murine models to reduce airway inflammation and&#xD;
      mucous metaplasia. Recent work in humans has further demonstrated a potential benefit of β&#xD;
      blockers in asthmatics by demonstrating a significant improvement in airway&#xD;
      hyperresponsiveness to bronchial challenge1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this early evidence supporting chronic use of β blockers in asthma, there is concern&#xD;
      in 2 major regards: their potential to cause acute bronchoconstriction (irrespective of&#xD;
      long-term benefit) and the possibility that they could block the reliever action of&#xD;
      β-agonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-sensitivity of β-adrenoceptors occurs following treatment with long-acting β-agonists.&#xD;
      Previous work in our department has shown that high dose steroids can re-establish the&#xD;
      β-adrenoceptor function following such down-regulation2. It therefore seems plausible that a&#xD;
      similar response may occur following β-blockade (reversing β-blockade and re-establishing&#xD;
      β-agonist sensitivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to gather evidence for the best methods to treat β-blocked patients in&#xD;
      the short term. The investigators therefore wish to examine the effects of acute-β blockade&#xD;
      with low dose propranolol on mild-to-moderate asthmatics. The investigators wish to simulate&#xD;
      airway stress and rescue in acutely β-blocked patients. For safety purposes the investigators&#xD;
      have chosen propranolol due to its short half-life of 3 to 5 hours. Importantly the ability&#xD;
      to achieve airway reversibility and recovery following acute β-blockade will influence the&#xD;
      long term viability of chronic β blockers use in the management of asthma.&#xD;
