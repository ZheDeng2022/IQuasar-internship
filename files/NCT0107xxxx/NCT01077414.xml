      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A person s mental state, personal relationships, or spiritual well-being often change in&#xD;
           many ways during or after cancer. Some of these changes can have a life-changing&#xD;
           positive side, called psycho-socio-spiritual or PSS Healing. For example, a person may&#xD;
           feel mentally stronger or more whole than before their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because researchers are interested in enhancing such experiences in other cancer&#xD;
           patients, there is interest in developing a way to measure PSS Healing that would be&#xD;
           helpful in understanding this phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine and categorize the characteristics of PSS Healing, which could lead to&#xD;
      development of a psychometric instrument to measure it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults who have cancer or have had cancer that was diagnosed after the age of 18 and who&#xD;
      have had at least one strong positive emotional or mental change in relation to the cancer&#xD;
      (e.g., relationships with others, spiritual well-being or faith, thoughts about the meaning&#xD;
      of life, reactions to stress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study design does not involve any treatment or counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be interviewed by a research team member. The one-time interview will&#xD;
           last up to 2.25 hours and will be audiotaped and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews will consist of an in-depth portion to assess the positive changes in&#xD;
           relation to the illness. Participants will then be asked to identify from a list of&#xD;
           short descriptions the ones that best reflect their personal experience of PSS Healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcribed information will be coded and categorized according to standard research&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We identify healing in the context of chronic or life-threatening illness as a&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome consisting of growth or benefit in psychological, social and/or&#xD;
      spiritual dimensions representing improvement well above the patient s pre-morbidity&#xD;
      baseline. This positive outcome often occurs despite substantial suffering during the&#xD;
      illness, even in terminal cases (Kearney 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous phenomenological studies, qualitative descriptions of healing and the processes&#xD;
      by which it develops have not been structured in categories suitable for the development of a&#xD;
      fully validated and standardized psychometric instrument. Also, the relationship of healing&#xD;
      to psychometrically measurable constructs such as posttraumatic growth, resilience, coping,&#xD;
      and acceptance is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This program is to provide (1) a qualitative model of healing-related processes,&#xD;
      (2) phenomenological categories of healing suitable for a psychometric instrument&#xD;
      development, (3) the relationship of healing to other relevant constructs such as trauma,&#xD;
      coping, and adult development, and (4) questionnaire items for healing assessment and (5)&#xD;
      software tools that greatly increase the qualitative analysis speed and rigor of&#xD;
      phenomenological category building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study populations: Two populations of subjects who have experienced a life-threatening&#xD;
      disease or serious chronic illness (cancer or cardiac disease) will be recruited from three&#xD;
      sites. The first population (50 subjects) are individuals with exemplary healing experiences&#xD;
      (life-transforming positive outcomes connected to illness along psychological, social and/or&#xD;
      spiritual dimensions) or in the early stages of healing-related processes. In-depth interview&#xD;
      data from these subjects will empirically help identify endpoint markers and process pathways&#xD;
      of profound healing. The second population (400 subjects) consists of current or past&#xD;
      participants in structured healing or medical rehabilitation programs. In a written&#xD;
      interview, these participants will qualitatively evaluate questionnaire items for identifying&#xD;
      readiness for and progress toward healing using their first-hand, illness-related experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This protocol has a qualitative, phenomenological, natural history design similar to&#xD;
      identifying features of a medical syndrome or psychological disorder. It has two formats of&#xD;
      data collection: in-depth individual interviews of the exemplary healing population, and&#xD;
      self-administered written interviews for current participants in formal healing or&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. In-depth interview sessions have 2 1/4-hour duration with three&#xD;
      components: a 50-minute, in depth phenomenological interview, a 30-minute short-statement&#xD;
      interview (how subjects view healing-related short questionnaire statements), and a 25-minute&#xD;
      related-constructs interview (how their positive outcomes, may be related to personality).&#xD;
      Interview and short-statement analyses consist of standard qualitative methodologies&#xD;
      including transcription, memo-writing, coding, categorization, and modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: None (non-interventional)&#xD;
