  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atelectasis and redistribution of ventilation towards non-dependent lung zones are a common&#xD;
      side effects of general anesthesia. Spontaneous breathing activity (SBA) during mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation may avoid or reduce atelectasis, improving arterial oxygenation; however, it is&#xD;
      unclear whether these effects play a significant role during general anesthesia in patients&#xD;
      with healthy lungs. Earlier studies on ventilation during general anesthesia had to rely on&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) findings. Recent advances in lung imaging technology allow to assess&#xD;
      the regional aeration of the lungs continuously and non-invasive by electrical impedance&#xD;
      technology (EIT). In this work, we will use the EIT to assess ventilation changes from the&#xD;
      time before induction of anesthesia until discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit. Our&#xD;
      main focus is the difference caused by pure positive pressure ventilation (PCV) and assisted&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing (pressure support ventilation, PSV). Our findings would improve our&#xD;
      understanding of the physiology of the lungs during general anesthesia and would help to&#xD;
      improve the standards of respiratory care during anesthesia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atelectasis formation is a common phenomenon during general anaesthesia, occurring in almost&#xD;
      90% of patients (Lundquist, Hedenstierna et al. 1995). In patients in supine position,&#xD;
      atelectasis of dorsal lung zones is usually accompanied by redistribution of ventilation&#xD;
      towards ventral areas (Hedenstierna 2003; Victorino, Borges et al. 2004).The main mechanisms&#xD;
      which contribute to the formation of atelectasis are compression (e.g. in obese patients or&#xD;
      during laparoscopic surgery), absorption (e.g. when high concentrations of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      are used) and reduced surfactant action(Magnusson and Spahn 2003). Atelectasis impairs&#xD;
      oxygenation by reducing the functional residual capacity and by causing right-to-left-shunts.&#xD;
      Consecutively, hypoxemia after extubation is common in daily practice: 20% of patients in a&#xD;
      study experienced desaturations below 92% (Mathes, Conaway et al. 2001), and the risk is even&#xD;
      higher in patients with risk-factors such as obesity or thoraco-abdominal procedures (Russell&#xD;
      and Graybeal 1993; Xue, Li et al. 1999). Hypoxemic events prolong the stay in PACU, cause&#xD;
      more ICU admissions and increase the incidence of cardiac complications (Rosenberg, Rasmussen&#xD;
      et al. 1990; Gill, Wright et al. 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several measures to prevent or treat atelectasis in ventilated patients have been&#xD;
      investigated, such as PEEP (Brismar, Hedenstierna et al. 1985; Tokics, Hedenstierna et al.&#xD;
      1987; Neumann, Rothen et al. 1999), recruitment maneuvers (Neumann, Rothen et al. 1999) and&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation (Putensen, Rasanen et al. 1994; Putensen,&#xD;
      Mutz et al. 1999). The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is ideally suited for spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing during general anaesthesia because of its low resistance. A large survey found that&#xD;
      more than half of the routine cases with an LMA are performed under spontaneous ventilation&#xD;
      (Verghese and Brimacombe 1996), while positive pressure ventilation is equally acceptable.&#xD;
      With regard to the prevention of atelectasis, spontaneous ventilation could be advantageous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most works on atelectasis formation during general anaesthesia used CT. Although CT is a gold&#xD;
      standard for quantification of lung aeration, it can only provide data on single time points&#xD;
      and is not suitable for measurements during routine cases. In recent years, the electrical&#xD;
      impedance tomography (EIT) has evolved into a versatile tool, which allows detailed insights&#xD;
      into ventilation and perfusion conditions of the lung (Bodenstein, David et al. 2009). EIT&#xD;
      allows continuous assessment of lung aeration, is non-invasive and can easily be used as a&#xD;
      research and monitoring tool during routine cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that compared with positive pressure ventilation (PPV), pressure support&#xD;
      ventilation (PSV) during general anaesthesia reduces the extent of redistribution as detected&#xD;
      by EIT during and after the procedure.&#xD;
