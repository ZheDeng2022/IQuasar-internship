  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of slow-release oral morphine&#xD;
      (SROM) treatment in patients that previously have been treated with methadone. Efficacy is&#xD;
      assessed by the frequency of by-consumption of illicit substances. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint in this study is the proportion of positive urine tests for by-consumption of target&#xD;
      substances per subject. Target substances are defined as all opioids except the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportions are compared between substitution with methadone and SROM treatment in a&#xD;
      crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effects of SROM on retention rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By-consumption of other drugs (cocaine, alcohol, cannabis, benzodiazepines).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Occurring psychopathological and somatic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effect of treatment on the ECG (QTc prolongation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Group characterisation of patients that is keen to change the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The change in dosage of treatment over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Self-assessed craving for Opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Self-assessed satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Nature, frequency and severity of occurring adverse events in the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Assessment of safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design (Methodology):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, multinational phase III study. It is conducted using a randomised,&#xD;
      open label cross-over design. The subjects will be randomised to either 10 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with methadone or SROM. After an adjustment phase of one week they first will be medicated&#xD;
      for 10 weeks with the treatment to which SUB9001 - Integrated Study Protocol 9/58 June 13,&#xD;
      2009 they have been randomised. The cross-over, in which all subjects change to their&#xD;
      opposite treatment, will serve for an additional adjustment phase of one week. After the&#xD;
      second and new adjustment phase they are treated for 10 weeks with the newly adjusted&#xD;
      medication. After the end of week 22 all participants continue with or switch back to SROM&#xD;
      for another 6 month (week 23 to 47).&#xD;
