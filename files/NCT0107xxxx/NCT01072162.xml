  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, five-period, balanced crossover study conducted in&#xD;
      approximately 40 healthy adult subjects enrolled at one study center in the USA. Subjects&#xD;
      receive five eltrombopag treatments: tablet fasted, Powder for Oral Suspension (PfOS) fasted,&#xD;
      PfOS with a high calcium meal, PfOS 2 hours prior to a high calcium meal, and PfOS 2 hours&#xD;
      after a high calcium meal, and each treatment is a single 25 mg dose. There is a 10 to 14 day&#xD;
      washout between periods, and between the last dose of study drug and the follow-up visit.&#xD;
      During each treatment period, subjects undergo serial PK sampling over 72 hours for&#xD;
      measurement of plasma eltrombopag concentrations. Safety is assessed by vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      safety laboratory assessments, and adverse events reporting.&#xD;

             and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Capable of giving written informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Body weight ≥ 50kg (110 lbs) for men and ≥ 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass&#xD;
             index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A platelet count within normal range and not &gt; 400,000 plt/uL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects, who are not surgically sterile, must agree on abstinence or to use a&#xD;
             double barrier method, such as, a condom plus spermicidal agent&#xD;
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). This criterion must be followed from the time of&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is neither pregnant nor lactating,&#xD;
             and falls into one of the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  non-childbearing potential including pre-menopausal females with documented&#xD;
                  (medical report verification) hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  post-menopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for greater than one year&#xD;
                  and having serum estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone levels consistent&#xD;
                  with menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  child-bearing potential with negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;

                  methods from screening or at least two weeks prior to first dose (whichever is&#xD;
                  earlier) until the follow-up visit. Recognized non-hormonal contraceptive methods&#xD;
                  include: complete abstinence from intercourse, male partner sterilization, two&#xD;
                  forms of barrier contraception (e.g. condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps with spermicide), or intrauterine device (IUD), or&#xD;
                  intrauterine system (IUS) with a &lt; 1% failure rate stated in the product label.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any previous history of deep vein thrombosis or any other thromboembolic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to abnormal platelet number or function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clotting factor abnormalities associated with hypercoagulability, specifically Factor&#xD;
             V Leiden, Protein C or Protein S deficiency or antithrombin III deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Elevated blood pressure (BP) at screening (systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg, diastolic &gt; 85 mm&#xD;
             Hg). If the subject's BP is elevated on the first measurement, complete two additional&#xD;
             BP measurements two minutes apart and average the three assessments to evaluate this&#xD;
             criteria. If averaged BP exceeds the safety criteria, the subject should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prolapse, significant heart murmur or&#xD;
             vascular bruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prolonged QTc interval (Bazett's) at screening (for females &gt; 450 msec and for males &gt;&#xD;
             430 msec). If the QTc interval is prolonged on the initial ECG, then complete two&#xD;
             additional ECGs 5 minutes apart and take the average QTc measurements of all three&#xD;
             ECGs to evaluate this criteria. If averaged QTc exceeds the safety criteria, the&#xD;
             subject should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects currently receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT).&#xD;

         12. History of alcohol consumption in the past six months exceeding 7 units/week for women&#xD;
             and 14 units/week for men (where 1 unit = 5 ounces of wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5&#xD;
             ounces of hard liquor).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking at screening or pre-dose (Day -1).&#xD;
             History of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dosing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs (including aspirin and non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements within&#xD;
             seven days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer, such as St. John's&#xD;
             Wort) or five half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication, unless in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the medication will&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subjects who have donated plasma within seven days prior to the screening visit or&#xD;
             where participation in this study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500&#xD;
             mL within a 56-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof.&#xD;
