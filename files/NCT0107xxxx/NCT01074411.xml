  <brief_title>Intraperitoneal Bortezomib and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of intraperitoneal bortezomib when&#xD;
      given together with intraperitoneal carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian epithelial&#xD;
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that is persistent or has come&#xD;
      back. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Bortezomib may help carboplatin work better by making&#xD;
      tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Infusing bortezomib and carboplatin directly into the&#xD;
      abdomen (intraperitoneal) may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of&#xD;
      intraperitoneal (IP) bortezomib (BTZ) when administered with intraperitoneal carboplatin in&#xD;
      women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that is&#xD;
      persistent or recurrent and who have failed primary therapy and at least one second-line&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the safety of administering BTZ in combination with carboplatin by the IP&#xD;
      route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate objective tumor response rate as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BTZ and carboplatin when administered&#xD;
      intraperitoneally once every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the frequency of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) when&#xD;
      administered as an intraperitoneal infusion in the context of recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib intraperitoneally (IP) and carboplatin IP on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
