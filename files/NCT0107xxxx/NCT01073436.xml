  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML)&#xD;
      previously treated with interferon-alpha (IFN) and presently on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (TKI) (imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, or nilotinib) with achievement of a complete cytogenetic&#xD;
      and at least a major molecular remission, are able to discontinue therapy and maintain a&#xD;
      durable remission. Relapse-free survival (RFS) rate at 1 year after discontinuation of TKI&#xD;
      will be the measurement of this objective.&#xD;

    <study_pop>

        Diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic&#xD;
             myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have received prior therapy with interferon-alpha for their CML, for a&#xD;
             period of at least 2 years, and achieved at least a partial cytogenetic response on&#xD;
             this therapy, defined as 1% - 34% Ph+ cells in metaphase, present in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be actively receiving treatment for their CML with a TKI (imatinib&#xD;
             mesylate, dasatinib, nilotinib). If patients are receiving dasatinib or nilotinib,&#xD;
             this can only be for reasons other than imatinib-resistant CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have an ongoing complete hematologic response (CHR) on a TKI, defined as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC ≤ 10 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &lt; 450,000 x 109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No evidence of disease-related symptoms and extramedullary disease, including the&#xD;
                  liver and spleen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on a TKI for a minimum of&#xD;
             one year leading up to enrollment. Complete cytogenetic response is defined as 0% Ph+&#xD;
             cells in metaphase, in the bone marrow and/or a negative peripheral blood FISH&#xD;
             analysis for the BCR/ABL gene fusion, and an ongoing CCyR must be confirmed by bone&#xD;
             marrow aspirate cytogenetics and/or peripheral blood FISH for BCR/ABL within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of discontinuing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have at least a major molecular remission on a TKI for a minimum of 1&#xD;
             year, present on 2 consecutive analyses, performed at least 3 months apart, in the 6&#xD;
             to 12 months leading up to enrollment. Major molecular remission is defined as ≥ 3 log&#xD;
             reduction from a standard baseline value (equivalent to a BCR-ABL/ABL of ≤ 0.1%) in&#xD;
             BCR/ABL transcript by quantitative RT-PCR performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow&#xD;
             aspirate. Complete molecular remission is defined as a negative quantitative RT-PCR&#xD;
             (QPCR) analysis for BCR/ABL, present on 2 consecutive analyses, performed at least 3&#xD;
             months apart, in the 6 to 12 months leading up to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be eighteen years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Appendix 13.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and standard&#xD;
             alternative therapy. All patients must sign and give written informed consent in&#xD;
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had prior progression of their CML to accelerated phase or blast&#xD;
             crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have previously undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients receiving dasatinib or nilotinib due to a prior history of imatinib-resistant&#xD;
             CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered&#xD;
             potentially unreliable.&#xD;
