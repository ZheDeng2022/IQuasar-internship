      The purpose of the study is to investigate if multiple (up to four) intravenous injections of&#xD;
      Xofigo (Alpharadin) have any clinically relevant effect on bone markers in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with bone dominant disease who have progressed on endocrine therapy and are no&#xD;
      longer considered suitable for endocrine therapy. In addition the safety of Xofigo&#xD;
      (Alpharadin) will be assessed.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is female, and either post-menopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1&#xD;
             year) or surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or&#xD;
             documented hysterectomy) or in therapy-induced premature menopause with LHRH agonists.&#xD;
             If of childbearing potential the result of a urine human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             pregnancy test, performed on the same day as and with the result known before study&#xD;
             drug administration, must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological evidence of primary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone dominant disease (with or without metastases in soft tissue, lymph nodes and/or&#xD;
             skin) with at least one non-irradiated bone metastasis on planar bone&#xD;
             scintigraphy/SPECT ± CT within previous the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has unequivocally progressed on endocrine therapy and further benefit from&#xD;
             endocrine therapy is considered unlikely (progression must be documented based on&#xD;
             imaging and/or other clinically relevant information).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been on bisphosphonate therapy for at least 3 months prior to treatment&#xD;
             start and no change to bisphosphonate therapy is expected during the treatment phase&#xD;
             of the study, or patient is not being treated with bisphosphonates, and such treatment&#xD;
             is not planned to start during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Latest endocrine therapy stopped at least 2 weeks prior to treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS 0 - 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient fulfils the following certain laboratory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the administration of&#xD;
             Alpharadin, or is scheduled to receive one during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or external beam radiation therapy within the&#xD;
             last 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug, or has not recovered from acute&#xD;
             ARs as a result of such therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is likely to require chemotherapy or immunotherapy within the 16 weeks treatment&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of imminent or established spinal cord compression based on clinical findings&#xD;
             and/or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of other currently active (relapse within the last 3 years) malignancy&#xD;
             (except non-melanoma skin cancer) that are not breast cancer metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of unequivocal visceral metastases requiring chemotherapy treatment in the&#xD;
             next 6 months, based on Investigator's judgement. Brain metastases are allowed only if&#xD;
             well controlled and if not associated with symptoms. Treatment for brain metastasis&#xD;
             should have been completed at least 8 weeks prior to treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other serious illness or medical condition, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinical heart failure severe enough to cause marked limitation of activity, and&#xD;
                  who is only comfortable at rest; or heart failure more severe than this (NYHA&#xD;
                  Heart Failure Class III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow myelodysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unmanageable faecal incontinence&#xD;
