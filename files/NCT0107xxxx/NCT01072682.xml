  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety of a selective cytopheretic device&#xD;
      (SCD) in patients that are on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute renal&#xD;
      failure (ARF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure is a condition where the kidneys are not capable of producing adequate&#xD;
      urine. Therefore, another way to remove waste from the body is needed to hopefully allow time&#xD;
      for the kidneys to heal. One method of removing waste from the body is called Continuous&#xD;
      Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) or variations of that therapy. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the device while it is connected to the CRRT tubing for up to 7 days. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed up until day 60 following the treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>To evaluate the safety of the SCD treatment after up to seven consecutive 24 hour SCD treatments compared to historic data on in-hospital mortality and on all cause mortality at day 28, and day 60 following treatment.</measure>

    <measure>To assess the effect of SCD treatment on various measures of patient clinical outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 following treatment end</time_frame>
    <description>Recording of clinical values such as vital signs, laboratory tests, adverse events, and the need for further dialysis will be tested.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the integrity of the SCD device and patient safety in SCD treatments from the time of initiation of therapy to as many as seven consecutive 24-hour SCD treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60 following treatment end</time_frame>
    <description>This will be done by seeing if the SCD requires changing more often than expected or if there is evidence of clotting.</description>

    <description>The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter cartridge. The device is connected in series to a commercially available Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) device. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through this space and is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit. Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.</description>
