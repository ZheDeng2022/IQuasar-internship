  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to obtain a pharmacokinetic profile (i.e. amount of drug in the&#xD;
      blood over time) of Omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with stable heart failure.&#xD;

      This study was conducted by Amgen as the IND holder, with Cytokinetics as a collaborator. Due&#xD;
      to the termination of the collaboration agreement between Amgen and Cytokinetics in May 2021&#xD;
      and subsequent transfer of the omecamtiv mecarbil IND from Amgen to Cytokinetics,&#xD;
      Cytokinetics is now listed as the sponsor.&#xD;

             inhibitor and/or an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) at doses shown to be&#xD;
             efficacious in Heart Failure (HF) trials, unless not tolerated. Stable medical therapy&#xD;
             is defined as having no new HF drug class introduced 4 weeks prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             although doses of all drugs may be adjusted throughout the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considered to be an appropriate candidate for study enrollment as determined by the&#xD;

             within 1 week following the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil, and she is using highly&#xD;
             effective methods of birth control. Postmenopausal female is defined as 12 continuous&#xD;
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea confirmed by a serum follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) result &gt; 40mIU/mL, or at least 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy (with&#xD;
             or without hysterectomy) as documented in medical history (verified with an operative&#xD;
             note, if available)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For male patients only: Male patients agree for the duration of the study and 11 weeks&#xD;
             after the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil to use a condom during sexual intercourse&#xD;
             with female partners who are of reproductive potential and to have female partners use&#xD;
             an additional effective means of contraception (eg, diaphragm plus spermicide, or oral&#xD;
             contraceptives) or the male subject must agree to abstain from sexual intercourse for&#xD;
             the duration of the study and 11 weeks after the last dose of omecamtiv mecarbil.&#xD;
