      The intent of this study is to describe the proportion of trauma patients requiring oxygen&#xD;
      before hospital arrival, the amount of oxygen they require, and whether or not the oxygen is&#xD;
      beneficial to outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients in the United States frequently receive high-flow high-concentration&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen in the pre-hospital setting, yet their physiologic need is rarely known.&#xD;
      Providing oxygen to everyone regardless of need may seem straightforward, but the practice&#xD;
      has extensive implications in logistically challenging areas such as a combat arena or mass&#xD;
      casualty event, and is not supported by care guidelines. Indeed, too much oxygen can be&#xD;
      harmful for some patients.1, 2 If it is the case, that not all trauma patients require&#xD;
      oxygen, this would decrease the logistical burden of providing oxygen in the pre-hospital&#xD;
      environment. No study has yet been performed that describes the proportion of patients&#xD;
      requiring oxygen, the amount of oxygen they require, and whether or not oxygen is beneficial&#xD;
      to outcomes. This prospective observational cohort investigation aims to bridge the knowledge&#xD;
      gap surrounding the need and possible benefits or harms arising from oxygen therapy. In our&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems, the written standard of care is to provide oxygen&#xD;
      only to maintain oxygen saturation at 95% or when hemorrhagic shock or traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      are suspected.3 We will observe patterns of oxygen treatment and outcome for patients treated&#xD;
      according to this written standard of care, and compare this to the treatment and outcomes&#xD;
      for patients transported by EMS units who continue their usual practice pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify the proportion of trauma patients who are hypoxemic or who have traumatic brain&#xD;
           injury or hemorrhagic shock at the time of initial EMS contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify the proportion of trauma patients who develop hypoxemia or hemorrhagic shock&#xD;
           while in the pre-hospital setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify differences in clinically important outcomes associated with treatments driven&#xD;
           by written standard of care compared with the usual practice pattern of EMS units. These&#xD;
           outcomes include requirement for advanced airway management, hospital and intensive care&#xD;
           unit lengths of stay, and disposition (including in-hospital and 30-day mortality)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the amount of oxygen (Liters per minute) required to reverse hypoxemia&#xD;
