  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal, inherited disorder among Caucasians. Choline&#xD;
      is an essential vitamin and as a methyl donor is critically needed to support the normal&#xD;
      metabolism. Our previous studies have demonstrated that children with CF have depleted levels&#xD;
      of choline. The purpose of this study is to supply a choline supplement to children with CF&#xD;
      to see if their nutrition and methyl status can be improved.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, repeated measures study involving 34 children with CF who will&#xD;
      take a supplement of water soluble choline bitartrate, 2 gm/day with meals for 6 months. The&#xD;
      baseline (day 0) results for each child will serve as his/her own control, and assessments&#xD;
      will be made at 3 months and 6 months choline supplementation and again 3 months after&#xD;
      stopping choline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement will be provided as capsules containing 250 mg choline bitartrate. 4 capsules&#xD;
      will be taken with or immediately before each of two meals per day: breakfast and dinnertime&#xD;
      meals, providing 1 gm of supplemental choline each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will be enrolled by description of the project to the child and their parent(s)&#xD;
      at a CF clinic appointment. Body weight, height and blood pressure will be measured and&#xD;
      routine blood work including liver enzymes, hematology, serum zinc, selenium and vitamins A&#xD;
      and E will be completed as part of the clinic appointment. The hematology and clinical&#xD;
      chemistry will be done by the Hematopathology and Clinical Chemistry labs at the B.C.'s&#xD;
      Children's Hospital. CF genotype, gender, birth date, hematology, clinical chemistry,&#xD;
      anthropometry, nutritional measures, pulmonary function test results, chest X-Ray and/or CT&#xD;
      scans, pancreatic function test results (fecal elastase, chymotrypsin or secretin-CCK),&#xD;
      medications and supplements (including enzymes, vitamins, minerals, nutrition supplements &amp;&#xD;
      Natural Health Products) and where available, liver ultrasound and biopsy reports will be&#xD;
      collected from chart data. Information in the subject's medical charts relating to antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, duration of illnesses, hospitalization and diagnosis will be reviewed to ensure the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pulmonary function by computer assisted spirometry which includes the measures&#xD;
      of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced&#xD;
      mid-expiratory flow (FEF 25-75) is completed for all children as part of each regularly&#xD;
      scheduled clinic visit and the results collected for this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  children aged 5-17 yr with proven CF and known genotype&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with stable pulmonary disease, are outpatients with no hospitalizations or changes to&#xD;
             antibiotic regiment during the previous 1 month and not receiving any parenteral&#xD;
             nutrition&#xD;
&#xD;

             containing compounds, experimental drugs or any aerosol or oral interventions designed&#xD;
             to deliver or increase glutathione or receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroidal&#xD;
             medications. E.g prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are not 5-17 years of age, do not have CF or have the medical condition&#xD;
