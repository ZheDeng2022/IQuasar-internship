      This proposal responds to Request for Applications RFA ( Rapid Founding Award)-MH ( Mental&#xD;
      Health)-08-131, which seeks applications that propose to enrich pre-existing resources for&#xD;
      schizophrenia in the NIMH ( National Institute of Mental Health) Human Genetics Initiative&#xD;
      and to apply genomic methods to further our understanding of the molecular etiology of the&#xD;
      disorder. The overarching aims of this proposal are to quickly and cost-effectively ascertain&#xD;
      a large sample of trio families affected by schizophrenia, and to discover causal variants&#xD;
      for the disorder in the first family-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the&#xD;
      disorder. In Taiwan, there is no such kind of policy to support this kind of GWAS study as it&#xD;
      is a very expensive study, including collecting large family samples and genome-wide SNP&#xD;
      scanning. We, thus, collaborate with Professor Ming T, Tsuang and his extended subcontracted&#xD;
      researchers to apply for this project. We, the research team in Taiwan, will collect 3800&#xD;
      trio families (11400 subjects) of schizophrenia. In our recently completed NIMH-funded&#xD;
      Genetic Linkage Study of Schizophrenia (R01MH059624; USA PI: Ming T. Tsuang; Taiwan PI:&#xD;
      Hai-Gwo Hwu), the investigators established a large and efficient ascertainment network and&#xD;
      infrastructure in Taiwan, which will again be utilized and expanded in the proposed study.&#xD;
      Through additional ascertainment within this framework, the investigators will collect an&#xD;
      aggregate sample with adequate power for detecting in a GWAS those variants that make even&#xD;
      small contributions to the risk for the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will meet the overarching goals of this project by accomplishing several&#xD;
      Specific Aims, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rapidly ascertain schizophrenia trio families from ten Taiwanese clinical ascertainment&#xD;
           sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Supplement NIMH Genetics Initiative collections by sending all clinical data and&#xD;
           biomaterials to the appropriate repositories;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the association of schizophrenia with a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphisms (SNPs) and their constituent haplotypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotypes such as age at onset ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform a genome-wide survey for copy-number variations related to schizophrenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Test for gene-gene interactions (epistasis); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Test for gene-environment interactions, such as the well-established effect of season of&#xD;
           birth.&#xD;

      Over the past four decades, researchers have become increasingly certain that schizophrenia&#xD;
      has a complex, multifactorial etiology. Although many twin studies confirm that genes play a&#xD;
      substantial role in the etiology of this disabling disorder,5 genome-wide linkage analysis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia have produced conflicting results. While many of these studies have identified&#xD;
      chromosomal regions showing some evidence for linkage to schizophrenia, no finding has been&#xD;
      consistently replicated. Given the high heritability of schizophrenia,5 the failure of&#xD;
      linkage methods to find susceptibility genes suggests that these genes each have very small,&#xD;
      incremental effects on the expression of the disorder. Risch and Merikangas6 showed that for&#xD;
      genes of small effect, the power of linkage studies will be low but the power of association&#xD;
      studies will be high. Although meta-analysis of candidate gene association studies have&#xD;
      implicated some genes, these findings (even if confirmed by larger studies) would only&#xD;
      account for a small fraction of schizophrenia's heritability. These considerations suggest&#xD;
      that a genome-wide association scan would be an effective method for finding schizophrenia&#xD;
      susceptibility genes. To that end, the investigators have designed a multi-stage analytic&#xD;
      plan which involves rapid continued ascertainment of probands and family members from an&#xD;
      established clinical ascertainment network in Taiwan, performing a genome-wide association&#xD;
      scan (GWAS) on this large sample of affected nuclear families, and pooling the novel GWAS&#xD;
      results from this project with those from existing case-control GWAS studies of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators propose a series of specific&#xD;
      aims, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Supplement our previously collected sample of 1,200 Han Chinese schizophrenia-affected&#xD;
           nuclear families from Taiwan by rapidly screening and collecting an additional 3,800&#xD;
           trios from eleven ascertainment sites in Taiwan;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the association of schizophrenia with a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphisms (SNPs) and their constituent haplotypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a genome-wide survey for copy-number variations related to schizophrenia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Test for gene-gene interactions and epistasis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Test for gene-environment interactions, such as the well-established effect of season of&#xD;
           birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotypes, such as age at onset; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Enhance the NIMH Genetics Initiative collections by sending all clinical data,&#xD;
           biomaterials, and genotypes to the appropriate repositories, and completing a&#xD;
           meta-analysis of our family-based GWAS data and those from existing case-control GWASs&#xD;
           of schizophrenia in the repository;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above aims achieve the goals of the RFA in several ways. First, the proposed work would&#xD;
      markedly enrich the existing resources of the NIMH Human Genetics Initiative, especially the&#xD;
      current pool of schizophrenia-affected nuclear families. Not only would the data and&#xD;
      biomaterials from this project enrich the NIMH repositories, the study has been designed to&#xD;
      be readily combinable with those already in the repositories to boost the power available for&#xD;
      detecting genes with small effects on risk. Further, the proposed project would apply the&#xD;
      latest genomic research methods to further our understanding of the molecular etiology of the&#xD;
      disorder. Lastly, by capitalizing on an existing clinical infrastructure and an efficient&#xD;
      screening and assessment protocol, the investigators will obtain a well-powered sample in a&#xD;
      very rapid and cost-effective manner.&#xD;
