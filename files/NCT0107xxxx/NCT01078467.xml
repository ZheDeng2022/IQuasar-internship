      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two important properties distinguish the healing process of skin wounds from that of&#xD;
           wounds of the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral mucosa). Although the skin and the&#xD;
           oral mucosa tissues are similar in nature, oral mucosa have more rapid healing and a&#xD;
           lack of scar tissue formation. However, oral wound healing in general has been poorly&#xD;
           studied, and more information is needed to determine how specific aspects of the oral&#xD;
           environment affect the healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in identifying various factors that contribute to oral wound&#xD;
           healing. Studying this process would help researchers explore procedures to accelerate&#xD;
           the healing of critically-sized oral lesions formed by trauma, surgery, radiation&#xD;
           therapy, infection, and other damage to the mouth. In addition, research into scar-free&#xD;
           healing could be applied to other mucosal sites to promote healing and minimize&#xD;
           unsightly scars that may compromise the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To identify the specific factors that enable rapid and nearly scar-free healing of oral&#xD;
      mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy male volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular cigarette, cigar, and pipe smokers; occasional smokers who smoke more than 1 day&#xD;
           a week or have smoked in the prior month; users of chewing tobacco or betel nut; and&#xD;
           heavy drinkers (three or more alcoholic drinks per day) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a medical history and examination, and will provide blood samples&#xD;
           at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide oral mucosa samples from the inside of the cheek, taken using&#xD;
           a dermal punch. At the same time, participants will provide skin biopsy samples of&#xD;
           approximately the same size. After the skin and oral mucosa samples are taken,&#xD;
           participants will be divided into three groups for follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: No further samples will be collected. This group will help document the normal&#xD;
           healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: A second, slightly larger biopsy, which will include the area of the first&#xD;
           biopsy, will be taken on day 3. Both skin and oral mucosa biopsies will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: A second, slightly larger biopsy will be taken on day 6, in a similar way as&#xD;
           described for Group 2. Both skin and oral mucosa biopsies will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wounds will be photographed with a digital camera on days 3, 6, 9, 13, and 15; and the&#xD;
           healing will be monitored at the scheduled clinic visits.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two important properties distinguish the process of healing of oral mucosa wounds from those&#xD;
      of the skin: more rapid healing and the absence of scar tissue formation. This is remarkable&#xD;
      given the apparent similarities of the two tissues. There are, however, prominent differences&#xD;
      in the healing environment, such as hydration, growth factor availability, inflammatory&#xD;
      response, and microbial exposure. Knowledge as to the causal contribution of each of these&#xD;
      factors to the differential healing response of the two epithelia is mostly anecdotal, and&#xD;
      oral wound healing has generally been poorly studied. This study seeks to provide a global&#xD;
      molecular definition of oral wound healing in comparison to that of the skin. The overall aim&#xD;
      will be to identify the specific factors that enable rapid and nearly scar-free healing of&#xD;
      oral mucosa. Identification of these physiological and molecular determinants will have&#xD;
      widespread implications for human oral health. Among others, it would provide venues for the&#xD;
      targeted exploration of procedures to accelerate the healing of critically-sized oral lesions&#xD;
      formed by trauma, surgery, radiation therapy, infection, and other oral pathologies, which,&#xD;
      if untreated, lead to permanent disability and dysfunction. Moreover, pathways and/or&#xD;
      molecules identified in these studies which may facilitate rapid, scar-less healing could be&#xD;
      considered for application to non-oral mucosal sites to promote healing and minimize&#xD;
      unsightly scars, which may also compromise the functional integrity of the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are significant differences in gene and protein expression between wound healing&#xD;
           in skin and oral mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recruitment of inflammatory cells associated with a large up-regulation of&#xD;
           inflammation-associated genes, including cytokines and chemokines, in the epithelial&#xD;
           cells of skin wounds may account for these differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are specific gene programs that can explain the presence of significant scarring&#xD;
           in skin tissues but not in oral mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this pilot study proposal is to establish the gene and protein&#xD;
      expression profiles during the early stages (1-6 days) of normal oral wound repair. By&#xD;
      comparing these profiles with those of cutaneous wound healing, we may be able to identify&#xD;
      molecules exclusive to oral wound repair that could represent biomarkers of the healing&#xD;
      process or serve as new therapeutic targets in pathological wound healing and cancer. One&#xD;
      specific hypothesis to be tested is that the level of expression of pro-inflammatory gene&#xD;
      networks by wound-infiltrating keratinocytes constitutes the most significant difference&#xD;
      between the human oral and cutaneous wound transcriptomes. The specific hypothesis has been&#xD;
      developed from data obtained from our recent complementary oral and skin wound healing&#xD;
      studies in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male volunteers age 18 to 40 will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral mucosa samples: A sterile 3-mm dermal punch will be used to create uniform,&#xD;
      full-thickness biopsy in the mucosa of the cheek just above the occlusal plane. Circular&#xD;
      pieces of tissue of approximately 2 mm in depth will be removed on the day of biopsy (day 1).&#xD;
      These subjects will be subsequently be randomly grouped as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: no further samples will be collected; pictures will be taken on days 3, 6, 9, 13,&#xD;
      and 15 (see Timetable). This group will help document the normal healing process under the&#xD;
      conditions of the present study, including the lack of scaring in the area selected for the&#xD;
      initial wound in the oral mucosa as compared with the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: a second biopsy will be taken on day 3, which will include the area of the first&#xD;
      biopsy with sterile 5 mm punch, following the same procedure as described for day 0; pictures&#xD;
      will be taken according to the schedule set in the Timetable. This second biopsy will enabled&#xD;
      sampling the healing area induced by the first biopsy. By selecting a punch size two&#xD;
      millimeters wider and taking a sample concentric to the first one, we can assure complete&#xD;
      removal of the area of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: a second biopsy will be taken on day 6, respectively, in a similar way as described&#xD;
      for Group 2; pictures will be taken according to the Timetable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin samples: In parallel to the oral biopsies, skin biopsies of similar size and depth as&#xD;
      the oral biopsy from the same subjects will be obtained from the axillary region following&#xD;
      the same schedule and procedure, including a second biopsy for groups 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wounds will be photographed with a digital camera and the healing monitored at clinic visits&#xD;
      per schedule above. The excised tissues in each case will be immediately bisected on ice;&#xD;
      half of the sample will be fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and embedded in paraffin for standard&#xD;
      histology and immunohistochemistry, and the remaining half will be placed in OCT-filled&#xD;
      plastic base molds, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 (Infinite)C until&#xD;
      processed for genomic and proteomic analysis.&#xD;
