  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignant tumor of infancy. Approximately 60% of NB&#xD;
      patients are clinically diagnosed as the stage IV disease and have a very poor prognosis with&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rate no more than 30%. Molecular markers of NB have great impacts on the&#xD;
      tumor behavior. MYCN amplification is the most well-known marker to predict a poor outcome in&#xD;
      NB patients. However, how MYCN affects the NB cell behavior remains unknown. In our&#xD;
      preliminary studies, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the differential gene expression&#xD;
      in 10 NB tumors with MYCN amplification and 10 with normal MYCN copy number. We found that&#xD;
      aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) reversely correlated with the MYCN expression. This&#xD;
      relationship was verified in 83 NB tumor samples. In addition, positive AHR expression by&#xD;
      immunostaining of NB tumors predicted a favorable prognosis. These lines of evidence&#xD;
      demonstrate that AHR not only relates to the MYCN expression but also plays an important role&#xD;
      in the tumorigenesis of NB. Therefore in this project we aim at further studying the&#xD;
      relationship between AHR and MYCN. In addition, the possible role of AHR in the tumorigenesis&#xD;
      of NB will be clarified. Specifically, we propose a 3-year project with the following three&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I. Determine the molecular relationship between AHR and MYCN expression. AHR has been&#xD;
      shown to suppress the E2F1 expression. E2F1 reversely has been found to upregulate the&#xD;
      expression of MYCN. In our preliminary microarray study, we also found that the expression&#xD;
      E2F1 positively correlated with the MYCN expression but inversely correlated with the&#xD;
      expression of AHR. Therefore, NB cells will be transfected with AHR expression vector or AHR&#xD;
      siRNA, then the associated E2F1 and MYCN expression will be examined to clarify if AHR could&#xD;
      regulate MYCN expression via E2F1. Furthermore, the E2F1 levels will also be manipulated to&#xD;
      determine if the effect of AHR on MYCN depends on E2F1. In addition, the E2F1 expression in&#xD;
      NB tumor samples will also be examined to clarify its in vivo role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II. Determine the effect of AHR expression on the NB cell behavior. The baseline AHR&#xD;
      expression levels in several NB cell lines will be examined. AHR is then overexpressed by&#xD;
      gene transfection in NB cells. The cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation after&#xD;
      AHR overexpression are evaluated. Furthermore the AHR expression in normal neuron cells is&#xD;
      also examined, and suppressed by siRNA to if downregulation of AHR could lead to cancer&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim III. Determine if AHR could be a target of gene therapy for NB. NB cells with either&#xD;
      normal MYCN or MYCN amplification before and after AHR gene transfection are inoculated into&#xD;
      nude mice to demonstrate the effect of AHR expression on NB cells behavior in vivo. AHR is&#xD;
      then transfected into the wild type NB tumor to see if the tumor growth could be suppressed&#xD;
      by AHR expression. Then wild type tumor and tumors transfected with AHR are subjected&#xD;
      microarray analysis to compare with the human tumor data set for evaluation of gene&#xD;
      expression changes along with differential AHR expression. Altogether, our studies will not&#xD;
      only establish the relationship between AHR and MYCN, but also allow us to depict the&#xD;
      functional role of AHR-MYCN interaction in the tumorigenesis of NB.&#xD;
