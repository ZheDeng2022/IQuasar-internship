  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of cancer leads to emotional distress, and major disruptions in&#xD;
      role functioning. Traditionally, psychosocial services offer individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer peer group support or individual counseling with only few consideration of type or&#xD;
      stage of cancer. Besides most cancers significantly impacting not only the individual but&#xD;
      also their partners and families, breast and gynecological cancer may be particularly&#xD;
      embedded in an interpersonal context, namely in the couple's relationship. Breast and&#xD;
      gynecological cancer cause additional concerns about the women' body image, sexual&#xD;
      functioning and these cancers may be prone to provoke or enhance maladaptive patterns of&#xD;
      interaction between women and their partners. Thus, not only the individual but also the&#xD;
      couple's functioning is threatened by these diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the here proposed study is to identify predictors of couple's adjustment and to&#xD;
      help couples to improve their ability to support each other during this time. In a multi-site&#xD;
      study, we will evaluate the efficacy of a couple-based intervention entitled &quot;Side by Side:&#xD;
      Coping with Cancer Together (&quot;Seite an Seite: Krebs Gemeinsam Bew√§ltigen&quot;). The intervention&#xD;
      teaches couples relationship skills that have been repeatedly validated within the marital&#xD;
      field. The aim of the intervention is to improve couples' skills to talk to each other&#xD;
      effectively about cancer-related topics, and enhance (or maintain) an affectionate&#xD;
      relationship in the face of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomly assign 303 women recently diagnosed with either breast or gynecological&#xD;
      cancer and their partners to one of two conditions: (1) Seite an Seite, or (2)&#xD;
      Treatment-As-Usual, in which couples receive no active psychosocial intervention. Assessment&#xD;
      will be conducted pre-, post-, and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. These assessments include&#xD;
      for both partners negative and positive self-report measures of individual functioning (such&#xD;
      as mood, anxiety and benefit finding) and relationship functioning (such as relationship&#xD;
      distress, communication patterns). Furthermore, at pre-, post- and 12-month Follow-up&#xD;
      observational data on mutual supportive behavior when communicating about a cancer-related&#xD;
      topic will be collected. The study may enhance our understanding of the significance of&#xD;
      relationship skills in the process of adjusting to cancer as a couple and as an individual.&#xD;
