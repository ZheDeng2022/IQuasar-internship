    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of letrozole in&#xD;
      preventing breast cancer in healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
      Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep breast cancer from forming or coming back. The&#xD;
      use of letrozole may keep cancer from forming in healthy postmenopausal women at high risk&#xD;
      for breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the effect of lower and intermittent doses of letrozole to standard letrozole&#xD;
      therapy on estrogen suppression in postmenopausal women at high risk for developing breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Comparison of the effect of lower and intermittent doses of letrozole to standard therapy&#xD;
      on signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency, including menopausal symptoms, serum lipid&#xD;
      profile, and serum marker of bone turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Comparison of the effect of lower and intermittent doses of letrozole to standard therapy&#xD;
      on nuclear chromatin abnormality of breast epithelial cells collected by random periareolar&#xD;
      fine needle aspiration (RPFNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the prevalence of breast cancer stem cells in the fine needle breast aspirates&#xD;
      and explore the potential intervention effect on the prevalence of breast cancer stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive 2.5 mg of letrozole orally (PO) thrice weekly for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive 1.0 mg of letrozole PO thrice weekly for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive 0.25 mg of letrozole PO thrice weekly for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients receive 2.5 mg of letrozole PO once daily for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 30.&#xD;
