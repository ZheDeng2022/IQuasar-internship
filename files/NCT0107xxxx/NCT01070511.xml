      Summary for Patients: This study, funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association, is intended&#xD;
      to build on recent findings published in the journal Nature showing beneficial effects of&#xD;
      tadalafil (also known as Cialis) in mice with an animal version of Duchenne and Becker&#xD;
      muscular dystrophies. Only two doses of tadalafil improved muscle blood flow, allowing the&#xD;
      dystrophic mice to perform more exercise with less muscle injury. This new short-term&#xD;
      clinical trial will move the testing from animals to human patients with Becker muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy and examine the effects of acute tadalafil dosing on muscle blood flow during a&#xD;
      bout of exercise. Patients will take two doses of tadalafil prior to exercising. Then doctors&#xD;
      will measure whether muscles receive increased blood flow and therefore are better protected&#xD;
      during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Hypothesis: In patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (particularly those with&#xD;
      dystrophin gene mutations between exons 41-46), loss of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase&#xD;
      engenders functional muscle ischemia and thus muscle edema after an acute bout of exercise.&#xD;
      The investigators further hypothesize that PDE5A inhibition, which boosts nitric oxide-cGMP&#xD;
      signaling, constitutes an effective new countermeasure for these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 phases to this research project: (1) an initial baseline study to compare&#xD;
      patients with Becker muscular dystrophy against healthy control subjects, and (2) a&#xD;
      subsequent brief treatment trial only in the muscular dystrophy patients (healthy controls&#xD;
      will not participate in this second phase of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline study involves an intake history, physical examination, and phlebotomy for blood&#xD;
      chemistries and DNA followed by (a) MRI scans of the forearm muscles before and after a brief&#xD;
      bout of handgrip exercise approximately 1-1.5 hours to complete), and (b) non-invasive&#xD;
      forearm blood flow studies (Near Infrared Spectroscopy, Doppler Ultrasound) before and after&#xD;
      a brief bout of handgrip exercise (approximately 3-5 hours to complete). Blood flow studies&#xD;
      will be performed with the subject's lower body enclosed in an airtight chamber. Blood flow&#xD;
      and oxygen delivery to the forearm muscles will be measured before and during application of&#xD;
      lower body negative pressure at rest and during handgrip exercise. Lower body negative&#xD;
      pressure simulates the blood flow changes that normally occur when a person sits up after&#xD;
      lying down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the baseline study will determine which patients meet preset eligibility&#xD;
      criteria to participate in the medication phase of the study. These criteria include (1)&#xD;
      normal kidney and liver function tests and normal BNP levels (the latter to exclude heart&#xD;
      failure), and (2) abnormal MRI and blood flow responses to handgrip exercise. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be asked to repeat the above laboratory procedures on two more study days: one&#xD;
      day after receiving 2 pills of tadalafil (a PDE5A inhibitor that is longer-lasting than&#xD;
      Viagra) and another day after receiving 2 placebo pills. Study procedures can be broken up&#xD;
      into two separate days for scheduling purposes and/or to avoid fatigue. Patients completing&#xD;
      the trial will receive both study medications and the order will be random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, healthy control subjects will only undergo the baseline study whereas Becker&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy patients completing all phases of the project will have 3 separate study&#xD;
      days (baseline, tadalafil, and placebo) and 2 medication visits (to receive the study&#xD;
      medication and have their blood pressure checked by a study physician). Study days will be&#xD;
      separated by at least two weeks to allow time for test results, to rest the forearm muscles&#xD;
      between exercise bouts, and to ensure complete elimination of tadalafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 24 adult men with Becker muscular dystrophy, of whom 12 men will have&#xD;
      dystrophin gene deletions between exons 41-46, and 24 healthy control subjects.&#xD;
