  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic assistance during thyroid surgery has been utilized clinically in Korea since late&#xD;
      2007. Robotic thyroidectomy has also been validated for surgical management of the thyroid&#xD;
      gland. Compared with endoscopic thyroidectomy, the use of a robot in an endoscopic approach&#xD;
      via the axilla provides a broader view of the thyroid bed, albeit from a lateral, as opposed&#xD;
      to the conventional anterior, perspective. The wrist action of a surgical robot also provides&#xD;
      a greater degree of movement than afforded by the use of simple endoscopic instruments, and&#xD;
      tremor is eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no&#xD;
      prospective trials comparing the clinical results of robotic with conventional open&#xD;
      thyroidectomy have been described. We therefore designed a prospective trial comparing&#xD;
      outcomes, including postoperative distress and patient satisfaction, between patients&#xD;
      undergoing robotic and conventional open thyroidectomy.&#xD;

      Patient assessment A prospective study addressing perioperative outcomes and postoperative&#xD;
      patient discomfort after thyroidectomy was commenced in April 2009 and is currently&#xD;
      continuing. All patients were told about the operative techniques involved in conventional&#xD;
      open and robotic thyroidectomy, and patients subsequently chose their preferred surgical&#xD;
      procedure, voluntarily agreed to participate in our study, and provided written informed&#xD;
      consent. The study protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were included if they had (a) a minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma ≤4&#xD;
      cm in diameter, or (b) a papillary thyroid carcinoma ≤2 cm in diameter. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included (a) previous neck operations; (b) age &lt;21 or &gt;65 years; (c) prior vocal fold&#xD;
      paralysis or a history of voice or laryngeal disease requiring therapy; (d) a malignancy with&#xD;
      definite extrathyroid invasion, multiple lateral neck node metastasis, perinodal infiltration&#xD;
      at a metastatic lymph node, or distant metastasis; and/or (e) a lesion located in the thyroid&#xD;
      dorsal area (especially adjacent to the tracheoesophageal groove) caused by possible injury&#xD;
      to the trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). The extent of thyroid&#xD;
      resection was determined for each patient using American Thyroid Association guidelines. All&#xD;
      patients underwent prophylactic ipsilateral central compartment node dissection (CCND;&#xD;
      pretracheal, prelaryngeal, and paraesophageal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical outcomes Surgical outcomes included operating time, intraoperative blood loss,&#xD;
      number of retrieved central lymph nodes, length of hospital stay, and postoperative&#xD;
      complications. We also assessed the incidence of postoperative seromas and hematomas for at&#xD;
      least 3 weeks postoperatively. Operating time was defined as the interval from skin incision&#xD;
      to closure. The drainage extent was measured over 24 h, and a drain was removed if drainage&#xD;
      was &lt;30 mL in this interval. Study patients were discharged the day after drain removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobility of the vocal cords was assessed by videostrobolaryngoscopic examination, performed&#xD;
      both preoperatively and 1 week and 3 months postoperatively. Vocal cord palsy was defined as&#xD;
      permanent when there was no evidence of recovery within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain and cosmetic outcomes To evaluate the degree of postoperative pain, all&#xD;
      patients were given analgesics on an identical protocol. Patients were asked to grade&#xD;
      postoperative pain in the neck and anterior chest as none, very slight, slight, moderate, or&#xD;
      severe, 24 h after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 week and 3 months after surgery, patients were asked (by questionnaire) to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of hyperesthesia and paresthesia in the neck and anterior chest, as well as shoulder&#xD;
      discomfort. All patients answered and returned completed questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cosmetic results, including wound appearance and complaints, were evaluated by patients 3&#xD;
      months after surgery using a verbal response scale with five possible responses: extremely&#xD;
      satisfied, excellent, acceptable, dissatisfied, and extremely dissatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective voice and swallowing evaluation We used the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), a&#xD;
      validated, reliable self-assessment tool that measures patient assessment of voice quality&#xD;
      and the effect of voice on quality-of-life, to determine the frequency of voice&#xD;
      abnormalities. The VHI-10 consists of 10 questions, responses to each of which are scaled&#xD;
      from a minimum of 0 (no voice alteration) to a maximum of 40 (highest voice impairment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowing difficulties were assessed using the Swallowing Impairment Index (SIS-6), a&#xD;
      self-administered, six-item assessment of symptoms related to dysphagia that has been&#xD;
      validated for diagnosis of impairment. The scoring of each item on the SIS-6 ranges from a&#xD;
      minimum of 0 (no swallowing alteration) to a maximum of 24 (highest swallowing impairment).&#xD;
      The SIS-6 score is also excellent for assessing non-voice throat symptoms, including cough,&#xD;
      choking, and throat-clearing, all of which occur after thyroidectomy. All patients enrolled&#xD;
      in this study completed the VHI-10 and SIS-6 questionnaires before surgery and at 1 week and&#xD;
      3 months after surgery.&#xD;
