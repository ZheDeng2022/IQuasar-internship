  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate and optimize imaging sequences and parameters of rapid&#xD;
      real-time MRI in order to obtain adequate guidance for accurately and precisely delivering&#xD;
      radiation to moving abdominal and thoracic tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate dose delivery remains one of the weakest aspects of radiotherapy, especially in the&#xD;
      case of thoracic and abdominal tumors, where significant patient motion occurs during dose&#xD;
      delivery (intrafraction motion). Such motion results in geometric and dosimetric&#xD;
      uncertainties that compromise treatment quality. Effective management of intrafraction motion&#xD;
      is therefore key to realizing the full potential of modern image-guided radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IGRT). While external markers have been found to be well-correlated with internal anatomy&#xD;
      within an imaging session, there is no guarantee that these correlations will continue to&#xD;
      exist and be constant throughout the course of the therapy. In general, implanted,&#xD;
      radio-opaque seeds have been found to be more reliable than external markers. However,&#xD;
      implantation of fiducials, whether radio-opaque or electromagnetic, is necessarily invasive&#xD;
      and carries with it the risk of associated complications - an issue that becomes especially&#xD;
      important for cancer patients with weakened immune systems. Currently, MR imaging is the only&#xD;
      modality that is non-invasive and provides high quality volumetric information for the whole&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;ideal&quot; intrafraction motion management requires complete spatio-temporal knowledge of&#xD;
      the irradiated anatomy. However, to date, there is no clinical method of directly visualizing&#xD;
      the tumor volume during dose delivery. Most techniques rely on external or internal surrogate&#xD;
      markers which often provide (usually non-volumetric) information of limited accuracy and&#xD;
      reliability. In addition, internal markers impose significant &quot;costs&quot; on the patient in terms&#xD;
      of interventional complications and increased imaging dose. In this work, we investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility of using in-room, fast cine MR imaging as a non-invasive means to provide&#xD;
      real-time, soft-tissue-based, volumetric image guidance for continuous monitoring of the&#xD;
      target and surrounding anatomy. To date, there has been no systematic investigation of the&#xD;
      imaging requirements of an integrated MRI+linac for the specific task of real-time&#xD;
      radiotherapy guidance.&#xD;
