  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis designed&#xD;
      to assess the biochemical, immunological and pharmacokinetic profiles of a large, actively&#xD;
      infusing natalizumab patient population. A duration effect for progressive multifocal&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk associated with natalizumab therapy appears to exist. There is&#xD;
      minimal data available to understand this effect at the biochemical and cellular level. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to gather preliminary data on several parameters to guide in more&#xD;
      focused research on the duration effect.&#xD;
