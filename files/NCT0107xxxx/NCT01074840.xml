  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if there is a way to treat children with peanut&#xD;
      allergy to help lower the risk of severe allergic reactions and also cause them to lose their&#xD;
      allergy to peanuts and to understand what happens to their immune systems when they have&#xD;
      viral infections while on therapy. The approach we will use to treat peanut allergy in this&#xD;
      study is a process called desensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that children with a peanut allergy receiving peanut oral immunotherapy will be able&#xD;
      to eat more peanuts without having a reaction by the end of the study than they could eat at&#xD;
      the beginning. We also think that we will be able to measure changes in their immune system&#xD;
      and their immune system's response to viruses while they are on therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Compared with other food&#xD;
      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.&#xD;
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut&#xD;
      using peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). We are also studying the effect of viral infections on&#xD;
      the immune system in children receiving peanut OIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages three to sixteen years of age with peanut allergy will be given peanut OIT.&#xD;
      Twenty-five subjects will also be recruited as controls. These subjects will not receive any&#xD;
      peanut or placebo but only have skin prick testing and lab work in addition to a history and&#xD;
      physical exam. Active subjects will undergo a double-blind food challenge at entry to verify&#xD;
      that they are allergic to peanuts. If allergic, they will then have modified rush&#xD;
      immunotherapy on the first day and then increase the doses at least every two weeks up to a&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily at&#xD;
      home except for dose increases which will be done at Children's Medical Center. Outcome&#xD;
      variables of interest include response to double-blind placebo controlled food challenge,&#xD;
      skin prick testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse events. These results will be compared&#xD;
      between the start and end of peanut OIT using appropriate statistical analysis.&#xD;
