      The purpose of this study is explore the antibody and cell mediated immune responses to one&#xD;
      injection of Focetria™ pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy adults aged 18-60 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase IV open-label clinical profiling study. The population to be enrolled&#xD;
      will consist of healthy adults aged 18-60 years. A total of approximately 60 subjects are&#xD;
      planned for enrolment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will receive 7.5 µg of vaccine + MF59 (9.75 mg/dose). Each&#xD;
      subject will receive one 0.5 mL IM dose (deltoid muscle, non-dominant arm) of H1N1sw vaccine&#xD;
      at Visit 1, after the blood draw. Up to 70 mL of blood will be drawn for CMI and antibody&#xD;
      assessment from all subjects at all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be requested to declare occurrence of influenza-related symptoms during the&#xD;
      study period. Whenever appropriate, subjects might be asked to provide throat swab for viral&#xD;
      typing. Subjects with laboratory confirmed H1N1sw influenza might be asked to provide one&#xD;
      blood sample (70 mL) within 4 weeks after influenza resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this study is not designed nor powered to draw conclusions regarding safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, all subjects will be followed, but not analyzed, for safety throughout the&#xD;
      study. After vaccination, all subjects will remain under medical supervision at the study&#xD;
      site for 30 minutes to be monitored and evaluated for possible immediate hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions. All study subjects will be instructed on the completion of diary cards to record&#xD;
      local and systemic reactions for seven days, starting on the day of vaccination and&#xD;
      continuing during the 6 following days. The same diary cards will additionally be used to&#xD;
      collect any vaccine-related reactions and any changes in the subject's health (including any&#xD;
      serious medical problems such as hospitalizations or any life-threatening medical problems)&#xD;
      and any medications taken by the subject throughout the study. All serious adverse events and&#xD;
      all adverse events will be recorded throughout the entire trial.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Antibody and cell mediated immune responses to one 0.50 mL IM injection of egg-derived Focetria™ pandemic influenza vaccine in terms of quality and quantity of the antigen-specific T- and B-cell response</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 8, 22, 202 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Cell Mediated Immunity (CMI) assessed by frequencies and fold increases of antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells and B-lymphocytes on Day 0,8,22,202.&#xD;
Immunogenicity, i.e. Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI), Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) and Microneutralization (MN), assessed as follows:&#xD;
Geometric mean titer (GMT)/Geometric mean area (GMA) on Day 0,8,22,202.&#xD;
Geometric mean ratio (GMR) at each time-point vs. Day 0.&#xD;
Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase on Day 8,22,202.&#xD;
Percentage of subjects with HI (or MN) titer≥40 and SRH≥25 mm2 on Day 0,8,22,202.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antibody responses to one injection of egg-derived Focetria™ pandemic influenza vaccine according to CHMP criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 8, 22, 202 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>In the interpretation of HI immunogenicity results, the following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) criteria (CPMP/BWP/214/96) for healthy adults will be taken in consideration:&#xD;
The proportion of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titer should be &gt; 40%&#xD;
Mean geometric increase should be &gt; 2.5&#xD;
The proportion of subjects achieving an HI titer ≥ 40 should be &gt; 70%.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes after vaccination (Day 0) and on day 8, 22 and 202 after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>A medical history will be obtained and physical assessment performed for each subject entered into the study at the time of enrolment and then, a brief physical assessment after every subsequent visit. All subjects will be followed for safety throughout the study. All serious adverse events and all adverse events will be collected throughout the entire trial using diary cards.</description>
