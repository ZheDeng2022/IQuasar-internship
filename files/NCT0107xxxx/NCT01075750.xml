    <textblock>
      In this study we want to show that the choice of a balanced type fluid solution for the&#xD;
      perioperative fluid management of patients receiving cadaveric renal transplantation results&#xD;
      in less occurrence of intra- and postoperative hyperkalemia, and thus the need for&#xD;
      postoperative dialysis. Additionally, we aim to determine whether the use of a balanced&#xD;
      infusion solution leads to less occurrence of metabolic acidosis and electrolyte disorders&#xD;
      than the use of isotonic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore we want to evaluate whether perioperative fluid management with balanced infusion&#xD;
      solutions results in a higher frequency of primary graft function than with administration of&#xD;
      isotonic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that the use of &quot;Elomel isoton&quot;(Fresenius Kabi Austria GmbH) a&#xD;
      balanced infusion solution will result in less occurrence of hyperkalemia and consequent&#xD;
      post-transplant dialysis, less occurrence of metabolic acidosis, decreased incidence of&#xD;
      electrolyte disorders and higher incidence of primary graft function when compared to&#xD;
      isotonic saline for perioperative fluid management in patients receiving cadaveric renal&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage-renal-disease&#xD;
      (ESRD). Successful renal transplantation improves quality of life and reduces mortality in&#xD;
      eligible patients when compared to hemodialysis. In 2007, 44 kidney transplantations per&#xD;
      million residents were performed in Austria. The number of patients with a renal transplant&#xD;
      has continuously risen in the last ten years. 398 kidney transplantations were performed in&#xD;
      Austria in 2007, of which only 61 were of living donors. This underlines the special role of&#xD;
      cadaveric kidney transplantation in Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated that adequate intraoperative fluid administration is&#xD;
      associated with earlier onset of graft function and improved graft survival in renal&#xD;
      transplant recipients. However, which kind of solution should be chosen for the perioperative&#xD;
      fluid management of renal transplant recipients remains to be clarified. A non-governmental&#xD;
      US survey has shown that normal saline is the most commonly used fluid for renal&#xD;
      transplantation. The most common cited reason for the administration of normal saline was the&#xD;
      lack of potassium in the solution. Balanced salt type fluids were used in only less than 10%&#xD;
      of kidney transplantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge only three studies compared the effects of lactated ringer's solution versus&#xD;
      normal saline in kidney transplantation. Taken together, the application of lactated ringer's&#xD;
      solution led to less occurrence of metabolic acidosis, electrolyte derangements and in one&#xD;
      study, the appearance of hyperkalemia was eliminated by the use of lactated ringer's instead&#xD;
      of normal saline. However, it was also shown that the administration of lactated ringer's&#xD;
      during kidney transplantation led to a significant rise in lactate levels compared to those&#xD;
      treated with normal salin. Despite the knowledge that lactated ringer's can at least&#xD;
      potentially lead to a rise in lactate levels, no studies using acetate based balanced salt&#xD;
      type fluids have been performed so far in cadaveric renal transplantation. We therefore&#xD;
      propose a prospective study in which patients undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either a solely acetate buffered balanced salt type fluid or a&#xD;
      normal saline for infusion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative hyperkalemia is a common problem in patients receiving cadaveric renal&#xD;
      transplantation, especially when primary graft function does not occur. Due to the acidifying&#xD;
      effect of isotonic saline infusion via the generation of hyperchloremic acidosis and/or&#xD;
      dilutional acidosis, a rise in serum potassium is only boosted. However, today isotonic&#xD;
      saline is the most commonly used infusion solution for the perioperative period in renal&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a balanced infusion solution, containing a metabolizable anion, such as acetate,&#xD;
      could result in less metabolic acidosis and therefore a decreased need for post-transplant&#xD;
      dialysis. Moreover, since balanced infusion solutions have a by far lower chloride content&#xD;
      than isotonic saline, the adverse effects of a rise in serum chloride on renal perfusion&#xD;
      could be avoided. This could ultimately result in improved graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      O'Malley et al. compared the effects of lactated Ringer's to isotonic saline in 51 renal&#xD;
      transplant patients. 48 patients received living donor transplantation and 3 received&#xD;
      cadaveric renal transplantation. 26 patients received isotonic saline and 25 lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's. 19% of patients receiving isotonic saline reached postassium concentrations &gt;&#xD;
      6mmol/L and required treatment versus 0% in the lactated Ringer's group. 31% of patients in&#xD;
      the isotonic saline group versus 0% in the lactated Ringer's group required treatment for&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis. No effect on primary graft function could be shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hadimioglu et al. randomized patients undergoing living-related kidney transplantation to&#xD;
      three groups receiving either isotonic saline, lactated Ringer's or Plasmalyte (a balanced&#xD;
      infusion solution using acetate and gluconate). No effects on potassium levels could be shown&#xD;
      in this study. Patients receiving isotonic saline showed significant decreases in pH, base&#xD;
      excess and a significant rises in serum chloride. In the lactated Ringer's group lactate&#xD;
      levels increased significantly. The study showed no differences in the need for postoperative&#xD;
      dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Khajavi et al. randomized patients undergoing kidney transplantation to either normal saline&#xD;
      or lactated Ringer's. The authors noticed a higher incidence of hyperkalemia and acidosis in&#xD;
      the isotonic saline group while 2 patients in the lactated Ringer's group lost their kidneys&#xD;
      due to vascular graft thrombosis.&#xD;
