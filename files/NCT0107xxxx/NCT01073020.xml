  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial clinical evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of currently&#xD;
      practiced bariatric surgical techniques to improve metabolic control and/or resolve type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2DM) in clinically severe obese patients (class 3 obesity). Evidence suggests such&#xD;
      procedures have greater effects on insulin secretion and insulin action than that expected&#xD;
      from weight loss alone, which has led to the recent claim that such procedures may be useful&#xD;
      as a primary treatment for T2DM in the moderately obese population. Concurrently, there have&#xD;
      also been substantial advances in the non-surgical medical management of T2DM. As a result,&#xD;
      the best treatment algorithm for T2DM patients with class 1 &amp; 2 obesity is increasingly&#xD;
      controversial. This trial investigates the utility of currently practiced and available&#xD;
      bariatric surgical procedures as compared with multidisciplinary intensive medical and weight&#xD;
      management for the treatment of T2DM with class 1 and 2 obesity.&#xD;

      Primary Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band&#xD;
      versus intensive medical and weight management in the treatment of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been only one randomized control trial to date comparing surgical to medical&#xD;
      management of T2DM in the less obese population, which demonstrated substantial superiority&#xD;
      of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) in the improvement of glycemic and&#xD;
      metabolic measures. However, these findings remain controversial as the magnitude of weight&#xD;
      loss in this study was far superior to that generally reported following LAGB. Thus, we&#xD;
      propose a second prospective randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of intensive&#xD;
      medical and weight management (IMWM) vs. LAGB in T2DM patients with BMI in the 30-42 kg/m^2&#xD;
      range. This range does extend LAGB surgery to BMI limits below those currently used in&#xD;
      medical care, FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) G090163. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable will be attaining glycemic control (as defined by fasting plasma glucose levels &lt;126&#xD;
      mg/dL and HbA1c &lt;6.5%) at one year of follow-up. The study was subsequently extended to 3&#xD;
      years, with the same outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass versus intensive medical and weight management in the treatment of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although observational studies and meta-analyses suggest rapid and sustained improvement or&#xD;
      resolution of diabetes following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), to date there&#xD;
      has been no randomized trial directly comparing these effects to those produced by IMWM. We&#xD;
      propose a prospective randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of IMWM vs. LRYGB in T2DM&#xD;
      patients with BMI's in the 30-42 kg/m^2 range. This range extends LRYGB surgery to BMI limits&#xD;
      below those currently used in medical care to explore the use of this type of surgical&#xD;
      procedure in type 2 diabetes with lesser magnitude obesity. The primary outcome variable will&#xD;
      be attaining glycemic control (as defined by fasting plasma glucose levels &lt;126 mg/dL and&#xD;
      HbA1c &lt;6.5%) at one year of follow-up. The study was subsequently extended to 3 years, with&#xD;
      the same outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to allow for strong patient preference towards specific surgical&#xD;
      procedures, and as such is designed as two parallel trials with each of the two surgical&#xD;
      procedures judged against intensive medical weight management. Subjects without strong&#xD;
      preference will be randomly assigned to one of the four study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of suitable study design: In addition to testing the effectiveness of current&#xD;
      and available surgical techniques as compared to medical management, this trial will also&#xD;
      test the utility of this trial design in future multi-institutional comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      studies of these therapies, or alternatively, in future trials evaluating new surgical&#xD;
      procedures being designed specifically for less obese T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of metabolic factors: Insulin secretion and action will be assessed during&#xD;
      provocative mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTT) using the corrected incremental insulin&#xD;
      response (CIR) and the composite insulin sensitivity index (CISI). MMTT will be performed in&#xD;
      all groups at baseline and repeated at the time point of 10% weight loss (matched for weight&#xD;
      loss), and at 12 months following randomization (matched for time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of cardiovascular risk factors: Each group will be studied for evidence of&#xD;
      changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors. Multiple surrogate measures of cardiovascular&#xD;
      health will be compared, including blood pressure, fasting lipid profiles,&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and plasma will be collected for circulating markers of&#xD;
      endothelial function. The study was subsequently extended to 3 years, with the same outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of metabolic rate: Each group will be studied for change in energy expenditure&#xD;
      and respiratory quotient using the non-invasive indirect calorimetry technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and cost utility outcomes: Longitudinal measures of patient reported quality&#xD;
      of life outcomes, and cost utility measures will also be collected to generate preliminary&#xD;
      data for future studies.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive either 1) laparoscopic placement of an adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or 2) treatment with an intensive medical and weight management (IMWM) program.&#xD;
LAGB will be placed using the &quot;pars flaccida&quot; technique. The Allergan laparoscopic band &quot;LAP BAND&quot; system will be utilized. LAGB ports will be placed in subcutaneous pockets in the right upper abdomen.&#xD;
The IMWM group will participate in the Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) program, which is a multidisciplinary program for weight control and intensive diabetes management designed by Joslin Diabetes Center. Key aspects include: 1) Intensive and interactive medication adjustments, 2) Structured modified dietary intervention, 3) Graded, balanced, and individualized exercise intervention, 4) Cognitive behavioral intervention and 5) Group education.</description>

    <baseline>
      <population>Participants first selected whether they preferred gastric band or RYGB. After consent, they were randomized to either surgery or intensive medical diabetes and weight management. This resulted in 2 independent substudies, one of which compared band to its corresponding intensive medical diabetes and weight management group, and one of which compared RYGB to its corresponding intensive medical diabetes and weight management group..</population>

        <title>Glycemic Control, as Measured by Hemoglobin A1c</title>
        <description>All participants had type 2 diabetes. Long-term diabetes control is typically evaluated in both clinical and research settings using the measurement of Hemoglobin A1c (a measure of glycated hemoglobin, proportional to average glucose levels over approximately 3 months). This endpoint (hemoglobin A1c) was measured at 3 years after intervention. Reported values are changes from baseline derived from the mixed effects model analysis, adjusted for baseline.</description>

          <title>Glycemic Control, as Measured by Hemoglobin A1c</title>
          <description>All participants had type 2 diabetes. Long-term diabetes control is typically evaluated in both clinical and research settings using the measurement of Hemoglobin A1c (a measure of glycated hemoglobin, proportional to average glucose levels over approximately 3 months). This endpoint (hemoglobin A1c) was measured at 3 years after intervention. Reported values are changes from baseline derived from the mixed effects model analysis, adjusted for baseline.</description>

Long-term durability of beneficial effects of reducing weight and HbA1c could not be evaluated after 3 years.&#xD;
Newer bariatric surgical procedures, e.g. sleeve gastrectomy, were not studied.</limitations_and_caveats>
