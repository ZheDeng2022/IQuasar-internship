    <textblock>
      Despite aggressive treatment, patients with heart failure have a poor prognosis.&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oils, may&#xD;
      prevent the progressions of heart failure through mechanisms that are not addressed with&#xD;
      current drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA) favorably impact mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation in heart failure&#xD;
      (HF). Treatment with DHA-t-EPA alters cardiac phospholipid composition by decreasing&#xD;
      arachidonic acid (a pro-inflammatory fatty acid) and increasing DHA and the mitochondrial&#xD;
      phospholipid cardiolipin, with is associated with improved Left Ventricular (LV) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fish oil supplements contain a mix of DHA and EPA, however we postulate that DHA is superior&#xD;
      to EPA in improving mitochondrial function and suppressing inflammation, and thus DHA should&#xD;
      be used to treat HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac phospholipid fatty acid composition (i.e. DHA, EPA, and arachidonic acid) and&#xD;
      cardiolipin (CL) content will be measured in biopsies from stable heart transplantation&#xD;
      patients that are obtained as part of standard clinical care in heart transplant patients&#xD;
      before and after treatment with DHA alone or DHA+EPA. We will compare cardiac phospholipid&#xD;
      composition from biopsies obtained at study entry and at 6 months follow-up (allowable range&#xD;
      +/- two months, depending on patients' clinical conditions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 adult heart transplant recipients (18-75 years of age) entered the maintenance phase (&gt;6&#xD;
      months after heart transplantation), remaining clinically quiescent (See Inclusion criteria)&#xD;
      and undergoing regularly scheduled myocardial biopsies (as part of standard clinical care)&#xD;
      for allograft rejection will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the subject will be receive DHA and half DHA+EPA administered orally which will be&#xD;
      administered in two capsules in the morning and two in the evening. Each patient will serve&#xD;
      as their own control, and comparisons will be made between pre and post treatments within&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to assignment to treatment, a septal biopsy (10 to 20 mg) will be obtained during a&#xD;
      routine biopsy procedure and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 until&#xD;
      analysis. Therapy will continue for at least 6 months and until completion of the primary end&#xD;
      point of paired cardiac biopsy acquisition. Cardiac biopsies obtained during regularly&#xD;
      scheduled myocardial biopsies for clinical evaluation for allograft rejection will also be&#xD;
      analyzed for phospholipid fatty acid composition.&#xD;

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;Completed Date&quot;&#xD;
