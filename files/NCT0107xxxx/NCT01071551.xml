  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) is related to poor physical health, obesity, elevated&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and iron deficiency anemia. We plan to offer a comprehensive&#xD;
      framework allowing the &quot;Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model&quot; (NEHLM) among a low&#xD;
      SES Kindergarten children. The model offered is designed to take into account the current&#xD;
      economic status of the child's family. We shall conduct a randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the influence of the intervention on changes in food consumption, physical&#xD;
      activity and ,and caries rates in the children in kindergartens where it is applied versus&#xD;
      the control kindergartens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrative Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model (NEHLM) will improve health&#xD;
      behaviors among children and parents in comparison to control intervention (physical activity&#xD;
      only).&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;Nutrition Enrichment and Healthy Living Model&quot; (NEHLM) is an Integrative model covering variety of lifestyle issues such as nutrition, dental care, and physical activity. The model will be applied to kindergartens and a sample of their parents. Children participating will be given 10 lessons in nutrition, 5 lessons in dental-care and 20 physical activity lessons. Parents for children in this group will be given 2 nutrition-education meetings and a meeting with a dental clinician.2 additional meetings will be held for parents and children together, one in nutrition and one in dental-care.</description>
