      Intranasal injection of epinephrine is used routinely during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS)&#xD;
      to reduce bleeding in the nasal mucosa and thereby improve visualization of the surgical&#xD;
      field. However, systemic absorption of epinephrine via the nasal mucosa is often accompanied&#xD;
      by cardiovascular side effects during the early postinjection period, putting in risk&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular morbidity. Evidence indicate that topical administration of&#xD;
      epinephrine achieves similar hemostatic effects compared with injection of epinephrine, while&#xD;
      avoiding systemic adverse effects. We wish to conduct a prospective controlled trial&#xD;
      assessing the hemostatic and hemodynamic effects of intranasal injection compared to topical&#xD;
      application of epinephrin during ESS, in order to evaluate whether the previous could be&#xD;
      avoided due to its untoward effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that topical administration of epinephrine provides a hemostatic effect not&#xD;
      inferior to that of intranasal injection while minimizing hemodynamic instability during ESS.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intranasal injection of epinephrine is used routinely during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS)&#xD;
      to reduce bleeding in the nasal mucosa and hence improve visualization of the surgical field&#xD;
      [1, 2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic absorption of epinephrine via the nasal mucosa, due to its vasoconstriction ability&#xD;
      and cardiac effect, is often accompanied by cardiovascular side effects (e.g., hypertension,&#xD;
      hypotension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, etc) during the early postinjection period [1,&#xD;
      3-5]. In patients with minimal cardiac reserve, these acute hyperdynamic effects may result&#xD;
      in myocardial ischemia or infarction [6, 7]. The nasal mucosa has an excellent absorbing&#xD;
      capability which may be utilized for local administration of vasoconstrictive substances&#xD;
      instead of intranasal injection [8, 9], thus avoiding their systemic adverse effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence indicate that topical use of epinephrine may achieve similar hemostatic effects&#xD;
      compared with injection of epinephrine [10]. Another pilot study has demonstrated that&#xD;
      epinephrine injection better facilitates visualization of the surgical field, yet topical&#xD;
      application does not involve hemodynamic side effects [11]. However, a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized larger trial has shown that, when local anesthetic containing epinephrine was used&#xD;
      compared with normal saline (NS) injection for ESS, there was no significant reduction in&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss or duration of surgery. More importantly, a significantly higher&#xD;
      mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was associated with injection of epinephrine [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study is to compare the hemostatic and hemodynamic effects of&#xD;
      intranasal injection versus topical application of epinephrin during ESS, in order to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the previous could be avoided due to its untoward effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be assigned to one of two groups - intranasal&#xD;
      injection group (IG) or topical application (TG) of epinephrine, by computer-generated&#xD;
      assignment of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative surgical management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine ESS will be performed on each subject. Resection and removal of different structures&#xD;
      in the sinonasal complex will be executed appropriately as indicated according to underlying&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative vasoconstrictor administration Vials containing either epinephrine 1:100,000&#xD;
      or saline will be prepared in the operating room (OR) by the surgeon, with the assistance of&#xD;
      the OR nurse. The content of the vials will not be disclosed to the surgeon (or anesthetist),&#xD;
      who will thus not be aware of the type of solution being diluted. While patients allocated to&#xD;
      the IG group will be injected with epinephrine, saline injection (total of 8 mL) will be used&#xD;
      in the TG group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical epinephrine will be applied in exactly the same manner and quantity for the&#xD;
      saline-injected group as for the IG group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initiation of general anesthesia and intubation, cotton pledgets soaked in 1 mL&#xD;
      epinephrine 1:1,000 will be positioned in the nasal cavity for approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Following this, all patients will receive intranasal injection according to their assigned&#xD;
      group. In the IG group a total of 8 mL of epinephrine 1:100,000 will be injected in the&#xD;
      lateral nasal wall in two locations: the area superior to the insertion of the middle&#xD;
      turbinate and area anterior to the posterior insertion of the middle turbinate, at the&#xD;
      spheno-palatine artery region. The injection will be applied to both sides (total of 8 mL).&#xD;
      Following the injection, Epinephrine-soaked cotton pledgets (1 mL of 1:1,000) will be placed&#xD;
      at the middle meatus and anterior to the sphenoethmoidal recess. During the procedure the&#xD;
      pledgets will be used at various locations as required for primary decongestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the TG group, saline will be injected instead of epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' parameters will be collected during the procedure by an anesthesiologist via&#xD;
      iMDsoft software. A printout delineating the following data will be obtained: heart rate, ECG&#xD;
      for arrhythmias, systolic (SP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured from a blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff once per 2 minutes, and total intraoperative blood loss. These parameters will&#xD;
      be monitored by the anesthetist throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be monitored throughout the procedure for any hemodynamic events&#xD;
      potentially related to the vasoconstrictor applied to them. We will continue follow-up until&#xD;
      they discharge in order to detect any post-operative complications that may occur due to&#xD;
      systemic absorption of epinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated a significant increase in the plasma catecholamine level&#xD;
      after nasal injection of epinephrine, which was associated with hemodynamic fluctuations [1,&#xD;
      11]. We therefore wish to analyze the systemic absorption of injected epinephrine during ESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative catecholamine blood levels (epinephrine and norepinephrine) will be obtained&#xD;
      by taking blood samples (7ml in each sample) from each patient: immediately after intubation&#xD;
      (baseline), before pladget placement, 5min after pladget placement, before injection&#xD;
      (approximately 10 minutes after applying epinephrine gauze strips), 2min post injection and&#xD;
      placement of cotton pledgets (to both sides), 5min, 10min and 15 minutes post injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other records will include: patient demographics, the duration of surgery, extent of&#xD;
      nasosinusal polyposis/number of structures to be operated, the presence of polyps will be&#xD;
      recorded, and need for intraoperative pharmacological intervention (vasopressors,&#xD;
      vasodilators, inotropes, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in intraoperative hemodynamic parameters,&#xD;
      and incidence of hemodynamic events during surgery, and specifically in the immediate post&#xD;
      injection/topical application period (5min). These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lowest and highest HR, SP and MAP values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean HR, SP and MAP during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of hypotensive and hypertensive events (&gt;20% relative to baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of tachycardic (HR&gt;115) and bradycardic (HR&lt;55) events. Analysis for&#xD;
           correlation of these parameters with catecholamine blood levels will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extent of nasal bleeding (estimated by assessment of the suction bottles, sponges, and&#xD;
           the surgical drapes and gowns).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The total number of epinephrin pledgets used during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of arrhythmias and ST changes on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjective surgeons' evaluation of the feasibility of performing the procedure,&#xD;
           effectiveness of hemostasis, and visualization of the operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pharmacokinetics of epinephrine administered to the nasal mucosa via injection and&#xD;
           topical administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post-operative complications due to systemic absorption of epinephrine in patients with&#xD;
           risk factors (i.e., arteriosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and other&#xD;
           cardiac problems, anemia, preexistent liver or renal damage, and endocrinologic&#xD;
           dysfunction such as hyperthyroidism, phaeochromocytoma, and diabetes mellitus) will be&#xD;
           monitored until the patients discharge.&#xD;
