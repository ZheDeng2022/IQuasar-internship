      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the prevalence and severity of the fear of falling in a rheumatoid population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the effect the treatment with biological agents has on fear of falling and&#xD;
      physical activity in a rheumatoid population&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an open, observational study to determine the prevalence of fear of falling&#xD;
      in a rheumatoid population with severe disease being considered for biological therapy; this&#xD;
      will be compared with physical activity levels at baseline and the change in these level pre&#xD;
      and post treatment with biologic therapy. An age and sex matched control group will also be&#xD;
      studied to allow inference to be drawn from the self reported 'fear of falling' and the&#xD;
      objective activity levels of the RA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two visits: screening/baseline, and a 12 week follow up visit. It&#xD;
      will be an observational study of the effects of the planned treatment regime via the NHS&#xD;
      pathway. The subjects who are eligible to enter in the study will receive his/her normal&#xD;
      treatment prescribed and be at the referral phase for biological treatment. The control group&#xD;
      will continue on any existing treatments but will not have any reported physical limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening/baseline visit the self completion outcome questionnaires will be given to&#xD;
      both the patient group and the control group. A disease activity score (aggregate score of RA&#xD;
      symptoms - DAS) for the RA population will be calculated by a nurse specialist at the time of&#xD;
      referral for the biological agent and again at 12 weeks post treatment, these parameters will&#xD;
      not be repeated by the research team but the DAS score will be collected used in the final&#xD;
      analysis. In addition, the Numact ambulatory activity recorder - used to assess spontaneous&#xD;
      ambulatory activity - will be fitted for a 24hour period. This screening / baseline visit&#xD;
      will occur before, but as near as possible to the 1st treatment day of the prescribed&#xD;
      biological agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasionally the recording device may fail due to extraneous factors; in this instance a&#xD;
      second recording may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will complete their study participation immediately after the screening /&#xD;
      baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then follow the care pathway of their treating physician with no&#xD;
      interception by the study team. The 2nd and final study visit will be scheduled for 12 weeks&#xD;
      post treatment with the biologic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 weeks a repeat assessment of the screening procedures will be made. Beyond which there&#xD;
      will be no further study contact with the patients unless they request further discussion&#xD;
      about the study findings. If they request this an appointment will be made at the time of the&#xD;
      final study report/write up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination could be carried out at any time during the study period if considered&#xD;
      appropriate by the physician, however, this is not a predicted study procedure..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of any changes in medication and adverse events will be reported by subjects at the&#xD;
      final visit, week 12.&#xD;
