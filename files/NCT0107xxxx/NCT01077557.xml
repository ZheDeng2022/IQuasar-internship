    <textblock>
      This US population-based study will explore the incidence of and risks for fracture among&#xD;
      adults with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The objectives are to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of fracture among persons with and without HIV infection, compare&#xD;
      risk factors for fracture among persons with and without HIV infection, and to examine the&#xD;
      associations of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment exposure for incidence and risk of fracture&#xD;
      among persons with HIV infection.&#xD;

      This study uses data from the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) National&#xD;
      Managed Care Benchmarked Database, a health insurance claims database. The study has two&#xD;
      analytic components. The first is a retrospective cohort study comparing subjects without HIV&#xD;
      infection to subjects with HIV infection for the incidence of and risk for fracture,&#xD;
      including the use of anyARV drugs in persons with HIV infection. The second is a nested&#xD;
      case-control study limited to persons with HIV infectiion within the cohort. Cases are those&#xD;
      with incident fractures occurring after the diagnosis of HIV infection, and controls those&#xD;
      without a fracture. Cases and controls will be compared for risk factors for incident&#xD;
      fracture including ARV drug exposure. The drug exposures will include individual nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (as permitted by sample size) and the other ARV drug&#xD;
      classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of&#xD;
      updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects without HIV infection (Group 1) are adults, 18 years of age and older, continuously enrolled for at least 12 months in the Integrated Health Care Information Services (IHCIS) National Managed Care Benchmarked Database, a health insurance claims database, during the interval between January 1, 1997 and March 31, 2008, and with continuous eligibility for pharmacy benefits. A 3:1 match of subjects without HIV infection to a subject with HIV infection will occur.
