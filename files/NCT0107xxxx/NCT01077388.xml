      The e-Care for Heart Wellness study will look at ways to reduce a person's chances of getting&#xD;
      heart disease. We are asking about 100 Group Health members whose electronic medical record&#xD;
      shows they have uncontrolled high blood pressure to be in the study. Having high blood&#xD;
      pressure increases your future risk of heart attacks and strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many things you can do to help keep your heart healthy. Examples include lowering&#xD;
      blood pressure and cholesterol, eating healthier, and being more active. Our goal is to test&#xD;
      whether getting care and supportive emails from a dietician helps people do things like this&#xD;
      to lower their chances of having a heart attack or a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some people, this study will involve both research and clinical care. About half the&#xD;
      people in the study will receive care related to heart disease prevention from a dietician.&#xD;
      It's a standard clinical practice for dieticians to help people reduce their risk of heart&#xD;
      attacks and strokes. What's different about this study is using emails from a dietician to&#xD;
      help people take steps to improve their heart health.&#xD;

      Overweight and obese adults are more likely to have hypertension and other risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence-based medication and lifestyle strategies exist for&#xD;
      reducing CVD risk, but little is known about the comparative effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of these strategies and how best to integrate them into routine health&#xD;
      care. We have previously demonstrated that Web-based pharmacist medication management&#xD;
      intervention can cost-effectively improve HTN control (e-BP: Electronic Communication and&#xD;
      Home Blood Pressure Monitoring; R01 HL075263, B. Green, PI). Web-based pharmacy care did not&#xD;
      lead to lifestyle behavior change or weight loss. However patients who lost small amounts of&#xD;
      weight (2 kg or more) were more likely to have controlled BP (p=.008), regardless of their&#xD;
      study group assignment. We propose using Health Information Technology systems (HIT) to&#xD;
      identify asymptomatic patients at moderate risk for CVD and invite them to participate in a&#xD;
      theory-based behavioral intervention that uses the Chronic Care Model as its planning&#xD;
      foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Aim #1: We hypothesize that using electronic databases alone, we can identify&#xD;
      asymptomatic overweight or obese patients, with uncontrolled BP, and at moderate risk for CVD&#xD;
      who might benefit from a behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: We hypothesize that a dietitian-delivered behavioral intervention, that uses a&#xD;
      patient shared EMR and e-communications, can be integrated into routine healthcare and will&#xD;
      result in improved control of modifiable CVD risk. To test this hypothesis we will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients who agree to participate and complete the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The change in mean systolic and diastolic BP and weight (kg), and a weight loss of 4 kg&#xD;
           or more, and the change in Framingham risk score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient satisfaction with the intervention, its effects on health related quality of&#xD;
           life (HrQOL) and the cost of delivering the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using this information and the results of the e-BP trial we will plan a full scale,&#xD;
      multi-site (2-3 health institutions with comprehensive EMR's and different geographic and&#xD;
      patient populations) multi-factorial randomized trial-to test the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of different strategies to improve control of modifiable CVD risk.&#xD;
