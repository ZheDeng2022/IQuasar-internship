      Randomized controlled multi-center study with three arms including 200 patients with low risk&#xD;
      endometrial hyperplasia. After confirmed diagnosis the patients will receive one of the&#xD;
      following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provera (Medroxyprogesterone (MPA)/progestin) 10 mg per oral treatment for 6 months 10&#xD;
           day each cycle,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MPA 10 mg continuously for 6 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mirena (Levonorgestrel) impregnated IUD for 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the Western world and the&#xD;
      incidence is still increasing. Endometrial cancer is principally developing through&#xD;
      preliminary stages called endometrial hyperplasia and 10-30 per cent will develop into&#xD;
      carcinoma when left untreated. The incidence of endometrial cancer in Norway is presently&#xD;
      about 650 cases per year and about 3000 cases of endometrial hyperplasia are estimated.&#xD;
      Thus,correct and optimal treatment of endometrial hyperplasia will contribute to prevent&#xD;
      endometrial cancer development and also in the long term, to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. Correct treatment of endometrial hyperplasia includes operative treatment&#xD;
      with hysterectomy of the high risk cases and conservative treatment and follow up for&#xD;
      patients with lower risk. As diagnostics of endometrial hyperplasia has been a challenge to&#xD;
      pathologists, overtreatment of patients with low risk of cancer development is unfortunately&#xD;
      still a problem. In the present study an objective scoring system, D-score, is used to&#xD;
      classify the patients into low and high risk hyperplasia. D-score in an objective&#xD;
      morphometric analysis and the scoring system has proved reliable to predict the prognosis of&#xD;
      each single case as to cancer development or not. By tradition low risk endometrial&#xD;
      hyperplasia is treated conservatively with progestin hormones, however, no national routines&#xD;
      really exist according to dose, type of progestin, treatment time or distribution route,&#xD;
      however, varying doses of per oral treatment is mostly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progestins hormones are known to have a growth regulatory effect on the uterine mucosa.&#xD;
      However, treatment success after per oral therapy has shown that up to 50% are non-responders&#xD;
      after per oral treatment. On the other hand a few recent studies have reported successful&#xD;
      results after using the LNG-IUD as treatment for endometrial hyperplasia with 100 per cent&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levonorgestrel impregnated impregnated intrauterine originally constructed for&#xD;
      menorrhagia and contraceptive use, is delivering more than hundred times increased&#xD;
      concentration of progesterone to the uterine mucosa compared to per oral therapy. Thus , the&#xD;
      favourable treatment is attributable to the increased concentration of progestins obtained in&#xD;
      the uterine mucosa. Another advantage is that treatment can last for years and that&#xD;
      side-effects seen for per oral treatment after progestin therapy can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the patients in the present study are seeing their gynecologist due to irregular&#xD;
      bleedings.Biopsy is routinely taken by the gynecologist to exclude malignancy or verify&#xD;
      hyperplasia. The biopsy is investigated routinely by a the local pathologist. If the&#xD;
      diagnosis of hyperplasia is verified and the patient fulfils the inclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      histological specimen is sent to the laboratory in Tromsø for D-score. When D-score is &gt;0,&#xD;
      the patient may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-score:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The D-score system is dividing the patients into three risk groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients having a D-score &lt;0 are shown to have a high risk of cancer development are&#xD;
           recommended hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients having D-score &gt;1 have very low risk of cancer development and are recommended&#xD;
           progestin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients having D-score 0-1 have an uncertain risk of cancer development and may be&#xD;
           treated conservatively. Only patients with D-score &gt; 0 may be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the gynecologist receive the diagnosis and the D-score results and the D-score is in&#xD;
      accordance with the inclusion criteria, the patients is asked by her gynecologist to be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If consent is given, the randomization is performed by telephone contact with the&#xD;
      randomization office , UNN, Tromsø, after written informed consent. The patient is free to&#xD;
      leave the study any time without argument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the treatment according to assigned treatment arm can be started. During&#xD;
      the therapy period the patient will be controlled with repeat biopsy after 3 months and at&#xD;
      the end of treatment after 6 months. D-score is repeated if hyperplasia persists. If a&#xD;
      negative D-score is performed, the patient will have to leave the study. If D-score is still&#xD;
      positive the patient will also leave the study, new therapy is then decided by the local&#xD;
      gynecologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be controlled with repeat biopsy every six month for two years after end of&#xD;
      therapy. If recurrence of hyperplasia occurs the patient will leave the study and receive&#xD;
      other therapy decided by her own gynecologist after repeated D-score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All side effects which can be related to treatment during treatment and/or follow-up will be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
