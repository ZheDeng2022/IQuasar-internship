  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether Trichuris suis ova, a potential&#xD;
      immunomodulator, is safe in adults and children allergic to peanut or tree nuts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy is a major cause of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions. Currently&#xD;
      avoidance of the allergenic food is the only established method of preventing reactions in&#xD;
      allergic patients. This situation impacts significantly the lives of patients, mainly&#xD;
      children, and their families. The current increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases,&#xD;
      food allergy in particular, in the Western world has been attributed in part to changes in&#xD;
      life style. Before the mid 20th century individuals were exposed to numerous bacterial,&#xD;
      parasitic and viral agents. Since these times the progress of hygiene has considerably&#xD;
      reduced the risk of exposure to these agents. It is thought that this lack of exposure,&#xD;
      particularly during childhood, has led to subtle changes in humans' immune system resulting&#xD;
      in an increased propensity to develop allergic and autoimmune responses, the so-called&#xD;
      hygiene hypothesis. One of the means of reverting this propensity could be exposure to&#xD;
      harmless biological agents. One such agent, eggs of the parasite Trichuris suis (Trichuris&#xD;
      suis ova, TSO), has been shown to be well tolerated and efficient in patients with&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel diseases. This phase I study will assess whether TSO is safe in adults and&#xD;
      children with peanut or tree nut allergy.&#xD;
