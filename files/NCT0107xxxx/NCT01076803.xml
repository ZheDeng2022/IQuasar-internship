    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lanreotide 120 mg for the&#xD;
      relief of clinical symptoms due to malignant bowel obstruction in inoperable patients. This&#xD;
      effect will be evaluated by the percentage of responder patients 7 and 14 days after one&#xD;
      administration of lanreotide 120 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A responder patient will be defined either as a patient experiencing &lt; or= 1 vomiting&#xD;
      episode per day during at least three consecutive days or as a patient in whom NGT has been&#xD;
      removed without any vomiting recurrence during at least three consecutive days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of visits will depend on the clinical situation, 5 visits are obligatory:&#xD;
      Day(D)-3/-0,Day 1,Day 7,Day 14,Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit (D-3/-0): eligibility, PIC, obstruction history, clinical exam, vital signs,&#xD;
      diary cards, VAS scale, cc medication, blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit D1: injection Visit D7/D14/28: clinical exam, nutrition procedure, result of&#xD;
      biochemical analyse, adverse events, cc medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      In between the visits, the patient will keep and fill out his diary and VAS scale&#xD;
