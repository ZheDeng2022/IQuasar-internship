    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate, that is the % of patients with&#xD;
      non-progression of their metastatic breast cancer after 4 months on treatment that was&#xD;
      selected by molecular testing and proteomics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To determine the percent of patients with refractory breast cancer where molecular profiling&#xD;
      and RPMA-based protein pathway activation analysis of their tumor, can change the clinical&#xD;
      course of their disease (i.e. produce a Growth Modulation Index (GMI) ≥1.3). The GMI is&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio of Progression-free survival (PFS) under molecular profiling and RPMA&#xD;
      analysis selected treatment to the time to progression (TTP) for the most recent regimen the&#xD;
      patient has progressed on.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  metastatic breast cancer, with measurable or evaluable non-measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have progressed on at least 3 prior chemotherapeutic or biological regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be defined as refractory to the last line of therapy according to the following&#xD;
             criteria: Documented disease progression under the last treatment or within two months&#xD;
             of the last treatment dosing AND Have received ≥ 30 days of the last treatment AND&#xD;
             Have discontinued for progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willing to undergo a biopsy or surgical procedure to obtain tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have been off their prior regimen for ≥ 3 weeks or 5 x half life of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and&#xD;
             agree to use at least one form of contraception during the study and for at least one&#xD;
             month after treatment discontinuation. For the purposes of this study, child-bearing&#xD;
             potential is defined as: all female patients unless they are post-menopausal for at&#xD;
             least one year or are surgically sterile&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients must use a form of barrier contraception approved by the Investigator&#xD;
             during the study and for at least one month after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor biopsy intended for use in the current study which was performed more than 2&#xD;
             months prior&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frozen material is not available/obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic lesion is not accessible to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; 6 months treatment under the last line of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastasis. Patients with a history of CNS metastases&#xD;
             who have been treated must be stable without symptoms for 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
             treatment, with image documentation required, and must be either off steroids or on a&#xD;
             stable dose of steroids for ≥ 2 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the skin or cured in-situ carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             unstable cardiac arrhythmias, psychiatric illness, or situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with the study requirements or the ability to willingly give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV, HBV, HCV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients or any patient with childbearing potential not&#xD;
             using adequate contraception.&#xD;
