      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In spite of well-researched treatments and therapies, 5 to 10 percent of tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      patients who have initially successful TB treatments will relapse, usually within a year&#xD;
      after completion of therapy. This percentage is even greater for patients who are infected&#xD;
      with multi-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant types of TB. Because the People s&#xD;
      Republic of China has the second highest number of TB cases in the world, researchers are&#xD;
      interested in studying TB patients in China to evaluate their response to treatment on a&#xD;
      long-term basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve TB diagnosis and testing by determining the number and proportion of patients&#xD;
           admitted with suspected TB who actually have TB (definite or probable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the prevalence of non-tuberculosis bacteria among patients with presumed TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have been admitted to Henan Provincial Chest&#xD;
      Hospital with suspected tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into three groups, based on their diagnosis after&#xD;
           admission. Another group of individuals who do not have TB will be enrolled as controls&#xD;
           for comparison purposes during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will use computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest at initial enrollment, 2&#xD;
           months, and 6 months to evaluate disease response to treatment. Incidents of TB that are&#xD;
           not in the chest area (extrapulmonary TB) will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will also monitor the treatments and therapies used against the disease,&#xD;
           changes in patients immune systems, and any changes in the biological samples taken over&#xD;
           the course of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite optimal antimicrobial treatment with directly observed short-course therapy (DOTS),&#xD;
      about 5-10 percent of drug-compliant patients with cured tuberculosis (TB or MTB) relapse,&#xD;
      usually within a year after completion of therapy. This percentage is even greater for&#xD;
      patients that have previously been treated for TB who often are infected with multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) organisms. The People s Republic of&#xD;
      China has the second highest number of cases of TB in the world, with a rate of 101&#xD;
      cases/100,000 person-years estimated for 2004. Based on the data of the 4th national TB&#xD;
      epidemiological survey in 2000, it is estimated that there were 1.96 million instances of&#xD;
      pulmonary TB. With an established MDR TB prevalence of 10.7 percent, there were an estimated&#xD;
      209,720 cases of pulmonary, bacteriology confirmed MDR TB in China in 2000. About half of all&#xD;
      prevalent cases of TB disease in 2000 were extrapulmonary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective longitudinal natural history study will monitor 150 subjects with suspected&#xD;
      TB at the Henan Provincial Chest Hospital during their initial response to antituberculous&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The subjects will be divided into 3 groups of TB-infected individuals: Cohort&#xD;
      A) acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive pulmonary disease; Cohort B) smear negative&#xD;
      pulmonary disease; and Cohort C) extra-pulmonary disease (EPTB) in order to reflect the&#xD;
      spectrum of TB manifestations observed at Henan Provincial Chest Hospital. We will also be&#xD;
      enrolling 45 non-TB suspects as controls (Cohort D). The control group will serve as a&#xD;
      comparison group for exploratory immunologic and diagnostic assays that may, in the future,&#xD;
      serve as ways to diagnose TB and/or evaluate response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this exploratory study, we will be looking at the change in total volume of disease as&#xD;
      detected by computerized tomography scans of the chest at baseline, at 2 months, and at 6&#xD;
      months. We will also be looking at scanned regions of extrapulmonary TB. In addition, we will&#xD;
      monitor chemotherapeutic regimen, changes in the host immune response, overall changes in&#xD;
      clinical parameters, initial and acquired drug-resistance of the infecting isolates, and&#xD;
      changes in bacterial and host markers in subject samples during chemotherapy. In each case,&#xD;
      we will look for associations of these parameters with rates of disease resolution correlated&#xD;
      with specific structural features determined by computerized tomography scanning of the sites&#xD;
      of TB disease (with the exception of TB meningitis and cutaneous TB, for which there are no&#xD;
      specific lesions to follow radiographically). These studies will allow us to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of entry criteria in future clinical trials and eventual TB diagnosis confirmation using&#xD;
      these entry categorizations. We will also be able to examine the impact of initial regimen&#xD;
      selection, and subsequent modifications, mycobacterial strain characteristics, extent of&#xD;
      disease, types of lesions and host immunologic response to the overall outcome of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, as well as potentially identify surrogate markers for improving monitoring of&#xD;
      the response to chemotherapy.&#xD;
