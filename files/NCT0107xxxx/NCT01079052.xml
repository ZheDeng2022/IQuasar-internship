      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study comparing famotidine tablets, USP&#xD;
      20 mg manufactured by OHM Laboratories with Pepcid速 AC Acid reducer famotidine tablets 20 mg&#xD;
      (containing famotidine 20 mg) distributed by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Merck Consumer Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Co. Fort Washington, PA 19034 USA under fed conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, all subjects were served a high-fat&#xD;
      high-calorie breakfast. Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast, subjects were&#xD;
      administered a single oral dose of famotidine tablets, USP 20 mg or Pepcid速 AC Acid reducer&#xD;
      famotidine tablets 20 mg (containing famotidine 20 mg) under low-light condition during each&#xD;
      period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature and under&#xD;
      supervision of trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done&#xD;
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood&#xD;
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study for all the subjects.&#xD;
