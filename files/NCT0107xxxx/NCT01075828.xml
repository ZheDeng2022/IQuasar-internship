      After consultation with the Korean Health Authorities, the two Post-Authorization Safety&#xD;
      Studies EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) were combined within one&#xD;
      study protocol EMR 062202-551. This Post-Marketing Surveillance Study (PMS) EMR 062202-551 is&#xD;
      requested by the Korean Health Authorities to continue monitoring of Erbitux and provide&#xD;
      further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice in at least 900 patients&#xD;
      during 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data points from the EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) remain&#xD;
      unchanged in protocol EMR 062202-551. Therefore, the Sponsor has decided not to separately&#xD;
      disclose the EMR 062202-551 study titled &quot;A Korean Post-Marketing Surveillance Study On&#xD;
      Erbitux速 (Cetuximab) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent and/or Metastatic&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (originally EMR 62241-508) and in Patients With&#xD;
      EGFR-expressing, KRAS wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (originally EMR 62202-509)&quot; on&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study on Erbitux速 (Cetuximab) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the&#xD;
      head and neck in Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will collect safety information from more than 300 subjects treated&#xD;
      with Erbitux as final evaluable cases. During the PMS period, subject background, subject's&#xD;
      medical (surgery, anti-cancer treatment) history, Erbitux treatment status, concurrent&#xD;
      medication, response evaluation, status and reason of discontinuation, all adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs; regardless of the causal relationship to Erbitux), and abnormal results of laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be collected for the study purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PMS is based on all cases treated with Erbitux at least once. The PMS will be done within&#xD;
      6 years from the approval date of the new indication. This PMS is requested by the Korean&#xD;
      Regulatory Authorities. After approval of new indication in Korea, it is further required to&#xD;
      investigate more than 300 subjects during 6 years according to local regulations to continue&#xD;
      monitoring and provide further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Analysis on safety and efficacy information on the use of Erbitux in the market&#xD;
      and factors affecting its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain safety information on the use of Erbitux in subjects with locally advanced&#xD;
           SCCHN or recurrent and/or metastatic in terms of frequency and severity of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gather clinical efficacy information of the treatment&#xD;
