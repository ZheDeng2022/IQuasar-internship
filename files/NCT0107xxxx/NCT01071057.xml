  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve how we treat itching, a common side effect associated&#xD;
      with the use of morphine pain medication. Itching is a problem experienced by up to 30% of&#xD;
      the children treated with pain medications in the morphine family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite studies demonstrating the effectiveness of using naloxone to treat itchiness in&#xD;
      adults receiving morphine pain medications, there are not many studies in children. This&#xD;
      study is designed to study how well naloxone works for treatment of itching in children&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Naloxone co-administered simultaneously with standard Patient Controlled&#xD;
      Analgesia (PCA) basal and bolus morphine will significantly reduce the incidence of Opioid&#xD;
      Induced Pruritus (OIP) without affecting analgesia or opioid consumption in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if naloxone (12 µg/ml) mixed in a single infusion with morphine (1 mg/ml)&#xD;
           will be effective in the prevention of opioid induced pruritus (OIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if treatment with naloxone will result in attenuation of analgesia or an&#xD;
           increase in opioid utilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if treatment with naloxone will reduce other opioid induced side effects&#xD;
           such as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is divided into two phases. Phase 1 - Although, there are studies&#xD;
      confirming the compatibility of morphine (4 mg/mL) with naloxone (16 µg/mL) in separate&#xD;
      infusion pumps run into the same intravenous site, there are no studies confirming the&#xD;
      chemical and physical compatibility of morphine and naloxone in the same syringe with the&#xD;
      standard concentrations used at BCCH. Therefore, a compatibility and stability study of&#xD;
      naloxone and morphine solution in the same syringe will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Phase 2 is a blinded clinical trial where 70 subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either morphine mixed with naloxone or morphine mixed with placebo.With institutional review&#xD;
      board approval, and written parental/guardian informed consent (and assent if appropriate),&#xD;
      we will recruit children, ages 5-16 years, receiving intravenous opioids via PCA for&#xD;
      post-operative pain control. Subjects will be evaluated every 4 hr for pain scores, frequency&#xD;
      of vomiting, nausea, pruritus, sedation, and respiratory depression. At 24 and 48 hr, the&#xD;
      total morphine consumption will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Differences in the incidence and intensity of pruritus between the two groups&#xD;
      will be compared. We will review side effects using the following control variables: (1)&#xD;
      demographic data; and (2) summation of opioid use in each 4 hr period for total opioid&#xD;
      consumption. ANOVA and crosstabs will be used where appropriate to analyze data.&#xD;
