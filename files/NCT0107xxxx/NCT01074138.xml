  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for patients with bone-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer is&#xD;
      chemotherapy. If a patient elects not to choose chemotherapy, 70% will progress within 6&#xD;
      months. KX2-391 given orally twice a day for 6 months will be evaluated for its ability to&#xD;
      delay/prevent disease progression in patients who have not had prior chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of orally administered KX2-391 in adult&#xD;
      male patients with progressive bone-metastatic CRPC. Patients must have 1) documented&#xD;
      bone-metastatic prostate cancer, 2) castrate levels of testosterone, 3) not received prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and 4) documented disease progression based on rising PSA, progressive&#xD;
      measurable visceral disease and/or progressive bone lesions (one criteria is sufficient) as&#xD;
      per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) guidelines (Scher et al 2008).&#xD;

             value relative to the 2nd value AND in the 2nd value relative to the 1st value (i.e.&#xD;
             two consecutive rises over time muse be noted). Given potential for fluctuations in&#xD;
             PSA values, one drop in rising PSA values over time may be seen when determining&#xD;
             eligibility. Pre-therapy PSA doubling time may also be calculated (if there are 3 or&#xD;
             more values 4 or more weeks apart.&#xD;
