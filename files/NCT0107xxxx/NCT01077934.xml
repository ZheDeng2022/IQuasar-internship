  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the reliability and accuracy of Near Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (NIRS) in the detection of intra-compartmental tissue perfusion in injured and&#xD;
      noninjured extremities over time. We hypothesize that this technology, combined with vital&#xD;
      signs, intracompartmental pressures and clinical examinations, will be useful in diagnosing&#xD;
      acute compartment syndrome (ACS), monitoring patients at risk for ACS, and evaluating the&#xD;
      adequacy of fasciotomy in patients treated for ACS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is associated with lower leg trauma in up to 20% of high&#xD;
      energy injuries. ACS occurs when the pressure due to swelling exceeds the perfusion pressure&#xD;
      thereby cutting off blood flow to the leg. If untreated, the results can be catastrophic with&#xD;
      an insensate, contracted leg. Moreover, there is a high risk of subsequent infection and even&#xD;
      amputation. The treatment for ACS, a four compartment fasciotomy, is aimed at releasing the&#xD;
      pressure through two incisions from roughly the knee to the ankle. Often due to wound&#xD;
      expansion, the incisions require multiple debridements and skin grafting to close. With&#xD;
      fasciotomies, fractures are converted from closed to open injuries. When left open for many&#xD;
      days, the risk of infection and complications such as nonunion increase significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only accepted objective method for diagnosis of ACS is to measure the pressure inside the&#xD;
      leg compartments by using a large gauge needle hooked to a pressure monitor. However, these&#xD;
      readings can be erroneous if not performed correctly. As such, ACS continues to be a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis which is made based on the surgeon's experience and their interpretation of the&#xD;
      character of the injury (high-energy, motorcycle crash, vs. low-energy, a twisted ankle).&#xD;
      Clinicians are left to attempt to interpret physical exam findings and readings from pressure&#xD;
      monitors. Most importantly ACS is not an event, but a process that can manifest at multiple&#xD;
      points after injury. The most accurate and effective method for diagnosing and appropriately&#xD;
      treating ACS is serial examination over a course of hours to days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we hope to evaluate the NIRS device, which is non-invasive, as diagnostic&#xD;
      tool in the evaluation of acute compartment syndrome. We plan to evaluate all patients by the&#xD;
      gold standard in diagnosing acute compartment syndrome while simultaneously evaluating the&#xD;
      patient with the NIRS device. This will allow us to determine if the NIRS device can&#xD;
      accurately and reliably predict the development of acute compartment syndrome in a&#xD;
      non-invasive, longitudinal manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Access to a precise, reliable, and noninvasive method for early diagnosis of ACS would be a&#xD;
      landmark achievement in orthopaedic and emergency medicine.&quot;&#xD;
