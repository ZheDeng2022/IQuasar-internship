      Urinary peroxides and plasma glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio will be&#xD;
      measured in preterm infants less than 32 weeks gestation before and 7 days after receiving&#xD;
      either Light-protected (Group 1) or Light-exposed (Group 2) Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective single blinded randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inborn preterm infant less than 32 wks gestational age, receiving TPN in neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit (NICU) of Mansoura University Children's Hospital as a part of their care will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infant will be randomly divided into 2group:- Group 1 includes preterm infant who&#xD;
      will receive their TPN through bags and tubing system that are protected from light by&#xD;
      aluminum foil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 includes preterm infant who will receive their TPN through bags and tubing system&#xD;
      that are exposed to light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done using random table technique with opaque sealed envelopes&#xD;
      containing the serial number and the group to which the subject will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These envelopes will be kept in the unit ready for use at any time; each one has a number&#xD;
      which is the serial number of the baby and group of TPN to which the baby will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urine sample will be sent to the laboratory with this serial number with no information&#xD;
      about the group of study to which this sample follows for peroxide level as well as blood&#xD;
      sample for GSH\GSSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two blood samples and two urine samples will be collected. The first one will be at 0 hour&#xD;
      before starting TPN regimen as a base line and the second will be at 7 days of starting TPN&#xD;
      regimen. Blood sample will be at least 1cc of blood for GSH/GSSG assay. Urine collection bag&#xD;
      will be placed on the infant to obtain minimum of 1cc of urine for urinary peroxide level&#xD;
      assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary outcomes will be assessed with duration of NICU admission including death and&#xD;
      /or bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infant at time of hospital discharge, necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis with positive blood cultures, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), time to full enteral feeding, duration of respiratory&#xD;
      support, liver function, cholestasis defined as an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin &gt;2&#xD;
      mg/dL, and metabolic response.&#xD;
