      The main objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of U3-1784 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           tumours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and or establish the safety and&#xD;
           tolerability of the maximum administered dose (MAD) of U3-1784&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumours&#xD;
             refractory to, intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who decline&#xD;
             standard therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 2: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC refractory to,&#xD;
             intolerant of, or not eligible for standard treatment, or who decline standard&#xD;
             therapy, or for whom no therapy with curative intent is available. If emerging Part 1&#xD;
             data suggest that a particular tumour type or specific tumour histology might be&#xD;
             responsive to treatment, then patients with this tumour type or histology will also be&#xD;
             included in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients, 18 years of age or older.&#xD;

             within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females of childbearing potential are permitted in the study so long as they&#xD;
             consent to avoid getting their partner pregnant or becoming pregnant, respectively, by&#xD;
             using a highly effective contraception method, as described below, throughout the&#xD;
             study and for up to 90 days after completion. Highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception include: hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation,&#xD;
             intrauterine device; surgical sterilization (including partner's vasectomy) or sexual&#xD;
             abstinence, if this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Women of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically sterile or&#xD;
