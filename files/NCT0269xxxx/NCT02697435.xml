  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is a huge problem for millions of Americans, including nearly 11 million Veterans.&#xD;
      Our older Veterans suffer the most. Citizens spend billions of dollars, yet consistently get&#xD;
      poor results. Primary Care Providers are often tasked with diagnosing and treating Chronic&#xD;
      Low Back Pain, even though they are often undereducated in the field. These PCPs often use&#xD;
      advanced imaging, usually MRIs to guide care. These images often show degenerative disc&#xD;
      disease and other common pathologies in older adults, even those who are pain free, which can&#xD;
      lead to misdiagnosis and treatment. The investigators believe that Chronic Low Back Pain is a&#xD;
      syndrome, a final common pathway for the expression of multiple contributors that often lie&#xD;
      outside the spine itself. For example, hip osteoarthritis, knee pain, and even anxiety could&#xD;
      all lessen back pain if addressed and treated probably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will measure participants' low back pain-associated disability with the&#xD;
      well-validated RMDQ. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly via telephone. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that veterans who receive PCCET will experience significantly&#xD;
      greater reduction in low back pain-associated disability than those who receive IAUC at six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also measure participants' low back pain with the 0-10 Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale for Pain. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly via telephone. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that veterans who receive PCCET will experience significantly&#xD;
      greater reduction in low back pain than those who receive IAUC at six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare patients treated with usual care, which usually starts&#xD;
      with imaging, versus patients who are treated by trained geriatricians who know how to&#xD;
      recognize and address 11 key conditions that commonly drive pain and disability in older&#xD;
      adults. The investigators believe that older patients who receive care tailored to their&#xD;
      needs by educated PCPs will ultimately have less back pain and, more importantly, better&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of our 22 million US military Veterans are age 65 and older and, within this&#xD;
      population, low back pain is common, costly and often disabling. The prevalence of low back&#xD;
      pain in those 85+, the most vulnerable and fastest growing segment of society, is estimated&#xD;
      at 44%. Chronic low back pain (CLBP, i.e., present for 6 months or more) is associated with&#xD;
      the overwhelming majority of healthcare resource utilization and personal suffering. Treating&#xD;
      back problems cost Americans more than $30 billion in 2007- up from $16 billion in 1997 (in&#xD;
      2007 dollars). Despite these staggering data, there is no evidence that the care of patients&#xD;
      with CLBP has improved, and the use of invasive, potentially morbid, and often ineffective&#xD;
      interventions (e.g., epidural corticosteroid injections and spine surgery) continues to&#xD;
      skyrocket. Primary care providers (PCP) who are tasked with treating CLBP without adequate&#xD;
      education often use advanced imaging (most commonly magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to&#xD;
      guide care. Imaging-identified pathology (e.g., degenerative disc and facet disease, bulging&#xD;
      discs) is ubiquitous in older adults, even in those that are pain-free. It is not surprising,&#xD;
      therefore, that imaging-guided treatments often lead to suboptimal outcomes and potential&#xD;
      morbidity. In contrast to how CLBP is often conceptualized and treated, the investigators&#xD;
      conceptualize CLBP as a syndrome, that is, a final common pathway for the expression of&#xD;
      multiple contributors that often lie outside the spine itself, for example, hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia syndrome, and anxiety. Treating CLBP and ameliorating disability&#xD;
      in older adults necessitates addressing multiple conditions and risk factors; however, the&#xD;
      expertise to evaluate and treat all of the disorders that can contribute to CLBP typically&#xD;
      resides in multiple specialty silos, making a comprehensive approach to treating CLBP&#xD;
      difficult to implement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the support of a 2-year Rehab R&amp;D Merit Review pilot award, the investigators have&#xD;
      laid the essential foundation for delivering more comprehensive and patient-centric care to&#xD;
      older Veterans with CLBP. The investigators have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1) synthesized, through a modified Delphi process, evidence on evaluating and treating&#xD;
           11 key conditions that commonly drive pain and disability in older adults with CLBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2) created algorithms to be used in the clinical setting to treat these 11 conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3) successfully trained geriatrician providers in a practical structured assessment of&#xD;
           the 11 conditions, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4) validated the prevalence of these conditions specifically in older Veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current application, the investigators are proposing a 2-site pilot study to explore&#xD;
      the impact of delivering patient-centered comprehensive evaluation and treatment (PCCET) as&#xD;
      compared with imaging-associated usual care (IAUC) to older Veterans with CLBP. In addition&#xD;
      to examining whether PCCET is more effective than IAUC for reducing pain and functional&#xD;
      limitations when delivered by geriatricians in 2 VA medical centers, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate PCCET's impact on health-related quality of life and health care utilization. The&#xD;
      investigators also will collect data to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing&#xD;
      PCCET from the perspective of patients and providers.&#xD;

    <description>The Roland Morris Questionnaire is a 24 item yes/no measure of back pain interference with various daily activities. It is a well validated measure of low back pain disability. The total score ranges from 0 to 24 with a higher score meaning greater impairment. Our main outcome measure is reported as the change in Roland Morris score from baseline to 6 months.</description>

        <description>The Roland Morris Questionnaire is a 24 item yes/no measure of back pain interference with various daily activities. It is a well validated measure of low back pain disability. The total score ranges from 0 to 24 with a higher score meaning greater impairment. Our main outcome measure is reported as the change in Roland Morris score from baseline to 6 months.</description>
