      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gravid diseases are complications in pregnancy. They include gestational diabetes and&#xD;
      preeclampsia. These can cause problems with how a fetus grows. Being pregnant with twins can&#xD;
      make complications more likely. Research suggests that changes in fetal soft tissue may be&#xD;
      the earliest signs of growth problems. These tissue changes are in lean mass, fat mass, and&#xD;
      organ size. 3D images might detect these changes earlier than 2D images. This could help&#xD;
      manage gravid diseases. The NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons measured fetal growth for&#xD;
      four racial groups, Caucasian, African American, Asian, and Hispanic. Fetuses of obese women&#xD;
      and women with twins were also measured. 2D and 3D images were taken at various stages of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Measurements were taken after birth. Researchers want to expand this study by&#xD;
      measuring organ volumes and body composition by racial group and in twins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To set standards for body composition and organ volumes by race. To understand the&#xD;
      relationship between gravid diseases and changes in fetal body composition and organ volume&#xD;
      over the course of pregnancy. To find out whether these are different for twins than for&#xD;
      single pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who participated in the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will come from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies - Singletons and Twins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review scans taken in the previous study. They will take measurements from&#xD;
      the scans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) will conduct a research study&#xD;
      entitled: &quot;Fetal Body Composition and Volumes Study&quot; to catalog and perform 2 Dimensional&#xD;
      (2D) and 3 Dimensional (3D) measurement of the obstetrical ultrasound images in the existing&#xD;
      bank of singleton and twin gestations collected from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. The&#xD;
      research study aims to augment the singleton Study with organ volumes by racial group and to&#xD;
      understand the relationship between gravid diseases and longitudinal changes in fetal body&#xD;
      composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and organ measurements (in singletons) over the&#xD;
      course of pregnancy, thereby, complementing available data for the Cohort.&#xD;
