    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers will test the effectiveness of a self-management education&#xD;
      programme, on self-management behaviours of patients with type two diabetes. Up to 230&#xD;
      consenting participants will be recruited from outpatient diabetes clinics in Jordan, 230&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to one of two groups. Group 1 ( 115 patients) have received&#xD;
      the intervention, which consisted of an introductory session of tailored, face-to-face&#xD;
      education and advice, followed by educational materials to take away, and regular telephone&#xD;
      support at a regularity specified by the patient, over a three-month period. This&#xD;
      intervention is based on behavioural change theory called the&#xD;
      Information-Motivational-Behavioural skills model. Group 2 (115 patients) have received usual&#xD;
      clinical care with no additional intervention. Researchers have assessed the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention by measuring self-care strategies (dietary habits, physical activity and&#xD;
      managing diabetes medications), diabetes control (HbA1c), quality of life and Diabetes&#xD;
      Self-Management Knowledge, Motivation and Self-Efficacy at 3 time points: before the&#xD;
      intervention, at 3 months and at 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is prevalent, costly to healthcare services and associated&#xD;
      with significant mortality; over 1.5 million deaths occur directly by diabetes in low and&#xD;
      middle-income countries (WHO,2014) and diabetes is predicted to be the seventh leading cause&#xD;
      of death by 2030. Ajlouni et al (2008) estimated that approximately one million people in&#xD;
      Jordan have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes; a figure that is increasing. More than half&#xD;
      a million Jordanians have an uncontrolled level of Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c &gt;7.5%) due&#xD;
      to factors such as sedentary lifestyle and poor medication management. To prevent diabetes&#xD;
      microvascular and macro vascular complications, increased efforts and attention need to be&#xD;
      directed towards improving glycaemic levels and improving metabolic outcomes through&#xD;
      appropriate glycaemic management. Intensive diabetes management by anti-hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      medications alone may improve metabolic outcomes, but may also lead to side effects for&#xD;
      patients such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Patients with diabetes are strongly&#xD;
      recommended to engage in self-management over their glucose levels and this may be best&#xD;
      achieved through educating patients in self-management of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Didactic interventions have shown to improve metabolic outcomes, although benefits last less&#xD;
      than six months and are not sustained in the long term. Educational programs need to target&#xD;
      psychological factors such as patient's confidence, to ensure self-management strategies are&#xD;
      sustained in the long term. Barriers in diabetes self-management behaviours map on to the&#xD;
      Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills (IMB) Model of behavioural change. The model was&#xD;
      critically constructed based on analysing previous interventions and addressing limitations&#xD;
      of the theories that have been used among clients with HIV risk. Chang et al (2014)&#xD;
      systematically reviewed the IMB model-based behavioural interventions and found that effects&#xD;
      of IMB model persisted up to 12 months in studies followed up patients for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To examine the effects of IMB Model-based Diabetes Self-Management Educational (DSME)&#xD;
      intervention on three self-management activities: patients' eating habits, physical activity&#xD;
      and medications management, in patients who attend an outpatients diabetes clinics at Jordan&#xD;
      University Hospital and Prince Hamzeh Hospital in Jordan. The hypothesis to be tested is that&#xD;
      the IMB educational program will improve participants' behavioural outcomes in self-care at 6&#xD;
      months compared with control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research protocol and methods: A two group trial with randomised allocation of 230&#xD;
      participants on 1:1 average for both groups. Intervention group will receive the educational&#xD;
      intervention. Control group will receive usual clinical care and referral to diabetes&#xD;
      educational consultation if required. This intervention is an individualised DSME program&#xD;
      based on Information-Motivation-Behavioural (IMB) skills theory. IMB behavioural change&#xD;
      theory assumption proposes that health-related behaviour information, motivation and&#xD;
      behavioural skills are primary determinants of promoting health behaviour. The intervention&#xD;
      will be based on a validated DSME toolkit and will be delivered using motivational&#xD;
      interviewing techniques through a two face-to-face session and follow-up phone calls at&#xD;
      patients preferred frequency for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur at 3 time points; baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Measures will&#xD;
      include self-management knowledge, motivation, behavioural skills, diabetes outcomes (HbA1c),&#xD;
      blood pressure and weight. At 3 months, some participants in the intervention group will be&#xD;
      selected using purposive sampling, to participate in a process evaluation interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable end point/statistical power of the study: Primary outcome is diabetes self-care&#xD;
      activities measured at 6 months using the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale&#xD;
      (SDSCA) questionnaire. Statistical power of 0.8 has been used to calculate study sample.&#xD;
