  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multicenter, single-arm, observational study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of a systematic direct stenting strategy with the Svelte SLENDER IDS&#xD;
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent-on-a-Wire Integrated Delivery System (SLENDER IDS) in an&#xD;
      all-comers, real-world population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this post-market study, the population will include real-world subjects who are intended&#xD;
      to be treated, with SLENDER IDS as standard therapy. Follow-up contacts post procedure will&#xD;
      be made for clinical assessments at hospital discharge, 1, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, observational all-comers&#xD;
      clinical study to collect ongoing safety and efficacy of SLENDER IDS and to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a direct stenting strategy in an all-comers population. A minimum of two&#xD;
      hundred fifty (250) subjects will be treated at up to 20 sites in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of safety data and risks to subjects will be monitored by an independent Clinical&#xD;
      Events Committee (CEC) at pre-specified enrollment milestones.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject has symptomatic heart disease due to coronary artery lesions of length &lt; 28 mm&#xD;
             and a reference vessel diameter 2.5 - 4.0 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is intended to be treated with PCI and implantation of SLENDER IDS as part of&#xD;
             his/her standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject or subject's legal representative understands the study requirements and the&#xD;

             tests or procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is unable to receive anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulant therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is allergic to sirolimus, PEA III Ac Bz, cobalt, chromium, nickel or tungsten;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is judged to have lesions preventing complete inflation of an angioplasty&#xD;
             balloon or proper placement of a coronary stent, including chronic total occlusions.&#xD;

             on the standard of care for the cath lab);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device clinical trial that&#xD;
             the investigator feels would interfere with the subject's participation in this study.&#xD;
