      To show that the addition of a self-rehabilitation program to standard treatment, involving&#xD;
      repeated BTI and usual physiotherapy, improves impairment and activity limitation of the&#xD;
      paretic upper limb more than the control treatment (BTI + usual physiotherapy), in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled study of patients with spastic hemiparesis following stroke.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, 30% of patients are left with a &quot;hemiplegic&quot; upper limb meaning that they&#xD;
      are unable to carry out any movements with the limb and are thus partially or totally&#xD;
      dependent for all activities of daily living (dressing, washing, feeding etc). Another 40%&#xD;
      have some proximal recovery. These patients are able to carry out some movement of the&#xD;
      shoulder and sometimes the elbow. They can use the limb for some activities of daily living&#xD;
      such as carrying a bag or stabilising paper while writing. The last 30% recover a certain&#xD;
      degree of prehension, however their motor control is altered and they have impairments of&#xD;
      both the reaching and grasping phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for chronic stroke symptoms (more than 6 months post-onset) including impairments&#xD;
      and activity limitations is mostly based on physiotherapy and botulinum toxin injections&#xD;
      (BTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy : This treatment has been shown to be effective, and is essential to reduce&#xD;
      impairments and improve function in patients with hemiparesis following stroke (Robertson et&#xD;
      al, 2008 ; Bourgeais et al, 2010). Different methods exist, and comparative studies of the&#xD;
      most common ones have shown a similar effectiveness (Adal et al, 2006 ; Flansbjer et al, 2008&#xD;
      ; Brazzelli et al, 2011, Durstine et al 2009). No conventional treatment has been shown to be&#xD;
      more effective than another. However, it has been demonstrated that the intensity and&#xD;
      specificity of rehabilitation techniques are positively correlated with motor recovery&#xD;
      (Gordon et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity of rehabilitation: In 2006, a meta-analysis of 21 studies on the effect of muscle&#xD;
      strengthening post stroke showed that it improved active function and activities of daily&#xD;
      living (measured on different scales) following acute and chronic stroke (Ada et al, 2006).&#xD;
      Currently, a meta-analysis by Brazzelli et al. (2011) contains the largest collection of&#xD;
      data, with 32 studies and a total of 1414 participants. The studies included were on the&#xD;
      subject of cardiovascular training, muscle strengthening and mixed training&#xD;
      (cardiovascular+strength). The main outcome measures were the incidence of mortality and the&#xD;
      degree of dependence and disability. The results showed improvements following cardiovascular&#xD;
      training and mixed training. Strength training alone did not significantly improve mobility.&#xD;
      These results lead the American College of Sport and Medicine to recommend endurance and&#xD;
      strength training coupled with stretching for stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task-oriented training : Carr et Shepherd (1998) were the first to promote task oriented&#xD;
      training. More recently, Van de port et al, (2009-2012) evaluated 250 patients following 12&#xD;
      weeks of task-oriented circuit training (126 patients) or conventional physiotherapy (124&#xD;
      patients). All the patients were at least 6 months post stroke. The training consisted of&#xD;
      6-minute work stations with 8 different exercises, such as rising from a chair to reach&#xD;
      different targets, picking up objects from the floor while walking, kicking a ball, crossing&#xD;
      obstacles, ascending and descending stairs etc. Greater improvements occurred in the&#xD;
      task-oriented group for the six-minute walk test and the Stair test (time to ascend and&#xD;
      descend a flight of 10 stairs. Another meta-analysis (including 307 participants)&#xD;
      demonstrated that task-oriented training improves distance walked, gait speed and the Timed&#xD;
      Up and Go test (rising from a chair, walking 3 metres, turning and returning to sit) (Wevers&#xD;
      et al, 2009). These results show that training should involve practice of the specific&#xD;
      function to be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin injections : Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by the clostridium&#xD;
      botulinum bacteria. Seven different serotypes exist but only the A and B serotypes are used&#xD;
      in clinical practice. Botulinum toxin blocks the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter at&#xD;
      the neuromuscular junction. Focal transitory paralysis thus occurs in the injected muscle.&#xD;
      Its action lasts on average 3 months in striated skeletal muscle. The effect of BTI in the&#xD;
      upper limb depends on the parameters studied. A meta-analysis carried out by Foley et al,&#xD;
      2013 showed a relatively large effect size for the reduction of impairment and the&#xD;
      improvement of passive function. However, there was only a small effect size for the&#xD;
      improvement of functions such as prehension. This confirms the results of a previous study&#xD;
      (Sheean et al, 2010) which showed that the effect of BTI in the upper limb was only&#xD;
      significant for the reduction of impairment or the improvement of passive function, but not&#xD;
      active function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results were further confirmed in a study which used goal attainment scaling as an&#xD;
      outcome measure (Turner Stokes et al, 2010). Following BTI in the upper limb of hemiparetic&#xD;
      patients, there was a significant improvement in the goal attainment scaling score which was,&#xD;
      moreover, strongly correlated with the reduction in spasticity evaluated with the Ashworth&#xD;
      scale (most widely used scale for the evaluation of spasticity). The results also showed that&#xD;
      the goal was more often attained when it involved the improvement of a passive function than&#xD;
      an active function. The only study to have shown an improvement in prehension following BTI&#xD;
      involved combined treatment with constraint induced therapy (Sun et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-rehabilitation Two recent studies have shown that rehabilitation coupled with BTI could&#xD;
      have a significant effect on activity limitation: A pilot randomised controlled trial of 35&#xD;
      patients with spastic hemiparesis by Roche et al (2014) showed that a 30-minute, daily&#xD;
      self-rehabilitation program coupled with a single session of BTI in the lower limb&#xD;
      significantly improved several gait-related activities. The self-rehabilitation program was&#xD;
      developed to combine different types of exercises including: i) strengthening of the hip&#xD;
      flexors and extensors and the triceps sural; ii) stretching of the rectus femoris, hamstrings&#xD;
      and triceps sural and iii) task-oriented gait-related exercises including obstacle crossing&#xD;
      and slaloming. They showed significantly greater improvements in the experimental group than&#xD;
      the control group for maximal gait speed in the 10-metre walk test, distance walked in the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test and the time to ascend and descend a flight of stairs. Sun et al (2010)&#xD;
      carried out a randomised controlled trial which included 32 patients with stroke. They showed&#xD;
      that constraint-induced therapy in the paretic upper limb coupled with BTI significantly&#xD;
      improved prehension and reduced spasticity in the finger and wrist flexors more than BTI&#xD;
      coupled with standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary Together, these results indicate that the addition of a self-rehabilitation&#xD;
      program to botulinum toxin injections is the most pertinent method to optimise the effects of&#xD;
      BTI and usual therapy. However, no study has yet evaluated the effects of the addition of a&#xD;
      self-rehabilitation program to treatment by BTI and usual therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, this corresponds to a public health issue which is to provide a greater intensity&#xD;
      of rehabilitation within the constraints of the health system, including lack of funding and&#xD;
      lack of physiotherapists trained in this type of specialised rehabilitation.&#xD;
