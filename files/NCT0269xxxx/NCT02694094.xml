    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the short term and long term effects of ketogenic&#xD;
      diets on measures of cardiovascular health. Such measures include cholesterol levels, blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, and thickening of the blood vessel wall over time. Adults aged 18 or older&#xD;
      who are already on a ketogenic diet for at least 12 months or who are interested in beginning&#xD;
      on the modified Atkins diet may join.&#xD;

      If participants agree to be in this study, the investigators will ask the participants to do&#xD;
      the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Initial enrollment for both longterm ketogenic diet and new modified Atkins diet&#xD;
      participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of calendars (showing seizures) and 3-day food record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs will be drawn as well as levels of low density&#xD;
           lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will receive a high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries in the&#xD;
           neck performed either the day of enrollment or within 1 month of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up clinic visits (month 3 and month 6) for new modified Atkins diet participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of calendars and food records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Labs repeated - standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs as well as levels of low&#xD;
           density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up clinic visits (month 12 and month 24) for new modified Atkins diet participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of calendars and food records&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Labs repeated - standard modified Atkins diet clinic labs as well as levels of low&#xD;
           density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions, fatty acids, and apolipoproteins B and A-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check height and weight, blood pressure, skin-fold thickness and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries in the&#xD;
           neck performed either the day of follow-up or within 1 month of follow-up&#xD;
