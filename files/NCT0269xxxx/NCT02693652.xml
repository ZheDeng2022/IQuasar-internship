      -  Objectives: To explore the appropriate dose of a therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine through&#xD;
           the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects: Chronic hepatitis B carrier with normal ALT range&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study hypothesis: The immune tolerance break and strong immune responses in the chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis B carrier could be achieved with therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine containing&#xD;
           novel adjuvant&#xD;
