    <textblock>
      The study design is an open-label pharmacokinetic study in healthy G6PD normal Thai subjects.&#xD;
      This study will enroll 16 healthy subjects. Participants who pass the screening process will&#xD;
      have 6 admissions in the hospital to receive 6 drug regimens as below&#xD;
&#xD;
      First admission visit: The subject may be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      Artemether-Lumefantrine or Amodiaquine with more than 6 weeks washout period before second&#xD;
      admission visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second admission visit: Subject who receives Artemether-Lumefantrine from previous visit will&#xD;
      receive amodiaquine in this visit and vice versa. This visit will required more than 6 weeks&#xD;
      washout period before third admission visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third admission visit: Every subject will receive Artemether-lumefantrine and Amodiaquine&#xD;
      with more than 6 weeks washout period before forth admission visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forth admission visit: Every subject will receive Primaquine with more than 1 week washout&#xD;
      period before fifth admission visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifth admission visit: Subject may randomize to receive either Artemether-Lumefantrine and&#xD;
      Primaquine or Artemether-Lumefantrine and Amodiaquine and Primaquine in this visit with more&#xD;
      than 6 weeks washout period before sixth admission visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixth admission visit: Subject who receives Artemether-Lumefantrine and Amodiaquine and&#xD;
      primaquine from previous visit will receive Artemether-Lumefantrine and Primaquine in this&#xD;
      visit and vice versa.&#xD;

             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication&#xD;
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of&#xD;
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             compromise subject safety; the investigator will take advice from the manufacturer&#xD;
             representative as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new&#xD;
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 x half-life, or twice the duration of the&#xD;
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject is unwilling to abstain from ingesting alcohol within 48 hours prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             sample during each regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have donated blood to the extent that participation in the study would&#xD;
             result in more than 300 mL blood donated within a 30-day period. Note: This does not&#xD;
             include plasma donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have a history of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or&#xD;
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,&#xD;
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to&#xD;
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. AST or ALT &gt;1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with history of renal disease, hepatic disease, and/or cholecystectomy&#xD;

             chloroquine, primaquine, artesunate, piperaquine and pyronaridine treatment within 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
