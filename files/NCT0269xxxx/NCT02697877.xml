  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether myocardial perfusion reserve, measured during&#xD;
      routine clinically ordered regadenoson stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has prognostic&#xD;
      value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events. Myocardial perfusion reserve will be&#xD;
      measured with CMR by assessing blood flow through the coronary-sinus - the primary vein in&#xD;
      the heart.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial perfusion reserve is the ratio of global myocardial blood flow at stress vs. rest.&#xD;
      Traditionally, it has been measured non-invasively using quantitative positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Several recent studies have suggested&#xD;
      that measurement of myocardial perfusion reserve provides significant additive prognostic&#xD;
      information during stress perfusion imaging in patients with known or suspected coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. Myocardial perfusion reserve depends not only on trans-stenotic pressure&#xD;
      gradient of the epicardial arteries and thus stenosis severity but even more on the ability&#xD;
      of the coronary microvasculature (especially the pre-arterioles) to dilate. Therefore,&#xD;
      coronary microvascular dysfunction, which impairs pre-arteriolar function, reduces myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion reserve independently of the presence of epicardial coronary stenosis. Hence, the&#xD;
      ability to measure myocardial perfusion reserve allows a more comprehensive assessment of the&#xD;
      entire coronary circulation, beyond the current paradigm of the epicardial arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, both PET and current CMR techniques are cumbersome, and in the case of PET require&#xD;
      radiation as well as on-site Rubidium-82 generators. Therefore, they are challenging for&#xD;
      routine clinical practice and have been limited to specialized research centers. An&#xD;
      alternative, simple CMR method for measurement of myocardial perfusion reserve by quantifying&#xD;
      change in coronary sinus flow has been described. The coronary sinus drains approximately 96%&#xD;
      of total myocardial blood flow and provides a potentially convenient location for measurement&#xD;
      of global myocardial blood flow. This method has been validated against both invasive and PET&#xD;
      techniques. The investigators hypothesized that measurement of coronary sinus flow at stress&#xD;
      and rest may provide a simple and rapid assessment of myocardial perfusion reserve during&#xD;
      regadenoson stress perfusion CMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use phase contrast images obtained from patients during their clinically&#xD;
      indicated CMR stress study to calculate myocardial perfusion reserve as the ratio of maximum&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow to baseline blood flow - at the coronary sinus. Coronary sinus flow&#xD;
      will be calculated by post-processing of images after the patient has left the scanner. In&#xD;
      brief, the contour of the coronary sinus will be traced on the flow images throughout the&#xD;
      cardiac cycle. Coronary sinus flow is calculated by integrating the momentary flow rate&#xD;
      values from each cardiac phase over the entire cardiac cycle and multiplying by the mean&#xD;
      heart rate during the acquisition. Patients will be followed for the occurrence of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, late revascularization, hospitalization&#xD;
      for heart failure or unstable angina).&#xD;
