      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing cesarean sections will be enrolled in this study after obtaining verbal&#xD;
      consent as there are no extra interventional measures that will be undertaken in the study&#xD;
      apart from routine investigations and procedures done during cesarean sections, being already&#xD;
      approved in signed consent to undergo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature and aim of the work will be fully discussed to all women who will agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Verbal consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      study which is approved by the local ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation of patients included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history taking including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Personal (name, age)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complaint (in patient word)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Present history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history (Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past history (any surgeries)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examination including vital data (blood pressure,pulse, temperature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routine hematologic laboratory tests including complete blood picture &amp; random blood&#xD;
           sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The surgical site will be assessed at least once before cesarean section if the&#xD;
           participant presented to emergency department with findings concerning for surgical-site&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Indication for cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of ruptured membranes if found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Risk of infection including Diabetes mellitus, immuno-compromised, rupture of membranes&#xD;
           and corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients In the study group (povidone iodine group) patients will be prepared with vaginal&#xD;
      cleansing with povidone-iodine along with the usual abdominal scrub. Vaginal cleansing will&#xD;
      be done with 3 gauze pieces soaked with 10% povidone iodine in a sterilized bowl and the&#xD;
      scrub will be done from the vaginal apex to introitus with attention to the anterior,&#xD;
      posterior and lateral vaginal wall. After vaginal cleansing the gloves will be changed to&#xD;
      perform the abdominal scrub.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group (no vaginal cleansing group) will not have any vaginal wash&#xD;
      (even tap water will not be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, patients will receive preoperative per protocol prophylactic I.V. antibiotics&#xD;
      (third generation cephalosporin ) before skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study all cases will be subjected to exclusion and inclusion criteria. Any risk&#xD;
      of infection will be assessed including rupture of membranes, Diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      immune-compromised and corticosteroid therapy….etc. Cesarean section will be performed with&#xD;
      estimation of operative duration in time and mean operative blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up for temperature of 38°C and greater during first 24 hours of surgery and&#xD;
      endometritis will be diagnosed by fever 38.4°C and greater with any of the following (uterine&#xD;
      tenderness ,foul smelling lochia or positive C-reactive protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean hospital stay in days will be determined. N.B: Culture of the upper genital tract are&#xD;
      virtually impossible to obtain without contaminating the specimen by the microorganisms in&#xD;
      the vagina. Therefore, they rarely add significant information that enhances clinical&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
