      The purpose of this project is to create a database to collect information about the NEW&#xD;
      Keiki Program. The information collected for this project will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      program. The NEW Keiki program promotes healthy lifestyles and behavior changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A database containing pre and post program information will be developed. For the referred&#xD;
      patients, this database will contain information related to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity-related Medical co-morbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, e.g.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lab values (fasting lipids, glucose, LFTs, HbA1c)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric data (ht, weight, BMI) and select vital signs (BP, HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fitness testing data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical address)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answers to a lifestyle, attitudes, and health habits survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answers to a program survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information for follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participating family members (parents, grandparents, siblings, e.g.) this data base will&#xD;
      contain information related to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Past medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity-related Medical co-morbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, e.g.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric data (ht, weight, BMI) and select vital signs (BP, HR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographical address)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answers to a lifestyle, attitudes, and health habits survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answers to a program survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information for follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the database is created a retrospective chart review will be done to collect data on&#xD;
      patients that have completed the program. This information will be obtained from facility&#xD;
      records and program records. Individuals who previously completed the program will be&#xD;
      contacted and asked to provide consent to be included in the database. Only data from&#xD;
      individuals who provide consent will be included in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the program will be asked to provide consent when they enroll in the program&#xD;
      or when they come for a follow up visit. Only data from individuals who provide consent will&#xD;
      be included in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed to collect information on lifestyle maintenance and long term&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be queried regularly to provide information about the participants and&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated to describe the study population pre and post&#xD;
      program. Outcomes will be analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Exploratory analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted to detect trends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in a secure location with limited access. All paper documents will be&#xD;
      stored in a locked office in a locked cabinet. Electronic data will be stored on a limited&#xD;
      access computer. The database will be password protected and encrypted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assigned a study ID number. The study ID will be used for&#xD;
      transmission of data. Data collection forms will use the assigned study ID. All data that&#xD;
      needs to be transmitted will be de-identified to the extent possible, password protected, and&#xD;
      encrypted.&#xD;
