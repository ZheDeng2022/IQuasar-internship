    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological consequences of motor vehicle&#xD;
      accidents and burn accidents in 7-18 years old children and adolescents. The impact of&#xD;
      posttraumatic cognitions on developing psychological symptoms are of particular interest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions play an important role in the aftermath&#xD;
      of a traumatic event. Children and adolescents, who think that the experienced trauma has a&#xD;
      permanent and disturbing impact on their actual life and their future, feel threatened. Study&#xD;
      results show that dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions correlate highly with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety. In addition, children and adolescents with a&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have significantly more dysfunctional trauma-related&#xD;
      cognitions than those without PTSD. Especially for children and adolescents it is important&#xD;
      to consider interacting developmental and environmental factors. A developmental approach,&#xD;
      nevertheless, has not been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aims of the proposed study are to achieve a better understanding of dysfunctional&#xD;
      trauma-related cognitions considering child and environmental factors in a cross-sectional&#xD;
      and a longitudinal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The sample consists of two different subsamples: 1) A hospital sample consisting of&#xD;
      children and adolescents (school age: 7-18 years), who experienced an accidental trauma&#xD;
      (either acute traffic accident or burn injury) assessed at three times: in the acute phase&#xD;
      (7-14 days), 3 months, and 6 months after the trauma occurred. 2) An already existing&#xD;
      clinical sample of 159 children and adolescents (TreatChildTrauma study), who mostly&#xD;
      experienced an interpersonal trauma such as sexual or physical abuse. The total sample will&#xD;
      be used to investigate the impact of child and environmental factors including trauma type,&#xD;
      trauma frequency, age, gender, risk status pre trauma (psychopathological status pre trauma&#xD;
      and traumatic events pre trauma), psychopathological status post trauma, and parental&#xD;
      trauma-related cognitions. In addition, the hospital sample will be used for assessing the&#xD;
      naturalistic time course of dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions as well as the&#xD;
      association between cognitions, PTSS, depression, and anxiety over time. Moreover, the&#xD;
      association between parental dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions and altered parenting as&#xD;
      well as their impact on the child's cognitions will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions have an important impact on coping with a&#xD;
      traumatic event in childhood and adolescence. Nevertheless, no study has investigated the&#xD;
      interaction between several child and environmental factors so far. A gain of knowledge in&#xD;
      this area is important to improve treatments of trauma-related disorders.&#xD;

    <description>The CPTCI is a 25-item self-report measure assessing dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions in children ages 6-18 years. The questionnaire showing good psychometric properties yields scores for two subscales &quot;Permanent and disturbing change&quot; and &quot;Fragile person in a scary world&quot; as well as a total score.</description>
