  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Emergency Department (ED), patients frequently seek medical treatment for cutaneous&#xD;
      abscesses. Traditional incision and drainage (I&amp;D), with or without packing of cutaneous&#xD;
      abscesses has long been the accepted standard of care. This procedure is often very painful&#xD;
      for the patient. Additionally, compliance with wound care and follow-up can present barriers&#xD;
      to proper care and healing. Research has suggested that incision and loop drainage of an&#xD;
      abscess may be another effective treatment for simple cutaneous abscess. Thus far, research&#xD;
      into this procedure has been limited to the pediatric population with small sample sizes. In&#xD;
      these previous studies, this technique was found to be an effective and less painful&#xD;
      treatment for abscesses. Research has not been done in the adult population using this&#xD;
      procedure. If this procedure is found to be as effective and less painful in the adult&#xD;
      population, then it should be considered as a potential preferred I&amp;D method for cutaneous&#xD;
      abscess in the ED.&#xD;

      Patients who meet study criteria for treatment of a simple cutaneous abscess and desire to be&#xD;
      a part of this study, will be consented. Study subjects will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the study or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group- standard I &amp; D method for cutaneous abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group- Loop Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gather all of your material and bring to bedside&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clean area with chlorhexidine or iodine swabs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anesthetize area&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use your scalpel to make small 5mm incision at most fluctuant area of abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore cavity with your hemostat and break down loculations&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Make second incision less than 4cm away from first incision. Feel borders of abscess,&#xD;
           and try to make second incision as far within cavity as you can.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. For larger abscesses can repeat step 5 thus creating several LOOPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Irrigate cavity with saline flush&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pass hemostat through both incisions and pull loop vessel, penrose, or bottom of glove&#xD;
           through. Keep your loop device equal in length on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Tie loop device loosely over 30cc syringe to form LOOP. Usually 5-6 knots. This helps&#xD;
           prevent loop from falling out prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Slide syringe out, and trim free ends of loop. Make sure loop is mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Cover site with dry dressing. Follow-Up-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wound check in 1-2 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient may manage drain at home by rotating it to facilitate drainage and prevent&#xD;
                adhesion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient will be instructed to return to the Emergency Department for drain removal&#xD;
                in 5-7 days.&#xD;
