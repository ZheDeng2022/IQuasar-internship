  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether Meditative Movement (based on a standardized and&#xD;
      tested Qigong/Tai Chi Easy protocol) is more efficacious for improving fatigue and other&#xD;
      symptoms in women after treatment for breast cancer than (a) a non-meditative &quot;sham&quot; Qigong&#xD;
      active intervention and (b) an inactive education / support group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer often report fatigue and other associated symptoms that persist&#xD;
      for months, even years, after treatment ends. In a recent pilot study of Qigong/Tai Chi Easy&#xD;
      (QG/TCE, a low-intensity form of Meditative Movement), fatigued breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      experienced greater improvements in fatigue (medium effect size, .56); compared to a &quot;sham&quot;&#xD;
      Qigong control intervention (also low-intensity activity). Trends for improvement compared to&#xD;
      control were found for sleep quality and depression. Recruitment for the single-site&#xD;
      implementation was steady, and feasible. To build upon the promise of this pilot study, and&#xD;
      to further test intervention components that may elucidate what aspects of the intervention&#xD;
      have the most impact, a three-group, randomized trial will be undertaken to test effects of&#xD;
      an 8-week QG/TCE intervention on fatigue and other symptoms at the end of 8 weeks, and 24&#xD;
      weeks post-intervention. 246 (attrition to 210) women who are 6 months to 10 years past&#xD;
      treatment for Stage 0- III breast cancer, aged 45-75, and post-menopausal, will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of three study arms. Two comparison groups will be used, an educational support (ES)&#xD;
      group control and an active sham Qigong (SQG) group with movements that are similar to and&#xD;
      with the same level of physical activity intensity as QG/TCE, but without the focus on the&#xD;
      breath and meditative state. These treatments allow for separation of effects associated with&#xD;
      gentle exercise alone (controlled in SQG) and education/social support alone without any&#xD;
      exercise (controlled in ES) relative to the mind-body practice of QG/TCE, to distinguish&#xD;
      unique effects of the meditative and breath foci. The study will be implemented in two sites&#xD;
      in a large, metropolitan area, including one low-income hospital (and catchment neighborhood)&#xD;
      with larger numbers of Latina survivors where our research team has extensive community&#xD;
      connections and cultural experience implementing exercise and meditative movement programs.&#xD;
      Psychometrics and biomarkers related to symptoms before and after the interventions will be&#xD;
      examined to further our understanding of the mechanisms associated with effects of QG/TCE, as&#xD;
      distinct from ES and SQG.&#xD;
