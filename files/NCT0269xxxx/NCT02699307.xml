  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is the cornerstone of good diabetes management, and yet effective physical&#xD;
      activity intervention is not available. The investigators developed a lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      based on individual's home activity patterns. The goal of the study is to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of this intervention among older adults with diabetes. In addition to physical activity, the&#xD;
      investigators will also assess if the intervention will improve social participation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To tailor to the needs of older adults, the investigators developed an innovative lifestyle&#xD;
      modification intervention that incorporates rehabilitation approaches to improve the&#xD;
      participation of physical activities (PA) among sedentary older adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      The intervention is developed based on well-established health behavior theory (i.e.,&#xD;
      self-regulation) and the conceptual framework from the World Health Organization, with&#xD;
      several innovations not previously investigated in this population. The intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. is tailored based on individual's unique patterns of daily PA performed within his/her&#xD;
           environment as opposed to the total amount of PA performed in a day or a recall of&#xD;
           activities over some time period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. uses an accelerometer-assisted, field-based method to address the individual's unique&#xD;
           physical and social environment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. is delivered by a trained occupational therapist in brief counseling sessions, which can&#xD;
           be easily translated into real clinical settings; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. addresses participation, a patient-centered outcome that is associated with quality of&#xD;
           life but has received limited attention outside of rehabilitation research.&#xD;
