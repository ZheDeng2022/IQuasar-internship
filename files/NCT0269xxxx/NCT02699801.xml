    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of elderly patients are undergoing cardiac surgery. Elderly patients may&#xD;
      have prolonged recovery following cardiac surgery when compared to other groups of patients,&#xD;
      and are at higher risk of postoperative delirium, postoperative neurocognitive decline and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life following hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of sedation and analgesia for patients following cardiac surgery are multifold and&#xD;
      include postoperative pain relief, the facilitation of ventilation, resolution of hypothermia&#xD;
      and normalization of electrolyte balances. The choice of sedative agent however can impact&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes. Dexmedetomidine has been associated with improved quality of recovery&#xD;
      in patients undergoing major spine surgery and with a reduced incidence of delirium, both of&#xD;
      which can impact a patient's quality of life following surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent immediately following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in elderly patients would result in improved quality of recovery and a&#xD;
      reduced incidence of delirium in the postoperative period, when compared to propofol. The&#xD;
      investigators were also interested as to whether there was an associated improvement in&#xD;
      neurocognitive outcomes in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent in ICU in elderly patients following&#xD;
           cardiac surgery result in improved Quality of Recovery scores when compared with&#xD;
           propofol?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent in ICU in elderly patients following&#xD;
           CABG+/- AVR result in a reduced incidence of postoperative delirium as compared to&#xD;
           propofol?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do these patients subsequently have a reduction in cognitive decline?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to advances in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, increasing numbers of elderly&#xD;
      patients are undergoing cardiac surgery. Elderly patients with multiple comorbidities&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery may have prolonged recovery following cardiac surgery when&#xD;
      compared to other groups of patients, and are at higher risk of postoperative delirium,&#xD;
      postoperative neurocognitive decline and reduced quality of life following hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, outcomes following cardiac surgery were measured in terms of complication&#xD;
      rates or mortality rates1. More recently however, quality of life (QoL) measures are&#xD;
      increasingly being recognized as important outcome measurements following cardiac surgery2.&#xD;
      Factors related to cardiac surgery and perioperative care which could potentially influence&#xD;
      later QoL include quality of recovery following surgery, postoperative delirium, and&#xD;
      postoperative neurocognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of recovery (QoR) is a newer concept, which aims to measure a patient's health status&#xD;
      after surgery and anaesthesia. The use of dexmedetomidine during spinal surgery has been&#xD;
      associated with improved quality of recovery in the early postoperative period3. There are&#xD;
      suggestions that dexmedetomidine attenuates the increase in inflammatory mediators during a&#xD;
      stress response4 which could have a role in the post-surgical stress response. There are no&#xD;
      studies that have attempted to correlate dexmedetomidine use with quality of recovery&#xD;
      following cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of delirium following cardiac surgery in patients over 60 years has been&#xD;
      reported in the range 30-52% (5, 6). Delirium is a condition characterized by consciousness&#xD;
      disturbances, concentration disorders, memory disturbances and hallucinations. There have&#xD;
      been associations made between the choice of sedative and the prevalence of delirium in ICU&#xD;
      patients. In a multicenter randomized trial predominantly involving medical patients in the&#xD;
      ICU, those assigned to receive dexmedetomidine had a reduced risk of delirium and spent less&#xD;
      time undergoing mechanical ventilation7. It is not known if the choice of sedation agent in&#xD;
      this population impacts on the incidence of delirium following cardiac surgery. Delirium is&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, increased mortality8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive decline refers to a condition in which intellectual abilities and memory seem&#xD;
      impaired when the patient appears to have otherwise recovered from the surgery. It is a&#xD;
      condition distinct from delirium or encephalopathy. Cognitive decline is common, and can be&#xD;
      persist for months and years, following cardiac surgery. The reported incidence of cognitive&#xD;
      decline after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) has been reported as 53% at hospital&#xD;
      discharge, 36% at 6 weeks and 42% at 5 years9. Elderly patient undergoing cardiac surgery are&#xD;
      at increased risk for postoperative cognitive decline10. A strong relationship has been&#xD;
      reported between cognitive decline and reduced quality of life following cardiac surgery11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of sedation and analgesia for patients following cardiac surgery are multifold and&#xD;
      include postoperative pain relief, the facilitation of ventilation, resolution of hypothermia&#xD;
      and normalization of electrolyte balances. The choice of sedative agent however can impact&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes. Dexmedetomidine has been associated with improved quality of recovery&#xD;
      in patients undergoing major spine surgery and with a reduced incidence of delirium, both of&#xD;
      which can impact a patient's quality of life following surgery. We hypothesized that the use&#xD;
      of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent immediately following cardiac surgery in elderly&#xD;
      patients would result in improved quality of recovery and a reduced incidence of delirium in&#xD;
      the postoperative period, when compared to propofol. We were also interested as to whether&#xD;
      there was an associated improvement in neurocognitive outcomes in this population.&#xD;
