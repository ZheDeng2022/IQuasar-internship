      The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a family-based psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      program for teens with ADHD (Supporting Teens' Academic Needs Daily; STAND) developed to be&#xD;
      delivered in community settings. STAND is BT enhanced by Motivational Interviewing (MI) that&#xD;
      was developed (R34 MH092466) for teens with ADHD through a stakeholder informed process.&#xD;
      STAND consists of ten 50-minute sessions delivered by therapists with community-typical&#xD;
      levels of training and supervision. Across randomized controlled pilot (N=28; N=36) and&#xD;
      efficacy trials (N=128), STAND demonstrates medium to large effects on ADHD and ODD symptoms&#xD;
      and indices of academic and family impairment. In the proposed study, 300 adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD who present for treatment at one of four community mental health agencies in Miami-Dade&#xD;
      County, FL will be randomly assigned to STAND or agency usual care (UC). Participating agency&#xD;
      therapists also will be randomly assigned to deliver STAND or UC. STAND therapists will&#xD;
      receive a comprehensive treatment manual, three-day training, and weekly supervision from a&#xD;
      project psychologist. Participants will be screened by research staff in the community&#xD;
      setting and enrolled on a rolling basis over 30 months. Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. In line with RDoC, multi-method measures&#xD;
      will be obtained for treatment outcome (family and academic impairment), treatment mediators&#xD;
      (executive functioning, parent academic involvement, parent-teen communication,&#xD;
      parent/adolescent motivation, ADHD symptoms), and moderators of effectiveness (patient,&#xD;
      practitioner, service delivery, and organization characteristics). Additional consumer&#xD;
      perspective (satisfaction, therapeutic alliance) and agency fit (therapist competence,&#xD;
      treatment fidelity, need for additional treatment, attendance, therapist attitude toward&#xD;
      treatment, cost effectiveness) measures will also be obtained to evaluate effectiveness. We&#xD;
      will recruit an ethnically diverse sample (65% Hispanic, 19% African-American, 16%&#xD;
      Non-Hispanic White) that is historically underrepresented in research, but ideal for&#xD;
      evaluating therapy effectiveness.&#xD;
