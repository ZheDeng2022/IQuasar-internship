  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effect of different dietary potassium sources on uptake&#xD;
      and retention of potassium, as well as to determine the effect of potassium intake on blood&#xD;
      pressure and acid-base balance. The study will compare three different sources of potassium&#xD;
      given as a supplement, potatoes or French fries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Potassium is a shortfall nutrient according to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
      Only 3% of Americans meet the recommended Adequate Intake of 4700 mg/d for potassium. Average&#xD;
      potassium intake is approximately half of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), with&#xD;
      potatoes providing the highest percentage (19-20% of potassium) in the American diet.&#xD;
      Recommended dietary potassium intakes were determined primarily to optimize protection&#xD;
      against hypertension and secondarily to protect against stroke and coronary heart disease. In&#xD;
      setting requirements for most minerals, bioavailability is usually considered. However,&#xD;
      little is known about bioavailability of potassium and what is known is from supplements&#xD;
      rather than food. Recently, we performed a potassium bioavailability study on white potatoes&#xD;
      looking at 35 healthy, normotensive men and women at 3 levels of potassium intake as potatoes&#xD;
      or potassium gluconate supplements. Bioavailability of potassium was determined from AUC of&#xD;
      serial blood draws and cumulative urinary excretion. Serum potassium Area Under the Curve&#xD;
      (AUC )increased with dose (P&lt;0.0001) and did not differ due to source (p=0.52). Cumulative 24&#xD;
      h urinary potassium also increased with dose (p&lt;0.0001) and was greater with potato than&#xD;
      supplement (p&lt;0.0001), concluding that bioavailability of potassium is as high from potatoes&#xD;
      as from supplements. These data allow us to evaluate the quality of the food as a source of&#xD;
      potassium. However, a remaining question is whether retention of potassium from potatoes is&#xD;
      higher than from the salt, which requires a metabolic balance study to determine. The effects&#xD;
      of potassium rich foods on blood pressure have also been recently accessed. A controlled&#xD;
      feeding study would properly capture potassium retention and balance, as well as adequately&#xD;
      control for any positive benefit potassium may have on blood pressure and other vascular&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing potassium citrate decreased titratable acidity and improved calcium retention in a&#xD;
      dose response manner in postmenopausal women. There is one Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      of potassium on bone, in postmenopausal women, showing a benefit of a supplement of potassium&#xD;
      chloride on protecting against bone loss. Similar studies have not been performed with food&#xD;
      sources of potassium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of added potassium (K) from potatoes in the&#xD;
      diet on K retention , blood pressure, and parameters related to bone health including calcium&#xD;
      retention and acid base balance.&#xD;

Measurements will be repeated at least three times within a 20 minute period after the subject has rested for at least 10 minutes in a seated position. The staff member will place a tonometer (pressure sensor) on the wrist to detect the radial pulse waveform. Measurements will be taken over the course of 5-15 minutes or until pulse wave signal reaches data acquisition parameters.</description>

    <description>Acid-base balance will be determined on two-end of phase 24 h urine collection to relate to urinary calcium and potassium excretion. Pre-prandial arterialized blood samples will be collected anaerobically using forearm venous blood from the heated hand (10) into a polypropylene syringe containing lyophilized lithium heparin. The blood samples will be stored at room temperature and analyzed within 1 h of collection. Renal acid-base balance will be measured using urinary Net Acid Excretion (NAE) and Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL).</description>
