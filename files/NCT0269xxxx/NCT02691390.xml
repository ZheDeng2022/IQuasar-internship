      dTMS intervention to reduce recurrent alcohol abuse among alcohol users who are abstinent for&#xD;
      at least 5 days.&#xD;

      Phase 1: (up to 2 weeks), participants undergo a set of baseline assessments, including&#xD;
      questionnaires, rating scales, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (rsfMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2, patients receive one of two treatments: High-frequency (10Hz, 100 trains of 3 sec&#xD;
      with 15 sec inter train interval) dTMS targeting the ACC or sham stimulation for 30 min. Each&#xD;
      treatment is preceded by provocation (pouring, holding and smelling the subject's favorite&#xD;
      alcoholic beverage) designed to activate the relevant brain circuitry (provocation of&#xD;
      symptoms may increase response rate to Deep TMS as was evident in the treatment of PTSD,&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and OCD). dTMS sessions are conducted five times per week for 3 weeks, for&#xD;
      a total of 15 sessions. A second scan that include rsfMRI and a risk-related decision-making&#xD;
      task is conducted at the end of this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 includes 12 weeks of patients' follow-up, including clinical visits at weeks 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      8 and 12 post treatment. During this phase, subjective and objective measures of alcohol use&#xD;
      (self-report and analysis of urine samples for levels of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl&#xD;
      sulfate (EtS), respectively) are collected. Following completion of the main part by the&#xD;
      individual, an &quot;open label&quot; treatment using the same parameters of the experiment is offer&#xD;
      (regardless of treatment group).&#xD;

    <description>The scores of the Penn alcohol craving scale (PACS) between the active and sham groups over the follow up period. The PACS is a 5-item questionnaire that measures the individual's alcohol craving in the past week, with each item scored on a scale between 0 and 6 (i.e., minimum value of 0 and maximum value of 30) and higher scores denote higher levels of craving.</description>
