  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apremilast in&#xD;
      subjects with moderate Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label 28-week trial. All Subjects will receive Apremilast with the&#xD;
      initial titrating dose as per package insert (10mg per day on day #1, escalating to 30mg&#xD;
      twice daily at day #6 and continuation at this dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proportion of subjects achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at&#xD;
      week 16, defined as a 30% reduction in the total number of abscess and inflammatory nodule&#xD;
      count with a 50% reduction as an exploratory endpoint..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of patients achieving a one point reduction in the Physician's Global&#xD;
           Assessment (PGA) score at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in Modified Sartorius scale from Baseline to Week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The number of patients achieving a two point reduction (required from baseline score) in&#xD;
           the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over 24 weeks on active therapy followed by a four week&#xD;
      observational visit. The total length of the study will be 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and then a&#xD;
      observational follow up 4 weeks afterwards. Additionally, all subjects will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone 1 week following the Baseline visit to ensure daily pain assessments are being&#xD;
      recorded. If any signs or symptoms are reported at the time of the call, an unscheduled study&#xD;
      visit will be conducted to assess whether an infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;
