      To test the efficacy of FACE-TC on key outcomes, the investigators propose using an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat, longitudinal, prospective, multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design. Adolescents with cancer, aged 14 up to 20 years, and their families (N=130 dyads;&#xD;
      N=260 participants) will be recruited and randomized to FACE-TC or Treatment as Usual (TAU)&#xD;
      control. Participants will complete standardized questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and&#xD;
      18 months post-intervention. Our goal is to assess the extent to which FACE-TC helps&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with cancer and their families: (1) reach and maintain better&#xD;
      congruence in treatment preferences over time; (2) improve their quality of life; and (3)&#xD;
      document goals of care and advance directives earlier in the course of their potentially life&#xD;
      limiting illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective, longitudinal, 2-arm RCT to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      FACE-TC on key measurable outcomes through 18 months post-intervention. Dyads composed of&#xD;
      adolescents with cancer and their families (N=130 dyads; 260 subjects) will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized to either the FACE-TC intervention or Treatment as Usual (TAU) Control group at a&#xD;
      ratio of 2:1 [N=87 FACE-TC dyads and N=43 TAU Control dyads]. The investigators estimate 30%&#xD;
      attrition by the 18 month post-intervention assessment (20%-25% due to death/complications&#xD;
      and 10% due to dropout). Of the original sample of 130 randomized dyads (N=260 subjects), the&#xD;
      investigators estimate the investigators will have full longitudinal data at 18 months&#xD;
      post-intervention for 91 dyads (N=182 subjects). Participants will be recruited from Akron&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and University of Minnesota&#xD;
      Masonic Children's Hospital pediatric oncology programs. Participants will undergo written&#xD;
      informed consent/assent. Eligible participants will be enrolled and complete the baseline&#xD;
      assessment followed by randomization. Randomization will be at the level of the dyad.&#xD;
      Allocation will be concealed from the RA-Assessor to prevent bias. Block randomization by&#xD;
      study site will control for site differences. Intervention and Control Conditions: The&#xD;
      curriculum based FACE-TC consists of: The Session 1 ACP Survey; Session 2 Respecting Choices&#xD;
      Interview; and the Session 3 Five Wishes advance directive. To minimize the burden to ill&#xD;
      adolescents, the investigators have chosen a Treatment as Usual comparison condition. This&#xD;
      group will be provided with an advance care planning booklet/information only. Assessments&#xD;
      occur at baseline, and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. At each site the&#xD;
      assessments and intervention will be administered by a research team comprised of the site&#xD;
      Co-Investigator and two Research Assistants (RA) (RA-Assessor &amp; RA-Interventionist).Visit&#xD;
      protocol: Screening Visit: The RA-Assessor presents the adolescent with cancer and family&#xD;
      with an Information Sheet describing the study and conduct an initial assessment about&#xD;
      whether they are eligible for enrollment. After consent/assent, further screening for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria is conducted. Baseline Visit: At enrollment and prior to&#xD;
      randomization, baseline measures will be obtained. Entry of baseline data by the RA-Assessor&#xD;
      will trigger computerized randomization of patient/family dyads to either FACE-TC&#xD;
      intervention or TAU Control using a randomly permuted block design and a 2:1 ratio by study&#xD;
      site. The Children's National clinical coordinator will then notify the RA-Interventionist&#xD;
      who will schedule the next study visit. The adolescent and family will learn their assignment&#xD;
      when the RA-Interventionist calls to schedule study sessions. Attendance will be recorded to&#xD;
      assess effects of full vs. partial participation in FACE-TC. Follow-up Visits: RA-Assessor&#xD;
      will obtain follow-up measures from the adolescent and family at 3, 6, 12 and 18 month post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site Co-Is will oversee site activities and provide weekly, face-to-face supervision of the&#xD;
      RAs. They are responsible for recruitment, retention, safety, fidelity to protocol, and&#xD;
      supervision and support of RAs. The RAs will assist with recruitment, screening, enrollment&#xD;
      and baseline screening measure collection, as well as the day-to-day functioning. RAs will be&#xD;
      blind to random assignment. RA-Interventionists will be trained to implement the protocol.&#xD;
      Only the RA-Assessor will be permitted to administer post-randomization assessments.&#xD;
      Children's National will serve as the data coordinating center and will be responsible for&#xD;
      database design and maintenance and the statistical analyses. Sites will be overseen by a&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). A 2-day Investigator Meeting will be held in Washington,&#xD;
      District of Columbia (DC) and will include all site Co-Is, RA-Assessors and consultants. The&#xD;
      protocol, its scientific rationale, underlying ethics issues, implementation including&#xD;
      recruitment and retention, will be reviewed with the entire team. In month 9 of Year 1 there&#xD;
      will be a 3-day training meeting of the RA-Interventionists and RA-Assessors on the&#xD;
      intervention, which site-Co-Is will also attend. RA-Assessors will attend only one day of&#xD;
      this training in order to maintain blindness. Site Initiation. To begin screening/enrollment&#xD;
      (1) the protocol must be approved at each site's Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all&#xD;
      personnel must be certified in Human Subjects Research training, (2) personnel are recruited&#xD;
      and trained for RA roles, and (3) each RA-Interventionist must complete certification as a&#xD;
      Next Steps-ACP Facilitator. Dr. Lyon and the Research Coordinator will verify that the site&#xD;
      has all components in place for the logistics of screening, enrolling, scheduling, performing&#xD;
      assessments, administering interventions, and collecting the data. To assure continuous&#xD;
      quality for the intervention and its evaluation, monitoring will be ongoing. Dr. Lyon and Ms.&#xD;
      Briggs will review the first 5 DVD/audio recordings of intervention sessions from each site&#xD;
      to ensure fidelity with the protocol. Thereafter, they will randomly review 1 DVD per week,&#xD;
      rotating sites. Dr. Lyon and Ms. Briggs will use a competency checklist. Dr. Lyon and&#xD;
      Research Coordinator will monitor ongoing site IRB approval documentation and assist sites in&#xD;
      annual continuing reviews. The Research Coordinator will keep copies of all regulatory forms,&#xD;
      including consent-stamped templates from each site and staff members' Human Subjects Research&#xD;
      Training approval certificates. Dr. Lyon and the Research Coordinator will perform twice&#xD;
      yearly site monitoring visits while the intervention is being implemented to assure&#xD;
      standardization of procedures and resolve any problems that are identified. They will review&#xD;
      and confirm that all consents have occurred properly at the sites and that the sites are&#xD;
      maintaining all participant and regulatory data. The REDCap database from the FACE-TC pilot&#xD;
      will be updated and expanded for this study, and the systems for data entry will be revised&#xD;
      to address multi-site implementation. A data dictionary will be created. An external Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be assembled by Dr. Lyon with the responsibility of reviewing&#xD;
      safety information, study progress, and other relevant data. The SMC will meet a minimum of&#xD;
      once a year. Prior to parametric testing, scale reliabilities for multi-item measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      pain/fatigue, child and parent psychological, spiritual/religious measures) will be assessed&#xD;
      using Cronbach's alpha and their composite scores will be used for data analyses. Analytical&#xD;
      Plan for AIM 1. To evaluate the efficacy of FACE-TC on adolescent-family congruence in&#xD;
      treatment preferences. Congruence in decision-making for medical treatment will be tested&#xD;
      based on agreement (i.e., both patient and his/her family choose the same option) on the&#xD;
      Statement of Treatment Preferences in four different cancer-related situations. Kappa&#xD;
      coefficients will be applied to assess chance-adjusted agreement between patient and family&#xD;
      responses. Change in Kappa coefficient (congruence improvement) from baseline to each&#xD;
      follow-up time point during the study period will be tested using bootstrapping technique.&#xD;
      The latent growth model (LGM) with categorical outcome will be used to test Hypotheses H1a,&#xD;
      i.e., FACE-TC participants will have a higher congruence rate over time. In the LGM, the&#xD;
      investigators will set time scores, except those for identification purpose, as free&#xD;
      parameters to let the shape of growth trajectory be determined by data. As such, the&#xD;
      congruence development trajectory would have an empirically based nonlinear shape, instead of&#xD;
      assuming a linear or nonlinear polynomial function. The investigators will apply the growth&#xD;
      mixture model (GMM) to test heterogeneity of congruence development trajectories and identify&#xD;
      possible patterns of congruence in development trajectories in the full sample. The latent&#xD;
      class variable estimated from the GMM captures the pattern of congruence development&#xD;
      trajectories. Time-invariant covariates will be used to predict the memberships of the latent&#xD;
      trajectory groups; and time-varying covariates will be included to predict the level of&#xD;
      congruence at different time points. To test Hypotheses H1b, the investigators will regress&#xD;
      the latent growth slope factor and the latent class variable on FACE-TC intervention,&#xD;
      controlling for covariates in the GMM to assess 1) how FACE-TC would affect the membership of&#xD;
      the latent classes of congruence development; and 2) how the effect of FACE-TC on congruence&#xD;
      change over time varies across the latent trajectory classes. Analytical Plan for AIM 2. To&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy of FACE-TC on AYA quality of life and family QOL. The LGM and GMM models&#xD;
      proposed for evaluating Aim 1 can be readily applied to evaluate Aim 2 and test Hypotheses H2&#xD;
      where the outcome measures are continuous variables. When examining the effects of FACE-TC on&#xD;
      QOL for AYAs with cancer and their families, socio-demographics will be controlled as&#xD;
      time-invariant covariates, while time-varying covariates will be included in the model to&#xD;
      predict measures of QOL at different time points. In addition, family caregiver&#xD;
      appraisal/depression measured at the end of the study period will be included as a distal&#xD;
      outcome in the GMM models, and how this distal outcome is associated with the patterns of the&#xD;
      developmental trajectories of AYA QOL will be assessed. As the same model will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate multiple outcomes, Bonferroni correction will be applied to exert a stringent&#xD;
      control over false discovery. As attrition is inevitable in longitudinal studies, robust&#xD;
      model estimator (e.g., MLR) using the full information maximum likelihood will be used for&#xD;
      model estimation. Importantly, missing at random (MAR), instead of missing completely at&#xD;
      random, can be assumed in MLR. MAR is a plausible assumption that allows missingness to be&#xD;
      dependent on observed measures like intervention assignment. Analytical Plan for AIM 3. To&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of FACE-TC on early completion of pACP goals of care and advance&#xD;
      directives. First, the investigators will use the two-proportion z-test to test the&#xD;
      differences in proportions of completion of pACP goals of care and advance directives between&#xD;
      FACE-TC and control groups. Then logistic regressions will be used to test the Hypothesis H3,&#xD;
      controlling for socio-demographics. Interaction between intervention and ethnicity will be&#xD;
      included in the models to test ethnic disparity in regard to intervention efficacy. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore if FACE-TC improves the match between patients' goals of care&#xD;
      and the medical care received at the EOL among the adolescents who may die. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to estimate the frequencies of the study variables. Chi-square&#xD;
      statistics with Fisher Exact tests will be used to assess the difference in the match between&#xD;
      FACE-TC and controls; and exact logistic regression will be applied to examine the effect of&#xD;
      FACE-TC on such a match, controlling for covariates. For continuous outcomes with a modest&#xD;
      observation autocorrelation (p=0.20) and moderate effect size (delta=0.35), the estimated&#xD;
      sample size to achieve a power of 0.80 at =0.05 level and detect a moderate effect size&#xD;
      (delta=0.35) is about N=76 individuals at each of the 5 observation time points. For binary&#xD;
      outcomes, a sample size of N=70 can achieve a power of 0.80 to detect a moderate response&#xD;
      probability difference of d=0.17 given p=0.20. Our proposed sample of N=130 dyads will ensure&#xD;
      a large enough statistical power for our proposed longitudinal analyses on patient data and&#xD;
      parent data, respectively. For the cross-sectional logistic regression model proposed to&#xD;
      evaluate Aim 3, a sample size of N=100 would achieve a power of 0.83 at alpha=0.05 level to&#xD;
      detect an odds ratio of 4.&#xD;
