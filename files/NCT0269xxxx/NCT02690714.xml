  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, open-label, repeat-dose study of the PK, efficacy, and safety of the&#xD;
      IMP, in pediatric and adult subjects with hypoplasminogenemia. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening period and 3 treatment segments (Segment 1,2, and 3). Subjects who have documented&#xD;
      individual PK profiles do not need to undergo Segment 1 and can proceed directly to Segment&#xD;
      2. Subjects in Segment 1 will receive a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg IMP infusion. Blood samples&#xD;
      for PK analysis will be drawn prior to infusion and subsequently through 96 hours after the&#xD;
      infusion to establish individual PK profiles. The sample drawn prior to infusion will be used&#xD;
      to measure the subject's baseline anti-plasminogen antibody, plasminogen activity and antigen&#xD;
      as well as D-dimer levels. The resulting PK profile will be used to determine each subject's&#xD;
      dosing interval in Segment 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on individual PK profiles from Segment 1 subjects will receive 6.6 mg/kg IMP infusion&#xD;
      every second, third, or fourth day for 12 weeks in Segment 2. For subjects who directly enter&#xD;
      Segment 2, baseline assessments will be conducted before the first dose of IMP, including a&#xD;
      blood sample to measure the baseline anti-plasminogen antibody, plasminogen activity and&#xD;
      antigen as well as D-dimer levels. Subjects will visit the study sites on Week 1 and&#xD;
      subsequently every 4 weeks, and receive the IMP infusion at the study site. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained at each study visit at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 and by a home health nurse at Weeks&#xD;
      2, 6 and 10. Subjects will undergo clinical assessments of the disease, including but not&#xD;
      limited to: photographic measurements of visible lesions, spirometry for subjects with&#xD;
      pulmonary involvement, and imaging study of nonvisible lesions, as applicable. Plasma samples&#xD;
      will be drawn before IMP administration every 2 weeks to measure the trough levels of&#xD;
      plasminogen activity and antigen, and D-dimer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Segment 2, subjects will have the option to participate in Segment 3 where they&#xD;
      will continue to receive IMP for an additional 36 weeks in Norway, and until product&#xD;
      licensing or study termination by the sponsor for subjects in the United States. Subjects&#xD;
      will return to the study sites for assessments every 3 months to monitor subjects' clinical&#xD;
      status and plasminogen trough levels. Subjects at the Norway site in Segment 3 should return&#xD;
      to the study site for a safety follow-up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose. Due to the&#xD;
      delay in product approval, subjects at the US site in Segment 3 will be allowed to enroll in&#xD;
      treatment protocol 2002C018G and continue ongoing IMP treatment without any break in&#xD;
      treatment. If subjects decide to not enter treatment protocol 2002C018G, then they will stop&#xD;
      IMP and return to the study site for a safety follow-up visit 30 days after the final IMP&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to achieve an increase of individual trough&#xD;
      plasminogen activity by at least an absolute 10% (i.e., 10 U/dL) from baseline during the 12&#xD;
      weeks of plasminogen replacement therapy in Segment 2; and to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or visible symptoms of&#xD;
      hypoplasminogenemia during the 48 weeks of dosing in Segments 2 and 3.&#xD;

    <description>Overall clinical success was defined as 50% of participants with visible or other measurable lesions achieving at least a 50% improvement in lesion number/size or functionality impact from baseline. Visible lesions were defined as lesions that could be imaged and analyzed with digital photography. Non-visible lesions were defined as lesions whose dimensions could have been assessed by medical imaging studies (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, etc) or functional assessments (eg, spirometry, audiogram, oximetry, etc).Visible lesions that had both a length and width as measured by the 1mm scale, were referred to as &quot;measurable lesions&quot;, and visible lesions that were too small to measure by the 1mm scale (length and/or width could not have been measured) were referred to as &quot;non-measurable lesions&quot;.</description>

    <description>Plasminogen activity is a measurement of functional plasminogen levels and is therefore the most accurate and specific method to quantify active Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous concentration in participants' plasma. Primary endpoint success was defined as at least 80% of evaluable participants (ie, 8 or more) achieving the target trough levels for at least 3 measurements in 12 weeks. The target trough level was defined as an increase in plasminogen activity level of at least an absolute 10% (10 U/dL) from the participant's individual baseline level.</description>

          <description>Plasminogen activity is a measurement of functional plasminogen levels. Plasminogen activity levels were measured with an automated chromogenic assay. Assay calibration curve was performed with a pool of normal human plasma with the assigned value of 100% plasminogen and plasminogen activity levels were reported in %. The normal reference range of plasminogen activity in healthy subjects was determined to be 70%-130% and the limit of quantification was set at 5%</description>

Visible lesions were defined as lesions that could be imaged and analyzed with digital photography. Non-visible lesions were defined as lesions whose dimensions could have been assessed by medical imaging studies (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, etc) or functional assessments (eg, spirometry, audiogram, oximetry, etc).Visible lesions that had both a length and width as measured by the 1mm scale, were referred to as &quot;measurable lesions&quot;, and visible lesions that were too small to measure by the 1mm scale (length and/or width could not have been measured) were referred to as &quot;non-measurable lesions&quot;.</description>

Primary endpoint success was defined as at least 80% of evaluable participants (ie, 8 or more) achieving the target trough levels for at least 3 measurements in 12 weeks. The target trough level was defined as an increase in plasminogen activity level of at least an absolute 10% (10 U/dL) from the participant's individual baseline level.</description>

          <title>Overall Clinical Success in Number and Size of Lesions as Measured by Photographic or Other Imaging Modality Depending on the Organ System Affected or Change in Affected Organ Functionality at 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>Overall clinical success was defined as 50% of participants with visible or other measurable lesions achieving at least a 50% improvement in lesion number/size or functionality impact from baseline. Visible lesions were defined as lesions that could be imaged and analyzed with digital photography. Non-visible lesions were defined as lesions whose dimensions could have been assessed by medical imaging studies (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, etc) or functional assessments (eg, spirometry, audiogram, oximetry, etc).Visible lesions that had both a length and width as measured by the 1mm scale, were referred to as &quot;measurable lesions&quot;, and visible lesions that were too small to measure by the 1mm scale (length and/or width could not have been measured) were referred to as &quot;non-measurable lesions&quot;.</description>
          <population>Efficacy population week 12 included all 15 enrolled participants who completed the week 12 visit. All 15 participants were assessed, however only 11 participants had visible and/or non-visible lesions at baseline.</population>
