      Phase II, open-label, multicentre national study. Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinomas of extrapulmonary origin will be eligible. Treatment will be performed as&#xD;
      indicated in the section &quot;Investigational drug and reference therapy&quot;. Cisplatinum and&#xD;
      everolimus dosing is based upon earlier phase 1 studies (Fury et al. 2012). CTs will be done&#xD;
      at 9 weekly intervals (after 3 courses of chemotherapy;). Patients will be treated until&#xD;
      documented progression according to RECIST 1.1. Enrolment is expected to take between 14 - 16&#xD;
      months. The total study duration is estimated to be 2 to 3 years until publication. Three NET&#xD;
      centres in The Netherlands will participate, (Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam,&#xD;
      Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam and , the University Medical Center of Groningen) A&#xD;
      pre-treatment (and optional post-treatment) tumour biopsy will be included for DNA/RNA&#xD;
      analyses and organoid culture. An additional 5cc of blood will be withdrawn as a germline DNA&#xD;
      reference. A second 5 cc of blood will be included for measuring circulating tumour&#xD;
      transcripts to identify all types of GEP-NET (NETTest).&#xD;
