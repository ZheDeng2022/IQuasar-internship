      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the accuracy and safety of&#xD;
      non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements using the HeadSense-1000 (HS-1000)&#xD;
      device compared to the current invasive external ventricular device (EVD) or parenchymal&#xD;
      (bolt) monitoring devices in the pediatric population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HS-1000 is an innovative non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring device that&#xD;
      employs advanced acoustic signal analysis to derive ICP on a continuous basis. The first&#xD;
      version of the device was clinically validated in trials in Italy, India, and Armenia.&#xD;
      Overall, more than 10,000 ICP measurements were collected from both patients and healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The device is currently undergoing FDA validation in an adult cohort across eight&#xD;
      sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a pilot study conducted at Akron Children's Hospital. A maximum of 40 patients&#xD;
      with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) or neurological conditions requiring ICP monitoring&#xD;
      will be studied over 2 years. All patients treated with either surgical ICP monitor (external&#xD;
      ventricular drain [EVD] or subarachnoid manometer [Bolt]) are eligible for study enrollment.&#xD;
      The HS-1000 device will be deployed as soon as possible after surgical ICP monitor placement&#xD;
      to record and collect data in parallel with the surgical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the accuracy and safety of the HS-1000 device as an alternative to the invasive ICP&#xD;
      procedure, the investigators will compare ICP readings obtained by the HS-1000 monitoring&#xD;
      system to measurements recorded by the surgical device during 15-30 minute recording&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICP readings will be recorded from both the invasive and HeadSense non-invasive ICP monitor&#xD;
      for an aggregate of 30 minutes. During the recording sessions, a webcam will take periodic&#xD;
      snapshots of the ICP monitor and/or bedside monitor picturing the ICP values and other&#xD;
      clinical parameters that are displayed on screen, with a focus on blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate (HR). Recording sessions will be done until an aggregate of at least 30 minutes of data&#xD;
      are collected, depending on the patient's clinical condition. Recording sessions may be&#xD;
      repeated over several days until the 30 minute target is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HeadSense headset is removed between recordings. Recording should be done only in case&#xD;
      the patient's clinical condition allows it (i.e. patient is in supine position and does not&#xD;
      require any clinical intervention or treatment at the time of the recording). In case the&#xD;
      patient requires some clinical intervention the recording will be stopped and will be resumed&#xD;
      only after the intervention is done and the patient's clinical condition allows resuming of&#xD;
      the recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, the investigators will also place a commercial sound meter in the participant's room&#xD;
      to collect baseline data on exposure to ambient noise within the Pediatric Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (PICU) treatment environment. This data will facilitate a device-vs-ambient sound&#xD;
      comparison, a component of the device safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patient demographics will be collected to include patient medical record number, age,&#xD;
      gender, diagnosis, medical information, and the patient's clinical course pertinent to the&#xD;
      ICP monitoring until the attending physician determines invasive ICP measurement is no longer&#xD;
      necessary. Additional demographic, diagnostic parameters, severity of illness calculations,&#xD;
      and procedures will be obtained from the Virtual Pediatric Systems (VPS, LLC) Pediatric&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit clinical outcomes database. The patient will be followed for 48 hours&#xD;
      post ICU discharge for any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of head trauma or other medical conditions indicating a need for ICP&#xD;
      monitoring, the decision to place an intraventricular catheter and the duration of ICP&#xD;
      monitoring are at the discretion of the patient's clinical care team and independent of this&#xD;
      study. With the exception of simultaneous use of the non-invasive acoustical HS-1000&#xD;
      monitoring system and ambient noise level measurements within the patient's room, all other&#xD;
      patient care, including clinical evaluations and treatments, is independent of this study. No&#xD;
      HS-1000 data will be displayed and will not be used in clinical decision making.&#xD;
