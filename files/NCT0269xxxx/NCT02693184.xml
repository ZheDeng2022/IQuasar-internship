      The purpose of this study is to validate a revised food frequency questionnaire that is&#xD;
      designed to capture vitamin D, calcium and protein intake in a population of elderly men and&#xD;
      women with fragility fractures. Protein, calcium and protein intake will be correlated with&#xD;
      biochemical measures and bone mineral density measured by DXA.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to validate a revised food frequency questionnaire that is&#xD;
      designed to capture vitamin D, calcium and protein intake in a population of elderly men and&#xD;
      women with fragility fractures. Protein, calcium and protein intake will be correlated with&#xD;
      biochemical measures and bone mineral density measured by DXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria) Forty-five eligible participants will be recruited from the endocrine&#xD;
      referrals for osteoporosis/fracture. They will be men and women, age &gt;65 years with a&#xD;
      fragility fracture (defined as a fracture sustained after a fall from a standing height or&#xD;
      less). They will be English speaking. They will need to have the mental capacity to recall&#xD;
      events, (MMSE score Â³24).11 They will need to have a telephone and the ability to answer&#xD;
      questions over a phone. They will not have secondary causes of fragility fracture such as&#xD;
      malabsorption (celiac disease, bariatric surgery), liver disease, organ transplant,&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma, current cancer diagnosis, or alcoholism. They will not&#xD;
      have renal disease requiring dialysis (as the dietary requirement of these patients is quite&#xD;
      different from the general elderly population). They will not be on tubefeeds of any kind&#xD;
      (although supplemental food such as Ensure is allowed). Interventions and Evaluations) The&#xD;
      evaluations will include a history and physical exam, and a mini mental status exam. Two&#xD;
      telephone interviews will be conducted ~ 4 weeks apart during which the Block 2014&#xD;
      questionnaire will be given and the revised screener will be given. The order that the&#xD;
      questionnaires are given will be randomized. As part of the standard of care workup for&#xD;
      osteoporosis, a biochemical workup including 25-hydroxyvitamin D, comprehensive metabolic&#xD;
      profile, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (a bone remodeling marker), phosphorus and&#xD;
      transglutaminase IgA (to rule out celiac disease), and DXA scan for bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) measurement will be done. The BMD by DXA and 25-hydroxyvitamin D will be correlated to&#xD;
      protein, calcium and vitamin D intake obtained by the Block 2014.&#xD;
