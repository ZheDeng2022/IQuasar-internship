  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is a potent and highly selective inhaled Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase delta inhibitor&#xD;
      being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      inflammatory airway diseases. The study will be conducted at a single centre and in 3 Parts.&#xD;
      The aim of Part A and B of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) single and repeat doses of a new formulation of GSK2269557 administered&#xD;
      via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) to healthy subjects. This is the first study in&#xD;
      which GSK2269557 will be administered via the ELLIPTA DPI. Part C of the study will&#xD;
      investigate the proportion of the systemic exposure that post inhalation is due to the&#xD;
      swallowed fraction of the inhaled dose. Part C will also be conducted using the ELLIPTA&#xD;
      device and magnesium stearate formulation. Part A will be conducted first. Part B and Part C&#xD;
      may be run sequentially or in parallel. Part A is a randomized, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, single dose, dose escalating incomplete block 2-period crossover study in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either one dose strength of GSK2269557 and&#xD;
      placebo utilizing placebo replacement, or will receive both active dose strengths. Part B is&#xD;
      a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, repeat dose study in healthy Subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either repeat doses of GSK2269557 or placebo for 10&#xD;
      days. Part C is a, randomized, open-label, crossover design to assess the systemic exposure&#xD;
      of single doses of GSK2269557 administered via the ELLIPTA DPI to healthy subjects, with and&#xD;
      without ingestion of activated charcoal. ELLIPTA is the registered trademark of&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline groups of companies.&#xD;
