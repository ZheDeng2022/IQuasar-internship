  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Multimeric-001&quot; (M-001) contains conserved, common linear influenza epitopes that activate&#xD;
      both cellular and humoral arms of the immune system against a wide variety of influenza A and&#xD;
      B strains. Apart from its direct action, M-001 is an attractive candidate for priming immune&#xD;
      responses to pandemic influenza vaccine in the adult population. The current clinical study&#xD;
      was designed to assess M-001's standalone and priming action in subjects aged 18-60 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase IIb study comprising 222 participants. Eligible subjects were randomized to&#xD;
      receive two sequential intramuscular injection of 0.5mg or 1.0mg M-001 (treatment), or two&#xD;
      placebo (saline) injection, before receiving the sub optimal dose of H5N1 pandemic vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind active-controlled Phase 2b study. 222&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 into three groups to receive two sequential non-adjuvanted&#xD;
      0.5 mg or 1.0mg intramuscular injection of M-001 (treatment), or two placebo (saline)&#xD;
      injection, before receiving the Alum adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine at a sub optimal dose of 3mcg.&#xD;
      Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) will be evaluated at baseline and 3 weeks after H5N1 whole&#xD;
      virion inactivated pandemic influenza vaccination as a measure of M-001's ability to enhance&#xD;
      the humoral response. Cell mediated immune (CMI) responses will also be evaluated at baseline&#xD;
      and after immunization with M-001 as a measure of M-001's standalone immunogenicity. The&#xD;
      subjects will monitored for safety throughout the study until day 180.&#xD;
