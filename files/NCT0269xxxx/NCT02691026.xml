  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase II, single arm, open-label, interventional trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in&#xD;
      subjects with metastatic or locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic malignant peripheral&#xD;
      nerve sheath tumour (MPNST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated with pembrolizumab for up to 10 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the percentage of patients with curatively unresectable&#xD;
      MPNST who have achieved clinical response; complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or&#xD;
      stable disease (SD) at 18 weeks as assessed by the Investigator, by using RECIST, v1.1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MPNST, who are not eligible for surgery of curative intent, will be considered&#xD;
      for treatment with pembrolizumab. Patients will receive pembrolizumab treatment for up to 10&#xD;
      cycles. The patients must discontinue study treatment earlier (before 10 cycles of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab) if they experience symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerable toxicity related to pembrolizumab, any medical condition that may&#xD;
      jeopardize the patient's safety, use of other non-protocol anti-cancer therapy or pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received 10 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of&#xD;
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have achieved a clinical meaningful response after 10 cycles of pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by&#xD;
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant&#xD;
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if&#xD;
      progression is detected after cycle 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the low incidence of MPNST, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a Simon's&#xD;
      two-stage design is suggested (see Statistical Analysis Plans - Section 8.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be performed after the first 7 patient&#xD;
      has been treated for 18 weeks: In case of no responders; the trial ends. If one or more&#xD;
      responders, the trial will continue into stage two to a total number of 18 patients will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
