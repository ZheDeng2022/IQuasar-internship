  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microscopic colitis is a common cause of watery diarrhea, particularly in the elderly.&#xD;
      Although the incidence is comparable to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the etiology&#xD;
      is unknown. Understanding the etiology of microscopic colitis is an important step in&#xD;
      developing logical interventions to decrease the burden from microscopic colitis. This&#xD;
      research could provide critical insights into the etiology of this poorly studied condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic condition that is a common cause of watery diarrhea,&#xD;
      particularly in the elderly. The etiology is unknown but widely considered to be an abnormal&#xD;
      immune reaction to luminal antigens in predisposed hosts. Drugs and autoimmunity have also&#xD;
      been implicated. The aims of the study are: 1) To quantitatively classify microscopic colitis&#xD;
      using image analysis microscopy to determine whether the degree of lymphocytic infiltration&#xD;
      correlates with etiology, symptoms and prognosis. 2) To investigate the etiology of&#xD;
      microscopic colitis by examining medical and lifestyle risk factors including medications,&#xD;
      autoimmunity, diet, and smoking 3) To evaluate the association between the adherent microbial&#xD;
      flora and MC to assess whether bacterial dysbiosis is linked to presence of MC. As an&#xD;
      exploratory aim we will evaluate whether CYP2C19 polymorphisms are more common in purportedly&#xD;
      drug-induced disease since the diverse drugs that have been associated with MC are all&#xD;
      substrates for this gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct the study the investigators will obtain detailed dietary, medical and lifestyle&#xD;
      information on study subjects who undergo complete colonoscopy for diarrhea. The&#xD;
      investigators will obtain colon biopsies from the right, transverse and left colon to&#xD;
      evaluate adherent bacterial organisms. The investigators will draw blood to evaluate CYP2C19&#xD;
      polymorphisms and for future genetic studies. The prospective design corrects important&#xD;
      limitations of prior research on MC. Successful completion of the study aims will improve the&#xD;
      understanding of risk factors, set the stage for more scientifically grounded future&#xD;
      research, and potentially suggest new interventions for a disease that is currently poorly&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;

      40 ml of blood centrifuged and separated into plasma, buffy coat and red blood cells. A serum&#xD;
      separator tube will be used to collect an additional 10 ml of blood for serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During colonoscopy, four mucosal biopsies will be obtained from normal appearing mucosa in&#xD;
      the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending/sigmoid colon during the withdrawal&#xD;
      phase of the exam from each patient (12 research biopsies). To improve orientation 2 biopsies&#xD;
      from each segment will be flattened onto filter paper using a forceps and placed together&#xD;
      into fixative. The remaining 2 biopsies from each area will be rinsed in sterile PBS to&#xD;
      ensure there is no contamination with fecal bacteria prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen.&#xD;
