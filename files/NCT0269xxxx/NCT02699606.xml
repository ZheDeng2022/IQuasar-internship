    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) as per&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of erdafitinib in a&#xD;
      molecularly-defined subset of Asian participants with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),&#xD;
      urothelial cancer, esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

             the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than (&lt;) 50% as assessed by&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Received prior selective FGFR inhibitor treatment or RET inhibitor treatment,&#xD;
             respectively according to the biomarker prescreening result, or if the participant has&#xD;
