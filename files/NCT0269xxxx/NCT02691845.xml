    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial in which 240 depressed individuals are&#xD;
      assigned to one of three arms, with each successive arm having an added component that may&#xD;
      serve to increase and maintain physical activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. brief advice (BA) to exercise (control condition);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BA + supervised &amp; home-based exercise (SHE) + health education (HE) contact control; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BA + SHE+ cognitive-behavioral sessions focused on increasing and maintaining exercise&#xD;
           (CBEX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess and optimize the safety, feasibility, acceptability of each&#xD;
      intervention component, as well as barriers limiting their effectiveness in order to prepare&#xD;
      for a larger scale randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial in which 240 depressed individuals are&#xD;
      assigned to one of three arms, with each successive arm having an added component that may&#xD;
      serve to increase and maintain physical activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. brief advice (BA) to exercise (control condition);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BA + supervised &amp; home-based exercise (SHE)+health education (HE) contact control; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BA+SHE+ cognitive-behavioral sessions focused on increasing and maintaining exercise&#xD;
           (CBEX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases for participants: intervention phase (3 months), which consists of&#xD;
      intensive contact, and the follow-up phase (6 months). BA will consist of one, 45-minute&#xD;
      session about public health recommendations, and strategies for getting started. SHE will be&#xD;
      a 12-week intervention consisting of 1x/week supervised exercise plus exercise prescriptions&#xD;
      for home-based exercise with the goal of gradually achieving the public health recommendation&#xD;
      of 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), CBEX and HE sessions&#xD;
      will be individual, 30-minute, weekly sessions during the intervention phase. CBEX will&#xD;
      address barriers to physical activity that are particularly pronounced in depression -i.e.,&#xD;
      anhedonia, decreased motivation, and decreased energy, as well as poor problem-solving&#xD;
      skills. During the follow-up phase, groups who received SHE during the intervention phase&#xD;
      will receive brief, monthly phone check-ins from an exercise specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficacy of the 3 arms for increasing physical activity during the&#xD;
           12-week intervention phase. We hypothesize that BA + SHE + CBEX will be superior to BA +&#xD;
           SHE + HE, and that BA + SHE + HE will be superior to BA alone in terms of objectively&#xD;
           measured MVPA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the longer-term impact of the three arms on objectively-measured minutes of&#xD;
           MVPA at 6- and 9-month follow-ups (i.e., follow-up phase). Hypotheses are the same as&#xD;
           for the intervention phase (aim #1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the impact of proposed intervention combinations on depression, physical&#xD;
           health outcomes including cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition, and&#xD;
           self-reported MVPA in all phases. Hypotheses mirror those described in our primary aims&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether amount of MVPA mediates the association between group assignment&#xD;
           and change in depressive symptoms. We hypothesize that amount of MVPA will serve as a&#xD;
           mediator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine behavior change theory-based mediators of the association between group&#xD;
           assignment and MVPA. Hypothesized mediators include: perceived benefits of exercise,&#xD;
           perceived barriers to exercise, exercise self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation to&#xD;
           exercise, and identified motivation to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To examine whether social and environmental barriers to exercise predict exercise&#xD;
           maintenance.&#xD;
