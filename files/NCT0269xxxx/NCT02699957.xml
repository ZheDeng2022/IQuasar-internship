      The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry (LAAO Registryâ„¢) is designed to assess the&#xD;
      prevalence, demographics, management, and outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous and&#xD;
      epicardial based left atrial appendage occlusion procedures to reduce the risk of stroke.&#xD;
      Patient-level data will be submitted by participating hospitals on a quarterly basis to the&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology Foundation's National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR). The&#xD;
      primary aims of the LAAO Registry are to optimize the outcomes and management of patients&#xD;
      through the implementation of evidence-based guideline recommendations in clinical practice,&#xD;
      facilitate efforts to improve the quality and safety for patients undergoing percutaneous and&#xD;
      epicardial based left atrial appendage procedures, investigate novel quality improvement&#xD;
      methods and provide risk-adjusted assessment of patients for comparison with nationwide NCDR&#xD;
      data. The secondary purpose of the LAAO Registry is to serve as a rich source of clinical&#xD;
      data to support assessments of short- and long-term safety, comparative and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness research, and as a scalable data infrastructure for post market studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitals join the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Registry (LAAO Registry) by agreeing to&#xD;
      the terms of a specific contract that outlines the obligations of each party and the annual&#xD;
      fees for participation. In addition, participating sites sign a Business Associate Agreement&#xD;
      with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) as per the requirements of the Health Insurance&#xD;
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LAAO Registry dataset, comprised of approximately 300 data elements, was created by a&#xD;
      panel of experts using available American College of Cardiology (ACC), Heart Rhythm Society&#xD;
      (HRS), and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) societal overview&#xD;
      document guidance, data elements and definitions, previous trial data elements, and other&#xD;
      evidentiary sources. Protected Health Information (PHI), such as social security number, is&#xD;
      collected. The intent for collection of PHI is to allow for complete follow-up and tracking&#xD;
      of the patient, to assist data managers in correcting data collection errors and improving&#xD;
      data quality, for future registry interoperability and the potential for future generation of&#xD;
      patient-level drill downs in Quality and Outcomes Reports (see section 11, Data Analysis and&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations). Registry sites can opt out of transmitting direct identifiers to&#xD;
      the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR), so inclusion of direct identifiers in the&#xD;
      registry is at the discretion of the registry site. When using the NCDR web-based data&#xD;
      collection tool, direct identifiers are entered but a partition between the data collection&#xD;
      process and the data warehouse maintains the direct identifiers separate from the analysis&#xD;
      datasets. The minimum level of PHI transmitted to the ACC when a participant opts out of&#xD;
      submitting direct identifiers meets the definition of a Limited Dataset as such term is&#xD;
      defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data required for registry participation are collected retrospectively from existing medical&#xD;
      records or concurrently in the normal course of treatment. The Societal Document and safety&#xD;
      recommendations for left atrial appendage occlusion recommend additional testing and contact&#xD;
      with the patient outside the hospital episode of care at 45 days, 6 months, 1 year and 2&#xD;
      years post-procedure. All registry data (in-hospital and follow-up) is captured by&#xD;
      participating sites using an electronic data collection tool provided by the LAAO Registry or&#xD;
      in the future the option will be available for collecting data using a certified software&#xD;
      application that has been reviewed and certified as compliant with the transmissions&#xD;
      specifications established by the ACC for the LAAO Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of a call for data window, participants prepare a data submission by&#xD;
      exporting the data from their data collection mechanism and uploading their data to a secure&#xD;
      https server at the ACC using approved encryption software with the highest encryption that&#xD;
      is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recognition of the importance of data quality to all of its registry products, and to&#xD;
      ensure that data submitted to the NCDR are complete, consistent, and accurate, a Data Quality&#xD;
      Program was formally established by the NCDR in 2004. Upon receipt of the LAAO Registry data&#xD;
      submission, the ACC reviews the data electronically and reports back coding errors. Such&#xD;
      electronic checks verify consistency and completeness and allow participants to have ample&#xD;
      opportunity to submit data until it satisfies consistency and completion thresholds. The&#xD;
      report produced from these data checks is called a Data Quality Report (DQR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DQR provides the participant with a confidential analysis of their data submission's&#xD;
      completeness, and is used by the participant to help prioritize data cleaning efforts and to&#xD;
      assess the necessity for re-submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the data meets the data quality thresholds, an Outcomes Report is produced. The Outcomes&#xD;
      Report aggregates the participant's data and provides a comparison group (usually procedure&#xD;
      volume based) and national comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCDR understands the need to ensure the data submitted to the LAAO Registry is accurate&#xD;
      and it has launched a national on-site and off-site audit program whereas a random set of&#xD;
      participants participate in an on-site or off-site audit to confirm the data submitted to the&#xD;
      registry is consistent with data in the medical record or source documentation.&#xD;
