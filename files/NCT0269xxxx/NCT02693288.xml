  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radial fracture reparations by volar plating are often managed under regional&#xD;
      anaesthesia, but are associated with severe pain when the block ends. Acute post-operative&#xD;
      pain may delay rehabilitation, and even be a risk factor for the development of chronic pain.&#xD;
      The use of opioids and the inevitable opioid-related side effects further decrease patient&#xD;
      satisfaction. A multimodal approach to pain management should include local or regional&#xD;
      analgesia technique when possible. In the case of wrist fractures, two methods are available:&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block by the anaesthesiologist or surgical site local infiltration by the&#xD;
      surgeon with a long-acting local aesthetic. Both techniques are commonly used for the&#xD;
      management of postoperative pain after diverse orthopaedic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine the equivalence between ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block and local infiltration by the surgeon for short-term postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia after surgical reparation of isolated closed wrist fractures by volar plating under&#xD;
      regional anaesthesia. The quality of postoperative pain, patient satisfaction and adverse&#xD;
      events were recorded for the first 48 hours following surgery.&#xD;

      Patients were allocated to treatment group according to a computer-generated randomisation&#xD;
      sequence by blocs. Randomization was obtained and all data recorded through an electronic&#xD;
      report form (URC Robert Debre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and medical information were obtained in a pre-operative anaesthesia consultation&#xD;
      kept with the rest of the patient's written file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interventions were carried out under regional anaesthesia consisting of an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided axillary block with 25-35 mL of lidocaine 1,5% with epinephrine, targeting&#xD;
      the median, ulnar, radial, musculocutaneous and lateral cutaneous nerves. The analgesic&#xD;
      intervention was realised according to group allocation, at the end of surgery: after skin&#xD;
      closure and before making the cast. To ensure the blinding of the patient, the surgical&#xD;
      sterile drapes were kept until the end of the analgesic intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the peripheral nerve block group (BN), the anaesthesiologist performed an&#xD;
           ultrasound-guided block of the median and radial nerves at the lower third of the arm.&#xD;
           Each nerve was encircled with 10 mL of ropivacaine 0,475%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the local infiltration group (INF), the surgeon injected 10mL of ropivacaine 0,75%&#xD;
           directly all peri-fracture tissues: fracture site, tendon synovial sheaths hypodermis&#xD;
           and dermis regarding surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operating room or aesthetic nurse timed the duration of realisation of the analgesic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of proximal motor nerve block was recorded before patient discharge from the&#xD;
      post anaesthesia care unit, using a modified Bromage Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group the pain management was standardised: in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU)&#xD;
      the patients received 1g of acetaminophen and 550mg of naproxen (NSAID) as well as 20 mg&#xD;
      omeprazole given orally. This treatment was continued in the orthopaedic ward, every 6 hours&#xD;
      for acetaminophen, 12 hours for naproxen and every day for omeprazole. If the pain score&#xD;
      reached 3/10, rescue medication was given: 10 mg of oral morphine sulphate, available every 6&#xD;
      hours. Upon discharge, the patient was given a prescription with these same medications for&#xD;
      two days and clear instructions on the use of rescue opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was asked to record pain scores at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, opioid&#xD;
      consumption, opioid related adverse events, quality of sleep and satisfaction with pain&#xD;
      management on a document intended for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain scores were recorded using a Numeric Rating scale for pain ranging from 0 (no pain)&#xD;
      to 10 (worst possible pain). Total opioid consumption was assessed in milligrams. Quality of&#xD;
      sleep as well as patient satisfaction with pain management were recorded using a numerical&#xD;
      rating scale ranging from 0 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interns or medical practitioners unaware of patient allocation then collected the data. If&#xD;
      the patient was discharged within 2 days, data was recovered by telephone. The anonymized&#xD;
      data was then recorded in the electronic report form. All electronic data was declared to the&#xD;
      CNIL (French National Committee for Data protection and Liberties).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our preliminary data, the standard deviation of the mean duration of analgesia&#xD;
      for the first 48 postoperative hours was 108 minutes. We chose to set the equivalence margin&#xD;
      at 90 minutes, as it seemed clinically relevant to describe a difference in duration of&#xD;
      analgesia for the patient. With a risk alpha = 5% and beta = 10% and 10% of patients expected&#xD;
      not assessable, the estimated number of patients to include was 72 (36 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study aims to show equivalence, a per-protocol analysis will be carried out in first&#xD;
      intention. An intention-to-treat analysis will follow to assess the results' reliability and&#xD;
      treatment's efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be described for the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint was the delay between analgesic intervention and occurrence of a&#xD;
      pain score greater than 3/10 during the first 48 postoperative hours. The equivalence margin&#xD;
      of 90 minutes was considered clinically relevant, defining an equivalence interval between&#xD;
      -90 and + 90 minutes. If the confidence interval of the difference in analgesia duration&#xD;
      between the two techniques is included in this interval, the two techniques will be&#xD;
      considered equivalent. On the contrary if the confidence interval of the difference is only&#xD;
      partially included of not included in this interval, we will conclude to non-equivalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-points will be included in a superiority analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean difference for the duration of realisation of analgesic intervention will be&#xD;
           compared using Student's t-test or a non-parametric test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intensity of proximal motor block assessed by modified Bromage Scale will be&#xD;
           compared using a chi-squared test or Fischer's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of patients with a numerical pain rating ≤ 3, the number of patients&#xD;
           requiring opioids, the frequency of opioid-related adverse events during the first 48&#xD;
           postoperative hours and the quality of sleep on the first night on a numeric scale from&#xD;
           0 to 10 will be compared using a chi-squared test or Fischer's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total opioid consumption (in milligrams) as well as patient satisfaction with pain&#xD;
           management during the first 48 postoperative hours will be compared using Student's&#xD;
           t-test or a non-parametric test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pain scores recorded at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours postoperatively will be&#xD;
           described with a graphic analysis and compared using a mixed model reflecting the&#xD;
           repeated measures.&#xD;
