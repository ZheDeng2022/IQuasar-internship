  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort and will receive two infusions of&#xD;
      unlabeled huJ591 on days 1 and 14. 89Zr-J591 will be administered on day 21 (+ 1 day) and a&#xD;
      positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) will be performed week later on day&#xD;
      28 + 1 (visit 4). Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after the 2nd dose of J591, the patient will&#xD;
      undergo radical prostatectomy with or without lymph node dissection (day 31 + 4 days). The&#xD;
      final visit for the study will include a postoperative visit two weeks following surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of huJ591 to&#xD;
      trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response manifested by a peri-tumoral&#xD;
      inflammatory response with or without apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with either high or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. To participate the patients&#xD;
      will be required to meet all eligibility criteria. Patients may not participate in other&#xD;
      clinical trials while undergoing therapeutic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening period (up to 28 days prior to start of treatment under this clinical&#xD;
      trial) consists of visit to confirm eligibility, discuss the risks / benefits of&#xD;
      participating in the trial and radical prostatectomy (with or without lymph node dissection),&#xD;
      and obtain patient prostate biopsy samples for anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#xD;
      expression review. An enrolled subject's participation in the study entails approximately 6&#xD;
      to 7 weeks of therapy along with the additional 2 weeks time involved in recovery from a&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy. Adverse events will be collected throughout the entirety of the study.&#xD;
      The total duration of the patient being in the study can be around 9 to 11 weeks. Medical&#xD;
      information/Survival information will be collected from the routine followup visits (standard&#xD;
      of care) for up to 3 years after the surgery.&#xD;
