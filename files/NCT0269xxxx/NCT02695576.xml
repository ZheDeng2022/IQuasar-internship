      Background: At present there is no clear evidence that surgical treatment by fusion operation&#xD;
      is more advisable than non-surgical treatment in patients suffering from unspecific chronic&#xD;
      low back pain (CLBP). By personal experience a subgroup among the CLBP patients is selected,&#xD;
      possibly representing patients with pain from a motion segment/disc, thus making patient&#xD;
      selection more specified. Furthermore, selection of level to fuse based on radiological&#xD;
      findings has not been found reliable. Therefore a mechanical provocation test has been&#xD;
      developed at the clinic. The aim of this randomized study was to compare the outcomes in pain&#xD;
      and pain related functions perceived by this specific subgroup of CLBP patients following&#xD;
      fusion surgery with those following non-surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with a specified symptomatology and specified clinical signs at examination&#xD;
      were recruited and randomized to either type of treatment, non-surgical (NS) including&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy and physiotherapy (37 pat.) or surgical (S), including the same&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy and physiotherapy as in the NS group plus fusion surgery (37&#xD;
      pat.). All patients were thoroughly investigated before start of the study and at follow-up&#xD;
      one year after treatment. The outcomes perceived by the patients were assessed on the&#xD;
      validated questionnaires Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris, Balanced Inventory&#xD;
      for Spinal Disorders (BIS), Short-Form-36 (SF-36) and Euro-Quol (EQ-5D).&#xD;

      1. a. Title: Lumbar fusion or non-operative care for treatment of presumed discogenic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. Only two out of five existing randomized studies comparing results from fusion&#xD;
           surgery for chronic low back pain (CLBP) with results from conservative treatment have&#xD;
           reported the results from surgery to be better. Systematic review of these trials also&#xD;
           found methodological concerns. At present, therefore, there is no clear evidence that&#xD;
           surgical treatment is more advisable than non-surgical treatment in patients suffering&#xD;
           from unspecific CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 b. The investigators hypothesis is that a/ there exists a specific identifiable subgroup of&#xD;
      patients within the CLBP group in whom the pain emanates from the disc, and that b/ patients&#xD;
      in this subgroup may be selected based on thorough symptom analysis, and c/ that the actual&#xD;
      disc may be localized, not by radiological methods or discography, but by mechanical testing&#xD;
      procedures, making pain reduction possible by a fusion operation at that level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 a. A RCT with parallel group design with pre- and post-treatment data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 b. No changes were made after trial commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 a. Inclusion criteria: 18 to 65 years, with pronounced low back pain for at least one year&#xD;
      and having tried ordinary physical therapy without improvement and being on sick leave at&#xD;
      least 50 %. They should not have had any prior fusion operation but may have had surgery for&#xD;
      e.g. a disc herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 b. Eligible outpatients at the Clinic of Spinal Surgery, Strängnäs, Sweden, were informed&#xD;
      about the study and those who consented to participate were included, the other received&#xD;
      ordinary treatment outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected at the Clinic of Spinal Surgery, Strängnäs, Sweden. Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. A percutaneous mechanical provocation test was developed to obtain information regarding a&#xD;
      possibly painful segment. Local disc injections were also performed to analyse the pain&#xD;
      response at needle contact with the disc, at injection into the disc with saline or local&#xD;
      anaesthetics blind for the patients and also the pain situation following local anaestetics&#xD;
      into the disc, discoblock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, an open mechanical provocation test was developed to analyse the location of a&#xD;
      possibly painful disc. Operation by posterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed using&#xD;
      microsurgical technique and autologous bone. Internal fixation was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups, the surgical (S) and the non-surgical (NS) group, were all treated&#xD;
      by formal physiotherapy at a five days stay at the Clinic and instructed to continue their&#xD;
      training at home according to the lines given at the Clinic. Patients in both groups were&#xD;
      similarly treated individually by cognitive-behavior therapy at seven occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 a. The primary outcome was back pain, assessed by the patients on the BIS and on a VAS&#xD;
      before treatment and at follow-up one year after treatment as well as the perceived change in&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were pain related functions assessed on the ODI, the Roland-Morris, and&#xD;
      the BIS questionnaires. Health related quality of life was also assessed as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome measure, by using the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 b. No changes in trial outcomes were made during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      7a. The sample size calculation was performed before study start by the statistician (ES). It&#xD;
      was based on previous knowledge of outcomes from a Swedish cross-sectional study (surgery vs&#xD;
      physiotherapy) in which the proportions patients with improvement were 63% and 29%,&#xD;
      respectively. Assuming similar results of improvements a total sample size of 66 (33+33) will&#xD;
      detect such a difference with the statistical power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 b. Interim analysis did not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. Sequence generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 a and b. A randomization scheme balanced for female/male, as well as for&#xD;
      surgery/non-surgery patients was performed by using random permuted blocks of 20 (10 females&#xD;
      and 10 male) patients in order to reduce predictability. The permutation blocks were randomly&#xD;
      chosen. Two sets of closed envelopes in numbered orders, one set for males and one for&#xD;
      females, with either message &quot;operate&quot; or &quot;do not operate&quot; were delivered to the clinic by&#xD;
      the statistician not involved in the treatment of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. The patients were consecutively included in the study according to the randomization&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. A statistician not involved in the treatment of the patients generated the random&#xD;
      allocation sequence. The surgeon enrolled the participants and an anaesthesiology nurse at&#xD;
      the clinic performed the practical assignment, i.e. opened the closed envelopes in&#xD;
      consecutive order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 a. In accordance with the treatment alternatives the participants and the care givers&#xD;
      could not be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 b. Patients in both groups, the surgical and the non-surgical, received equal&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment and physiotherapy. Besides, patients in the surgical group&#xD;
      were operated by spinal fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 a and b. The outcome variables are assessed on rating scales that generate ordered&#xD;
      categorical data. Characteristic features are the ordered structure with lack of information&#xD;
      regarding size and inter-categorical distances. Non-parametric rank-based statistical methods&#xD;
      that take account of these limited mathematical properties of ordered categorical data have&#xD;
      been used for description and analysis. Frequency distribution, proportions, bar charts,&#xD;
      median and quartiles are used for statistical description of cross-sectional data.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of difference in outcomes assessed by transitional scales in the BIS by&#xD;
      the two groups of patients was performed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Statistical&#xD;
      evaluation of change in the paired assessments made before treatment and on the follow-up&#xD;
      occasion was made by a statistical approach developed for paired ordinal data that provides&#xD;
      measures of systematic change in common for the group and additional measure of individual&#xD;
      variability. The measures and the 95% confidence intervals of systematic change in position&#xD;
      (RP), and in concentration (RC), and the measure of individual variability (RV) will be&#xD;
      calculated as well as the differences in these measures between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
      This approach has been found to have a high power of detecting differences in small samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. All patients in the surgical as well in the non-surgical group received the allocated&#xD;
      treatment. All patients in both groups were seen at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 a. Recruitment started July 4, 2007 and ended when the last patient was included in the&#xD;
      study at March 28, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up took place from Oct. 21, 2008 to June 27, 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 b. The trial was performed as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers analysed&#xD;
&#xD;
      16. The analysis was carried out on the complete groups of 37 patients in each group and no&#xD;
      missing patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and estimations&#xD;
&#xD;
      17 a and b. The material is not fully analysed yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ancillary analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      18. None.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harms&#xD;
&#xD;
      19. There were no surgical complications, no neurological deterioration and no device&#xD;
      failures. Five of the 37 patients in group S had defect bone healing and were re-operated by&#xD;
      anterior fusion at the same level, one patient had anterior fusion at a new level and in 3&#xD;
      patients the fixation screws were extracted due to local pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20. There was a rather small sample size because of difficulties in recruiting eligible&#xD;
      patients, but a good research team and the choice of appropriate statistical analysis shows&#xD;
      the power of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalizability&#xD;
&#xD;
      21. The investigators regard the results generalizable, provided that the patients and the&#xD;
      level to fuse being selected according to the same criteria as in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      22. Based on the results from existing randomized studies comparing fusion surgery with&#xD;
      conservative treatment in patients suffering from CLBP it has not been evident that surgery&#xD;
      is advisable. However, in previous studies the symptoms of the patients selected has been&#xD;
      described simply as &quot;chronic low back pain&quot;. The patients in the investigators study were&#xD;
      selected based on a more specific symptom analysis. Furthermore, in previous studies the&#xD;
      level to fuse has been chosen based on radiological findings whereas a mechanical provocation&#xD;
      tests is used in the present study. Two of the previous studies stated the importance of&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy in CLBP patients, resulting in equally good results as following&#xD;
      fusion surgery. To study the specific effect of surgery, therefore, both groups in the&#xD;
      investigators study received quite the same treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy and&#xD;
      physiotherapy, the difference between the two groups being that one group also received&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
