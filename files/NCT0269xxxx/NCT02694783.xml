      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a brain infection in people with a&#xD;
      weakened immune system. Researchers think polyoma virus specific T cells (PyVST) therapy can&#xD;
      treat PML. The PyVST cells are made from blood cells of a healthy relative. They are grown in&#xD;
      a lab to expand the virus-killing cells, then given to the person with PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether PyVST safely treats PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults ages 18 and older with PML&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adults ages 18 and older who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Been screened under protocol 97-H-0041&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A sibling, parent, or child with PML and matching cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PML participants will also be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebrospinal fluid removed by needle in the back.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MRI: A dye is injected in a vein. They lie on a table that slides into a cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants will have apheresis: Blood flows through a needle in one arm into&#xD;
      machine that separates blood cells needed for donation. The rest of the blood is returned by&#xD;
      needle to the other arm. Some participants may have a central line placed in a vein instead.&#xD;
      They can have apheresis up to 3 times, at least 28 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PML will receive the PyVST cells by needle in the arm. They will stay in&#xD;
      the hospital 1 week. They can do this up to 3 times, at least 28 days apart. After each&#xD;
      infusion, they will have weekly visits for 1 month. Then they will have 4 visits over 1 year.&#xD;
      Visits include repeats of screening tests.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot clinical trial will aim to determine the feasibility and potential toxicities&#xD;
      associated with treating patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with&#xD;
      polyomavirus (PyV)-specific partially matched polyclonal allogeneic T cells. It will further&#xD;
      provide initial efficacy data for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 subjects with definite PML, defined as clinical signs and MRI compatible with active&#xD;
      PML and the presence of JCV by PCR in CSF. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older and must&#xD;
      have a first degree, partially HLA- matched relative able and willing to act as a donor of&#xD;
      lymphocytes. Subjects with underlying reversible immunosuppression (i.e.- HIV or MS status&#xD;
      post treatment with natalizumab), or subjects with uncontrolled malignancy will be excluded.&#xD;
      Subjects with evidence of active CNS inflammation as determined by presence of significant&#xD;
      contrast enhancement within the PML lesions by MRI will also be excluded because it is&#xD;
      assumed such patients are already mounting an adequate immune response against the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a first-in-human pilot study assessing the feasibility and toxicity profile of&#xD;
      NIH PyVST cellular product in subjects with PML. Subjects will be screened under the existing&#xD;
      NIH Natural History study of PML (13-N-0017). Sequential enrollment will be spaced at least&#xD;
      28 days apart. An initial fixed dose PyVST infusion (target dose of 1 x 10(6) PyVST/kg (+/-&#xD;
      10%)) will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, followed by 2x 10(6) PyVST/kg&#xD;
      (+/-10%) up to 2 times to each subject if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored to 28 days continuously with stopping rules based on the&#xD;
      treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Secondary outcomes include survival, assessed&#xD;
      at day 28 and at 1 year following the last infusion. CSF viral titers, MR imaging, and&#xD;
      clinical disability scales will also be collected.&#xD;
