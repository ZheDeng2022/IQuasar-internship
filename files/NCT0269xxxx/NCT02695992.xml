    <textblock>
      The RATAF II study is a randomized, prospective, parallel group study, designed to compare&#xD;
      the effects of two different drug regimens for rate control in permanent AF (atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation). We will investigate on the difference in effects on exercise capacity,&#xD;
      biomarkers (NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), troponins, hs-CRP), heart&#xD;
      rate, echocardiographic measurements and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that six months' treatment with the calcium channel blocker diltiazem&#xD;
      will lower NT-proBNP and increase exercise capacity (peak VO2) compared to treatment with the&#xD;
      beta blocker metoprolol in permanent AF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac disease, with increasing incidence and prevalence.&#xD;
      There are two main treatment strategies for this arrhythmia, rhythm control and rate control.&#xD;
      As rate control is easier to achieve and no major difference in outcome has been found&#xD;
      between these two strategies, it is considered a reasonable initial treatment for the&#xD;
      majority of AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced exercise capacity is the most prevalent symptom in patients with permanent AF. In the&#xD;
      first Rate control in Atrial Fibrillation (RATAF) study, we demonstrated that calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers preserved exercise capacity, reduced arrhythmia-related symptoms and lowered levels&#xD;
      of NT-proBNP - whereas the beta blockers reduced the exercise capacity, did not reduce&#xD;
      arrhythmia-related symptoms and increased NT-proBNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings are relevant to a large proportion of patients with permanent AF, suggesting&#xD;
      that calcium channel blockers should be the first drug of choice for rate control in patients&#xD;
      without heart failure or coronary heart disease. Our results challenge the current widespread&#xD;
      use of beta blockers in this setting. However, as the follow up time in the RATAF study was&#xD;
      only 3 weeks, it is not clear if these effects are sustained over time. Furthermore, we do&#xD;
      not know the mechanisms for the differential effects on exercise capacity, arrhythmia related&#xD;
      symptoms and NT-proBNP levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the RATAF II study we will investigate whether the effects on NT-proBNP levels, exercise&#xD;
      capacity and symptoms are sustained over time, and explore potential mechanisms that may&#xD;
      explain the difference in these effects. The study will provide new insights and results&#xD;
      relevant for everyday clinical practice and be of importance for a large and growing group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 240 patients will be included. Eligible patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      out-patient clinics at the participation hospitals and through advertisements in local&#xD;
      newspapers. After inclusion and a wash-out period of 14 days free from drugs affecting the&#xD;
      heart rate, patients will be examined by echocardiography, 12-lead ECG (electrocardiography),&#xD;
      24h Holter monitoring, maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and venous blood sampling at&#xD;
      rest, at maximal exercise and after recovery. Perceived arrhythmia related symptoms, quality&#xD;
      of life and level of physical activity will be assessed using self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized through a computer-generated randomization list, to receive&#xD;
      one of the study drug regimens; metoprolol 100 mg o.d. or diltiazem 360 mg o.d. The&#xD;
      investigators and study personnel will be blinded with regard to allocated study drug. The&#xD;
      participants themselves will know what study drug they are assigned. Also, study personnel&#xD;
      not involved in examinations will also be able to acquire knowledge concerning assigned study&#xD;
      drug, to ensure the process of dosage in the startup phase, assess adverse events (AE) and&#xD;
      side effects throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations will be repeated after four weeks and six months. All examinations will be&#xD;
      performed at the Department of Medical Research, Baerum Hospital to ensure standardized&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
