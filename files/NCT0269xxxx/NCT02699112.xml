      To assess patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure using echocardiography,cardiac output&#xD;
      measurements and markers of neural respiratory drive (EMGpara) prior to, during and after&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) initiation, and to follow the patients for 3 months. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the improvement in cardiac function and/or respiratory&#xD;
      mechanics over time are associated with ongoing improvements in oxygenation, quality of life&#xD;
      and exercise capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is characterized by the incapacity of the respiratory system to maintain&#xD;
      the normal arterial blood gas homeostasis. Specifically, the overlap of hypoxaemia and&#xD;
      hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6 kPa) is referred to as Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure (HRF). HRF is&#xD;
      one of the most common causes for hospital admission with high re-admission rates, therefore&#xD;
      constitute a major burden on healthcare systems. Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) is a well&#xD;
      established treatment in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who frequently suffer&#xD;
      with associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). NIV helps to increase arterial oxygenation and&#xD;
      reduces hypercapnia. It is used in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure caused by&#xD;
      Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS). The associated degree of PH can lead to an increased&#xD;
      afterload of the right ventricle (RV) that causes progressive remodelling of the right heart.&#xD;
      RV dysfunction is correlated with a reduced long term prognosis in respiratory conditions. In&#xD;
      literature NIV is shown as effective method to treat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in&#xD;
      OHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has not been described how NIV impacts on cardiac function and NRD in OHS.&#xD;
