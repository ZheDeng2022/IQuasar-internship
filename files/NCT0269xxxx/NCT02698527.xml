      BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain procedures, particularly those involving the skin, can cause pain and distress in&#xD;
      patients. Often , a local anesthetic is used to dull the sensation and improve patient&#xD;
      experience and satisfaction. The procedure at hand dictates the mode of delivery of the&#xD;
      anesthetic, but typically immediate and fast acting analgesia requires infiltration.&#xD;
      Lidocaine is in the amide class of local anesthetics and is the most commonly used agent for&#xD;
      infiltration. Lidocaine is usually given as a 1 percent solution and can be combined with&#xD;
      epinephrine in order to prolong the duration of action, decrease local bleeding via local&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and decrease systemic absorption of the lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that lidocaine injection can be painful, likely secondary to the acidity. A&#xD;
      meta analysis published in the Cochrane Database of 23 trials that compared pain during&#xD;
      infiltration of buffered or non-buffered lidocaine found that patients receiving buffered&#xD;
      lidocaine reported significantly less pain than those who received non-buffered lidocaine.&#xD;
      The decrease in pain was greater for patients who received lidocaine with epinephrine but was&#xD;
      also present for those who received lidocaine without epinephrine. The authors' conclusion&#xD;
      was that &quot;increasing the pH of lidocaine decreased pain on injection and augmented patient&#xD;
      comfort and satisfaction&quot;. The studies included in this review however were mainly focused on&#xD;
      lacerations, carpal tunnel decompression and &quot;outpatient procedures&quot;. There were two studies&#xD;
      that specifically involved OB/GYN patients; one investigated buffered lidocaine during&#xD;
      epidural catheter removal and the other investigated buffered lidocaine during Norplant&#xD;
      insertion. Since the Cochrane Review was published, one further gynecologic study&#xD;
      investigating buffered lidocaine has been published involving cervical loop excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no studies investigating the efficacy of buffered lidocaine during&#xD;
      procedures on the vulva. The vulva is a particularly sensitive region to have a biopsy&#xD;
      performed because it has extensive innervation, a large blood supply and it involves a pelvic&#xD;
      exam which can be associated with increased anxiety. As many OBGYNs know, the vulva can be&#xD;
      affected by a variety of conditions both benign and malignant. A crucial aspect of caring for&#xD;
      women with vulvar complaints is conducting biopsies of lesions to ensure no occult malignancy&#xD;
      and/or to further classify a diagnosis with histology. Use of local anesthetic is standard of&#xD;
      care during biopsy but can add to the pain and discomfort of an already painful procedure.&#xD;
      Some sources recommend use of topical anesthetic prior to infiltration of lidocaine,&#xD;
      particularly in the pediatric patient. However, this technique requires the topical&#xD;
      anesthetic be applied 20-60 minutes prior to the biopsy, which may not be feasible in a busy&#xD;
      outpatient practice. Currently, the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests 8.4%&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate can be added to lidocaine to minimize discomfort. However, there is&#xD;
      currently no standard anesthesia recommendations and this is often not being done in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the obstacles to topical anesthetic usage, the fact that it does not address the pain&#xD;
      involved with lidocaine infiltration and the lack of published literature on use of buffered&#xD;
      lidocaine on the vulva, this study aims to investigate the use of buffered lidocaine versus&#xD;
      non-buffered lidocaine in the setting of vulvar biopsy using a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Does buffered lidocaine decrease pain scores on a visual analogue scale&#xD;
      during infiltration for local anesthesia during vulvar biopsy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY/ STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a double blinded, randomized controlled trial to be performed at the&#xD;
      Women's Primary Care Center and The Program In Women's Oncology Clinics. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited as outlined below and assigned a sequential study identification number. They will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the questions on the Data Collection Form/Survey (see form titled &quot;Data&#xD;
      Collection Form&quot;) and if they agree to the study, will sign the Informed Consent (see form&#xD;
      titled &quot;Informed Consent&quot;). The Data Collection Form/Survey will be given to the patient upon&#xD;
      decision to perform a vulvar biopsy by the provider. The patient will be consented by&#xD;
      approved research personnel. Then, the patient will undergo a vulvar biopsy as per clinician&#xD;
      protocol. Baseline pain scores will be collected using the visual analogue scale. After skin&#xD;
      prep, the pre-filled, sequentially numbered, randomized 25 gauge syringes will be used to&#xD;
      inject 3ml of either buffered or non-buffered lidocaine prepared by the pharmacy as outlined&#xD;
      below. The biopsy will then proceed as per clinical standard. The patient will be presented a&#xD;
      100 mm visual analogue scale to mark their pain level. A total of three pain scores will be&#xD;
      obtained as the patient marks on the pain scale when instructed: A baseline pain score prior&#xD;
      to intervention, pain score at time of infiltration, and pain score at the completion of the&#xD;
      biopsy. The Data Collection Form/Survey will be collected from the patient by approved&#xD;
      research personnel and placed in secure storage. Data will be entered into a secure&#xD;
      electronic database for statistical analysis. Nursing staff at the WPCC may be present for&#xD;
      the biopsy, but will not be involved in the conduction of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of interest is patients undergoing vulvar biopsy for noninfectious&#xD;
      lesions. These clinic sites were chosen for this project given the relatively high volume of&#xD;
      such procedures. There are a number of other trials that have taken place or are ongoing at&#xD;
      the Women's Primary Care Center and The Program In Women's Oncology Office, such that ample&#xD;
      infrastructure and resources are available. Many of the patients have been approached for&#xD;
      other research trials, and may be more willing to participate for that reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: The sample size calculation is based on the null hypothesis that the mean pain&#xD;
      score will be the same in women treated with buffered lidocaine as in those treated with&#xD;
      non-buffered placebo. The alternative hypothesis (two-sided) is that the mean pain score in&#xD;
      women treated with buffered lidocaine will be different than those treated with non-buffered&#xD;
      lidocaine. Assuming an alpha of 0.05, 80% power, and a standard deviation of 21-30 mm (based&#xD;
      on a previous study measuring pain with tenaculum application and intracervical block), we&#xD;
      will need to recruit 64 women per arm to be able to detect a 15 mm mean difference between&#xD;
      groups on the 100 mm VAS. This difference is derived from a prior study showing the minimally&#xD;
      clinically significant difference in acute pain on the VAS is 12 mm, with a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval range from 9 to 15 mm. Therefore, we plan to recruit a total of 128 patients, or 64&#xD;
      patients per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT SELECTION/RECRUITMENT METHOD: Participants will be recruited from June&#xD;
      2015-April 2018. All patients at the Women's Primary Care Center and The Program In Women's&#xD;
      Oncology Clinic who are to undergo a vulvar biopsy for a noninfectious vulvar lesion will be&#xD;
      approached by the research assistant or provider in the clinic and asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study. The research assistant/provider will then review the study protocol, risks,&#xD;
      benefits, and the written informed consent form with the patient (see form titled &quot;Informed&#xD;
      Consent&quot;). If the patient wishes to participate, written informed consent for the study will&#xD;
      be obtained by study personnel prior to the biopsy. Women from all racial and ethnic groups&#xD;
      will be considered for inclusion in this study and no person shall be excluded based on their&#xD;
      race or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION/INTERPRETATION: All data will be collected prospectively by the research&#xD;
      staff or nursing staff (nursing staff at the WPCC will not be involved in research&#xD;
      activities). Before the biopsy, a questionnaire will be completed by the patient to identify&#xD;
      any factors that may influence pain perceived during the biopsy as well as baseline&#xD;
      demographic information: age, race/ethnicity, education level, any analgesics taken the day&#xD;
      of the biopsy. The physician performing the biopsy and indication for the biopsy will also be&#xD;
      noted. The primary outcome of interest will be pain score on the visual analogue scale during&#xD;
      lidocaine infiltration. A total of three pain scores will be obtained by the research&#xD;
      assistant or nurse: A baseline pain score prior to intervention, pain score at time of&#xD;
      infiltration, and pain score at the completion of the biopsy. This will be measured by asking&#xD;
      the patient to mark her pain level on a 100 mm scale at each predetermined time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis plan is based on the primary outcome of mean pain score during lidocaine&#xD;
      infiltration as measured on the 0 mm to 100 mm VAS. The investigators are comparing two&#xD;
      groups: 1) buffered lidocaine 2) non-buffered lidocaine. If the data are normally&#xD;
      distributed, we will compare mean pain scores between the two groups using a t-test. If the&#xD;
      data deviate notably from normality, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used&#xD;
      for comparisons. Imbalances will be handled by adjustment for covariates in multiple linear&#xD;
      regression. The investigators will use an intention to treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent is obtained and subjects are admitted into the study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups, buffered lidocaine or non-buffered&#xD;
      lidocaine. Randomization lists will be computer generated with a one-to-one allocation ratio&#xD;
      in blocks by the WIH pharmacy staff. After signing the consent form, each participant will be&#xD;
      assigned a study ID number corresponding with the order of recruitment into the study. The&#xD;
      pharmacy will prepare identical syringes containing 9 ml of the 1% lidocaine + 1 ml of sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate or 10 ml 1% lidocaine labeled only with the study name and sequentially numbered.&#xD;
      The numbered syringe corresponding with the participant's study ID number will be obtained by&#xD;
      the study staff from the locked refrigerator in the Women's Primary Care Center or The&#xD;
      Program In Women's Oncology. The syringes will appear identical. Participants, study&#xD;
      personnel, the medical assistant, and the clinician will be blinded to the assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACILITIES: All patient related aspects of the study will transpire in the Women's Primary&#xD;
      Care Center and The Program In Women's Oncology. Data processing and interpretation will take&#xD;
      place at Women and Infants Hospital in conjunction with the Division of Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY: The patients enrolled in the study will be asked permission for access to&#xD;
      their medical records. To ensure patient confidentiality, all forms will be marked with only&#xD;
      the participant ID number, with a key containing identifying information kept separately in a&#xD;
      locked cabinet that only research personnel will have access to. Electronic data will be&#xD;
      stored on the Care New England file server, a file server that is located in a physically&#xD;
      secured data center. Access to Care New England data center is card-controlled and all access&#xD;
      to the server room is recorded. Care New England computer account management policies and&#xD;
      practices ensure that computer access to the study database will be limited to key study&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY: Study personnel will meet to review safety issues and logistics at 25%, 50% and 75%&#xD;
      recruitment. Adverse events and complications will be recorded on the data collection sheet&#xD;
      which will be reviewed by the PI on a rolling basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERSONNEL/ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by and data collected by designated research staff and/or&#xD;
      providers in the Women's Primary Care Center and The Program In Women's Oncology. The&#xD;
      biopsies will be performed by designated key research personnel. These providers are educated&#xD;
      on the standard protocol utilized by the Center. Nursing staff at the WPCC may be present for&#xD;
      the biopsy, but will not be involved in the conduction of the study.&#xD;
