      Background Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a destructive joint disease, causing&#xD;
      degeneration of cartilage, damage to the underlying bone and morphological changes to the&#xD;
      joint1. It is a major public health concern due to the increased life expectancy of the&#xD;
      ageing population2,3. No approved medical treatment that reverses the morphological changes&#xD;
      currently exists. Conventional treatment includes physiotherapy, pain killers, braces and in&#xD;
      end-stage OA surgical knee replacement4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Osteoarthritis with Paqe 3 Version 2 the Stromal Vascular Fraction of Adipose&#xD;
      tissue 02-11-2015 During the past decade researchers have started to explore the regenerative&#xD;
      potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in OA5. MSCs are multipotent progenitor cells able&#xD;
      to give rise to osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoblasts and tenocytes6. MSCs were&#xD;
      first used to treat Chondral defects in 19987 and to treat OA in 20028. Since, a number of&#xD;
      case reports and prospective series have been published showing significant short term and&#xD;
      long term effect on pain and cartilage thickness5. Recently a prospective case-series of 1128&#xD;
      patients involving 1856 joints were treated with the stromal vascular fraction of abdominal&#xD;
      Adipose tissue (SVF) which is a rich source of mesenchymal stem cells. 86% of the treated&#xD;
      patients showed an improvement of at least 50% in modified Knee/Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score (KOOS/HOOS) at 3 months and 129. Only 0.9% of patients were non-responders showing no&#xD;
      improvement after treatment. No serious adverse effects like infection or tumor formation&#xD;
      were observed9, which is in accordance with previous studies10. Non-manipulated or minimally&#xD;
      manipulated cell therapies have been used within a wide range of medical conditions&#xD;
      including: stroke, myocardial infarction, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and breast&#xD;
      augmentation. More than 17,000 scientific articles have been published reporting treatment of&#xD;
      more than 320,000 patients11. No severe safety issues have been raised12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells can be derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue5. Most research has&#xD;
      been performed on bone marrow-derived stem cells but the past years a series of studies have&#xD;
      been published showing promising effect of Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs). By&#xD;
      using AMSC a large amount of cells can be harvested from a small volume of tissue thereby&#xD;
      avoiding the costly and time consuming process of expanding the cells in culture5,9.&#xD;
      Abdominal adipose tissue has been shown to have a 1000 times higher concentration of AMSC&#xD;
      than other investigated adipose tissue9. This opens for the possibility of a one-step&#xD;
      procedure where cells are harvested and injected during one visit in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
      The optimal dose of AMSC is unknown but the effect seems to be dose-dependent with doses&#xD;
      around 1.0 x 108 AMSCs per injection being desirable5,9. The stromal vascular fraction of&#xD;
      abdominal Adipose tissue is a rich source of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014 the Lipogems system has been launched as a commercial of-the-shelf product:&#xD;
      http://lipogems.eu/. The Lipogems system is an enzyme-free technology developed to process&#xD;
      lipoaspirates in a closed system, resulting in a non-expanded adipose tissue product that&#xD;
      contains SVF13. Before using this product in larger scale a controlled study of its&#xD;
      feasibility and safety is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective To investigate the feasibility and short term safety issues of treatment of&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis with intra-articular injection with the stromal vascular fraction of&#xD;
      abdominal adipose tissue (SVF) harvested and prepared using the Lipogems System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereby we wish to pave the road for a high quality randomized controlled trial investigating&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment of knee osteoarthritis with SVF looking at patient reported&#xD;
      outcome, function, homeostasis of the joint and cartilage regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Treatment Patients participating in the study are treated according to the Danish National&#xD;
      Clinical Guidelines for people with osteoarthritis16. They receive three months of&#xD;
      physiotherapy, are guided concerning the optimal pharmaceutical treatment with painkillers&#xD;
      and people with BMI above 28 are offered a consultation with a dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Description of the active treatment The active treatment is an intra-articular injection&#xD;
      with the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) harvested from the patient's own abdominal&#xD;
      subcutaneous fatty tissue. SVF is harvested using the Lipogems system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 Harvest of SVF Harvest of SVF is done under sterile conditions in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. The patient is positioned supine on an examination bench. The area from which the&#xD;
      tissue will be harvested is marked on the skin with a surgical marker. The area is app. 8cm&#xD;
      (cranio-caudal) x 20cm (lateral) and situated just below the umbilicus. Local anesthesia is&#xD;
      applied to the whole area with a suspension of Carbocain 1%, 200ml isotonic saline,&#xD;
      adrenaline and 10mmol Bicarbonate. Surgical cleaning is performed twice and a sterile draping&#xD;
      is applied. Through a stab incision the harvesting needle is introduced to the subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat and suction is applied. 20ml to 40ml of subcutaneous adipose tissue is harvested. At the&#xD;
      end of the procedure the skin is closed with a plaster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Preparation of SVF for implantation The syringes with subcutaneous aspirate are&#xD;
      prepared using the Lipogems system. The Lipogems system is an enzyme-free technology&#xD;
      developed to process variable amounts of lipoaspirates in a closed system, resulting in a&#xD;
      nonexpanded adipose tissue product that contains SVF. The technology works through a mild&#xD;
      mechanical tissue cluster size reduction. Thereby avoiding the use of any enzyme and&#xD;
      additional processing (i.e., centrifugation and subfractional harvesting).13 6.1.3&#xD;
      Implantation of SVF Implantation of the SVF is done under sterile conditions in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. The patient is positioned supine on an examination bench with the affected&#xD;
      knee stretched. The superior pole of the patella is palpated and the femoral condyle is&#xD;
      marked with a surgical marker. The suprapattelar recess is located by ultrasound, local&#xD;
      anesthesia is applied to the injection site and surgical cleaning is performed twice.&#xD;
      Injection of the SVF in to the suprapattelar recess is done using a 21 gauge syringe under&#xD;
      direct visualization by ultrasound. At the end of the procedure the skin is closed with a&#xD;
      plaster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.4 Control of dose of injected SVF Control of the dose of AMSC in the injected SVF is&#xD;
      performed after injection. As a consequence of the logistical favorable setup where harvest&#xD;
      and implantation is performed in a one-step procedure it is not possible to count the AMSC&#xD;
      before injection. Instead one mL of the solution is sent for cell count in the pathological&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
