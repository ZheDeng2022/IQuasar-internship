    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal observational study (via electronic records and biospecimens) designed&#xD;
      to utilize health IT advances to collect information from patients undergoing routine care.&#xD;
      This information will be stored in a database. Patients undergoing routine care from their&#xD;
      providers will be invited to participate in the UTSW Depression Cohort. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, the CDRCC team will collect information from available sources and store it&#xD;
      in a secure UT Southwestern network database protected by a security firewall. A schematic&#xD;
      representation of this information processing is shown in the figure contained in section 3&#xD;
      of the protocol. As part of the UTSW Depression Cohort, patients will allow banking of their&#xD;
      specimens. Specimens which are banked may include blood or blood products, urine, tissue&#xD;
      samples, saliva, stool samples or clinical waste products. The study will only enroll&#xD;
      participants comfortable with providing specimens. As the goal of the UTSW Depression Cohort&#xD;
      is to create a national database, CDRCC will engage with patients, providers, and researchers&#xD;
      at local, regional, and national levels. A large number of medical providers are already&#xD;
      screening patients for depression. Structured instruments like PHQ-2 or PHQ-9 are often used.&#xD;
      Hence, the CDRCC will seek collaborations with local, regional and national partners so that&#xD;
      information contained in their health IT initiatives can be included in the this database.&#xD;
      Due to the clinical nature of information collected, the investigators anticipate marked&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the variables and amount of data collected. Database architects will utilize&#xD;
      big data (large volumes of information from diverse sources with variable degrees of quality&#xD;
      and complexity) tools to structure the registry so that additional variables can be added, as&#xD;
      needed. The CDRCC team will maintain a detailed codebook of variables collected in the&#xD;
      database. All statistical analyses will be conducted only on de-identified data. Researchers&#xD;
      may obtain access to this de-identified data by following procedures established by the&#xD;
      CDRCC, which include obtaining IRB approval.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal observational study designed to utilize health IT advances to collect&#xD;
      information from patients undergoing routine care. This information will be collected as part&#xD;
      of routine care and stored in a database for research purposes. Patients undergoing routine&#xD;
      care from their providers will be invited to participate in the UTSW Depression Cohort. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, the CDRCC team will collect information from sources outlined in&#xD;
      background section of protocol and store it in a secure UT Southwestern network database&#xD;
      protected by a security firewall. A schematic representation of this information processing&#xD;
      is shown on page 7 of the protocol. The CDRCC team will also collect specimens which are&#xD;
      obtained as part of standard of care and are beyond the amount needed for routine clinical&#xD;
      care. For research-only purposes, CDRCC team will also collect blood, saliva, stool and urine&#xD;
      specimens at regular intervals described in subsequent section with the consent of study&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinics or health care facilities collaborating with CDRCC will approach their patients to&#xD;
      participate in this cohort. Research staff from UTSW or staff at these clinics (or health&#xD;
      care facilities) who have received training on how to obtain informed consent will then ask&#xD;
      interested patients to sign the IRB-approved Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization&#xD;
      documents. Initially, the Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization will be documented on&#xD;
      paper, and these documents will be scanned and stored in the master log of the Cohort&#xD;
      database in addition to securely storing the paper copy. In the future, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete Informed Consent and HIPAA authorization documents using computers or&#xD;
      handheld electronic devices (including signatures). Paper documents will be made available to&#xD;
      those who prefer and request them. Staff from CDRCC will be available either in person, by&#xD;
      email, or by phone to answer any questions that arise during the informed consent process&#xD;
      that cannot be answered by clinic staff. If patients are under the age of 18, they will&#xD;
      provide assent, and a parent or LAR will provide consent. The CDRCC will also develop&#xD;
      materials in print and electronic format to publicize the UTSW Depression Cohort. Other&#xD;
      patients or healthy individuals who are not involved with a CDRCC collaborator can also join&#xD;
      the registry if they complete the informed consent process. The UTSW Depression Cohort will&#xD;
      include comprehensive information collected as part of routine care by the patient's&#xD;
      provider(s). During routine care at their medical providers' offices, patients may fill out&#xD;
      screening questionnaires and self-rated behavioral health assessments, provide medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric history, undergo laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), radiologic or other&#xD;
      clinically relevant investigations and be given treatment recommendations. Some of the&#xD;
      self-rated assessments completed as part of measurement based care may include Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Patient Adherence&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PAQ), Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER),&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Concise Associated Symptoms Tracking - Self-Report&#xD;
      Scale (CAST-SR), Pain Frequency, Intensity, and Burden Scale (P-FIBS), Concise Health Risk&#xD;
      Tracking Scale (CHRT), and Alcohol and Drug usage screen. The information in the Cohort&#xD;
      database will be stored indefinitely unless a participant requests the principal investigator&#xD;
      to remove his/her name and associated information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research only assessments As part of the UTSW Depression Cohort, participants will undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment using MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Version 7.0 for&#xD;
      DSM-5 (MINI) and complete self-report research assessments for psychiatric symptoms and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning. These research only assessments will add 60-90 minutes to the visit&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen banking:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the UTSW Depression Cohort, patients will allow banking of their specimens. The&#xD;
      study will only enroll participants comfortable with providing specimens. Of course, like&#xD;
      with any other study procedure, those not comfortable with providing specimens will not be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Specimens which are banked may include blood or blood products,&#xD;
      urine, stool samples, tissue samples, saliva or clinical waste products. Clinical waste&#xD;
      products include surgical waste tissue samples, placenta samples and biopsy samples. Once a&#xD;
      sample is collected, all identifying information will be removed, and it will be given a&#xD;
      unique code. The information linking this unique code to a patient's identifying information&#xD;
      will be stored in the master log. Samples will be stored appropriately in the CDRCC freezers&#xD;
      located in the north campus building of UT Southwestern. Samples will be overseen by CDRCC&#xD;
      research personnel. A sample will be stored indefinitely until the sample runs out or it is&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and blood products- Blood will be obtained by venipuncture performed by personnel with&#xD;
      phlebotomy training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult blood draws will not exceed the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient weight Maximum Volume per 24 hour Maximum Volume per Month Kilograms Pounds&#xD;
      Milliliters Milliliters 51-60 112-132 112-120 224-240 61-65 134-143 122-130 244-260 68-70&#xD;

      211-220 192-200 384-400&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric blood draws will not exceed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient weight Maximum Volume per 24 hour Maximum Volume per Month Kilograms Pounds&#xD;
      Milliliters Milliliters &lt;0.9 &lt;2 3 12 0.9-1.8 2-4 4.5 18 1.9-2.7 4-6 6 24 2.8-3.6 6-8 7.5 30&#xD;

&#xD;
      Blood may be obtained as a single blood draw, which may be a patient's only collection.&#xD;
      Patients may be contacted to provide similar specimens at intervals around every 3-4 months&#xD;
      for over 5-10 years (for a total of 40 blood draws). Collections will be restricted by the&#xD;
      maximum safe volumes outlined above for both adult and pediatric participants. If being&#xD;
      obtained in a clinical setting, clinical care specimens will take precedence over research&#xD;
      specimens. If specimens are obtained during the course of clinical care, a safe volume will&#xD;
      be determined in conjunction with treating physicians, but will not exceed the above table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva- Saliva will be collected into the Oragene DNA and/or RNA self-collection kit and&#xD;
      stored at room temperature until DNA isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine- Urine samples will be collected in sterile urinalysis cups and 10 mL aliquots will be&#xD;
      frozen at -80°C in conical tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool- Stool samples will be collected once or possibly over time in conjunction with blood&#xD;
      draws described above in sterile 50 ml conical tubes and will be frozen at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical waste products- Samples obtained could include: a. surgical waste tissue samples; b.&#xD;
      placenta samples; and c. biopsy samples. These samples will be obtained as a part of standard&#xD;
      of care. Procedures involving these sample collections will be done by trained physicians and&#xD;
      medical technicians only. The tissue that will be used for research is the tissue that would&#xD;
      normally be discarded. After providing informed consent, study participants may allow study&#xD;
      personnel to collect these clinical waste products from the clinical sites. The clinical&#xD;
      waste product will then be transported to CDRCC on ice for storage. These samples will be&#xD;
      de-identified, stored and used for future research. There will be no cost or compensation to&#xD;
      the patients for donating this tissue to CDRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intended use of these samples is to enable future research into the diagnostics,&#xD;
      prognostics and biologic understanding of depression. The samples will be primarily used by&#xD;
      investigators affiliated with UT Southwestern, but will also be released to public and&#xD;
      private collaborators in a HIPAA compliant fashion (i.e., de-identified). Development of cell&#xD;
      lines and DNA libraries may occur with these samples. Samples may be used by investigators&#xD;
      not affiliated with UT Southwestern if they are collaborating with a UTSW investigator. Also,&#xD;
      samples may be used by colleagues at other institutions who are conducting their own IRB&#xD;
      -approved research. Furthermore, de-identified samples can be provided to collaborators in&#xD;
      industry if appropriate technology transfer agreements are in place. Samples sent to&#xD;
      investigators or private entities outside of UT Southwestern will have a charge associated&#xD;
      with them based on sample cost and projected use of the samples. Any specimen or data can be&#xD;
      released to collaborators (outlined above) as long as it is released in a HIPAA compliant&#xD;
      fashion (i.e., de-identified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain an IRB approval letter and maintain a current record of the&#xD;
      Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) for an IRB at another medical center if data and specimens are&#xD;
      sent from human cell banks at UT Southwestern to another medical center. If an investigator&#xD;
      at another medical center receives data and specimens from our Cohort at UT Southwestern, the&#xD;
      investigator will maintain documentation that (a) the recipient of samples from CDRCC&#xD;
      acknowledges that the conditions for use of the research material are governed by the IRB at&#xD;
      UT Southwestern in accordance with 45 CFR 46, (b) the recipient agrees to comply fully with&#xD;
      all such conditions and to report promptly to the CDRCC at UT Southwestern any proposed&#xD;
      changes in the research project, (c) the recipient remains subject to applicable State or&#xD;
      local laws or regulations and institutional policies which provide additional protections for&#xD;
      human subjects, and (d) the research material may be utilized only in accordance with the&#xD;
      conditions stipulated by the IRB at UT Southwestern. Any additional use of this material&#xD;
      requires prior review and approval by the IRB at UT Southwestern and, where appropriate, by&#xD;
      an IRB at the recipient site, which must be convened under an applicable OHRP-approved&#xD;
      Assurance. Non-UT Southwestern recipients of samples will be charged a usual and customary&#xD;
      fee for the sample to cover procurement costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the supervision of the principal investigator of CDRCC, two different subcommittees&#xD;
      will oversee the different aspects of the UTSW Depression Cohort: data management committee&#xD;
      and executive committee. The data management committee will be tasked with managing the flow&#xD;
      of information into and out of the Cohort database, maintaining the codebook of variables,&#xD;
      developing big data tools (as mentioned in specific aim 3), and ensuring consistency of data&#xD;
      collection and quality. The executive committee will be tasked with all other&#xD;
      responsibilities related to the registry like establishing collaborations with providers,&#xD;
      reviewing research proposals, and providing access to the cohort data for qualified&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be conducted as part of a patient's routine medical care except for&#xD;
      collection of research-only blood, urine, and saliva specimens as described above. This study&#xD;
      does not involve any interventions.&#xD;
