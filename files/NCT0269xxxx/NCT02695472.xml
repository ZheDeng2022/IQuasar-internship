  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening period and a randomized treatment. Approximately 220&#xD;
      subjects who meet eligibility during the screening period will be randomized to initiate a&#xD;
      12-week, double-blind treatment with NSI-189 80 milligrams/day (provided as 40 milligrams&#xD;
      twice per day), NSI-189 40 milligrams once a day, or placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screening period will range from a minimum of 14 days to a maximum of 28 days. The&#xD;
      Investigators will determine that the subjects meet eligibility criteria and will collect the&#xD;
      demographic and medical data permitting full characterization of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the randomization period will be 12 weeks. Subjects who meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Baseline Visit will be randomized to NSI-189 80&#xD;
      milligrams/day, given as 40 milligrams twice per day, NSI-189 40 milligrams/day, given once a&#xD;
      day, or placebo. The treatment will be double-blinded.&#xD;
