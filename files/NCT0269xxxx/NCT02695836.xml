      This project will evaluate three different strategies to get research findings back to&#xD;
      managers of care units in nursing homes. Feedback will be provided in a timely and effective&#xD;
      way so that it results in improvements in organizational context (modifiable features of the&#xD;
      care unit work environment, such as Formal Interactions, Informal Interactions, Social&#xD;
      Capital or Slack Time), quality of care providers' work life (e.g., burnout, job&#xD;
      satisfaction, general health) and quality of care. Three feedback packages will be tested to&#xD;
      determine the strategy that is most effective at fostering improvements and is also&#xD;
      cost-effective. The project will be carried out in nursing homes in Alberta and British&#xD;
      Columbia. The information developed will contribute to better care for Canadian seniors who&#xD;
      spend their final years in a nursing home.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to systematically evaluate a tailored intervention targeting&#xD;
      the leaders of clinical microsystems (care units) in residential long term care (nursing home&#xD;
      - NH) settings. The intervention is designed to feedback performance data for improvement.&#xD;
      This project is a key element of a long term program of research (Translating Research in&#xD;
      Elder Care - TREC) focused on advancing knowledge translation science. TREC's goal is to&#xD;
      improve quality of care, and in so doing, improve quality of life for older adults in NHs and&#xD;
      work life for their care providers. TREC specifically focuses on the important role of&#xD;
      organizational context (modifiable elements of the work environment) at the clinical&#xD;
      microsystem (clinical unit) level in NHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate and compare a standard feedback and 2 assisted, goal-directed feedback&#xD;
           strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess sustainability and long term effects of each strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Refine a practical assisted feedback strategy for use in NHs targeting the leaders of&#xD;
           clinical microsystems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pragmatic, three-arm, parallel, cluster-randomized trial; stratified permuted block&#xD;
      randomization; baseline assessment, 1-year intervention period, post-intervention assessment&#xD;
      and 1-year long-term follow up. NHs will be randomly assigned to Standard Feedback (SF),&#xD;
      Basic Assisted Feedback (BAF) or Enhanced Assisted Feedback (EAF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Stratified (region by size by operator) random sample of 67 eligible NHs from four&#xD;
      regions in two provinces: Alberta (Edmonton, Calgary) and British Columbia (Fraser Health,&#xD;
      Interior Health). Facilities participate in a longitudinal observational study (part of TREC)&#xD;
      that generates a rich resident, staff, unit, and facility level database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment: The cohort of 67 NHs is recruited. All sites have agreed to and expect&#xD;
      standard feedback. 22 facilities (60 eligible units) were randomly assigned to SF, 22&#xD;
      facilities (70 eligible units) to BAF, and 23 facilities (73 eligible units) to EAF.&#xD;
      Facilities assigned to BAF or EAF will be approached and offered additional feedback.&#xD;
      Managers will be explained the specific extra feedback (treatment) they will receive, but&#xD;
      they will be blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Target of the intervention are managers of the care units within the NHs. To avoid&#xD;
      contamination effects, randomization will be done at the facility level, with all included&#xD;
      unit managers of the same facility receiving the same feedback intervention. To determine&#xD;
      sample size a computer simulation-based sample size approach was adapted that accounted for&#xD;
      multiple repeated measures in three study arms, and the complex nested structure (time points&#xD;
      nested within each care unit, and units clustered within facilities). Power and sample size&#xD;
      were estimated based on a mixed-effects regression model. Using data from the previous phase&#xD;
      of TREC (2007-2012) the required parameters to be entered into the model were estimated.&#xD;
      Assumptions were that SF will increase the primary outcome (Formal Interactions [FI] score)&#xD;
      by 0.2, BAF will increase the FI score by 0.4, and EAF will increase the FI score by 0.6.&#xD;
      With an assumed power of 0.90, a significance level of 0.05 and an attrition rate of 25%, a&#xD;
      total of 144 care units will be needed (48 NHs with an average number of three units or 72&#xD;
      NHs with an average number of two units).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three groups will receive a face-to-face Dissemination Workshop (feedback of research&#xD;
      data on modifiable aspects of the care unit context). The SF group will receive no additional&#xD;
      intervention. The BAF and EAF arms will receive an additional face-to-face Goal Setting&#xD;
      Workshop and two Support Workshops at six month intervals. Support Workshops will be virtual&#xD;
      in the BAF arm and face-to-face in the EAF arm. In addition the EAF arm will receive&#xD;
      on-demand email and phone support. Feedback will include data about four aspects of&#xD;
      organizational context that are routinely measured in TREC with the validated Alberta Context&#xD;
      Tool (ACT). Four of ten ACT concepts were selected for specific focus: 1) the number of&#xD;
      Formal Interactions (FIs) care aides have with other providers and with patients/families; 2)&#xD;
      the amount of Slack Time care aides have; 3) Evaluation (unit feedback) Practices, and 4)&#xD;
      Social Capital. The intervention is designed to improve performance on these aspects of&#xD;
      context. Intervention target is the clinical microsystem (clinical unit) managerial team&#xD;
      within NHs: unit care managers and the director of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Formal Interactions (FI), defined as formal exchanges through scheduled&#xD;
      activities that can promote the transfer of knowledge (details see outcomes section).&#xD;
      Previous research in TREC (2007-2012) clearly suggested that some context areas on the ACT&#xD;
      have the potential to exert greater impact on quality of care and implementation of change.&#xD;
      Of these, FI has the greatest single impact. At the microsystem level no unit scored above&#xD;
      1.9 (max. possible score is 4) and the mean was 1.3, leaving substantial room for&#xD;
      improvement. The correlation of FI with the overall ACT context score is .5, and combinations&#xD;
      of FI plus three additional ACT concepts (Evaluation, Social Capital, Slack Time) increased&#xD;
      the correlation to .8. Field surveys suggested that care managers are interested in FI as an&#xD;
      actionable concept of facility context and consider it a prime accessible target for action&#xD;
      and change. FI constitutes the most actionable, cost-effective, and easy-to-improve context&#xD;
      for enhancing quality, since the mechanisms for improvement are readily available. FI makes&#xD;
      use of existing resources and requires little investment beyond organizational adaptations&#xD;
      (scheduling training or meeting sessions, developing educational materials to disseminate&#xD;
      research findings, etc.). Finally and importantly, FI is also a proximal goal. The&#xD;
      organizational behavior literature is clear that the goal set cannot be too distal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ACT context measures: Feedback, Social Capital, Organizational Slack - Time&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Staff outcomes: research use, psychological empowerment, job satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Resident outcomes: quality indicators from the Resident Assessment Instrument - Minimum&#xD;
           data Set 2.0 (RAI): worsening pain, declining behavioral symptoms. The RAI is used&#xD;
           internationally for comprehensive geriatric assessment of the health, physical, mental,&#xD;
           and functional status of NH. In Canada its use is mandated in several&#xD;
           provinces/territories, as well as by the Canadian Institute of Health Information for&#xD;
           national reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unit and facility outcomes: response to major near misses, managers' organizational&#xD;
           citizenship behavior, performance reports, quality improvement activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Workshop evaluation surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention protocol checklists to evaluate fidelity of workshop delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Focus groups with managerial teams directly before the first support workshop and one&#xD;
           month before the second support workshop&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cost accounting of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis: To compare the effectiveness of the three feedback interventions in&#xD;
      improving the FI score, mixed-effects regression models will be used. The models will account&#xD;
      for multiple measures within each unit and clustering of units within facilities. All&#xD;
      analyses will be adjusted for the three stratification variables of the TREC facility sample&#xD;
      (region, owner-operator model and facility size). Characteristics of units and facilities&#xD;
      will be compared using descriptive statistics at baseline. Based on this, models will be&#xD;
      adjusted for baseline variables that differ significantly between treatment groups. Data will&#xD;
      be assessed whether they meet the assumptions of this model (multivariate normality,&#xD;
      linearity, normally distributed, uncorrelated residuals, random effects with mean zero) and&#xD;
      models will be adjusted accordingly. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, as this&#xD;
      best reflects the pragmatic nature of the study. These results will be compared to an&#xD;
      as-treated analysis, which better reflects adherence/non-adherence with the intervention.&#xD;
      Reporting of these findings will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials&#xD;
      (CONSORT) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analyses: Change of secondary outcomes (resident outcomes, i.e., RAI quality&#xD;
      indicators, staff outcomes and organizational variables) will be monitored over time in each&#xD;
      study arm, and outcomes will be compared between the three study arms using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, Statistical Process Control methods, and appropriate significance tests (t tests&#xD;
      for normally distributed, linear, continuous outcomes; non-parametric tests for variables&#xD;
      that don't meet these assumptions; chi tests for categorical outcomes). A dichotomous&#xD;
      variable (improved/not improved) will be assigned to each unit in the intervention. Then,&#xD;
      using logistic regression with improvement as the outcome the effects of context (using ACT&#xD;
      scales), best practice use, and staff characteristics on improvement will be investigated. To&#xD;
      this end a reliable classification system for individual control charts was developed.&#xD;

Prevalence of Declining Behavioral Symptoms is one of 13 practice sensitive RAI-MDS 2.0 quality indicators (i.e., modifiable by care staff). It is based on the items E4a - Wandering, E4b - Verbally abusive, E4c - Physically abusive, E4d - Socially inappropriate behaviour, and reflects the percentage of residents who have declining behaviour symptoms. Where 1 or more of the indicators are greater at the target assessment than the prior assessment.</description>

    <description>Managers and directors of care will receive a printed report (tailored to their facility) on their facility's performance and performance of each unit (microsystem) within that facility. The workshop will include a presentation of the feedback reports with a particular focus on the core set of actionable context targets (Formal Interactions, Evaluation, Social Capital, Organizational Slack (OS) - Time) in the face-to-face workshops. Following the presentation, participants will discuss their reports in facilitated, round-table group discussions to a) help with interpretation of the results overall, b) draw attention to elements of context that are modifiable, c) encourage microsystem teams to work on improving the more modifiable areas</description>

    <description>Sessions will build on the dissemination workshops and will be held three months after. Feedback reports on Formal Interactions, Evaluation, Social Capital, and Organizational Slack (OS) - Time will be discussed. Small group activities will take place including: a) reflecting on context data, b) performance goal setting using the 'tell and sell' method, which capitalizes on the workshop leaders' perceived expertise about what goals are achievable, c) establishing a series of proximal learning goals that will provide teams with explicit strategies for attaining performance goals set in (b). An action plan and instructions for reporting back at the Virtual Support Workshop will be provided.</description>
