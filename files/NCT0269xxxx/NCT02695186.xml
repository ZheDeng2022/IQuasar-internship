      Intestinal metaplasia is generally considered a precancerous lesion. Although it is&#xD;
      associated with a very small increase of gastric cancer risk, European Endoscopic Society and&#xD;
      other European academic companies highlighted the increased risk of cancer in patients with&#xD;
      gastric atrophy and IM and the need for staging in cases with high-grade dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of ROS in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and their role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases have not been studied&#xD;
      sufficiently. In the plasma of patients, in the context of the sequence gastro oesophageal&#xD;
      reflux-oesophagitis-metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma, have been found simultaneous&#xD;
      formation of DNA adducts and increased myeloperoxidase concentration, which are associated&#xD;
      with oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant capacity (decreased glutathione&#xD;
      concentration).These findings support the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      malignant transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic Syndrome (MS) has been recognized as a pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulant state&#xD;
      associated with increased levels of C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 6 and&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) 1. It has been reported that the inflammatory and the&#xD;
      pro thrombotic markers, which are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and DM2, represent only a part of the relationship between IM and cardiovascular mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors influence the pathogenesis of MS, as the pro-oxidant condition of such&#xD;
      patients may increase the risk for developing symptoms and related chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      DM2. Although the exact contribution of oxidative stress on every pathologic condition&#xD;
      included in MS is difficult to determine definitively, it is certain that oxidative stress is&#xD;
      particularly high in the MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the relationship between MS and GI diseases, studies have reported that patients&#xD;
      with MS are almost twice at risk for developing Barrett's esophagus.The relationship between&#xD;
      MS, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the development of IM also requires well&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is considered a precancerous lesion and is associated with a very&#xD;
      small increase of gastric cancer risk. Generally there are no widely accepted guidelines on&#xD;
      the IM management. Recently, the European Endoscopic Society and other European academic&#xD;
      companies have developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with IM.&#xD;
      These instructions highlighted the increased risk of cancer in patients with gastric atrophy&#xD;
      and IM and the need for staging in cases with high-grade dysplasia. Risk factors for IM&#xD;
      include infection with Helicobacter pylori, high NaCl intake, smoking, alcohol consumption&#xD;
      and chronic bile reflux. The four steps sequence of the events for the development of the&#xD;
      intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma include: Non-atrophic gastritis, multifocal atrophic&#xD;
      gastritis, IM, and dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as by-products of the normal metabolism of the&#xD;
      cell. ROS are generated in response to ultraviolet radiation, smoking, alcohol, nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories, ischemia-reperfusion, chronic infections and chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorders. Disruption of the normal homeostasis of the cell, due to changes in redox&#xD;
      homeostasis can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases and cancer. The production of ROS in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and their role&#xD;
      in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases have not been studied&#xD;
      sufficiently. Despite the protective barrier provided by the digestive mucosa, different&#xD;
      molecules which may be present in the content of GI,as well as various pathogens can cause&#xD;
      oxidative damage and inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa and the immune cells.&#xD;
      Pathogenesis of various GI diseases, including ulcerative lesions, cancer, and inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel diseases are attributable in part to oxidative stress. In the plasma of patients, in&#xD;
      the context of the sequence gastro oesophageal&#xD;
      reflux-oesophagitis-metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma, have been found simultaneous&#xD;
      formation of DNA adducts and increased myeloperoxidase concentration, which are associated&#xD;
      with oxidative stress, decreased antioxidant capacity (decreased glutathione&#xD;
      concentration).These findings support the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      malignant transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, since chronic inflammation has been recognized as an important risk factor&#xD;
      for the development of GI tumors, the underlying molecular mechanisms have been studied&#xD;
      extensively. Chronic inflammation may induce cell mutations and promote malignant&#xD;
      transformation in normal cells of the GI mucosa. The inflammatory reaction generated during&#xD;
      carcinogenesis involves the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS)&#xD;
      derived from mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes, as well as the development of immune&#xD;
      response, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is&#xD;
      considered as the main mediator of the immune response. The activation of NF-κB through&#xD;
      phosphorylation leads to translocation of NF-κB in the nucleus, where regulates the&#xD;
      transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation can create the appropriate conditions for genomic and epigenetic changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is associated with insulin resistance in the&#xD;
      peripheral tissues and abnormal fatty acid metabolism, often leading to type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM2) development. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemia and cytokine&#xD;
      production by adipocytes (adipokines) can also result in endothelial dysfunction, disorders&#xD;
      of the lipid profile, hypertension and vascular inflammation, which promote the development&#xD;
      of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In patients with coexistence of metabolic risk&#xD;
      factors for DM2 and cardiovascular disease (abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia&#xD;
      and hypertension) suggested the existence of &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot;. Metabolic Syndrome (MS)&#xD;
      has been recognized as a pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulant state associated with increased&#xD;
      levels of C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL) 6 and plasminogen activator inhibitor&#xD;
      (PAI) 1. It has been reported that the inflammatory and the pro thrombotic markers, which are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and DM2, represent only a part of&#xD;
      the relationship between IM and cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, no causal relationship&#xD;
      between increased levels of CRP levels and MS incidence has been found. The value of several&#xD;
      markers for the monitoring of patients with MS remain uncertain.The use of these markers&#xD;
      should be made for clinical purposes only, with respect to the determination of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk assessment. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) emphasize that the analysis of CRP still belongs to the optional tests,&#xD;
      because the power as an independent predictive remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors influence the pathogenesis of MS, as the pro-oxidant condition of such&#xD;
      patients may increase the risk for developing symptoms and related chronic diseases such as&#xD;
      DM2. The reduction of antioxidant capacity in individuals with IM can be explained by the&#xD;
      concomitant overproduction of ROS and their metabolites (d-ROMS), the decreased activity of&#xD;
      the enzymes that neutralize ROS (SOD, CAT and GPx) and reduction of other antioxidant&#xD;
      systems, such as PON1 activity. Recently, γGT has been suggested as a promising biomarker for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of MS, and its levels in serum may reflect the response to oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the correlation between the SOD and the various active moieties in MS may indicate&#xD;
      that the SOD activity could be a better biomarker of oxidative stress in these patients. The&#xD;
      measurement of the SOD activity could be used as a predictive tool for determining the extent&#xD;
      of the underlying oxidative stress in the disease. These findings suggest that the study of&#xD;
      the oxidative state in the earlier phases of MS may be the starting point for understanding&#xD;
      the pathways that contribute to the progress of the MS and its subsequent complications.&#xD;
      Although the exact contribution of oxidative stress on every pathologic condition included in&#xD;
      MS is difficult to determine definitively, it is certain that oxidative stress is&#xD;
      particularly high in the MS. It seems that increased oxidative stress is the main mechanism&#xD;
      behind the increased tendency to develop cardiovascular disease, greater severity of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in younger people and poorer treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the relationship between MS and GI diseases, studies have reported that patients&#xD;
      with MS are almost twice at risk for developing Barrett's esophagus. If these findings will&#xD;
      be confirmed in prospective studies, patients with MS could form a high-risk group for&#xD;
      developing Barett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The prevalence of MS concerning&#xD;
      the development of Barett's esophagus and particularly the relationship between the length of&#xD;
      damage and changes in the levels of leptin, insulin and proinflammatory markers, indicate&#xD;
      that the changes caused by the development of Barrett's esophagus are constant and are&#xD;
      affected by metabolic changes caused by adipokines and cytokines. The relationship between&#xD;
      MS, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the development of IM also requires well&#xD;
      designed prospective studies. It seems however, to be a correlation between obesity and GERD,&#xD;
      as well as between obesity and gastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
