    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). An externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to&#xD;
      the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver (the Device). Preliminary research suggests that&#xD;
      the Device has the potential to reduce the likelihood of TBI. The currently developed collar&#xD;
      has been approved for studies in humans and the results indicate safety for use during high&#xD;
      demand and maximal exertion activities, This study will investigate the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      device in high school athletes playing a collision sport such as football. The use of helmets&#xD;
      during such a high-risk sport will allow for collision measurement devices to be embedded in&#xD;
      the helmet and will not affect play or fit of equipment. Athletes participating in this study&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Device wearing during the season or 2)&#xD;
      Non-device wearing during the season. The helmets of all participants will be outfitted with&#xD;
      an accelerometer which will measure the magnitude of every impact to the head sustained by&#xD;
      the athlete. Effectiveness of the device will be determined via differences in longitudinal&#xD;
      brain imaging and functional testing following competitive football participation. A subset&#xD;
      of athletes who report a diagnosed concussion will also receive additional brain&#xD;
      neuroanatomical and neurophysiological testing within a week following the diagnosed&#xD;
      concussive event. The purpose of the study is to monitor longitudinal changes in brain&#xD;
      structure and function between the preseason and postseason, in a population of football&#xD;
      playing athletes wearing the Device and compared to a similar population not wearing the&#xD;
      device. Secondly, the purpose is to determine the protection of the device relative to amount&#xD;
      and magnitude of sustained head impacts.&#xD;

      The Device has the promise of providing a novel mechanism for reducing or preventing the&#xD;
      likelihood of TBI, and may be used in conjunction with other protective equipment. TBI is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in individuals under age 45. The cost of TBI in the U.S. is estimated&#xD;
      at anywhere from $50 to $150 billion, annually. The January, 2008 New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine reports, &quot;Head and neck injuries, including severe brain trauma, have been reported&#xD;
      in one quarter of service members who have been evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan&quot;. The&#xD;
      vast majority of these injuries have resulted from exposure to improvised explosive device&#xD;
      (IED) blast waves. Head injuries, concussions and the resulting trauma have been in public&#xD;
      discussion recently as the National Football League (NFL) deals with a lawsuit regarding head&#xD;
      injuries by about one-third of living former NFL players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to NASA, &quot;The oscillation of a fluid caused by an external force, called sloshing,&#xD;
      occurs in moving vehicles containing liquid masses, such as trucks, etc.&quot; This oscillation&#xD;
      occurs when a vessel is only partially filled. It is hypothesized that the brain faces&#xD;
      similar slosh energy absorption during external force impartation. Slosh permits external&#xD;
      energies to be absorbed by the contents of a partially filled vessel or container by means of&#xD;
      inelastic collisions. Tissues of differing densities can decelerate at different rates&#xD;
      creating shear and cavitation. If the collisions between objects or molecules are elastic,&#xD;
      the transfer of energies to those objects diminishes, minimizing the energies imparted by&#xD;
      slosh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Woodpeckers, head ramming sheep and all mammals (including humans) have small, little known&#xD;
      and misunderstood muscles in their necks called the omohyoid muscles. Highly G-tolerant&#xD;
      creatures of the forest have utilized these muscles to gently restrict outflow of the&#xD;
      internal jugular veins thereby &quot;taking up&quot; the excess compliance of the cranial space and&#xD;
      ultimately protecting themselves from TBI like tiny &quot;airbags&quot; in a motor vehicle. Rat studies&#xD;
      by have demonstrated that we can easily and safely facilitate this muscle's actions by a&#xD;
      well-engineered gentle compression over those muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical Queckenstedt Maneuver devised to detect spinal cord compression, gently places&#xD;
      pressure over the external jugular veins to increase cerebral spinal volume and pressure. In&#xD;
      this maneuver, the veins are compressed while a lumbar puncture monitors the intracranial&#xD;
      pressure. &quot;Normally, the pressure rise to the higher 'plateau' level occurs instantly upon&#xD;
      jugular compression to fall again equally fast upon release of the compression&quot;. This&#xD;
      incredibly simple principle can be employed to protect soldiers and athletes from TBI by&#xD;
      safely, and reversibly, increasing intracranial volume and pressure. The neck collar device&#xD;
      is made of Outer collar - hytrel (thermoplastic elastomer), Inner collar - TPSiV&#xD;
      (thermoplastic elastomer), metal insert (stainless steel), and is fitted to the neck to&#xD;
      provide a comfortable and precise jugular compression that potentially mitigates cerebral&#xD;
      slosh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the skull, blood, and brain are &quot;almost incompressible,&quot; the vasculature tree of the&#xD;
      cerebrum is quite reactive and compressible. As volume is added to the cranium, eventually&#xD;
      the compensatory reserve volume is surpassed and the intracranial pressure increases&#xD;
      slightly. Increasing cerebral blood volume by just 1-3% safely and reversibly reduces&#xD;
      compliance of the cerebral vascular tree and diminishes absorption of slosh energies. Jugular&#xD;
      compression increases cerebral blood volume almost instantaneously. As mentioned, this degree&#xD;
      of increase has significantly mitigated slosh and TBI in laboratory animals and mimics the&#xD;
      highly concussion resistant wild animals that are able to reflexively increase cerebral blood&#xD;
      volume through natural jugular compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A landmark article, published in the Journal of Neurosurgery, used a standard&#xD;
      acceleration-deceleration impact laboratory model of mild TBI. The study showed a successful&#xD;
      and marked reduction of axonal injury following Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) compression as&#xD;
      indicated by immunohistochemical staining of Amyloid Precursor Proteins (APP). It is argued&#xD;
      that IJV compression reduces slosh-mediated brain injury by increasing intracranial blood&#xD;
      volume and reducing the compliance and potential for brain movement within the confines of&#xD;
      the skull. The potential for such technique to mitigate both linear and rotational brain&#xD;
      injury in humans by &quot;internal protection&quot; represents the most novel approach to mitigating&#xD;
      TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project will be designed following a prospective longitudinal study design. All&#xD;
      MRI scanning will be performed on a 3 Tesla Philips Achieva MRI scanner located in Imaging&#xD;
      Research Center (IRC) in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Research Foundation (CCHRF).&#xD;
      Sedation will not be used for any of the test visits. The entire MRI series, including&#xD;
      anatomical imaging, DTI, resting state fMRI, SWI, HARDI, ASL and BOLD will be completed in 65&#xD;
      minutes or less (see Table 1 for detailed specifications). All functional and neurocognitive&#xD;
      testing will be performed at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Human Performance Laboratory.&#xD;
