      Exercise adoption enhances well-being and recovery from breast cancer. Researchers trained&#xD;
      American Cancer Society volunteers to provide exercise counseling to breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      and the survivors increased their exercise in the short-term. This RCT examines the effects&#xD;
      of three maintenance conditions on survivors' exercise participation at longer follow-ups.&#xD;
      The cost-effectiveness of the three groups will be examined to guide implementation of this&#xD;
      peer mentoring approach in community-based organizations.&#xD;

      The current study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), represents the next step of the&#xD;
      efforts to to extend the research on physical activity to the community setting; community&#xD;
      volunteers will deliver the intervention, thereby making physical activity interventions much&#xD;
      more accessible to survivors. In partnership with the National American Cancer Society office&#xD;
      (Atlanta, GA) and Reach To Recovery (RTR) programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, and&#xD;
      Georgia, researchers at the University of South Carolina's College of Nursing will share&#xD;
      skills, experience and resources to examine the effects of RTR coaches offering a&#xD;
      theoretically-based 3-month exercise program among 150 breast cancer survivors to increase&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) followed by self-monitoring (i.e. exercise&#xD;
      logs) and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus), monthly phone calls from RTR coaches,&#xD;
      self monitoring and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus Message) or weekly email/text&#xD;
      messages, self-monitoring and feedback reports in Months 4-9 (Reach Plus Message). In this&#xD;
      three group study, researchers will assess survivors' exercise, fatigue, mood, quality of&#xD;
      life, and self-reported physical functioning at baseline, 3, 9 and 12 months. The costs of&#xD;
      the methods vary and data on costs will be collected to guide the selection of maintenance&#xD;
      strategies for dissemination. If the results are promising, researchers will proceed with a&#xD;
      dissemination trial wherein the large network of RTR volunteers can expand the scope of their&#xD;
      services to benefit breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
