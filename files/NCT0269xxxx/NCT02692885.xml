      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body uses energy from calories for basic functions like breathing and digesting food.&#xD;
      Over time, when a person eats more calories than they burn, they may become overweight or&#xD;
      obese. Obesity is a major health concern. Researchers want to look at fat and muscle tissue&#xD;
      to learn more about metabolism. That is how the body uses food and other nutrients for normal&#xD;
      function and energy. This research may help to develop new treatments for obesity and related&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the role of fat and muscle in metabolism, particularly how fat and muscle&#xD;
      store and use energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 years and older who have a planned surgery at NIH in which tissue can be collected&#xD;
      by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by their regular NIH doctor. Then researchers will contact them&#xD;
      about this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not have to make extra visits to NIH for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect samples during the participant s surgery. These will be fat tissue&#xD;
      and skeletal muscle tissue. Muscle tissue will only be taken from tissue that is going to be&#xD;
      discarded. Collecting the tissue will not add any time or any extra incisions than what is&#xD;
      required for the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, blood will be drawn. Some participants will have this done in the pre-op or&#xD;
      post-op room. Others will have this done during their hospital stay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      More than ever before, people are eating more calories from food than what they are burning&#xD;
      off through exercise and other activities, and this imbalance is causing the rising rates of&#xD;
      obesity and diabetes in the US and throughout the world. The different types of body fat are&#xD;
      central players in this process. The white fat stores excess calories coming from food, while&#xD;
      brown fat - also known as brown adipose tissue, or BAT - consumes the energy from food to&#xD;
      generate heat. This important process in BAT is achieved through the action of a special&#xD;
      protein found only in BAT, called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Scientists used to believe&#xD;
      that BAT was important only in small animals and human infants, but it was recently&#xD;
      discovered by us and others that in response to mild cold exposure, adult human BAT (hBAT)&#xD;
      consumes more glucose by weight than any other tissue. In addition, human BAT may also combat&#xD;
      weight gain by becoming more active in the setting of increased food consumption. This&#xD;
      phenomenon has already been demonstrated in mice and rats, and its presence suggests that&#xD;
      activation of human BAT could be used as a safe treatment for obesity and metabolic disease.&#xD;
      Finally, emerging evidence indicates that human BAT may be an endocrine organ, which means&#xD;
      that it releases hormones into the blood and regulates other organs of the body as well,&#xD;
      including skeletal muscle, liver, and the insulin-releasing pancreatic Beta-cell. If we are&#xD;
      going to understand how hBAT functions in the body physiology and use its calorie-burning&#xD;
      ability to treat illnesses of metabolism such as diabetes, we will need to approach the&#xD;
      challenge using several different methods. One key reason is that BAT is not easy to find in&#xD;
      the body, and the cells that make it up are different depending on where they are and what&#xD;
      the body needs. Brown fat is composed of at least two known types of distinct cells, termed&#xD;
      &quot;constitutive&quot;/brown and &quot;inducible&quot;/beige; and there are also white fat cells in varying&#xD;
      proportions. Given that there is currently no known way to estimate the amount of brown fat&#xD;
      in the body from a simple blood test, our lab group has successfully relied on collecting&#xD;
      small amounts of fat from the site of surgery in patients who are already undergoing&#xD;
      clinically indicated procedures. Information obtained from these fat tissues has addressed&#xD;
      questions related to (a) how brown fat cells develop from immature stem cells; (b) what genes&#xD;
      are active; and (c) how many calories the brown fat can burn. These earlier studies have also&#xD;
      provided the preliminary cells necessary for establishing long-lasting human brown and white&#xD;
      cells that can be grown indefinitely in the laboratory. Despite this progress, much remains&#xD;
      unknown about the functional differences between brown and beige fat cells and how these&#xD;
      could affect metabolism in humans of different age, sex, and genetic backgrounds, as well as&#xD;
      the changes seen in the brown fat cells in different illnesses. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      address these and related questions.&#xD;
