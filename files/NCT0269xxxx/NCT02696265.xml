      Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ablation of&#xD;
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) drivers marked by spatiotemporal dispersions and Complex&#xD;
      Fractionated Atrial Electrocardiograms (CFAEs) to Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) based&#xD;
      ablation in patients with persistent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CFAE/spatiotemporal dispersion guided ablation will increase AF free survival&#xD;
      compared to a PVI guided ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: Patients with persistent AF will be randomized based on a 2:1 ratio into&#xD;
      one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CFAE/spatiotemporal dispersion guided ablation: CFAE mapping and ablation during AF&#xD;
           aimed at restoring sinus rhythm during ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter&#xD;
           control of pulmonary vein signals&#xD;

      Design: A prospective, multicenter, randomized unblinded clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ablation of AF&#xD;
      drivers marked by spatiotemporal dispersions and CFAEs guided ablation to PVI guided ablation&#xD;
      in patients with persistent AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CFAE/spatiotemporal dispersion guided ablation will increase AF free survival&#xD;
      compared to a PVI guided ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: 120 patients will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Sites: International (including non EU-countries), multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: Patients with persistent AF (defined as atrial fibrillation which is&#xD;
      sustained beyond 7 days but no more than one year, or lasting less than 7 days but&#xD;
      necessitating pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, but lasting longer than 48 hours)&#xD;
      should be documented either on 12-lead ECG, transtelephonic monitoring (TTM), ambulatory&#xD;
      holter monitoring (HM) or telemetry strip and a physician's note showing continuous AF.&#xD;
      Furthermore patients who have failed at least one Anti Arrhythmic Drug (AAD) (Class I or III)&#xD;
      as evidenced by recurrent symptomatic AF or intolerable side effects of the AAD. Eligible&#xD;
      patients who sign the study informed consent form will be randomized based on a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      into one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CFAE/spatiotemporal guided ablation: CFAE/spatiotemporal dispersion mapping and ablation&#xD;
           during AF aimed at restoring sinus rhythm during ablation. Pulmonal vein isolation will&#xD;
           be checked before and after ablation using a mapping catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVI guided ablation: wide antral pulmonary vein isolation during mapping catheter&#xD;
           control of pulmonary vein signals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Freedom from recorded AF or atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia&#xD;
      recurrences (&gt;30 seconds) without the use of AADs through 18 months follow-up, post-blanking,&#xD;
      on either a 12 lead ECG on visits or on 24 hour holter monitoring or on symptom driven event&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFAE/spatiotemporal dispersions procedural details: To increase the accuracy of CFAE mapping,&#xD;
      the Pentaray mapping catheter will be used to define spatiotemporal dispersion areas of CFAEs&#xD;
      as specific targets of ablation as described by Seitz (see also citation) as follows.&#xD;
      Dispersion areas are defined as clusters of electrograms, either fractionated or&#xD;
      non-fractionated, that display interelectrode time and space dispersion at a minimum of 3&#xD;
      adjacent bipoles such that activation spread over all the AFCL. At each bipole in a&#xD;
      dispersion area, one or more of the following fractionated or nonfractionated electrogram&#xD;
      morphologies can be found:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. continuous, low-voltage fractionated electrograms (&quot;continuously fractionated signal&quot;);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. bursts of fractionated electrograms (&quot;trains of fractionation&quot;);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. fast nonfractionated electrograms (AFCL &lt;120 ms; &quot;rapid fires&quot;); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. slow nonfractionated electrograms (AFCL &gt;120 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multipolar electrogram dispersion and non-dispersion regions, illustrate that fractionated&#xD;
      electrograms are found in both dispersion and non-dispersion regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFAE software can be used, but CFAE ablation is not guided by the software, but based on&#xD;
      visual judgement. Preferably a CFAE map will be made before ablation to judge the sites of&#xD;
      most extensive CFAE sites. Baseline mapping in both atria will be performed during AF with&#xD;
      the PentaRay multispline catheter sequentially positioned in various regions of the RA and&#xD;
      LA. At each location, the catheter will be maintained in a stable position for a minimum of&#xD;
      2.5 s. The operator will look for dispersion areas (electrograms exhibiting both time and&#xD;
      spatial dispersion). Where dispersion are found and/or the catheter is not stable for 2.5 s,&#xD;
      acquisitions will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional risks: No additional risks are anticipated for patients enrolled in this study&#xD;
      compared to patients undergoing ablation of symptomatic AF outside of the study, because the&#xD;
      same catheter is used as in patients outside the study, and both methods (PVI and CFAE) are&#xD;
      part of daily practice. Although none reported in the literature so far, CFAE ablation may&#xD;
      cause more extensive lesions than other ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      especially in the posterior wall. This in turn may cause pericardial effusion, myocardial&#xD;
      rupture and atrio-esophageal fistula. All of these are potentially life threatening. However,&#xD;
      energy settings are changed according to myocardial wall size and pressure recordings, in&#xD;
      order to prevent these complications. Furthermore, also in the group of wide antral ablation,&#xD;
      the posterior wall is targeted, possibly resulting in the same events. For prevention of&#xD;
      posterior wall injury, temperature monitoring in the oesofagus may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombus formation is a complication that can occur with any ablation technique. Thrombi may&#xD;
      dislodge and embolize, causing a stroke, myocardial infarction or other ischemic event.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is required that activated clotting time (ACT) is kept above 300 seconds. This&#xD;
      should be monitored every 30 minutes, and heparin should be administered depending on the&#xD;
      outcome. The operator is responsible for maintaining an adequate ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation exposure during the fluoroscopic imaging of the catheters may result in an increase&#xD;
      in the lifetime risk of developing a fatal malignancy (0.1%) or a genetic defect in offspring&#xD;
      (0.002%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefit: The direct benefit for patients undergoing ablation is the potential&#xD;
      elimination of AF episodes. It is furthermore expected that quality of life will improve and&#xD;
      less frequent hospitalization will be needed. Whether further morbidity as cerebral vascular&#xD;
      events are prevented is subject to discussion. The information gained from the conduct of&#xD;
      this study may benefit patients with AF by improving future treatment modalities.&#xD;
