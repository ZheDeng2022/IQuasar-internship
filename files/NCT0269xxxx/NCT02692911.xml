      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gallbladder is a small organ below the liver. Gallbladder cancer is a leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death among women in Chile. Chile also has among the highest rates of gallbladder&#xD;
      cancer and death in the world. Researchers in a high-risk region of Chile want to find out&#xD;
      more about this type of cancer. They especially want to know how inflammation affects the way&#xD;
      it develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the causes of gallbladder diseases and factors that may be associated&#xD;
      with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women ages 50 74 with gallbladder cancer who are covered by the Chilean national health&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other people over age 21 with gallbladder disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults over age 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be screened with an ultrasound. They may be asked questions about their&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an ultrasound of the abdomen. This can be done at the study clinic or&#xD;
      in the hospital or at home. The ultrasound uses sound waves to take pictures of the&#xD;
      gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their mouths looked at for tooth loss, dentures, and gum redness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample or saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked for access to their medical history. They may be asked to allow&#xD;
      researchers to keep any samples taken during gallbladder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their medical history. This will include illnesses,&#xD;
      surgeries, medicine use, and family history. It will also include diet and lifestyle habits,&#xD;
      such as places where they have lived and worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have 3 follow-up visits over 6 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gallbladder cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women in Chile, which has among&#xD;
      the highest reported gallbladder cancer incidence and mortality rates in the world.&#xD;
      Gallbladder cancer provides a particularly good model for understanding the role of&#xD;
      inflammation in carcinogenesis since the major risk factor, gallstones, causes substantial&#xD;
      inflammation in the gallbladder. Chile also has a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, which are increasingly understood as inflammatory disorders, but the&#xD;
      extent to which their carcinogenic effects are mediated through inflammatory pathways is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the vast majority of gallbladder cancer cases have gallstones, only a small fraction of&#xD;
      gallstone patients ever develop gallbladder cancer. Since there is no way to identify this&#xD;
      small proportion at risk, gallstone cases are cholecystectomized, which, given large absolute&#xD;
      numbers of individuals with gallstones, results in overtreatment of some and under-treatment&#xD;
      of others in a high-risk area like Chile. While cholecystectomy is standard treatment for&#xD;
      symptomatic relief, there are more people who need surgery than there are surgeons to perform&#xD;
      them, and individuals aged 34-49 are prioritized for treatment, regardless of symptoms. This&#xD;
      practice may lead to overtreatment among 34-49-year-olds and under treatment of individuals&#xD;
      aged 50 and above since they have to wait longer for surgery. At the same time, about 30% of&#xD;
      patients with a biliary colic attack will never have another attack, and cholecystectomy does&#xD;
      not always lead to the cessation of symptoms. In addition, cholecystectomy has been&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of other digestive diseases. Thus, cholecystectomy may not&#xD;
      be needed in all gallstone patients and may in fact increase the risk of cancer in some.&#xD;
      Better predictors of risk are clearly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with other cancers, dysplasia is an important epidemiologic endpoint as the immediate&#xD;
      precursor to cancer since the vast majority of gallbladder cancers develop through a&#xD;
      histologic continuum of chronic cholecystitis, pseudopyloric metaplasia, incomplete&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer. Thus, our aim is to identify risk factors for&#xD;
      gallbladder dysplasia and cancer (GDC) and potential non-invasive risk stratification&#xD;
      methods, such as ultrasound characteristics alone or in combination with inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and patient characteristics, to better understand the etiology and natural history of GDC and&#xD;
      to help inform strategies for GDC prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together with collaborators at Pontifica Universidad Catolica (PUC), we successfully&#xD;
      completed a pilot study in Chile that was previously reviewed and approved by SAG and&#xD;
      provided baseline data for the proposed study. Our pilot demonstrated high recruitment rates&#xD;
      in the target enrollment area (80%) and high rates of questionnaire completion (100%), blood&#xD;
      collection (78% population-based controls), and participant retention (93% of eligible&#xD;
      completed a follow-up visit). Information from the pilot was used to optimize procedures for&#xD;
      the longitudinal study. We also found that both gallstones and gallbladder cancer were&#xD;
      associated with systemic immune alterations, which as we previously demonstrated, reflect&#xD;
      inflammatory changes in the gallbladder detectable in bile. The next step is to demonstrate&#xD;
      that these markers precede GDC by longitudinally measuring their levels among gallstone&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to prospectively assess risk factors and early detection markers for GDC by&#xD;
      conducting the Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (BiLS), a cohort study of 6250 individuals&#xD;
      with gallstones from the high- risk southern-central region of Chile. Because women are twice&#xD;
      as likely to have gallstones and twice as likely to have gallbladder cancer as men, we plan&#xD;
      to maximize our screening efficiency and number of outcomes by screening and enrolling women&#xD;
      only. This approach is reasonable given that the female gender bias for gallbladder cancer is&#xD;
      largely thought to be due to the gender bias for gallstones,1-3 suggesting that in the&#xD;
      presence of gallstones, the risk of gallbladder cancer is the same for men and women. In&#xD;
      addition, Chile is conducting a general population cohort in a small town in the high-risk&#xD;
      area, and we can use the men with gallstones enrolled by the Chilean study to compare to the&#xD;
      women in our study. We plan to enroll women with gallstones over 2 years and follow them for&#xD;
      6 years, conducting visits every other year to collect data on the primary exposures of&#xD;
      interest, inflammatory markers and ultrasound characteristics, as well as additional&#xD;
      exposures of interest, such as infections, genetics, and environmental exposures (e.g.,&#xD;
      aflatoxin, pesticides).&#xD;

        Subject identification will begin with a census of the target neighborhoods in Chile in the&#xD;
        study areas. Potential participants will be contacted by study staff (healthcare&#xD;
        assistants), who will conduct home visits. If participant is eligible, study staff will&#xD;
        invite the individual to participate and obtain written informed consent. She will then&#xD;
        schedule an appointment at the study center for the screening ultrasound and give her the&#xD;
        instructions to prepare for the examination.&#xD;
