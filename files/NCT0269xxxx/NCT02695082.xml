      To compare, by insulin use at the index date, the incidence of hospitalization for acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are new users of&#xD;
      dapagliflozin with those who are new users of antidiabetic drugs (ADs) in classes other than&#xD;
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, insulin monotherapy, metformin&#xD;
      monotherapy, or sulfonylurea monotherapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The overall goal of this research study is to estimate the risk of hospitalization for acute&#xD;
      kidney injury in patients who are prescribed dapagliflozin compared to patients prescribed&#xD;
      other specific oral antidiabetic drugs. Dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic drugs are used&#xD;
      to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because of the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin and&#xD;
      results from small safety monitoring studies, there is interest in further evaluating the&#xD;
      safety of dapagliflozin in large populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented in three administrative health care data sources in two&#xD;
      countries: in the United Kingdom, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); and in the&#xD;
      United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare databases and&#xD;
      the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM). Individuals in the databases will be&#xD;
      included in the study if they meet the following age criteria; 18 years and older (CPRD and&#xD;
      HIRD), or 65 years or older (Medicare); and if they did not have type 1 diabetes, are new&#xD;
      users of one of the study drugs and meet the criteria of at least 180 days of electronic data&#xD;
      before their first prescription of the study drug. The study period starts July 1, 2013 in&#xD;
      CPRD, January 1, 2014 in PHARMO and January 9, 2014 in the United States data sources, and&#xD;
      will end at the latest available data at each database at the time of analysis.&#xD;

        Patients will be eligible for inclusion in this study if they are newly prescribed&#xD;
        dapagliflozin and meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.For each&#xD;
        dapagliflozin user up to four controls will be matched. Patients with a history of diabetic&#xD;
        nephropathy will be included, and this history will be accounted for in the analysis.&#xD;
