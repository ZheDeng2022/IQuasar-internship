    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to identify predictors of success in the treatment of obesity&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery. The specific aims of this proposal are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Employ behavioral tests of mechanisms that control food intake in normal weight&#xD;
           individuals, to determine which intake control mechanisms lead to changes after&#xD;
           Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measure behavioral and psycho-social predictors of weight loss and food intake&#xD;
           reduction, so as to determine which are most predictive of successful weight loss and&#xD;
           food intake reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Account for success in reduction of food intake brought about by the pattern of hormone&#xD;
           release, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Peptide YY (PYY) and gastric&#xD;
           distention, known to underlie satiation, coupled with post-ingestive changes in&#xD;
           reinforcing value of food and motivation to consume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of the hypothesis will be done by measuring responses to tasting, working for, and&#xD;
      consuming, foods on sensory, motivational, cognitive, and physiological variables, including&#xD;
      amount consumed and rate of eating under standardized conditions, before surgery and at a two&#xD;
      year follow up visit. In addition, the inhibitor sitagliptin will be administered the night&#xD;
      before and day of test meal and exendin-9-39 (EX9) will be infused before and during the meal&#xD;
      to determine whether blockade of GLP-1 / PYY receptors after surgery reverses intake&#xD;
      reduction. Investigators predict that successful patients will show changes that favor&#xD;
      reduction in food intake, rate of eating, motivation to consume, reward value of foods, and a&#xD;
      hormone profile that has been shown to generate satiation and maintain reduction in intake&#xD;
      (e.g. increased Cholecystokinin (CCK), GLP-1, PYY, reduced ghrelin). To the extent that&#xD;
      psycho-social and cognitive factors may override physiological brakes to eating behavior, the&#xD;
      subjects may fail to achieve success, and consequently the failure may be predicted from&#xD;
      over-impulsiveness or inability to suppress working for rewarding food stimuli. To test these&#xD;
      hypotheses, a total of 83 patients will be enrolled prior to RYGB/SG and restudied 2 years&#xD;
      after the surgery. The sitagliptin / EX9 studies will be done in a subset of 32 completers.&#xD;
      To test this aim, patients will be divided into 4 groups of 19. The 4 patients from each&#xD;
      group with the most weight loss (% weight loss ≥35 at 2 years post-surgery, 16 patients in&#xD;
      total) and least weight loss (% weight loss of ≤25 at two years 16 patients in total) will be&#xD;
      recruited for these two additional post-operative visits within one year of completing Visit&#xD;
      #3 after the RYGB/SG surgery. A total of 32 patients will be recruited for visits 4 and 5.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health as well as economic (expense of treating) problem&#xD;
      world-wide, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) surgeries are&#xD;
      effective treatments. A barrier to progress is that between 25% and 40% patients were not&#xD;
      successful in achieving and maintaining at least 30% weight loss, which is considered&#xD;
      medically successful for this operation. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to&#xD;
      success or failure of this operation is an unsolved problem in obesity research, which this&#xD;
      proposal is addressing. The focus of this project is to identify mechanisms that contribute&#xD;
      to suppression of food intake following bariatric surgery, and to investigate whether these&#xD;
      mechanisms predict long-term success following bariatric surgery&#xD;
