  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukodystrophies, and other heritable disorders of the white matter of the brain, were&#xD;
      previously resistant to genetic characterization, largely due to the extreme genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity of molecular causes. While recent work has demonstrated that whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing (WGS), has the potential to dramatically increase diagnostic efficiency,&#xD;
      significant questions remain around the impact on downstream clinical management approaches&#xD;
      versus standard diagnostic approaches.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukodystrophies are a group of approximately 30 genetic diseases that primarily affect the&#xD;
      white matter of the brain, a complex structure composed of axons sheathed in myelin, a glial&#xD;
      cell-derived lipid-rich membrane. Leukodystrophies are frequently characterized by early&#xD;
      onset, spasticity and developmental delay, and are degenerative in nature. As a whole,&#xD;
      leukodystrophies are relatively common (approximately 1 in 7000 births or almost twice as&#xD;
      prevalent as Prader-Willi Syndrome, which has been far more extensively studied) with high&#xD;
      associated health-care costs; however, more than half of the suspected leukodystrophies do&#xD;
      not have a definitive diagnosis, and are generally classified as &quot;leukodystrophies of unknown&#xD;
      etiology&quot;. Even when a diagnosis is achieved, the diagnostic process lasts an average of&#xD;
      eight years and results in test expenses in excess of $8,000 on average per patient,&#xD;
      including the majority of patients who never achieve a diagnosis at all. These diagnostic&#xD;
      challenges represent an urgent and unresolved gap in knowledge and disease characterization,&#xD;
      as obtaining a definitive diagnosis is of paramount importance for leukodystrophy patients.&#xD;
      The diagnostic workup begins with findings on cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      followed by sequential targeted genetic testing, however next generation sequencing&#xD;
      technologies (NGS) offer the promise of rapid and more cost effective approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant advances in diagnostic efficacy, there are still significant issues with&#xD;
      respect to implementation of NGS in clinical settings. First, sample cohorts demonstrating&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy are generally small, retrospective, and susceptible to ascertainment&#xD;
      bias, ultimately rendering them poor candidates for utility analyses (to determine how&#xD;
      efficient a test is at producing a diagnosis). Second, historic sample cohorts have not been&#xD;
      examined prospectively for information about impact on clinical management (whether the test&#xD;
      results in different clinical monitoring, a change in medications, or alternate clinical&#xD;
      interventions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these issues, the study team conducted an investigation of patients with suspected&#xD;
      leukodystrophies or other genetic disorders affecting the white matter of the brain at the&#xD;
      time of initial confirmation of MRI abnormalities, with prospective collection of patients&#xD;
      randomly received on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis from a network of expert clinical&#xD;
      sites. Subjects were randomized to receive early (1 month) or late (6 months) WGS, with SoC&#xD;
      clinical analyses conducted alongside WGS testing. An interim analysis performed in May 2018&#xD;
      assessed these study outcomes for a cohort of thirty-four (34) enrolled subjects. Two of&#xD;
      these subjects were resolved before complete enrollment and were retained as controls. Nine&#xD;
      subjects were stratified to the Immediate Arm, of which 5 (55.6%) were resolved by WGS and 4&#xD;
      (44.4%) were persistently unresolved. Of the 23 subjects randomized to the Delayed Arm, 14&#xD;
      (60.9%) were resolved by WGS and 5 (21.7%) by SoC, while the remaining 4 (17.4%) remained&#xD;
      undiagnosed. The diagnostic efficacy of WGS in both arms was significant relative to SoC&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate WGS group&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05). The overall diagnostic efficacy of the combination of WGS and SoC approaches was&#xD;
      26/34 (76.5%; 95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%) over &lt;4 months, greater than historical norms of &lt;50%&#xD;
      over more than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study now seeks to determine whether WGS results in changes to clinical management in&#xD;
      subjects affected by undiagnosed genetic disorders of the white matter of the brain relative&#xD;
      to standard diagnostic approaches. We anticipate that WGS will produce measurable downstream&#xD;
      changes in clinical management, as defined by disease-specific screening for complications or&#xD;
      implementation of disease-specific therapeutic approaches.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate changes in clinical management between the study cohort, who will undergo whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of clinical care, and a historical cohort of patients whose diagnoses were established using standard (i.e. non-WGS) diagnostic approaches. Differences in clinical management will be measured at six months following disclosure of results.</description>

        We expect participants to be identified during their initial presentation and preliminary&#xD;
        diagnostic workup. Leukodystrophies are heritable conditions that - with only few&#xD;
        exceptions - are not gender-specific. We therefore expect males and females to be equally&#xD;
        represented in the study population. The age of presentation is variable ranging from&#xD;
        infancy to adulthood, though enrollment for the study is limited to individuals who have&#xD;
        not yet reached the age of 18. All ethnicities are equally represented in these disorders,&#xD;
        and we expect ethnicities to be represented based on US census data of population&#xD;
        distribution.&#xD;
