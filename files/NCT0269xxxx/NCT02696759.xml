      The purpose of this research is to test whether bacteria that normally live in the intestines&#xD;
      play a role in fighting cancer. It is believed that the development and behavior of these&#xD;
      immune cells may be influenced by bacteria and other microorganisms living in the gut. In&#xD;
      turn, the activities of these immune cells could work with anti-cancer therapies to make them&#xD;
      more, or less, effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many chemotherapeutic agents compromise the integrity of the mucosal barrier in the gut,&#xD;
      allowing translocation of gram-positive bacteria in secondary lymphoid organs. While this&#xD;
      has, until recently, been considered an undesirable side-effect, it may also represent one&#xD;
      mechanism by which chemotherapy stimulates an effective anti-cancer immune response. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to test whether bacteria that normally live in the intestines&#xD;
      play a role in fighting cancer. It is believed that the development and behavior of these&#xD;
      immune cells may be influenced by bacteria and other microorganisms living in the gut. In&#xD;
      turn, the activities of these immune cells could work with anti-cancer therapies to make them&#xD;
      more, or less, effective. The hypothesis is that gut microbial composition can influence&#xD;
      immune response to the tumor, resulting in inter-individual differences in the response to&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapies.&#xD;

During chemotherapy: Questionnaires on health related quality of life and regarding any treatment side effects. Questionnaires will be completed every 2 weeks during standard office visits. After chemotherapy, prior to surgery: (a) Blood sample for research; (b) Fecal sample for research using a kit provided by the research staff for home collection of the fecal sample. The kit may be brought back to the clinic or mailed in a discreet package.</description>
