  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical manifestations of rotator cuff tear include shoulder pain, weakness, and stiffness.&#xD;
      The level of pain is often a limiting factor when assessing shoulder range of motion and&#xD;
      strength pre-operatively. Pain itself has even been a cause of weakness due to muscle&#xD;
      atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to further understand the effect pain has by measuring constant&#xD;
      shoulder scores in patients before and after ultrasound guided subacromial (the outer end of&#xD;
      the shoulder blade) injection of lidocaine (a local anesthetic or numbing agent) compared to&#xD;
      saline (salt solution), in patients indicated for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The&#xD;
      saline and lidocaine has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA). The constant shoulder score includes your level of pain, activity level, range of&#xD;
      motion and strength measures.&#xD;
