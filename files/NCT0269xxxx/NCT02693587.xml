  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, every 4 birth induced, most often due to prolonged pregnancy, up til 10-12 days&#xD;
      after term. A group (RADS) set up by the Danish Regions has recently recommended induction&#xD;
      with prostaglandins in tablet form (Angusta®). The recommendation is based primarily on the&#xD;
      results of a meta-analysis published by the Cochrane Library, where various prostaglandin&#xD;
      medications were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal prostaglandin insert (Misodel®) have proved safe in American Studies and is&#xD;
      registered in Denmark for use of induction. Misodel® was not included in RADS's evaluation,&#xD;
      as there are only few studies on the effectiveness and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, investigators want to compare two different regimes for the induction&#xD;
      of primipara who use respectively Misodel® and Angusta® as the primary method. The study is&#xD;
      based on prospective collection of data from three divisions in Region Zealand, where&#xD;
      investigators primarily compare the efficacy and safety but also to evaluate women's&#xD;
      experience, the cost of medicine and consumption of resources in the maternity wards.&#xD;

      Background The incidence of induced labour in Denmark, has increased from 12% in year 2000 to&#xD;
      25%, in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increase is primarily due to a policy of earlier induction in women with prolonged&#xD;
      pregnancy expected to decrease the risk of intrauterine fetal death. The national guidelines&#xD;
      were changed in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To compare a regimen with use of 25 mcg peroral misoprostol (Angusta®) to&#xD;
      200 mcg vaginal insert Misoprostol (Misodel®) in a population of nullipara with unripened&#xD;
      cervix. The regimens are compared in terms of technology (efficacy and safety), organisation,&#xD;
      economy and patient-satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the region of Zeeland, there are 6360 births annually, and among these 1636 (25%) births&#xD;
      are induced. Among primipara there were 493 (29%) inductions in 2013. The number covers all&#xD;
      induced births, i.e. medically, balloon-catheter, and amniotomy. In Holbæk Hospital (2013),&#xD;
      373 women were induced and among these 190 were primipara. In Næstved Hospital the number of&#xD;
      inductions were 393 and 177 were primipara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimes for induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There exist a number of different regimes for induction of labour. When the cervix is&#xD;
      unripened, there is general consensus that the induction should be with either prostaglandins&#xD;
      or a balloon catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A committee appointed by Danish Regions (RADS) launched in 2014 a recommendation for the use&#xD;
      of prostaglandins for induction of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendations are summarized in Table 1. The recommendations conclude that Angusta®&#xD;
      should be the first line treatment for induction of labour with prostaglandins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Prostaglandins for induction of labour Prostaglandin Trade name Approved in Ministry&#xD;
      of health RADS recommendations Misoprostol tablets, 25 mcg Angusta® Not approved Recommended:&#xD;
      (2 h x 8) Dinoproston vaginal tablet or gel 3 mg Prostin® Minprostin® Approved Can be used:&#xD;
      (6 h x 3) Misoprostol vaginal tablet 25 mcg Approved Can be used: (4 h x 4) Misoprostol&#xD;
      tablets, 50 mcg Approved Can be used: (4 h x 4) Misoprostol insert 200 mcg Misodel® Approved&#xD;
      Not recommended Dinoproston insert 10 mg Propess® Approved Not recommended&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the evidence and strength of the recommendations are based on the evaluation&#xD;
      method of GRADE (Grading of recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusions are primary based on a Cochrane analysis from June 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions from this analysis were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Misoprostol is more effective than placebo, and leads to a lower risk of caesarean&#xD;
           delivery than dinoproston.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Misoprostol is equally effective when administered vaginally, but increases the&#xD;
           risk of a low Apgar score and post-partum bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the conclusions of the Cochrane analysis has been debated. It has been argued that&#xD;
      the evidence of effectiveness/equivalence is based on studies where oral misoprostol has been&#xD;
      used in high dosages (&gt;25 mcg), whereas the studies that concluded an increased risk of&#xD;
      complications, used small dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misodel®:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol insert 200 mcg (Misodel®) is registered in Europe for the induction of labour.&#xD;
      The effect and safety is documented in studies from the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One randomized controlled study published in 2008, compared vaginal insert of 50 and 100 mcg&#xD;
      misoprostol to vaginal insert of 10 mg Dinoproston. The two primary outcomes were the&#xD;
      duration from administration to delivery, and the frequency of caesarean sections (CS). It&#xD;
      was found that 100 mcg misoprostol and 10 mg dinoprostone had about the same duration from&#xD;
      start of induction to delivery, whereas 50 mcg misoprostol showed a prolonged duration. The&#xD;
      frequencies of CS were the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the results from another RCT were published, comparing vaginal misoprostol insert of&#xD;
      100, 150 and 200 mcg. It was found that the 200 mcg group delivered within 25,8 hours for&#xD;
      nulliparous, and 14 hours for multiparous women. The rate of CS was increased in this group,&#xD;
      due to affected fetal heart-rate, although not significant. There were no differences in&#xD;
      neonatal outcome. Tachysystoli (hyper-stimulation) was more frequent, but fewer needed to be&#xD;
      stimulated with oxytocin (49%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One RCT from 2013 compared 200 mcg slow release misoprostol to 10 mg Dinoproston insert.&#xD;
      Their results showed a shorter duration to delivery (21,5 vs 32,8 hours), and the same&#xD;
      frequency of CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADS did not include Misodel® in their analysis since they found no RCTs that investigated&#xD;
      the effect vs. side-effect in Misodel® compared with other regimes. The background for not&#xD;
      recommending it, was that there seemed to be a high risk of tachysystoli with CTG changes -&#xD;
      although based on different dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to compare 2 different regimens for induction of labour in nullipara&#xD;
      with an unripened cervix by the use of a medical health technology assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Primipara, immature cervix (Bishop score &lt; 4), gestational age &gt; 37+0&#xD;
      weeks with a singleton pregnancy without suspicion of fetal growth retardation (SGA defined&#xD;
      as birth-weight deviation ≤-22%), and no history of prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). No&#xD;
      GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: GA &lt; 37+0 weeks, multipara, multiple pregnancy, placenta previa,&#xD;
      suspicion of SGA, PROM, and GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The obstetric departments in the Region of Zeeland, have elaborated a clinical&#xD;
      guideline for Angusta® that is expected to be fully implemented in the Hospitals of Roskilde,&#xD;
      Næstved and Nykøbing Falster in June 2015. The guideline is based on the recommendations from&#xD;
      RADS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department of Obstetrics in Holbæk has developed another guideline where Misodel® is used&#xD;
      as first line treatment in a selected population. The women giving birth in Roskilde, Næstved&#xD;
      and Holbæk are comparable on a number of parameters (BMI, distance to hospital, smoking,&#xD;
      frequency of CS, cup-delivery etc.). This data is already available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is based on a prospective collection of data for induced labour in Roskilde,&#xD;
      Næstved and Holbæk. Investigators will also collect corresponding data for spontaneous&#xD;
      delivery at term in the three different departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of hyperstimulation, defined as tachysystoly with &gt; 5 contractions in 10&#xD;
           minutes over a period of 30 minutes. Indeterminate or abnormal CTG. Scalp-pH &lt; 7,20 or&#xD;
           umbilical cord pH &lt; 7,10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of delivery within 24 hours after induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from induction to delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daytime delivery (8am-7pm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of hours with Syntocinon stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of ballon-catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Numbers and durations of contact to labour ward&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of vaginal explorations under active labour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of CTG monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expenses for medication per induction (prostaglandins, syntocinon, balloon-catheter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient experience (evaluated based on questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midwife experience (evaluated based on questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breastfeeding (questionnaire 3 months after delivery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome will be compared for the two departments with calculation of Odds Ratio (OR), with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be adjusted for confounders such as BMI, maternity age, birth weight, gestational&#xD;
      age, indication for induction by logistical regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Datasource:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval from data protection authorities have been applied for. Besides the questionnaires,&#xD;
      information will be available from electronic patient-charts, including MILOU (a program that&#xD;
      stores CTG electronically).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material size and strength-calculations for the primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material size is determined with the Kelsey method with a significance level of 5% and power&#xD;
      of 80%. For a more effective trial, we would like to set the ratio at 2:1 in control:Misodel®&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caesarean section: A difference in 2% is estimated to be relevant (an expected&#xD;
           difference of 20 to 22%). We need to include 4150 induced births in the Misodel® group&#xD;
           and 8300 patients in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperstimulation: a difference in the frequency if tachysystoli in 15% is estimated to&#xD;
           be relevant (40 to 55%). We need to include 126 and 252 patients in the Misodel® and&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth within 24 hours: A difference of 15% is estimated to be relevant, where the&#xD;
           results will be as above (40 to 55%): 126 and 252 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We are planning on including 140 induced women in the Misodel® group, and 280 in the&#xD;
           control group. After the inclusion of 70 women, investigators will perform an&#xD;
           interims-analysis. The investigators are not expecting to see any significant&#xD;
           differences in CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guideline for induction with Misodel® will be implemented in Holbæk in November 2015. The&#xD;
      prospective collection of data is expected to be commenced in November 2015, and finished&#xD;
      when the number of patients needed is reached (according to the sample size-calculations),&#xD;
      presumably 1-2 years. Questionnaires for patient satisfactory will be elaborated and&#xD;
      validated in May 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financing and conflicts of interests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional costs for medications or staff in the hospital of Holbæk. Funding&#xD;
      for the study will be applied for from private and public funds, none is paid for by any&#xD;
      pharmaceutical company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lone Krebs, Morten Lebech and Lisbeth Jønsson declare no conflicts of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and stored by Axelina Eriksson (AE) at Holbæk Sygehus, department of&#xD;
      Gynaecology and Obstetrics, in a locked office for interns at the department. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be locked in a drawer to which only AE has the key. Personal electronical data will only&#xD;
      be accessed when AE is alone in the office, and the collection of information will be stored&#xD;
      at AEs' personal login teamsite. A backup USB key will be stored in the same locked drawer,&#xD;
      as the questionnaires. When data is processed in the office, it will be anonymized, and will&#xD;
      only leave the office after anonymization. The project is scheduled to finish in 1/12-17 -&#xD;
      all personal sensitive data will be destroyed afterwards.&#xD;
