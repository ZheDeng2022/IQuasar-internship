      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when giving&#xD;
      together with stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      ipilimumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to the brain. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a&#xD;
      specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the&#xD;
      tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy, such as whole-brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy, uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving nivolumab&#xD;
      together with stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to the brain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nivolumab with intracranial radiation&#xD;
      and ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and intracranial radiation in non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis. (Phase I) II. To determine the RP2D of nivolumab&#xD;
      in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). (Phase I) III. To determine the RP2D of&#xD;
      nivolumab in combination with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). (Phase I) IV. To&#xD;
      determine the RP2D of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and SRS. (Phase I) V. To&#xD;
      determine the RP2D of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab and WBRT. (Phase I) VI. To&#xD;
      estimate the 4-month intracranial progression free survival overall and within each treatment&#xD;
      group; nivolumab and SRS; nivolumab and WBRT; nivolumab + ipilimumab and SRS; nivolumab +&#xD;
      ipilimumab and WBRT. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the potential neurocognitive changes in all treatment groups using the Hopkins&#xD;
      Verbal Learning Revised (HVLT-R) total recall test. (Phase II) II. To estimate the rate of&#xD;
      extracranial progression overall and within each treatment group. (Phase II) III. To estimate&#xD;
      overall survival overall and within each treatment group. (Phase II) IV. To estimate the&#xD;
      objective response rate of extracranial disease among all groups and within each treatment&#xD;
      group. (Phase II) V. To estimate the duration of treatment response extracranially in&#xD;
      patients who achieve an objective response. (Phase II) VI. To estimate steroid requirements&#xD;
      in patients overall and within each treatment group. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nivolumab followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes every 2 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo SRS once the day&#xD;
      after nivolumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP B: Patients then receive nivolumab as in Group A. Patients undergo WBRT once daily for&#xD;
      10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP C: Patients receive nivolumab as in Group A and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo SRS&#xD;
      once the day after nivolumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP D: Patients receive nivolumab as in Group A and ipilimumab as in Group C. Patients&#xD;
      undergo WBRT once daily for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
