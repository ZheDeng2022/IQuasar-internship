    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of inhaled sodium nitrite in adults with Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      and chronic Pseudomonas infections, and determine the ability of sodium nitrite to reduce the&#xD;
      burden of Pseudomonas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects the airways of 80% of adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In&#xD;
      these patients, P. aeruginosa forms extremely antibiotic resistant biofilm communities that&#xD;
      accelerate progression of obstructive lung disease. Current treatment of airway infection&#xD;
      focuses on monthly cycles of inhaled antibiotics. However up to 20% of adults are infected&#xD;
      with multi drug resistant P. aeruginosa for which we have no effective inhaled treatments.&#xD;
      These isolates are more common as patients age so with the increasing life expectancy of the&#xD;
      CF population, MDR P. aeruginosa is likely to remain a clinical problem. Another 10% of&#xD;
      patients are infected with other Gram-negative organisms such as Burkholderia cepacia and&#xD;
      Achromobacter species, for which we have inadequate suppressive treatment. Following lung&#xD;
      transplant, MDR airway infections remain a problem as the allografts are colonized by strains&#xD;
      carried in the paranasal sinuses. Sodium nitrite may present a new antimicrobial approach to&#xD;
      treating respiratory infection with Gram-negative organisms, because it is able to prevent&#xD;
      biotic biofilm formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the CF lung, P. aeruginosa grows as a biotic biofilm in association with airway&#xD;
      epithelial cells and mucous plaques. This environment has an acidic pH and low oxygen tension&#xD;
      with many bacteria subsisting through denitrification (both conditions where traditional&#xD;
      antibiotics are less effective). Because biotic biofilms can be up to 500-fold more resistant&#xD;
      than biofilms grown on abiotic surfaces, with support from our CF Research Development&#xD;
      Program (RDP) Cores, we showed that nitrite prevents biofilm formation on the surface of&#xD;
      primary CF airway epithelial cells. Moreover, nitrite dose-dependently potentiates the&#xD;
      effects of colistin sulfate in liquid culture, and in biotic biofilms on airway epithelial&#xD;
      cells. These data support the hypothesis that nebulized sodium nitrite will inhibit growth of&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF airways, and identify a potential therapeutic benefit for&#xD;
      nitrite alone and cooperatively with colistin as a novel therapy to inhibit P. aeruginosa in&#xD;
      CF airways. Nebulized nitrite has been through extensive animal toxicology, and is well&#xD;
      tolerated by subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension where it is being studied as a&#xD;
      pulmonary vasodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the therapeutic potential of sodium nitrite for CF, we propose two specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the safety of nebulized sodium nitrite administered in two doses to patients&#xD;
      with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Explore the effects of inhaled sodium nitrite on measures of lung function, exhaled&#xD;
      airway nitric oxide, and bacterial burden as measured by quantitative sputum cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, we propose a Phase I/II open-label study of sodium nitrite in CF.&#xD;
      Key inclusion criteria include individuals over the age 18 with cystic fibrosis as documented&#xD;
      by clinical features of CF, and genotyping or a positive sweat test. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      include advanced lung disease, inability to discontinue inhaled antibiotics for four weeks,&#xD;
      hospitalization or medication change within 4 weeks of enrollment, baseline systemic&#xD;
      hypotension (SBP&lt;90 mm hg), chronic kidney disease (Cr &gt;2.5), severe anemia (Hgb &lt;9 gm/dL in&#xD;
      the last six months). The primary outcome is safety, defined as FEV1 measured before and&#xD;
      after initial doses on days 0 and 7, and at week 4. Other safety data for the initial doses&#xD;
      include pulse oximetry and transcutaneous methemoglobin levels. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      quantitative sputum cultures, exhaled nitric oxide, sputum nitrite concentration, and patient&#xD;
      symptoms as assessed by a CF specific respiratory questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of this study will guide the development of sodium nitrite as a single agent for&#xD;
      CF infections, and inform future studies examining the effects of sodium nitrite in&#xD;
      combination with inhaled colistin for patients with drug resistant bacterial pathogens that&#xD;
      are an increasing problem. In addition, the study will provide important safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data that may inform future development of inhaled sodium nitrite as a therapy in young&#xD;
      patients to augment airway host defense and prevent biofilm formation.&#xD;
