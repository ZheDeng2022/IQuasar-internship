    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of various tumor response criteria&#xD;
      (Choi and RECIST1.1 criteria) in the assessment of regorafenib activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, an assessment of the tumor heterogeneity will be made using computed tomographic&#xD;
      texture analysis (CTTA)&#xD;
