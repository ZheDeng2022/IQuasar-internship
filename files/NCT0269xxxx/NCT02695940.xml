             cleft and perianal skin, in addition to neck or other skin folds). Mild to moderate is&#xD;
             defined as having at least score 1 for each individual sign thickness and redness, and&#xD;
             total TSS score of at least 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The total treatment area can be up to 4% BSA (720 cm2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a history of psoriasis, or have psoriasis, or present with&#xD;
             characteristic psoriasis leasons elsewhere on the body (including the scalp) at Visit&#xD;
             1 (Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable inverse psoriasis based on TSS evaluated at Visit 1 (Screening) and at Visit 2&#xD;
             (Start of treatment), which must not differ more than 1 point in any single clinical&#xD;
             sign score (redness, scaling and thickness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Except for inverse psoriasis, overall good health including well controlled diseases&#xD;
             (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease) as determined by medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate&#xD;

             experimental biological products prior to Visit 2 (Start of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic treatments (marketed/non-marketed), other than biologics, with a&#xD;
             potential effect on inverse psoriasis (e.g., corticosteroids, retinoids,&#xD;
             dimethylfumarate, cyclosporine, azathioprine methotrexate, immunosuppressants) within&#xD;

             Visit 2 (Start of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a positive HBV score antibody, HBsAg, anti-HCV or anti-HIV test at Visit&#xD;
