  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LLLT has an anti-inflammatory, analgesic effect and accelerates the healing of ulcerated&#xD;
      lesions. There are little data in the literature showing its efficacy in prevention of&#xD;
      mucositis in cohorts of patients with hematopoietic stem cells transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a prophylactic low level laser&#xD;
      therapy performed by nurses on the severity of oral mucositis during HSCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main end point for efficacy is the reduction of severe mucositis (grade 3 or more). The&#xD;
      secondary efficacy endpoints are the reduction of mucositis, whatever the grade, the&#xD;
      reduction of time with mucositis, the time to onset of mucositis symptoms, the reduction of&#xD;
      pain intensity and evaluation of quality of life.The secondary endpoints for safety are&#xD;
      severe adverse events and potential toxicity. Patients will be allocated at inclusion with a&#xD;
      1/1 ratio either to laser-on or laser-off groups. In the laser group, patients will undergo&#xD;
      laser therapy performed by nurses, which will consist of irradiation of the whole oral cavity&#xD;
      during 2 minutes with 250mW power. In the laser-off group, laser therapy will be carried out&#xD;
      with equipment off during the same time, and still performed by nurses. Protective eye&#xD;
      shields will be used to avoid detrimental effects on eyes and to keep the subjects blind.&#xD;

If the mucositis is localised, preventive laser will be kept on the healthy zones, and curative laser will be performed on painful zone. If the mucositis is general (more than 1 site), preventive laser is stopped for curative laser only.</description>
