      Different anesthetic techniques have been proposed for carrying out Inguinal hernia repair,&#xD;
      including local anesthesia, regional and general. There are no recent data on the application&#xD;
      of a validated questionnaire to assess which anesthetic technique, local infiltration under&#xD;
      general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, would provide better quality of recovery in the&#xD;
      opinion of the patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. The aim of the study is to perform&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial comparing the quality of recovery (QoR-40) after local&#xD;
      infiltration under general anesthesia via laryngeal mask (LMA) or spinal anesthesia for&#xD;
      unilateral inguinal hernia repair. METHODS - Seventy patients aged 18 to 65 years old, who&#xD;
      were scheduled to undergo unilateral inguinal hernia repair at Santa Lucinda Hospital will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The anesthesia will be performed according to the following sequence:&#xD;
      L Group - intravenous (I.V.) propofol and alfentanyl, followed by LMA positioning. The&#xD;
      anesthesia will be maintained by propofol. For local anesthesia, approximately 50 ml of 0.5%&#xD;
      ropivacaine will be infiltrated along the line of incision in the subcutaneous plane,&#xD;
      followed by peripheral nerve block technique (e.g., ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve block) and&#xD;
      local wound infiltration at the fascial level. S Group - spinal puncture followed by&#xD;
      intrathecal 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine injection and sedation with propofol by&#xD;
      continuous infusion. Pain will be assessed every 15 minutes at Post-anesthesia Care Unit&#xD;
      (PACU) using a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale and I.V. morphine will be administered to&#xD;
      maintain the pain score below 4. The QoR-40 will be administered by a blind investigator 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide. The&#xD;
      recommended treatment is surgery, which has undergone important advances in the last two&#xD;
      decades. Different anesthetic techniques have been proposed for carrying out such procedures,&#xD;
      including local anesthesia, regional and general. Even though local anesthesia (so called&#xD;
      monitored anesthesia care) is a more cost effective anesthetic technique for inguinal hernia&#xD;
      repair, general and spinal anesthesia remain the most popular anesthetic techniques at&#xD;
      university based teaching programs. It has been suggested that the use of local anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques requires greater surgical skill in the handling of tissues and that, therefore,&#xD;
      less skilled surgeons find it more convenient to operate under general or spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
      The choice of anesthesia is influenced by several factors, including surgeon or&#xD;
      anesthesiologist preferences, patient characteristics, cost or length of hospital stay.&#xD;
      Despite its popularity, spinal anesthesia can lead to side effects as urinary retention,&#xD;
      hypotension, motor block of lower extremities and headache. A recent systematic review&#xD;
      evaluated studies on the influence of anesthetic technique in controlling the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative pain in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. According to the authors,&#xD;
      local anesthesia, with or without general anesthesia is more effective considering the&#xD;
      avoidance of adverse events compared to spinal anesthesia. Traditionally, anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery studies have assessed outcomes such as time to wake or hospital stay and the&#xD;
      incidence of nausea, vomiting, pain or other adverse events. Recently, a measurement that&#xD;
      probes quality of life from the perspective of the patient has been considered as a more&#xD;
      important factor in clinical studies that wish to investigate the effect of anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery on patient recovery and satisfaction. The Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire&#xD;
      (QoR-40), a validated instrument for this purpose, allows an objective evaluation of the&#xD;
      factors that can influence the perception of the patient, and has been used successfully to&#xD;
      assess the degree of recovery after several different surgical and anesthetic techniques.&#xD;
      There are no recent data on the application of this instrument to assess which anesthetic&#xD;
      technique, local infiltration under general anesthesia via laryngeal mask or spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, would provide better quality of recovery in the opinion of the patients&#xD;
      undergoing inguinal hernia repair. The aim of the study is to perform a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial comparing the quality of recovery after local infiltration under general anesthesia via&#xD;
      laryngeal mask or spinal anesthesia for unilateral inguinal hernia repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This randomized trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of&#xD;
      Medical and Health Sciences, Pontifical Catholica University of São Paulo, approval number&#xD;
      45087615.0.0000.5373. Written consent form will be obtained from all participants. Seventy&#xD;
      patients aged 18 to 65 years old, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
      physical status I or II, who will bee scheduled to undergo local infiltration under general&#xD;
      anesthesia via laryngeal mask or spinal anesthesia for unilateral inguinal hernia repair at&#xD;
      Santa Lucinda Hospital will be enrolled in the study. Patients who (i) refuse to participate&#xD;
      in the study; (ii) are not able to communicate due to alterations in the level of&#xD;
      consciousness, or neurologic, or psychiatric disease; (iii) present with contraindication to&#xD;
      any of the drugs used in the present study; (iv) have history of alcohol or drug dependence;&#xD;
      (v) are super obese as defined by a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40; and (vi) undergo operation&#xD;
      for recurrent, strangulated, incarcerated or bilateral hernia will excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sequence No premedication will be applied to the patients. Patients´ preoperative data&#xD;
      including age, gender, physical status, BMI and hernia type according to Nyhus classification&#xD;
      will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The sample size for the following step was calculated considering 90% power to&#xD;
      detect a 10-point difference in QoR-40, which indicated the need to include 31 participants&#xD;
      in each group. Taking possible losses into consideration, the final sample will include 70&#xD;
      participants, which will be allocated to two groups according to a random number sequence&#xD;
      from a web-based random-number generator (available at www.random.com). Because of&#xD;
      significant difference between the anesthetic techniques, the patient and the investigators&#xD;
      will be blinded to group allocation, but not the anesthesia. The anesthetic technique to be&#xD;
      used for each individual participant will be kept in an opaque and sealed envelope, which&#xD;
      will be opened at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival at the operating room, standard ASA monitors will be applied. Intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam (0.06 to 0.08 mg.kg-1) and 1% lidocaine (30 mg) will be administered immediately&#xD;
      after venoclysis. The anesthesia will be performed according to the following sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      L Group - General anesthesia willl be induced with propofol 2 mg mg. kg-1 and alfentanyl 30&#xD;
      mcg.kg-1. Once an appropriate depth of anesthesia had been obtained, a laryngeal mask airway&#xD;
      (LMA) will be positioned. The anesthesia will be maintained by propofol 4 to 5 mg. kg-1.h-1.&#xD;
      Ventilation will be controlled by adjusting the flow volume and respiratory rate to keep the&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 level (PETCO2) between 30 and 40 mmHg. For local anesthesia, approximately 50&#xD;
      ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will be infiltrated along the line of incision in the subcutaneous&#xD;
      plane, followed by peripheral nerve block technique (e.g., ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve&#xD;
      block) and local wound infiltration at the fascial level. Failure of local anesthesia will be&#xD;
      defined as the presence of movements, sweating, tachycardia or blood pressure increase &gt;10%&#xD;
      of the pre-induction value with the beginning of the surgery. In these cases further&#xD;
      infiltration of additional 10 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be allowed. At the end of the&#xD;
      surgery, propofol will be discontinued and the LMA removed whenever the patients resume&#xD;
      adequate spontaneous breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S Group - In the S group, spinal puncture will be performed with the patient in the sitting&#xD;
      position, using 27 Gauge (27G) disposable Quincke needles (B. Braun, Meisungen, AG). After&#xD;
      obtaining cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine will be injected.&#xD;
      In case of complete failure, a new puncture will be performed and the same dose of anesthetic&#xD;
      drug injected. In cases of partial failure, the anesthesia will be converted to general&#xD;
      anesthesia and the patient excluded from the study. All the patients will be sedated with&#xD;
      propofol by continuous infusion at an initial dose of 0.5 mg.kg-1 followed by 2 to 5 mg.&#xD;
      kg-1.h-1 as necessary to reach level 5 on Ramsay Sedation Scale. The Lichtenstein&#xD;
      tension-free method of inguinal hernia repair will be used in both groups and all procedures&#xD;
      will be performed by the same surgical team. Patients who exhibit reductions in systolic&#xD;
      arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 30% will be given ephedrine (10 mg). Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution will be used for fluid replacement therapy at a rate of approximately 500 ml&#xD;
      throughout the first 30 minutes, and, then, 2 ml.kg-1.h-1. All of the participants will be&#xD;
      given i.v. ketoprofen (100 mg) before the end of the surgery. The time to operating room&#xD;
      discharge will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative When stable vital signs and respiration was confirmed, all patients will be&#xD;
      transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Data related to the occurrence of pain,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, shivering, urinary retention and the length of stay at the PACU will be&#xD;
      recorded. Pain will be assessed every 15 minutes using a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale,&#xD;
      where zero meant no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain. Intravenous morphine (1 to 2 mg)&#xD;
      will be administered every 15 minutes to maintain the pain score below 4 (1 mg when the pain&#xD;
      score was &lt;7 and 2 mg when it was ≥7). Postoperative pain relief in the ward was accomplished&#xD;
      by i.v. ketoprofen (100 mg) every 12 hours, dipyrone (30 mg.kg-1, maximum 1 g) every six&#xD;
      hours and tramadol (100 mg) at eight-hour minimum intervals as needed whenever patients judge&#xD;
      that their analgesia is insufficient. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will be&#xD;
      treated with i.v. dimenhydrinate (30 mg). Pain score, use of analgesics, and the occurrence&#xD;
      of nausea, vomiting, and other complications during the hospital ward stay will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoR-40 Questionnaire The quality of postoperative functional recovery will be assessed by the&#xD;
      QoR-40 questionnaire, which assesses five dimensions of recovery (physical comfort - 12&#xD;
      items; emotional state - 7 items; physical independence - 5 items; physiological support - 7&#xD;
      items; and pain - 7 items). Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale: none of the&#xD;
      time, some of the time, usually, most of the time, and all the time. The total score on the&#xD;
      QoR-40 ranges from 40 (poorest quality of recovery) to 200 (best quality of recovery).&#xD;
