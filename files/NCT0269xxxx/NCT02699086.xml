  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to determine the effective doses and treatment period&#xD;
      of PDC-1421 Capsule in subjects with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of PDC-1421 Capsule in subjects receiving&#xD;
      PDC-1421 at various dose levels.&#xD;

      This study was a Part I of Phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in&#xD;
      adult patients with ADHD. The Screening phase is intended for diagnosing and assessing the&#xD;
      patient for possible inclusion in the study and for providing an adequate washout period. The&#xD;
      targeted population of this Part I study is six subjects who met the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      per-protocol basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I study is an open-label study, single-center, and dose escalation evaluation in six&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low dose: Six subjects will be initially evaluated for safety and efficacy assessments&#xD;
           at low-dose (1 PDC-1421capsule TID) for 28 days. The subject will return for visit once&#xD;
           a week during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Checkpoint #1: There will be an evaluation with all safety assessments data to decide&#xD;
           whether subjects pass the checkpoint to enter high-dose treatment or continue to receive&#xD;
           a low-dose treatment by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High dose: The subjects who pass Checkpoint #1 will be initially evaluated for safety&#xD;
           and efficacy assessments at high-dose (2 PDC-1421 capsules TID) for 28 days. Subjects&#xD;
           will return for visit biweekly during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Checkpoint #2: There will be an evaluation with all safety assessments data to decide&#xD;
           whether this study passes the checkpoint to enter Part II by the investigators.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement ≥ 40% in ADHD-RS-IV From Baseline up to 8 Weeks Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the change of ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score from baseline up to Week 8 of treatment in ITT population.&#xD;
The ADHD-RS-IV with Adult Prompts is an 18-item scale base on the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD that provides a rating of the severity of symptoms. The adult prompts serve as a guide to explore more fully the extent and severity of ADHD symptoms and create a framework to ascertain impairment. The odd-numbered 9 items assess inattentive symptoms and the even-numbered 9 items assess hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Scoring is based on a 4-point, yielding a possible total score of 0-54. Likert-type severity scale: 0 = Never or Rarely, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, 3 = Very Often. Clinicians should score the highest score that is generated for the prompts for each item. The ADHD-RS-IV was assessed from Visit 1 to Visit 8 by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Change in ITT Population From Baseline up to 4 and 8 Weeks Treatment in the Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Self Report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S) 5 Subscales T-score.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conners' Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-Self Report: Short Version (CAARS-S:S) consists of 26 items rated from 0=not at all, never to 3=very much, very frequently. Four subscales each composed of 5 items (A: inattention/memory problems; B: hyperactivity/restlessness; C: impulsivity/emotional lability; and D: problems with self-concept) as well as a 12-item ADHD index can be computed. The raw scores were converted into standard T-scores by the SAS program which was designed according to the Profile form of CAARS QuikScore forms. The higher T-scores represent a better or worse outcome. A T-score is a standard score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in all samples and across all scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a CGI Score of 2 or Lower</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 2 or lower.&#xD;
The CGI-S is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGI-I scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse).</description>

The odd-numbered 9 items assess inattentive symptoms and the even-numbered 9 items assess hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.

The higher values represent a worse outcome for the total score and subscore. Likert-type severity scale: 0 = Never or Rarely, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, 3 = Very Often. . The ADHD-RS-IV was assessed from Visit 1 to Visit 8 by the investigator.</description>

          <title>ADHD Rating Scale</title>
          <description>The ADHD Rating Scale-IV with Adult Prompts is an 18-item scale base on the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD that provides a rating of the severity of symptoms. The adult prompts serve as a guide to explore more fully the extent and severity of ADHD symptoms and create a framework to ascertain impairment. The odd-numbered 9 items assess inattentive symptoms and the even-numbered 9 items assess hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Scoring is based on a 4-point, yielding a possible total score of 0-54. Clinicians should score the highest score that is generated for the prompts for each item.</description>

        <title>Change in ITT Population From Baseline up to 4 and 8 Weeks in the ADHD-RS-IV Inattention Subscale, Hyperactivity-impulsivity Subscale, and Total Scale Raw Score.</title>
        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV with Adult Prompts is an 18-item scale base on the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD that provides a rating of the severity of symptoms. The adult prompts serve as a guide to explore more fully the extent and severity of ADHD symptoms and create a framework to ascertain impairment. The odd-numbered 9 items assess inattentive symptoms and the even-numbered 9 items assess hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Scoring is based on a 4-point, yielding a possible summed &quot;total score&quot; of 0-54, &quot;inattentive subscore&quot; of 0-27, and &quot;hyperactive-impulsive subscore&quot; of 0-27. The higher values represent a worse outcome for the total score and subscore. Likert-type severity scale: 0 = Never or Rarely, 1 = Sometimes, 2 = Often, 3 = Very Often. . The ADHD-RS-IV was assessed from Visit 1 to Visit 8 by the investigator.</description>
