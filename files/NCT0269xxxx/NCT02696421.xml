  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramadan fasting entails abstinence from eating and drinking between dawn and sunset. During&#xD;
      this month major changes in meal times and patterns, sleeping times and activity occur.&#xD;
      Starvation is known to lead to a compensatory reduction in energy expenditure. However, the&#xD;
      Ramadan fast is not synonymous with starvation as it involves intermittent periods of fasting&#xD;
      followed by gorging. People who fast during Ramadan feel less energetic. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the effects of this religious practice on energy metabolism. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess energy dynamics before and/or after and during Ramadan&#xD;
      fasting in non-obese participants. Resting metabolic rate (RMR), thermic effect of food&#xD;
      (TEF), active energy expenditure (AEE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in free-living&#xD;
      conditions will be measured . Indirect calorimetry will be used to assess RMR and TEF, doubly&#xD;
      labeled water will be used to measure TEE and activity monitors will measure physical&#xD;
      activity. In addition, body composition analysis will be performed by bio-electrical&#xD;
      impedance. Blood sample will be taken to exclude medical factors affecting energy metabolism.&#xD;
