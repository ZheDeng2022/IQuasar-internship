  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 90% of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) experience sleep problems,&#xD;
      whereas less than 25% of typically developing children experience sleep problems. Poor sleep&#xD;
      can have significant consequences for children's physical and psychosocial health, as well&#xD;
      their caregivers' well-being. The impact of sleep problems on daytime functioning is even&#xD;
      greater in children with NDD. Although there are a range of factors that may disturb sleep in&#xD;
      children with NDD, the most frequent cause of sleep disturbance is behavioural insomnia.&#xD;
      There is some evidence that behavioural interventions can be effective in improving sleep in&#xD;
      children with NDD. However, this has not been tested through well-designed, large-scale&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, there are a number of significant barriers to&#xD;
      access for insomnia treatment for children; most importantly, sleep interventions are often&#xD;
      only provided by specialists, limiting access to treatment services. Instead, behavioural&#xD;
      insomnia is often treated with advice about sleep hygiene and with the supplement melatonin,&#xD;
      which is, at best, a short-term solution. The investigators, an interdisciplinary team of&#xD;
      researchers, will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an online sleep intervention that&#xD;
      will be widely accessible and sustainable and will have the potential to dramatically improve&#xD;
      the health of children with NDD and their families.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a web-based intervention for insomnia&#xD;
      among children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), including Autism Spectrum Disorder&#xD;
      (ASD), Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), Cerebral Palsy (CP), and&#xD;
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Using the internet to deliver an&#xD;
      intervention program for insomnia in children will address access barriers and provide&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment to large numbers of children with NDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will adapt the Better Nights, Better Days (BNBD) e-intervention that was developed&#xD;
      for typically developing children ages 1-10 years. The adaptation of BNBD will be led by a&#xD;
      team of experts in the fields of sleep in children with NDD, including ASD, FASD, CP, and&#xD;
      ADHD. The adaption will focus on behaviours that pose challenges to implementation of the&#xD;
      evidence-based sleep intervention strategies (e.g., anxiety, parental stress, sensory&#xD;
      sensitivities, language impairments, attention difficulties, etc.), rather than&#xD;
      disorder-specific symptoms. The finalized intervention is tailored for primary caregives of&#xD;
      children between the ages of 4-12 years, with mild to moderate NDD impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of this intervention in improving children's sleep and daytime functioning,&#xD;
      as well as secondary effects on the well-being of caregivers, will be evaluated through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). A parallel-design RCT (one per diagnostic group) will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine if the web-based sleep intervention for NDD improves children's sleep&#xD;
      and is associated with improved psychosocial outcomes for children and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is comprised of a development phase and an RCT phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Adaptation of web-based intervention and usability testing. A 3-step process will be&#xD;
      used to adapt the BNBD e-intervention for use by caregivers of children with NDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Development of modifications based on team lead input and literature reviews, with&#xD;
      the objective to identify specific adaptations for sleep interventions. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a Delphi study to gain consensus from leading experts on the most appropriate&#xD;
      modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Modification of the BNBD program. The investigators will work with Velsoft Training&#xD;
      Materials Inc. to adapt the intervention for caregivers of children with NDD. Modifications&#xD;
      will include changes to the information already included in BNBD, and addition of&#xD;
      informational and videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Usability study with experts and caregivers. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      e-intervention on 6 dimensions: usable, credible, accessible, desirable, useful, and&#xD;
      valuable. The investigators will obtain participants' perceptions of whether the caregivers&#xD;
      will be well supported by this e-intervention, and how to incorporate additional supports.&#xD;
      Participants will be 5 health care professionals who work with children with NDD, and 3&#xD;
      caregivers for each NDD group, for a maximum sample of 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: RCT of the BNBD-NDD Sleep Intervention. In Phase 2, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the web-based intervention for insomnia in 4 to 12-year-olds with NDD.&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at Baseline and at 4 and 8 months post-randomization. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess the intervention's immediate impact (Baseline vs. 4 months) on&#xD;
      children's sleep. Th secondary objective is to evaluate longer-term impact (Baseline, 4, 8&#xD;
      months) on children's sleep, as well as the longer-term impact on child and caregiver&#xD;
      psychosocial health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. Investigators will use a RCT design, with a pragmatic trial approach, to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, adhering to CONSORT 2010 guidelines. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a pragmatic, single-site (with national recruitment) RCT,&#xD;
      stratified by diagnostic group. Participants (primary caregivers of children ages 4 to 12&#xD;
      years with insomnia and mild to moderate NDD) will be assigned to Intervention or Usual Care&#xD;
      based on a 1-to-1 allocation. The primary objective is to assess whether the intervention&#xD;
      improves children' sleep within each group at 4 months and is this improved sleep maintained&#xD;
      at the long-term follow-up (8 month assessment). Secondary objectives are to determine&#xD;
      whether the intervention results in similar improvements in insomnia symptoms in each of the&#xD;
      four NDD diagnostic groups and the intervention's impact on child and caregiver psychosocial&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. After Baseline caregivers will be randomized to usual care or internet-based&#xD;
      sleep intervention (BNBD-NDD). The usual care group may access other interventions. They will&#xD;
      be given access to BNBD-NDD after all follow-up assessments. Caregivers in the intervention&#xD;
      group will also be allowed to access other interventions. The investigators will use&#xD;
      block-randomized stratification for each of the 4 diagnostic groups. A staff member (not&#xD;
      affiliated with the project) will prepare computer-generated block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. The investigators will recruit 200 eligible participants to have 100 caregivers&#xD;
      complete the post-treatment (4 month) assessment. Given the likelihood of overlap in&#xD;
      diagnoses across groups, participants will be enrolled based on their primary and most&#xD;
      impairing disorder. The intervention will be designed for children with mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      disabilities, as it is expected that children with severe neurologic disease will not benefit&#xD;
      from this type of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Assessment. Caregivers will be asked questions through an online screening&#xD;
      instrument to assess whether their child meets the study's inclusion criteria and does not&#xD;
      meet any of the exclusion criteria. To determine if the child has behavioural insomnia,&#xD;
      criteria outlined by Richman and modified by Anders and Dahl, which are consistent with the&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) insomnia criteria, will be&#xD;
      used. To determine if the child may have sleep apnea (an exclusion item), caregivers will&#xD;
      complete the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Outcome Assessments. Assessments will be conducted at Baseline and at 4 and 8&#xD;
      months post-randomization for all participants. A research assistant will email caregivers at&#xD;
      the appropriate time requesting that they complete the assessment, and will follow up by&#xD;
      email or telephone to answer questions and encourage completion of forms. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on children's sleep is the DIMS score&#xD;
      which will be calculated based on parent-report sleep questionnaire data. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will examine change in sleep and psychosocial health, and parent's psychosocial health. The&#xD;
      outcome measures of change will include measures of children's sleep and psychosocial health,&#xD;
      as well as measures of parents' psychosocial health, and exploratory questionnaires examining&#xD;
      how the intervention works.&#xD;
