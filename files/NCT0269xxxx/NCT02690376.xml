  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroscopy (OGD) is a useful test for investigating a variety of suspected upper GI&#xD;
      disorders. But it is uncomfortable for patients and incurs the risk of intubation and&#xD;
      sedation, plus a large proportion of procedures reveal insignificant or no pathology. Capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy (CE) is the investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe,&#xD;
      non-invasive and well-tolerated. The use of CE is traditionally restricted to the small&#xD;
      bowel, although newer capsules to image the oesophagus and colon are currently in use.&#xD;
      Previous capsules have failed to adequately image the stomach due to its' large volume and&#xD;
      rugal folds. Recently a magnetic capsule and handheld magnet has been developed (Mirocam&#xD;
      Navi, Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea) to enable an element of manoeuvrability of the capsule.&#xD;
      This is unnecessary in the small bowel where the capsule is propelled along its' tubular&#xD;
      structure by peristalsis, but in the capacious stomach this may allow the capsule to be&#xD;
      steered to examine all areas of the stomach. We have already conducted two feasibility&#xD;
      studies in porcine models with promising results and a trial has already evaluated the&#xD;
      equipment to steer the small bowel capsule through the stomach into the duodenum. An ongoing&#xD;
      study is comparing the ability of this technique to examine the stomach against conventional&#xD;
      OGD, in patients with recurrent iron deficiency anaemia. The next stop would be to compare&#xD;
      the two modalities under other different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to undertake a prospective single blind controlled trial comparing magnetically&#xD;
      assisted capsule examination to conventional OGD in diagnosing upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pathology in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intubational endoscopy is uncomfortable for patients and incurs the risks of bleeding,&#xD;
      perforation and sedation related complications. Gastroscopy is the 'gold-standard'&#xD;
      investigation to identify upper gastrointestinal pathology but is poorly tolerated by&#xD;
      patients. Moreover a large proportion of gastroscopies are normal or reveal insignificant&#xD;
      pathology and despite efforts to produce pre-procedure scoring systems to grade the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the procedure, correlation with diagnostic yield is poor. Capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy is very well tolerated but is traditionally reserved for examination of the small&#xD;
      bowel since it cannot be manipulated to view all areas of the capacious stomach. A capsule&#xD;
      which could overcome this and be steered to examine all areas of the mucosal surface of the&#xD;
      stomach as an alternative to intubational endoscopy would be advantageous to patients.&#xD;
      Mirocam Navi (MC1000-WM, Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea) is a small bowel capsule endoscope&#xD;
      with an inclusion of magnetic material. Available accessories include a handheld magnet with&#xD;
      which to gain some control over the capsule in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The capsule&#xD;
      is CE marked (CE0120) with the handheld magnet classed as an accessory. In order to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of our hypothesis we conducted a study in an ex vivo porcine stomach model,&#xD;
      commonly used for endoscopy training purposes. Different coloured/shaped beads were sewn into&#xD;
      each major location of the stomach (cardia, fundus, greater and lesser curve, anterior and&#xD;
      posterior wall, antrum and D1). The stomach was distended with 1000mls of water. Endoscopy&#xD;
      was performed according to a set protocol. All stomach tags were identified in 87.2% (41/47)&#xD;
      of examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was followed by a double blind, randomised controlled trial comparing magnetically&#xD;
      assisted capsule endoscopy (MACE) with conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to&#xD;
      detect coloured beads in a porcine stomach model. Gastroscopy correctly identified 88%&#xD;
      (79/90) beads, MACE correctly identified 89% (80/90) beads and thus is noninferior to&#xD;
      gastroscopy in this setting (95% CI 82.76%-95.24%). Mean examination times for gastroscopy&#xD;
      and MACE were 3.34 minutes and 9.90 minutes respectively. Clearly there are significant&#xD;
      differences between a porcine model and live human stomach. However, these studies provide&#xD;
      proof of the principle that a small bowel capsule endoscope can be manipulated to make&#xD;
      targeted movements within the stomach. We now also have one completed human trial assessing&#xD;
      whether the magnetic controller can be utilised to manipulate the small bowel capsule through&#xD;
      the stomach into the duodenum to improve the completion rate of small bowel capsule&#xD;
      examinations. Another trial is also near completion comparing the diagnostic ability ,within&#xD;
      the stomach, of MACE compared to conventional gastroscopy in the context of recurrent iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to develop the protocol for our study, discussions were made with other health&#xD;
      professionals (consultants, specialist nurses and ward nurses) who are involved in performing&#xD;
      or reporting gastroscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy examinations outside of the&#xD;
      research team. Feedback was used to modify the study protocol so it could be as patient and&#xD;
      user friendly as possible without compromising the overall aim to answer the research&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the protocol has been externally peer reviewed and subsequent modifications&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our porcine and two human trials it is clear that to obtain reasonable views of the&#xD;
      stomach to be able to guide the capsule the stomach needs to be distended. In our porcine&#xD;
      study we achieved good results with 1000mls of water. We felt that this would be an&#xD;
      acceptable amount for a patient to drink prior to magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy,&#xD;
      and the two human trials we have completed to date have proven excellent tolerance to this&#xD;
      volume of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Patients will be offered information about the trial at the time of their initial&#xD;
      clinical encounter in the outpatient clinic. Written information is provided at this stage&#xD;
      and will be followed by confirmation of consent on the day of, but prior to, the procedure.&#xD;
      The research team will be available when the patient attends for their procedures to answer&#xD;
      any questions or concerns. Additionally a contact telephone number for the research team is&#xD;
      provided on the patient information sheet for any other concerns or queries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION We have made every effort to enable the study to be open to a wide range&#xD;
      of patients however we have currently limited the study to patients with upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding to allow the highest possibility for pathology detection for either&#xD;
      endoscopic modality and hence facilitate comparison of diagnostic ability. Specific&#xD;
      considerations have been made to ensure that patients will be excluded from the study if&#xD;
      there is to be any delay/interference to the standard management of upper gastroinstinal&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT All participants will be consented as per the study consent form. All members of the&#xD;
      research team are formally trained in consent procedures and assessment of capacity. Any&#xD;
      participant without capacity to consent will not be included in the trial. The principal&#xD;
      investigator is trained in the ethical principles underpinning informed consent and is bound&#xD;
      to these principles as part of good medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS/BURDENS/BENEFITS The participant is subject to the risk of the procedures of&#xD;
      gastroscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy itself. Bleeding and perforation are the major&#xD;
      risks of undergoing a gastroscopy and occur in 0.02% of procedures. There is also a risk of&#xD;
      sedation related complications if the patient chooses this option. The main risk of SBCE is&#xD;
      retention of the capsule, occurring in up to 2% of examinations. Since the participant is&#xD;
      undergoing these procedures as part of their medical investigation these risks are discussed&#xD;
      when the patient is offered the investigations at the time of booking, they are also formally&#xD;
      consented by a trained individual when they attend for the procedure. Participants are not&#xD;
      felt to be at any additional risk by undergoing magnetically steerable capsule examination of&#xD;
      the stomach.&#xD;
