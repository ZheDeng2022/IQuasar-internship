  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to to characterize the effects of consuming 1 avocado fruit 7 days / week&#xD;
      (5-7 days is acceptable) compared to a no avocado relatively low fat, carbohydrate control&#xD;
      treatment over a 12 week period on insulin sensitivity as measured by the Matsuda composite&#xD;
      index of insulin sensitivity (MISI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a randomized, controlled, statistician blinded, 2-arm parallel study&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of avocado consumption compared to non-avocado control foods which&#xD;
      have opposing macronutrients (avocado is relatively higher in fat and in low carbohydrate and&#xD;
      the control foods will be low fat, high carbohydrate options) on indices of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      health over a 12 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will test 2 treatment conditions in pre-diabetic men and women 25-60 years of age&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome. One hundred twenty men and women will be recruited, aiming for a&#xD;
      completer set of 96 subjects. Qualified Subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 test&#xD;
      treatments based on randomization schedule from a computer generated randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control (CT) diet plan with at least 1 serving of a low fat, low fiber, high glycemic&#xD;
           carbohydrate and eliminate avocado 7 days / week (5-7 days is acceptable) over a 12 week&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment (AT) diet plan will include 1 Avocado 7 days/week (5-7 days is&#xD;
           acceptable) over a 12 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be asked to come for one Screening Visit, 9 interim food pick-up/compliance&#xD;
      visits and 4 Test Day Visits. The four main Test Day visits will occur at week 0 (day 1;&#xD;
      baseline), end of week 4, at the end of week 8 and at the end of week 12. Interim Visits will&#xD;
      occur at week 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11. Subjects will pick-up study foods, answer&#xD;
      questionnaires, receive dietary counseling, confirm diet compliance during interim visits.&#xD;
      They will also be asked to complete online 24 hour food recalls up to once per each week of&#xD;
      the study. Each of the 4 Test Day Visits will last about 2-3.5 h and involve blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) measurements, a fasting blood sample collection and anthropometric, body composition&#xD;
      assessment. In addition, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed at week&#xD;
      0/day 1 and at the end of week 12/day.&#xD;
