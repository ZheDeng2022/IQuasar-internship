      Two innovative approaches, pulsatile orocutaneous entrainment of non-nutritive suck via&#xD;
      orosensory entrainment (NTrainer) device technology and serial salivary gene expression&#xD;
      analyses, will be merged to examine the relation between gene expression, oral somatosensory&#xD;
      stimulation, feeding behavior, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months corrected age&#xD;
      (CA) on 180 extremely preterm infants [EPIs] (24 0/7-26 6/7 GA and 27 0/7 - 28 6/7 GA)&#xD;
      enrolled at three neonatal intensive care units: Catholic Health Initiative (CHI) Health St.&#xD;
      Elizabeth (Lincoln, NE), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA), and Santa Clara Valley Medical&#xD;
      Center (San Jose, CA). EPIs will be randomized to a blind pacifier (SHAM) or PULSED NTrainer&#xD;
      treatment groups, and stratified by GA, sex, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia status (BPD vs&#xD;
      non-BPD). We hypothesize that the combination of the NTrainer® intervention for improved oral&#xD;
      feeding skills, along with objective salivary gene expression data to monitor response to&#xD;
      treatment and feeding development, will result in a novel, objective, and personalized&#xD;
      approach to neonatal oral feeding and reduce the duration of time to attain oral feeds while&#xD;
      improving feeding, growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months' CA.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to combine molecular and behavioral methods in an experimental&#xD;
      conceptualization approach to map the effects of trigeminal (PULSED orocutaneous)&#xD;
      somatosensory stimulation on salivary gene expression in the context of the acquisition of an&#xD;
      exquisitely complex oromotor skill, namely oral feeding, in high-risk human neonates. The&#xD;
      aims of this study represent the first attempt to combine non-invasive treatment strategies&#xD;
      and transcriptomic assessments of high-risk EPIs to (1) improve oral feeding behavior and&#xD;
      skills, (2) further our understanding of the gene ontology of biologically diverse pathways&#xD;
      related to oral feeding, (3) use gene expression data to personalize neonatal care and&#xD;
      individualize treatment strategies and timing interventions, and (4) improve long-term&#xD;
      developmental outcomes. This integrative approach to oral feeding is a paradigm shift in&#xD;
      neonatal care where rapidly emerging technological advances and personalized transcriptomics&#xD;
      can safely and non-invasively be brought to the neonatal bedside to inform medical care&#xD;
      decisions and improve care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Participants: Only EPIs born between 24 0/7 and 28 6/7 weeks' gestation, as&#xD;
      determined by obstetric ultrasound at &lt; 15 weeks or last menstrual period, are eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study. We will actively enroll EPIs once they have a corrected PCA of ≥&#xD;
      29 weeks to limit the number of infants who develop serious sequelae of prematurity and would&#xD;
      not be eligible for this study based upon the criteria listed below. Parents of enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will receive a Babies R Us $50 gift card for their participation. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from four neonatal intensive care units including 1) CHI Health St. Elizabeth&#xD;
      [Lincoln, NE], 2) Tufts Medical Center NICU [Boston, MA], 3) Santa Clara Valley Medical&#xD;
      Center [San Jose, CA], and 4) Childrens Hospital Orange Country [Los Angeles, CA] by a study&#xD;
      site PI/Co-Investigator or the neonatal study coordinator. Informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      prior to participants' entry into the study, following consultation with the attending&#xD;
      physician and nurse(s). A total of 180 EPIs (approximately equal numbers of males and&#xD;
      females, no exclusion based on race/ethnicity) will participate in the study (power &gt;.85,&#xD;
      Type I error &lt;.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: EPIs will not be recruited for this study if they have any of the&#xD;
      following: 1) chromosomal and congenital anomalies including craniofacial malformation,&#xD;
      nervous system anomalies, cyanotic congenital heart disease, gastroschisis, omphalocele,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic hernia and/or other major gastrointestinal anomalies; 2) congenital infection,&#xD;
      3) no documented GA, 4) severe IUGR (3%), 5) abnormal neurological status including head&#xD;
      circumference &lt; 10th or &gt; 90th percentile, intracranial hemorrhage grades III and IV,&#xD;
      seizures, meningitis, neurological examination showing abnormal tone or movements of all&#xD;
      extremities for PCA; 6) history of necrotizing enterocolitis (stage II and III); and, 7)&#xD;
      culture-positive sepsis at the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: EPIs will be stratified among two gestational age groups (24 0/7 - 26 6/7 weeks,&#xD;
      and 27 0/7 - 28 6/7 weeks). Each infant will be randomized to receive either the PULSED&#xD;
      NTrainer or SHAM intervention using a software random integer function in Minitab v.17&#xD;
      (www.minitab.com). Infants assigned to the PULSED NTrainer group will receive a progressive&#xD;
      dose of the pulsatile orocutaneous stimulation. Beginning at 30 weeks' PCA, these infants&#xD;
      will receive 2 weeks of low-dose PULSED NTrainer stimulation (2 x 3-minute blocks) with a&#xD;
      1-minute stimulus 'off-period' between the stimulation blocks. This form of stimulation will&#xD;
      be given simultaneous with tube feedings 3 times/day. The stimulus dose will then be&#xD;
      increased over the next 2 weeks (3 x 3-minute blocks of PULSED NTrainer stimulation) with a&#xD;
      1-minute stimulus 'off-period' between the stimulation blocks, also given simultaneously with&#xD;
      tube feedings 3 times/day. EPIs randomized to the SHAM condition will be given a regular&#xD;
      silicone pacifier during tube feedings over the same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1-minute rest period (no stimulation) occurs between stimulation blocks. Criteria for&#xD;
      initiation of orocutaneous therapy include the following: 1) stable vital signs and not on&#xD;
      continuous vasopressor medications; 2) tolerating enteral feeds in previous 48 hours; and 3)&#xD;
      not intubated and mechanically ventilated. If the infant is on nasal intermittent positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure or nasal cannula &gt;2 liters per&#xD;
      minute, then the FiO2 must be &lt;40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NNS Assessment and Automated NNS Digital Signal Processing and Feature Extraction: In&#xD;
      addition to the oral stimulation interventions (PULSED NTrainer vs. SHAM pacifier), all study&#xD;
      infants will be assessed 3 times/week (e.g., M/W/F) for NNS performance. The NTrainer System&#xD;
      will be used in 'assessment mode' to record the compression dynamics of NNS during a 3-minute&#xD;
      session to immediately precede a tube feeding that is not associated with an intervention&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most active 2-minute period of NNS behavior based on suck cycle count is automatically&#xD;
      extracted from each suck assessment data file using an automated waveform feature extraction&#xD;
      algorithm on the NTrainer System. Pressure peaks &gt; 1.6 cm H2O are subjected to feature&#xD;
      extraction criteria, including suck cycle symmetry, cycle duration, and burst identification&#xD;
      defined as two or more NNS events occurring within 1200 ms. This algorithm permits objective&#xD;
      identification of NNS burst activity distinct from non-NNS mouthing compressions or tongue&#xD;
      thrusts against the pacifier. Four measures will be objectively extracted from the indexed&#xD;
      records of suck compression, including minute-rates for (1) NNS Bursts where an individual&#xD;
      burst includes 2 or more suck cycles, (2) NNS Cycle Events defined as suck compression cycles&#xD;
      with cycle periods less than 1200 ms, (3) Total Oral Compressions defined as the sum of all&#xD;
      pressure events, and (4) NNS compression pressure expressed in cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PO Feeding Advancement: EPIs will advance on a standardized cue-based feeding schedule&#xD;
      utilized by each site NICU, known as Infant Driven Feeding® that will lead to full nipple&#xD;
      feeds. This standardization of oral feeding advancements across sites will limit confounders&#xD;
      that may ultimately skew the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Collection, Processing, and Gene Expression Analysis: Saliva Collection: Saliva&#xD;
      samples will be collected from all enrolled infants on the first day prior to receiving&#xD;
      either the SHAM or PULSED NTrainer intervention. This sample will serve as our baseline gene&#xD;
      expression profile. Samples will then be obtained twice per week (~ 3 day intervals) up to&#xD;
      the time of achievement of full oral feeds or discharge home from the hospital with either a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube (NG) or gastronomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples at each site will be collected with techniques that have been optimized and&#xD;
      validated through the Maron laboratory. Briefly, saliva samples will be collected with a 1 mL&#xD;
      syringe, end caps removed and attached to low wall suction. Saliva will be collected for&#xD;
      approximately 20 seconds and immediately stabilized in 500 μL of Qiagen's RNA Protect Saliva&#xD;
      to halt gene expression changes, inhibit destructive RNases, and limit microbial overgrowth.&#xD;
      Samples will be vortexed briefly and frozen at -20 deg C. Once frozen, samples are stable for&#xD;
      up to 18 months prior to the need for total RNA extraction. Thus, samples from Nebraska and&#xD;
      Santa Clara will be shipped once a month on ice overnight to the Maron laboratory at the&#xD;
      Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generation of a Saliva Biobank: One additional saliva sample will be obtained each week from&#xD;
      all enrolled subjects to generate a biobank repository. Banking an additional sample each&#xD;
      week from study subjects will ensure that we will limit loss of data points. We anticipate&#xD;
      that there are informative salivary biomarkers of oral feeding maturation that have yet to be&#xD;
      identified. By generating a biobank of additional saliva samples that may be retrospectively&#xD;
      interrogated on either a microarray gene expression platform or with RNASeq, we will have the&#xD;
      potential to discover novel hypotheses about gene-gene interactions and/or transcriptional&#xD;
      regulatory processes related to oral feeding in the EPI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA Extraction: Salivary samples will extracted for total RNA using established&#xD;
      protocols optimized in the Maron laboratory. RNA extraction will occur with the QIAGEN&#xD;
      RNAProtect Saliva Mini kit per manufacturer's instructions. On column DNase treatment will be&#xD;
      performed for each sample to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Samples that are part of&#xD;
      the biobank will be frozen at -80°C pending need for future analysis. Samples that will be&#xD;
      used for RT-qPCR experiments will first undergo cDNA conversion with the Life Technologies&#xD;
      SuperScript Vilo kit per manufacturer's instructions. cDNA will be stored at -80°C in the&#xD;
      Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center pending gene expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene Expression Analysis: For the purpose of this study, we will interrogate each sample for&#xD;
      nine genes, six target genes of interest and three reference genes for quality control and&#xD;
      potential normalization of gene expression data. Genes to be analyzed in this study have been&#xD;
      previously shown to be directly linked to oral feeding in the newborn and include PLXNA1,&#xD;
      PLXNA3, NPY2R, WNT3, AMPK, and NPHP4. The three reference genes include GAPDH, HPRT1, and&#xD;
      YWHAZ, all of which have been shown to maintain stable gene expression across advancing PCA.&#xD;
      All cDNA samples will undergo a targeted pre-amplification with a custom TaqMan® PreAmp&#xD;
      Master Mix for all nine genes. This targeted approach to amplification will ensure that only&#xD;
      those genes of interest will be amplified and not all genes across the transcriptome which&#xD;
      may introduce bias. Preamplified cDNA will then undergo PCR with TaqMan Fast Advance Master&#xD;
      Mix on the Life Technologies Quant Studio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. This instrument is&#xD;
      housed with the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center and is an advanced&#xD;
      state-of-the-art PCR machine and software system. All efforts will be made to adhere to the&#xD;
      Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE)&#xD;
      guidelines for this study. All samples will be run in duplicate with appropriate positive and&#xD;
      negative controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Gene Expression Analyses: All gene expression data will be normalized on the Quant&#xD;
      Studio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System. Only samples that have successful amplification of all&#xD;
      three reference genes will be considered in the analysis. Previously, genes have been&#xD;
      informative in a binary fashion (+/- expression). However, for the purpose of this study, we&#xD;
      will be prepared to calculate relative gene expression of each target gene with the delta&#xD;
      delta cycle threshold (ΔΔCt) method. In accordance to the MIQE guidelines, we will use the&#xD;
      three reference genes for normalization and determine a geometric mean of their Ct in each&#xD;
      sample to calculate relative gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up: As part of standard of care, each site will complete the Bayley&#xD;
      Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Edition, on EPIs at 18 to 24 months' corrected&#xD;
      age (CA). The primary subtests of interest include Fine Motor, Gross Motor, Cognition, and&#xD;
      Language. These data will be recorded, analyzed, and correlated with feeding outcomes in the&#xD;
      neo-and post-natal period, gene expression data, and intervention status. In addition, growth&#xD;
      parameters including head circumference, length and weight will be recorded.&#xD;
