  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative brain damage and neuropsychological disorders have been observed in 30 - 80 %&#xD;
      of patients after heart surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).They can persist&#xD;
      up to a year after cardiac surgery and are associated with increased hospital mortality and&#xD;
      prolonged intrahospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoperfusion,hyperthermia,atrial fibrillation,genetic predisposition and systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response associated with CPB have been identified as pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms.However, some authors consider cerebral embolisation to be the prevalent mechanism&#xD;
      of intraoperative brain injury after cardiac surgery,as gaseous or solid cerebral emboli can&#xD;
      cause ischemia, inflammation and edema,consequently causing cerebral infarctions usually&#xD;
      resulting with stroke,coma,encephalopathy, delirium and cognitive decline. Additionally,they&#xD;
      may impair cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic valve replacement (AVR) preformed by full sternotomy is the standard approach in the&#xD;
      treatment of aortic valve disease. Minimally invasive (MIS) aortic valve replacement has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce postoperative mortality, morbidity, and pain while providing faster recovery,&#xD;
      a shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic results. However, due to technically more&#xD;
      demanding procedure, MIS may lead to prolonged CPB time and incomplete de-airing of the heart&#xD;
      with an increased risk for cerebral gas embolization. Therefore, the choice of MIS might bear&#xD;
      an augmented risk for brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) enables real time detection of intraoperative emboli in the&#xD;
      cerebral arteries seen as microembolic signals (MES), and is an essential neuromonitoring&#xD;
      tool. Several studies demonstrated correlation between the number of MES and the occurrence&#xD;
      as well as severity of postoperative neurological complications. However, the factors&#xD;
      contributing to brain injury have not been elucidated in those studies. The investigators&#xD;
      speculate that impairment of CVR is an important mechanism that persists and prolongs the&#xD;
      duration of brain injury into postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare two surgical approaches used for AVR, with focus on the&#xD;
      number of MES and their impact on levels of protein S100B (marker of brain tissue&#xD;
      damage),postoperative CVR and cognitive function With the results,the investigators aim to&#xD;
      help surgeons in selecting the appropriate technique for AVR in individual participants,as&#xD;
      well as to clarify the effect of aortic valve surgery on the brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing for aortic valve replacement will be enrolled in the study after giving&#xD;
      the signed informed consent and will be divided in two groups depending on the type of the&#xD;
      surgical technique. Either full sternotomy (FS) or minimal invasive sternotomy (MIS) will be&#xD;
      performed, both with the use of cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB).One week before and one week&#xD;
      after the surgery patients will undergo mini mental test and measurement of visually evoked&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow velocity response (VEFR).Levels of S100B, interleukin (IL) 1, IL 6, IL 8,&#xD;
      IL 10 and microparticles will be determined before induction of anesthesia,as well as 6 h, 24&#xD;
      h, 48 h and 7 days after CPB.Each patient will have invasive and non invasive monitoring that&#xD;
      will include near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), bispectral index (BIS) and TCD during&#xD;
      surgery.MES will be detected using TCD at the following time-points: beginning of surgery,&#xD;
      after sternotomy, during aortic cannulation, during CPB, during de-airing, opening of the&#xD;
      clamp on the aorta and after CBP removal before chest closure.All of this data will be&#xD;
      documented as well as the demographic characteristics of patients, their preoperative medical&#xD;
      status, and intraoperative data (duration of surgery, duration of CPB, hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters, inotropic/vasoactive support,blood and blood components); duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), duration of ICU stay, 30-day mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, as well as postoperative complications.&#xD;
