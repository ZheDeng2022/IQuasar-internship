      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing that melanomas which respond and develop eventual disease&#xD;
      stability in response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy undergo a genetic program&#xD;
      promoting secondary resistance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding these genetic alterations and the factors which contribute to this process&#xD;
      would be critical for the identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets which may&#xD;
      synergize with the T cell-targeted checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this work promises to&#xD;
      provide greater insight into tumor-mediated immune evasion mechanisms and primary&#xD;
      immunotherapy resistance, potentially unveiling predictive markers of clinical response for&#xD;
      our expanding arsenal of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients who exhibit a response to the anti-PD-1 antibodies develop a prolonged course&#xD;
      of disease stability which resembles the equilibrium phase of the previously proposed process&#xD;
      of cancer immunoediting. This state of equipoise has been hypothesized to involve genetic&#xD;
      alterations that promote immune evasion and, in some cases, lead to the development of tumor&#xD;
      escape. Based on our data, the investigators propose that melanomas that develop a period of&#xD;
      disease stability in response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy exhibit genetic alterations that&#xD;
      suppress the effectiveness of anti-tumor immunity. Our previous studies indicate that the&#xD;
      tumor-derived factors that play a role in the paracrine signaling pathways capable of&#xD;
      regulating nearby stromal cell populations are more likely to be critical immune regulators&#xD;
      of the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the investigators will focus our studies on those&#xD;
      differentially expressed genes which encode soluble proteins using an available prediction&#xD;
      algorithm. Those genes identified by this study to be differentially expressed in the&#xD;
      melanoma tissues of patients demonstrating a clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy will be further evaluated in transgenic autochthonous melanoma models.&#xD;
