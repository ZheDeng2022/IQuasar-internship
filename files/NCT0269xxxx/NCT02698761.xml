    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder affecting 80,000 to&#xD;
      90,000 individuals in the United States.[10] There are 13,000 hospital admissions for a&#xD;
      sickle cell crises, costing $448 million dollars annually.[10] In our hospital, the sickle&#xD;
      cell population is known to have some of the longest length of stays. Between October 2014&#xD;
      and September 2015, there were 89 admissions for a vaso-occlusive crisis with an average&#xD;
      length of stay of 6 days and 12 admissions greater than 10 days and 5 admissions greater than&#xD;
      20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the feasibility of the new CPP in a pilot randomized control trial to&#xD;
      determine if pain and length of stay can be reduced in patients with sickle cell disease. We&#xD;
      also propose to evaluate a sleep regimen to determine if this can reduce the hospital stay&#xD;
      and help with pain. We hypothesize increased physical activity and proper sleep, as&#xD;
      implemented in the CPP, are correlated with decreased hospital length of stay and decreased&#xD;
      pain. Additionally, we believe that creating a standardized nighttime environment at the&#xD;
      hospital will help the children stay in their circadian rhythm thus promoting improved sleep&#xD;
      and a more effective inpatient disease management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that results&#xD;
      in several interactive processes: polymerization of hemoglobin S (HbS), hemolysis, nitric&#xD;
      oxide depletion, and vaso-occlusion.[3] The most common manifestations of sickle cell disease&#xD;
      are vaso-occlusive pain events, specifically dactylitis which typically occurs as the first&#xD;
      clinical manifestation.[4] As patients age, the early onset peripheral pain moves to more&#xD;
      central regions resulting in increased severity of vaso-occlusive crises.[4] Pain from the&#xD;
      blockage of sickeled cells in vessels causes poor blood flow to a localized area. There are&#xD;
      few clinical and laboratory findings to indicate the severity of pain associated with sickle&#xD;
      cell crisis,[4] making it difficult for a physician to identify the amount of pain the&#xD;
      patient actually experiences. Length of stay in the hospital depends largely on physician&#xD;
      discretion and patient report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep is instrumental to many aspects of physical and emotional health during childhood and&#xD;
      adolescence. Sleep disruption from pain is a significant concern in patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease due to the prevalence of their acute and chronic pain.[7] In a study conducted by&#xD;
      Daniel et al., sickle cell patients between 4-10 years old, were more likely to exhibit&#xD;
      disrupted sleep, specifically night-waking and sleep-disordered breathing, than children who&#xD;
      were not diagnosed with sickle cell disease from similar demographic backgrounds. [7]&#xD;
      Furthermore, children with more severe forms of sickle cell disease were reported to have&#xD;
      more restless sleep than children with less severe forms. [7] Overall, the literature&#xD;
      suggests that sleep disruptions may interfere with children's daily functions, along with&#xD;
      their ability to cope with SCD and its complications.[7] Daniel et al. recommends discussing&#xD;
      ways to improve sleep habits with children suffering from SCD because it may increase&#xD;
      efficacy in pain management, priapism, and enuresis.[7] Another study by Valrie etal.,&#xD;
      suggests that poor quality of sleep is correlated with increased occurrence of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease pain the following day.[9] They also discovered that high pain severity was related&#xD;
      to poor sleep quality and this relationship was exacerbated during stressful situations.[9]&#xD;
      Developing a suitable sleeping environment (e.g. removing the television, or limiting the&#xD;
      lighting) will maximize sleep efficacy resulting in better health outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life.[7] There has been minimal research on evaluating the relationship between exercise and&#xD;
      sickle cell disease in children and adolescents. Studies conducted on sickle cell disease in&#xD;
      adults with respect to the effects of exercise have produced mixed results partly due to&#xD;
      patient comorbid illnesses. In 2012, Chirico et al. compared two fitness level group&#xD;
      including, subjects who did not partake in regular physical activity for two years prior to&#xD;
      the study versus subjects who partook in regular, weekly physical activity for several years&#xD;
      leading up to the study. [5] Both groups contained sickle cell trait carriers and subjects&#xD;
      with normal hemoglobin. [5] Subjects performed an incremental maximum exercise test while&#xD;
      data was collected on heart rate via a chest monitor and on oxidative stress levels via blood&#xD;
      samples at various points following completion of the exercise task. [5] Results indicated&#xD;
      regular physical activity helped to blunt the increase in oxidative stress and the decrease&#xD;
      in nitric oxide metabolism and up regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities in response to&#xD;
      exercise in sickle cell trait carriers. [5] These findings suggest an attenuated sickle cell&#xD;
      crisis in the subjects with regular exercise when compared with the sedentary group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, at Phoenix Children's Hospital, no protocol exists for management of sleep and&#xD;
      exercise in sickle cell patients. The most relevant policy named &quot;Parenting and Visitation&quot;&#xD;
      includes guidelines regarding sleep and visiting hours but these are not well enforced. In&#xD;
      our hospital, the sickle cell population is known to have some of the longest length of&#xD;
      stays. Between October 2014 and September 2015, there were 89 admissions for a vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crisis with an average length of stay of 6 days and 12 admissions greater than 10 days and 5&#xD;
      admissions greater than 20 days. Prior research suggests that implementation of standardized&#xD;
      care (e.g. order sets, protocols, and flowcharts) can improve compliance and patient outcomes&#xD;
      [8], reduce overall length of stay, and mitigate costs. Therefore, we have developed a new&#xD;
      comprehensive care plan (CPP) that enhances standard of care by including the following care&#xD;
      aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA). PCA will be initiated and managed at the discretion&#xD;
           of the Pain Management team. Naloxone infusion will be available for opioid related side&#xD;
           effects. Once tapered, patients will be transitioned to oral opioids to be administered&#xD;
           as needed. Patients will be discharged home, when appropriate, with oral opioids and&#xD;
           weaning instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other Medications. All medications will be given during daytime hours, if possible. All&#xD;
           home medications will be continued while inpatient. Ketorolac will be given&#xD;
           intravenously every 6 hours for 12 doses then switched to ibuprofen by mouth every 6&#xD;
           hours until discharge home. Stool softeners will be utilized while on narcotics to&#xD;
           prevent constipation. A clonidine patch may be used for adjunct analgesia and&#xD;
           anxiolysis. A lidocaine patch may be used for localized pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pain Psychology. Consultations will begin on Day 2 and continue as needed. The&#xD;
           psychologist will teach the patient sleep hygiene techniques, and non-pharmacologic pain&#xD;
           management skills including: distraction, diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle&#xD;
           relaxation, and guided imagery with medical hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical Therapy. Consultations will begin on Day 2 and continue as needed. Patient is&#xD;
           expected to spend time out of bed by Day 2 participating in light activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sleep Hygiene. Will be introduced to the experimental group. Patient must sleep between&#xD;
           the hours of 10 PM and 5 AM daily. Window blinds will be open by 8 AM. Patient must be&#xD;
           awake and ready to participate in therapies by 9 AM. Napping will be at the discretion&#xD;
           of the physician. Practitioners should examine care orders critically, such as routine&#xD;
           vital signs, and determine if it is safe and/or appropriate to defer these during sleep.&#xD;
           Room lights will be turned off to help promote the circadian rhythm. No video games,&#xD;
           television, cell phones, or computers will be allowed during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Extracurricular. Will participate in child life activities as recommended (e.g.&#xD;
           Playroom, or Zone). TV, phone, computer, and video games only between hours of 4-9 PM&#xD;
           (computer okay outside of hours only for school work).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Other. Patient will eat meals during regular daytime hours (e.g. breakfast consumed&#xD;
           before 9 am) and shower daily. No overnight visitors will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the feasibility of the new CPP in a pilot randomized control trial to&#xD;
      determine if pain and length of stay can be reduced in patients with sickle cell disease. We&#xD;
      also propose to evaluate a sleep regimen to determine if this can reduce the hospital stay&#xD;
      and help with pain. We hypothesize increased physical activity and proper sleep, as&#xD;
      implemented in the CPP, are correlated with decreased hospital length of stay and decreased&#xD;
      pain. Additionally, we believe that creating a standardized nighttime environment at the&#xD;
      hospital will help the children stay in their circadian rhythm thus promoting improved sleep&#xD;
      and a more effective inpatient disease management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Primary: To determine the feasibility and efficacy of the CPP to reduce pain&#xD;
      and length of stay in patients with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.To evaluate if patients who follow the CPP physical activity regimen will have less pain&#xD;
      and shorter hospital stay than patients receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.To measure if patients who follow the CPP sleep activity regimen will have less pain and&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay than patients receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective pilot study of 20 subjects who have sickle-cell disease&#xD;
      and are admitted to Phoenix Children's Hospital for an acute vaso-occlusive crisis. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized via a random number generator with equal probability of assignment to&#xD;
      either CPP (experimental) or standard of care (control) trial arm. Eligible subjects and&#xD;
      their family will be approached during the first day of hospital admission for consent to&#xD;
      participate and randomization. After randomization, all subjects will be given multiple&#xD;
      questionnaires to evaluate their current sleep habits, activity levels, and psychological&#xD;
      constructs Procedures During the enrollment visit, questionnaires will be administered to&#xD;
      every subject to evaluate current sleep habits, activity levels, pain, and quality of life.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the Actiwatch Spectrum Pro and be given instructions on how to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Patient will receive standard of care. Nursing staff will be aware of study&#xD;
      presence but will not receive any specific instruction for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group: During the enrollment visit, patient will go over the new comprehensive&#xD;
      care protocol with the study staff and will sign the agreement stating compliance. Patient&#xD;
      will be given a copy of the comprehensive care plan for reference. Nursing staff will be&#xD;
      aware of study's presence and will help to support patient's compliance with sleep and other&#xD;
      procedures according to care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge Study staff will closely follow the patient's progress in the hospital. Once&#xD;
      patient is ready for discharge, they will have a visit with study investigators and be given&#xD;
      one final PedsQL™ to complete. An additional questionnaire will be given to the experimental&#xD;
      group asking their opinion about the CPP. The Actiwatch Spectrum Pro will be collected from&#xD;
      the patients and be properly disinfected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement/Assessments Actiwatch Spectrum Pro Monitoring Device The Actiwatch Spectrum Pro&#xD;
      activity device will continuously monitor activity (active minutes), sleep (minutes slept and&#xD;
      quality) and allow the subject to input their numerical pain or fatigue rating. At the end of&#xD;
      the patient's trial, the data will be extracted from the actiwatch and placed into the&#xD;
      patient's alphanumeric account that is monitored by the research personnel. Patients or&#xD;
      families will not have access to the accounts. We will examine the minutes of activity per&#xD;
      day and minutes of sleep per day and compare it to the pain scores recorded by looking at the&#xD;
      data extracted from the Actiwatch Spectrum Pro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Baseline characteristics will be summarized within the two care groups using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics including count and percent for categorical variables and the mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (median and interquartile ranges) for continuous variables. Evaluation of&#xD;
      the CPP with length of stay will be done using the T-test or the Kruskal-Wallis test,&#xD;
      depending on the length of stay distribution. Analysis of variance for repeated measures will&#xD;
      assess the effect of time on pain scores within care groups. Differences in mean cumulative&#xD;
      pain scores between care groups will also be examined daily during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analyses will investigate the association of care components, physical activity&#xD;
      and sleep, with length of stay and pain scores using appropriate statistical methods as&#xD;
      described above. All statistical tests will have a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
