  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, prospective, non-randomised research study. The research team will&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of assessing primary human pancreatic tissue for changes to T&#xD;
      lymphocyte function and localisation in the presence and absence of AMD3100.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries.&#xD;
      It is a lethal disease that typically presents late, metastasises early and is resistant to&#xD;
      conventional treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. In 2012 there were 8700 deaths in&#xD;
      the UK from pancreatic cancer, making it the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapeutic strategies are aimed at extending survival as well as improving symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life, but although conventional chemotherapeutic agents have achieved modest&#xD;
      clinical benefit, the need for novel therapies is great.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to extend our pre-clinical studies to develop an ex-vivo assay for the&#xD;
      assessment of AMD3100 effectiveness in human samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will investigate the feasibility of assessing primary human pancreatic&#xD;
      tissue for changes to T lymphocyte function and localisation in the presence and absence of&#xD;
      AMD3100 through obtaining a blood sample and fresh pancreatic tissue intra-operatively from&#xD;
      pancreatic tumours located in the head of the pancreas.&#xD;
