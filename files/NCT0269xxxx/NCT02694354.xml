        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete medical&#xD;
             history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG, and&#xD;
             clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in&#xD;
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and local legislation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) is deviating from&#xD;
             normal and judged as clinically relevant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 100 to 140 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 60 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the&#xD;
             range of 50 to 90 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
             immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with&#xD;
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia&#xD;
             repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial&#xD;
             medication or its excipients)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10&#xD;
             half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might&#xD;
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/corrected&#xD;
             QT interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more 24 g per day for males)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial&#xD;
             medication or intended donation during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to&#xD;
             administration of trial medication or during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT interval (such as corrected QT&#xD;
             intervals that are repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males) or any other relevant ECG&#xD;
             finding at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,&#xD;
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a&#xD;
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study&#xD;
