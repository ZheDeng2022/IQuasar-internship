    <textblock>
      This research study is testing the safety and feasibility of delivering the 4 cycles of&#xD;
      'dose-dense' paclitaxel without the use of Neulasta (Pegfilgrastim) as a Granulocyte&#xD;
      Colony-stimulating Factor (G-CSF) support. The research study is for participants who have&#xD;
      early stage breast cancer and have been recommended to receive a standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen, doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) plus Paclitaxel (T), in what is called a&#xD;
      &quot;dose-dense&quot; fashion to prevent recurrences.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low white cell blood counts increase the risk of infections; thus, in order to give each&#xD;
      cycle of chemotherapy, white blood cell count must have recovered adequately in between&#xD;
      cycles. Traditionally, this regimen has been given with the use of a medicine called Neulasta&#xD;
      (Pegfilgrastim) to speed the recovery of the white blood cell count in order to maximize the&#xD;
      chances that the next cycle of chemotherapy can be given on time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Neulasta (Pegfilgrastim)&#xD;

    <description>We will compare charges/payments for study patients versus a matched set of non-study patients who were treated with dose-dense paclitaxel and also received pegfilgrastim at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 2012-present. Pegfilgrastim patients will have had reimbursement for this agent, either as a facility administered medication or prescription, within the one-year observation window. Study and non-study patients will be matched based on their propensity to receive pegfilgrastim; the propensity score will be derived from a logistic regression model that includes age, race, co-morbidity and stage as covariates. Total charges/payments will be calculated during the year after diagnosis, adjusted for inflation, and expressed as 2016 $United States. We will also assess charges/payments for specific services, including facility administered medications (i.e., chemotherapy), emergency department/inpatient hospitalizations, ambulatory clinic visits, and prescriptions.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage I-III breast cancer&#xD;
             (as defined by the revised, American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition criteria)&#xD;
             and be at sufficient risk for tumor recurrence. Staging studies to exclude metastatic&#xD;
             disease are not required in asymptomatic patients. However, patients with findings&#xD;
             considered suspicious for metastatic disease on any staging studies that are obtained&#xD;
             need to be evaluated to exclude stage IV breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed by their treating oncologist as candidates for (neo) adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy with dose dense AC and T.&#xD;

             exception of alopecia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate blood marrow function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 µL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Platelets ≥100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate hepatic function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.2 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Premenopausal women (including women who have had a tubal ligation and for women&#xD;
                  less than 12 months after the onset of menopause) must have a negative serum&#xD;
                  pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with risk factors for Hepatitis B or C should be tested (anti-hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (HCV) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or Hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody). Risk factors include: history of unprotected sexual intercourse,&#xD;
             intravenous drug use, or originally from endemic regions. If infection is suspected,&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and HCV RNA should be requested as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Patients with positive Hepatitis B or C serologies without known active disease&#xD;
             must meet the eligibility requirements for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase and must have a normal international normalized ratio (INR) on at least&#xD;
             two consecutive occasions, separated by at least 1 week, within the 30 day screening&#xD;

             or previous therapeutic radiation therapy for any reason in the last 5 years. Because&#xD;
             of possible limitations in bone marrow reserve, patients with such prior treatments&#xD;
             are not appropriate candidates for this trial. Patients who have had prior hormonal&#xD;
             therapy (for instance, tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer) are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients who have participated in a window study (treatment with an investigational&#xD;
             agent prior to surgery for ≤2 weeks) are eligible but must have discontinued the&#xD;
             investigational agent at least 14 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had at least one prior episode of fever and neutropenia (ANC&lt; 500/mm3 or expected&#xD;
             to fall below &lt; 500/mm3) during AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking lithium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chronic treatment with oral steroids or another immunosuppressive&#xD;
             agent (excluding steroids as part of the chemotherapy pre-medication or emetic&#xD;
             medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive individuals or with any immunodeficiency status.&#xD;

             malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Paclitaxel, which cannot be managed by premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements or other significant diseases or disorders that, in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion, would exclude the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
