  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection damages body defence mainly by affecting two&#xD;
      important white blood cells called cluster of differentiation (CD4) T cells and monocytes.&#xD;
      This immune dysfunction leads to persistent inflammation, which is partially resolved with&#xD;
      long-term anti-HIV therapy. Importantly, such inflammation increases risk for cardiovascular,&#xD;
      diabetes, and kidney diseases. The causes of this inflammation are largely unknown and&#xD;
      include HIV itself, presence of other infections, lifestyle characteristics like increased&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse. In addition, inflammation can be&#xD;
      driven by certain type of anti-HIV therapy called protease inhibitor (PI). PI has been&#xD;
      associated with an increase of cholesterol and may contribute to inflammation. A new class of&#xD;
      medication that is now available in Canada called integrase inhibitor (II) may have a lesser&#xD;
      or no effect on cholesterol levels. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of II on&#xD;
      cholesterol levels and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the inflammatory changes, in the blood of persons&#xD;
      treated with PI that will switch to the II or may remain on their PI-containing regimen. By&#xD;
      comparing persons continuing their current PI-based regimen with those who switch to II-based&#xD;
      regimen, we will know if the change from PI to raltegravir (Isentress), a type of II,&#xD;
      decreases lipids and inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult persons living with HIV, who are on PI-based therapy for more than a year, with any&#xD;
      CD4 T cell count and plasma viral load below level of detection, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. 40 study participants will be selected by randomization (like a&#xD;
      toss of a coin) to either continue PI-based regimen (20 participants) or switch to&#xD;
      raltegravir-based regimen (20 participants) for a period of 12 months. Blood samples of the&#xD;
      study participants will be drawn before, during and at the end of study to evaluate changes&#xD;
      in markers of inflammation, cholesterol level and CD4 T cell and monocyte function. No&#xD;
      experimental anti-HIV medication will be used; change of therapy will include raltegravir&#xD;
      which is one of currently recommended medications to treat HIV in Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be able to answer this important question whether inflammation can be&#xD;
      decreased by switching therapy from PI-based therapy to raltegravir-based therapy.&#xD;
      Ultimately, information provided by this study will contribute to the health of persons&#xD;
      living with HIV.&#xD;
