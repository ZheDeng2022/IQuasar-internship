  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to measure the effect of proprioceptive training,&#xD;
      short-term, on dynamic postural balance during pregnancy and after 8 weeks of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-nine pregnant women were randomized to either the intervention group(n=20) , which&#xD;
      would perform proprioceptive exercise, or the control group(n=19, no intervention) .&#xD;

      Improvement in the postural balance of pregnant women may be the improvement in joint&#xD;
      mechanoreceptor activation present in the joint capsules, medial ligament, posterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament, and meniscus, which result in improved articular stabilization and, consequently, a&#xD;
      possible increase in the musculature's ability to provide co-contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved their postural control after the intervention may have been due to central and&#xD;
      peripheral nervous system balance control circuits and strength gains, which showed&#xD;
      improvements extending from the second to the third trimester . The maintenance of postural&#xD;
      balance requires the integration of the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the spinal level, first level of motor control, nervous reflex movement patterns are&#xD;
      received from higher levels of the nervous system. This provides for reflex splinting during&#xD;
      conditions of abnormal stress about the joint and has significant implications for&#xD;
      rehabilitation.The muscle spindles play a major role in the control of muscular movement by&#xD;
      adjusting activity in the lower motor neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second level of motor control is the brain stem, where the joint afferent is relayed to&#xD;
      maintain the posture and balance of the body. Information delivered to the brain stem&#xD;
      emanates from the joint proprioceptors, the vestibular centers in the ears, and the eyes.The&#xD;
      final aspect of motor control includes the highest level of CNS function (motor cortex, basal&#xD;
      ganglia, and cerebellum)and is mediated by cognitive awareness of body position and movement.&#xD;
      Movements that are repeated can be stored as central commands, and can be performed without&#xD;
      continuous reference to consciousness. This better joint afferent between the peripheral and&#xD;
      central nervous system control may be reflected in the improvement of balance during&#xD;
      pregnancy, as observed in this study as a result of proprioceptive training delivered to&#xD;
      pregnant women.&#xD;
