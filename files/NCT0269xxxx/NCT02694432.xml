    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of adding an online mind-body-behavior program&#xD;
      to an existing behavioral self-management support platform that has been modified to promote&#xD;
      achievement of blood pressure goals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacious hypertension therapies are well-documented, yet 40% of treated patients do not&#xD;
      meet the blood pressure goals set by the Joint National Committee. This gap between&#xD;
      scientific evidence and clinical outcomes in part reflects low patient adherence to lifestyle&#xD;
      recommendations (e.g., physical activity, weight and diet), as well as medication&#xD;
      non-adherence. Accordingly, growing attention is focused on the need to provide patients with&#xD;
      effective self-management support tools. In addition to finding ways to help patients adhere&#xD;
      to currently prescribed hypertension care, it is useful to consider the range of treatment&#xD;
      options that are offered. Evidence-based reviews have identified stress reduction as an&#xD;
      effective tool for reducing blood pressure, yet such approaches are typically not implemented&#xD;
      in practice. This omission represents a chance to improve the quality of hypertension care by&#xD;
      adding stress management self-management tools. Furthermore, since patients have demonstrated&#xD;
      a clear interest in mindfulness, the incorporation of a holistic mind-body intervention is an&#xD;
      innovative approach to inherently patient-centered care. Increasing data supports the use of&#xD;
      mindfulness for treating health concerns. Its holistic nature may be particularly well-suited&#xD;
      to developing and maintaining healthy lifestyles, since lifestyle impacts diverse aspects of&#xD;
      physical and psychological health. Yet the potential for mindfulness in health&#xD;
      self-management has not been realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited but promising data demonstrate the effectiveness of web-based counseling for behavior&#xD;
      modification to improve common chronic disease risk factors. It is an ideal solution to&#xD;
      provider time constraints and a potential solution to patient non-adherence to lifestyle&#xD;
      recommendations. Health information technology provides a way to make self-management support&#xD;
      affordable, convenient and feasible. The investigators have developed a convenient behavioral&#xD;
      self-management support platform, &quot;Goal-oriented Online Access to Lifestyle Support&quot; (GOALS)&#xD;
      for primary care patients, which has promoted weight loss and improved blood pressure control&#xD;
      among primary care patients with weight-related cardiovascular risk factors. To maximize the&#xD;
      ability of patients to achieve blood pressure goals, the investigators propose to add an&#xD;
      online mind-body-behavior program to GOALS: &quot;Minding GOALS.&quot; The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of using this program for self-management support, in coordination with&#xD;
      primary care, in a group of 76 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In preparation for a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial comparing the online tool to online traditional self-management&#xD;
      support, the investigators will assess implementation and determine 1) the availability of&#xD;
      eligible and willing subjects using the proposed recruitment methods, 2) the feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering the proposed interventions in the population of interest, and 3) the viability of&#xD;
      the proposed measurement protocols.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will use for approximately four months an online platform, GOALS, consisting of weekly lessons designed to enhance blood pressure control. Recommended lifestyle changes for hypertension, including a low-sodium diet, physical activity, weight loss (if appropriate) and behavioral self-management skills will be offered. Attention to medication adherence and pharmacist support as well as that of a dedicated online health coach and ongoing collaboration with the primary care physician are also provided.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will also use the GOALS standard tools for blood pressure control. To further maximize success, they will receive additional online behavioral training throughout the 4-month intervention that focuses on mind-body approaches. Weekly topics, for example, will include meditation lessons, mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based eating awareness.</description>
