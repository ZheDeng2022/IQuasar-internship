      This 12-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-center trial evaluated the impact of&#xD;
      a microcrystalline zinc-hydroxyapatite (mHA) dentifrice on plaque formation rate (PFR) in&#xD;
      periodontitis patients. The investigators hypothesized that mHA precipitates cause delayed&#xD;
      plaque development when compared to a fluoridated control (AmF/SnF2), and therefore would&#xD;
      improve periodontal health.&#xD;

      Study Objectives and Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      a new dentifrice, containing carbonate/hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (BioRepair®, Kurt Wolff,&#xD;
      Bielefeld, Germany), in subjects suffering from severe gingivitis and/or mild to moderate&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis and receiving non-surgical periodontal therapy. Clinical efficacy will&#xD;
      be evaluated regarding clinical and microbiological parameters and compared to the use of a&#xD;
      zinc-fluoride containing dentifrice (Meridol®, GABA, Lörrach, Germany) serving as a positive&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This three-month clinical trial is conducted to answer the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Question&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a difference in de novo plaque formation as measured by the Plaque Formation&#xD;
           Rate Index (Axelsson 1991) between subjects using the new carbonate/hydroxylapatite&#xD;
           nanocrystal dentifrice and those using the established zinc-fluoride containing control&#xD;
           dentifrice? Secondary Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there differences between subjects using the two dentifrices with respect to their&#xD;
           subjective perception of therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are there differences between the two dentifrices with respect to the following&#xD;
           periodontal measurements: change of full mouth plaque scores (O'Leary Plaque Control&#xD;
           Record, O'Leary 1972), gingival index (Löe 1967), change of pocket probing depths&#xD;
           (PPD's), and the percentage of sites with attachment gain of ≥ 2 mm?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are there qualitative and quantitative changes regarding the composition of the oral&#xD;
           microflora?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The investigation is designed as a double blind, parallel group, and randomized&#xD;
      trial over a 3-months period (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints are not scheduled.&#xD;
      Seventy-five subjects will be enrolled in this four-visit study; visits 1-4 are required for&#xD;
      each subject. Test and control group subjects will be treated following identical therapy&#xD;
      protocols, except for the dentifrice. Participating study centers will be the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology at the University of Münster and the Department of Periodontology at the&#xD;
      University of Würzburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Registration and Randomization Subjects that fulfil all the inclusion criteria, do&#xD;
      not meet any exclusion criteria, and have signed the informed consent will be registered into&#xD;
      the study by the centers Münster or Würzburg (visit 1). At visit 2 study subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the test group using the carbonate/hydroxyapatite nanocrystal dentifrice&#xD;
      or the control group using a zinc-fluoride containing dentifrice. Patient randomization is&#xD;
      warranted by using a randomization list (block randomization with 4 subjects per block).&#xD;
      Designation of a study subject as a smoker/non-smoker will be based on recording&#xD;
      carbonmonoxide concentration in exhaled air (non-smoker: less than 3 ppm CO in exhaled air;&#xD;
      smoker: equal to or more than 3 ppm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of subjects At visit 1 (&quot;Screening/Recruitment&quot;) all subjects are informed about&#xD;
      the projected trial. If subjects are willing to participate, they receive periodontal&#xD;
      screening examination (PSI) and medical history is asked. At visit 2 (&quot;Baseline&quot;, consist of&#xD;
      two appointments at intervals of 24 hours) within the first appointment, subjects are&#xD;
      randomized and periodontal parameters are examined. The blinded packages of different&#xD;
      dentifrices are dispensed to the subjects. At the end, the subjects receive routine&#xD;
      supragingival scaling with sonic scalers and polishing with an air powder device (glycin&#xD;
      powder). Subjects are instructed to abstain from oral hygiene for the next 24 hours. At the&#xD;
      end, subjects fill out the two questionnaires. At the second appointment, plaque formation&#xD;
      rate is examined and subjects are instructed to brush with their already used toothbrush for&#xD;
      2 minutes at least twice per day at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after &quot;Baseline&quot; at visit 3 (&quot;Treatment&quot;, consist of two appointments at intervals&#xD;
      of 24 hours), periodontal parameters are examined and all subjects receive full mouth supra-&#xD;
      and subgingival debridement in two sessions on two consecutive days. Debridement is performed&#xD;
      with sonic scalers using micro tips under local anesthesia and polishing is performed with an&#xD;
      air powder device. Subjects are instructed to abstain from oral hygiene for the next 24&#xD;
      hours. At the second appointment, plaque formation rate is examined, all subjects receive&#xD;
      full mouth supra- and subgingival debridement, and are instructed to brush with their already&#xD;
      used toothbrush for 2 minutes at least twice per day at home. Two months after &quot;Treatment&quot; at&#xD;
      visit 4 (&quot;Reevaluation&quot;, consist of two appointments at intervals of 24 hours) periodontal&#xD;
      parameters are examined and all subjects receive full mouth supragingival debridement in one&#xD;
      session. Subjects are instructed to abstain from oral hygiene for the next 24 hours. At the&#xD;
      second appointment, plaque formation rate is examined, all subjects receive full mouth&#xD;
      supragingival debridement. Subjects return the dentifrice packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of the study no medication except the dentifrice or local anesthesia is&#xD;
      administered. During the trial, subjects are not permitted to undergo advanced periodontal&#xD;
      treatment (i.e. periodontal surgery) or to receive drugs influencing periodontal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Examinations After assessing the plaque and the gingival index (O'Leary 1972, Löe&#xD;
      1967) clinical measurements of full mouth pocket probing depths (PPD), bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP), gingival recessions (GR), and furcation involvement are taken. All measurements,&#xD;
      except for furcation involvement, are taken at six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, mid-buccal,&#xD;
      distobuccal, mesiolingual, mid-lingual and distolingual). Measurements of PPD, BOP, and GR&#xD;
      are performed using a standard Florida Probe® handpiece (Florida Probe Corp., Gainsville, FL,&#xD;
      USA). Clinical measurements are taken at baseline, after 4 weeks, and after 3 months (visits&#xD;
      2a, 3a, and 4a). Smoking habits are determined by an objective chairside measurement of&#xD;
      carbon monoxide concentration in exhaled air (Bedfont-Smokerlyzer®, Bedfont, UK) at visits 1&#xD;
      through 4. Intraoral radiographs and photographs are taken at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specification of Psychological Assessments At visits 2a and 4a patients are asked to complete&#xD;
      the Oral Health Impact Profile - German Version (OHIP-G 49) and the German version of the&#xD;
      Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (ZUF-8) as a standardized instrument used to measure health&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Health Impact Profile - German Version (OHIP-G 49) The original English version of the&#xD;
      questionnaire was developed by Slade and Spencer (1994). The German translation and&#xD;
      validation of the instrument was performed by John et al. (2002). The OHIP-G 49 contains 49&#xD;
      items that address specific problems of oral health, e.g., &quot;problems with chewing of food&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;pain in the gums&quot;. Each item is assessed on a five-point scale (0: never to 4: very often).&#xD;
      A sum score of all of the items is calculated as an indicator for current oral health. The&#xD;
      completion of the questionnaire takes about ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ZUF-8 The patients´ satisfaction with the treatment is evaluated by means of the Fragebogen&#xD;
      zur Patientenzufriedenheit (ZUF-8, Schmidt et al. 1989) which represents the German version&#xD;
      of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CQS, Attkisson &amp; Zwick 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological Examination For microbiological analysis, pooled subgingival plaque samples&#xD;
      are taken from four different teeth with at least one site with PPDs of ≥ 4 mm from each&#xD;
      study subject. The pooled subgingival plaque sample is collected in a transport tube&#xD;
      containing 500 µl Ringer-Glycerin-Solution. The pooled samples are at once taken to the&#xD;
      laboratory for analysis or stored in liquid nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supragingival plaque is collected from four sites per sample tooth. From the buccal and&#xD;
      lingual sites samples are taken using Periotron© adapted to the tooth surface to collect&#xD;
      dental plaque from the area near the gingival margin. Interproximal, supragingival plaque&#xD;
      samples are collected by inserting a sterile paperpoint horizontally in buccal to lingual&#xD;
      direction near the gingival margin. Samples from buccal/lingual and from interproximal sites&#xD;
      are pooled respectively (two pooled samples from each subject per visit 2a, 3a, 4a) in a&#xD;
      seperate transport tube containing 500 µl Ringer-Glycerin-Solution. The pooled samples are at&#xD;
      once taken to the laboratory for analysis or stored in liquid nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample teeth are randomly selected at baseline as shown in Fig. 2 to assure equal&#xD;
      distribution throughout the mouth, and remain the same over the course of the study. The&#xD;
      whole bacterial counts are quantified by culture at study visits 2a, 3a, and 4a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Processing, Microbiological Analysis After subgingival plaque sampling, the&#xD;
      samples are taken immediately in the laboratory for further processing or stored in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen until the study is finished. After finishing the trial they will be carried to&#xD;
      Münster. For transport they are stored in carbon dioxide snow and are stored in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen in the laboratory in Münster again. The pooled samples are sonicated for 10 seconds&#xD;
      (Sonotex RK 82, Bandelin Electronic AG, Berlin, Germany) and diluted in tenfold steps. 0.1 ml&#xD;
      of the undiluted suspension and 0.1 ml aliquots of the dilutions are spread on different&#xD;
      culture media. In parallel supragingival plaque samples are spread on CDC agar and are stored&#xD;
      in an aerobe atmosphere at 37 degree above zero overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative enumeration the undiluted and diluted suspensions are spread on&#xD;
      non-selective blood agar (CDC agar) plates containing 5% defibrinated sheep blood&#xD;
      supplemented with 5mg/l hemin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mg/l vitamin K1, and 10 mg/l&#xD;
      N-acetylmuramine acid (NAM). NAM is supplemented for cultivation of T. forsythensis. The&#xD;
      plates are incubated in an atmosphere containing N2 (85%), H2 (10%), and CO2 (5%) for 7 days.&#xD;
      Total cultivable counts are assessed for each of the plaque samples. The evaluation of pooled&#xD;
      plaque samples on CDC agar and the total cultivable counts are reported quantitatively as&#xD;
      colony forming units (CFU/ml). In further investigation the present of specific periodontal&#xD;
      pathogens will be evaluated.&#xD;
