  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD of an&#xD;
      anti-CTLA-4 human monoclonal antibody (AGEN1884) in subjects with advanced or refractory&#xD;
      cancer and in subjects who have progressed during treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as&#xD;
      their most recent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 1 portion of the study has been completed; It enrolled adult subjects with&#xD;
      refractory, advanced cancer in a 3+3 dose escalation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2 portion consists of up to 60 patients who have progressed during treatment with&#xD;
      an approved or investigational PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as their most recent therapy (2-6 weeks&#xD;
      prior to first dose of study drug).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histological or cytological diagnosis of solid cancer or lymphoma that is considered&#xD;
             incurable and without therapies with established benefit. Biopsy is not necessary for&#xD;
             subjects with known prior diagnosis, and clinical or radiographic evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence. For Phase 2 only: Subjects who experienced documented disease progression&#xD;
             during treatment with an approved or investigational PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as their&#xD;
             most recent therapy (2-6 weeks prior to first dose of study drug). This cohort&#xD;
             includes subjects with histological diagnoses of HCC (not including atypical histology&#xD;
             such as cholangiocarcinoma mix or fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma) who&#xD;
             experienced documented disease progression during treatment with an approved or&#xD;
             investigational PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as their most recent therapy (2-6 weeks prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects in Phase 2 with HCC should have a Child-Pugh score of A or B7 with no&#xD;
             encephalopathy or ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate cardiac function (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≤II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500×106/L,&#xD;
             absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/mm3, hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL, and platelet count&#xD;
             ≥100,000×106/mm3 without blood growth factors or without transfusions within 1 week of&#xD;
             first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For subjects in Phase 2 with HCC: Platelet count ≥60×106/mm3 and ANC ≥1,000×106/L are&#xD;
             acceptable provided that the principal investigator assesses these abnormalities as&#xD;
             due to liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Adequate liver function, defined as AST and ALT ≤2.5× institutional upper limit of&#xD;
             normal (ULN), and bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For subjects in Phase 2 with HCC: AST and ALT ≤5 × ULN, bilirubin ≤2 mg/dL × ULN, and&#xD;
             albumin ≥ 2.8 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate renal function, defined as estimated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min&#xD;
             according to Cockcroft-Gault formula, or measured 24-hour creatinine clearance (or&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Adequate coagulation defined by international normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin&#xD;
             time (PT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy); and&#xD;
             activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless the subject is&#xD;
             receiving anticoagulant therapy). Subjects in Phase 2 with HCC can have an INR ≤2.3 x&#xD;
             ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects in Phase 2 with HCC and on anticoagulant treatment would have an&#xD;
             assigned value of 1 point when scoring PT/INR so the overall Child-Pugh score is not&#xD;
             adversely affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception or abstain from sexual activity from the time of consent&#xD;
             through 90 days after the end of study drug. Adequate contraception includes condoms&#xD;
             with contraceptive foam; oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives;&#xD;
             contraceptive patch; intrauterine device; diaphragm with spermicidal gel; or a sexual&#xD;
             partner who is surgically sterilized or postmenopausal. Note: Abstinence is acceptable&#xD;
             if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. In the expansion phase, all subjects must provide a sufficient and adequate&#xD;
             formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample preferably collected after&#xD;
             progression on the last therapy and/or collected at screening, if clinically feasible.&#xD;
             If a recent biopsy is not available, an archival FFPE sample should be provided from a&#xD;
             site not previously irradiated. If no tumor tissue is available, a fresh biopsy will&#xD;
             be required if clinically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Other malignancies treated within the last 5 years, except in situ cervix carcinoma or&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other form(s) of antineoplastic therapy anticipated during the period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to another fully human monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             or severe reaction to immuno-oncology agents, such as colitis or pneumonitis requiring&#xD;
             treatment with steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including immunosuppressive disease, autoimmune&#xD;
             disease (including autoimmune endocrinopathies), or usage of immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo-, or hyperthyroid&#xD;
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible. Subjects with Type 2&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2, human T&#xD;
             lymphotropic virus 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects in Phase 2 with HCC: Subjects with active hepatitis B infection who are&#xD;
             receiving effective antiviral therapy are permitted. Subjects with active hepatitis C&#xD;
             infection are allowed (antiviral therapy not required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Administration of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within the following&#xD;
             intervals before the first administration of study drug: a. ≤14 days for chemotherapy,&#xD;
             targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy. Subjects must also not have had&#xD;
             radiation pneumonitis as a result of treatment and cannot participate in the study if&#xD;
             they are on chronic corticosteroids for radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
             permitted for palliative radiation to non-central nervous system (CNS) disease, with&#xD;
             medical monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications. b. ≤14 days for prior&#xD;
             immunotherapy. Subjects in the dose escalation cohorts are excluded if they have&#xD;
             received prior checkpoint inhibitors, costimulatory agonists, or immune modulating&#xD;
             therapy except as described below. Once a dose level is determined to be safe by the&#xD;
             SRC, subjects will be allowed to enroll in dose-level expansion cohorts if they have&#xD;
             received other non-CTLA-4 targeting immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. Subjects enrolling in Phase 2 must have cancer that has progressed after prior&#xD;
             treatment with an approved or investigational PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor as their most&#xD;
             recent therapy (2-6 weeks prior to first dose of study drug). The minimum requirement&#xD;
             of 2 weeks (14 days) from prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is to allow resolution of any&#xD;
             lower-grade (≤2) adverse events observed with the therapy. If the investigator feels&#xD;
             the subject has tolerated prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy well, then treatment with&#xD;
             study agent may begin sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             d. ≤7 days for prior corticosteroid treatment, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of an inhaled or topical corticosteroid is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Corticosteroid premedication for radiographic imaging for dye allergies is&#xD;
                  permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved after&#xD;
                  consultation with the medical monitor. e. ≤21 days for prior monoclonal antibody&#xD;
                  used for anticancer therapy, with the exception of denosumab. This does not apply&#xD;
                  to subjects being enrolled in Phase 2, who have received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor&#xD;
                  as their most recent therapy (2-6 weeks prior to first dose of study drug; see&#xD;
                  above).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  f. ≤7 days for immunosuppressive-based treatment for any reason, with the&#xD;
                  exceptions noted above for prior corticosteroid treatment (exclusion criterion&#xD;
                  d).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  g. ≤21 days or 5 half-lives before first dose of study treatment for all other&#xD;
                  investigational study drugs or devices. For investigational agents with long&#xD;
                  half- lives (e.g., &gt;5 days), enrollment before the fifth half-life requires&#xD;
                  medical monitor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  h. For subjects in Phase 2 with HCC &lt; 6 weeks for prior locoregional therapy to&#xD;
                  the liver e.g., transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE), radiation, surgery, or&#xD;
                  radioembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has not recovered to grade ≤1 from toxic effects of prior therapy and/or complications&#xD;
             from prior surgical intervention before starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with grade ≤2 neuropathy and alopecia are an exception and may enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled infection or other serious medical illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is&#xD;
             clinically meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude use of&#xD;
             AGEN1884, including AGEN1884 hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Concurrent participation in other investigational drug trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a CNS tumor, metastasis(es), and/or carcinomatous meningitis identified either on&#xD;
             the baseline brain imaging obtained during the screening period or identified prior to&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with history of brain metastases that have been treated may participate&#xD;
             provided they show evidence of stable supra-tentorial lesions are obtained after&#xD;
             treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained ≥4&#xD;
             weeks apart). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result&#xD;
             of the brain metastases or their treatment must have returned to baseline or resolved.&#xD;
             For individuals who received steroids as part of brain metastases treatment, steroids&#xD;
             must be discontinued ≥ 7 days prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. For subjects in Phase 2 with HCC, the following exclusions also apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Recent encephalopathy episodes in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Recent (within the last 6 months) gastro-esophageal varices bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Subject whose tumors have cardiac involvement, as determined by imaging.&#xD;
