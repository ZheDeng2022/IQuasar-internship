      Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HBI-8000 administered&#xD;
      orally. Patients must be hospitalized as per guidance of the treating investigator throughout&#xD;
      Cycle 1. Patients will receive HBI 8000 twice weekly (BIW) (after breakfast), in 28 day&#xD;
      treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients. The first cohort of 3 patients will&#xD;
      receive 30 mg BIW. Decisions regarding cohort escalation will be based upon the clinical&#xD;
      experience in Cycle 1 (first 28 days) only. For a given cohort, if 1 patient enrolled in the&#xD;
      cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days of the first dose, the&#xD;
      cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.&#xD;

             investigational antibody therapy or investigational ASCT), or in current clinical&#xD;
             studies with investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients with a history of drug abuse or long-term excessive alcohol consumption which&#xD;
             could affect study result assessment&#xD;
&#xD;

             significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that&#xD;
             would prevent the patient from participating in the study, or because of any condition&#xD;
             that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study&#xD;
