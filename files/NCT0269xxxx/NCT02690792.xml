  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) due to obesity&#xD;
      and ~8 million of these individuals have a progressive form of the disease, non-alcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no noninvasive ways to determine which&#xD;
      individuals with NAFLD will develop NASH. This is of medical importance since NASH can be a&#xD;
      prelude to the development of end-stage liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of NAFLD has been limited by several factors, including the difficulties associated&#xD;
      with studying liver metabolism in vivo in humans. Our group has pioneered new methods that&#xD;
      use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure intermediary hepatic metabolism in humans&#xD;
      with a goal of directly studying the pathophysiology of bland steatosis and NASH. In this&#xD;
      study, these noninvasive methods will be used to characterize and compare the metabolic&#xD;
      alterations that accompany bland steatosis and NASH and test the hypothesis that detects if&#xD;
      hepatic mitochondrial metabolism contribute to both disorders. Such characterization is&#xD;
      fundamental to establishing a rational approach to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD and&#xD;
      may provide simple, non-invasive methods to differentiate benign and progressive forms of&#xD;
      NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will be addressed via separate isotopic studies occurring at different time&#xD;
      points during a prolonged fast. In subjects with NAFLD, these studies will be carried out&#xD;
      before and after treatment with Vitamin E or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects will participate in initial baseline studies only without Vitamin E or&#xD;
      placebo intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to harness the physiologic changes that occur with short- and long-term&#xD;
      fasting to provide a rapid and cost-effective method to accomplish the aims of the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

      Study Procedures (Healthy and NAFLD/NASH Subjects) Screening (Week -2) Prior to initiation of&#xD;
      the timeline, all potential study participants will be evaluated by a research nurse to&#xD;
      obtain informed consent, a brief medical history, height, weight, body mass index, waist/hip&#xD;
      circumference, vital signs, approximately 20mls. of blood for screening labs and urine for&#xD;
      analysis. NAFLD/NASH subjects with no available liver serologies will have an additional 25&#xD;
      mls of blood drawn. This visit will take approximately 60 minutes and will include a&#xD;
      screening questionnaire for family history of disease, activities of daily living (ADL), and&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Diabetic subjects will also withhold their oral diabetic agent prior to&#xD;
      the fasting screening labwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching Visit: (Week -2 or prior to week -1): A research nurse will give diabetic subjects a&#xD;
      30-minute refresher course on diabetes that will include the signs and symptoms of hyper and&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. A teaching booklet will be given to each diabetic subject. Some type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      (T2DM) patients only on oral medication do not regularly check their blood sugar. If the&#xD;
      patient does not have a glucometer, we will provide a glucometer, supplies and instructions&#xD;
      for use by our diabetic study volunteers during their study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the initiation of standardized diet, subjects will maintain their normal dietary&#xD;
      routine. For three to four days prior to the protocol procedures, subjects will be placed on&#xD;
      a standardized diet provided by the CTRC metabolic kitchen. In addition, participants will&#xD;
      refrain from physical exercise at least 3 days prior to the procedures. Also, T2DM&#xD;
      participants will withhold their oral diabetic agents for 3-4 days prior to the protocol&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotyping (Week -1) Participants will be asked to write down food and beverage consumption&#xD;
      for three days prior to this visit. This food log will be turned into the dietician at the&#xD;
      Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) for calculation of proteins, carbohydrates and&#xD;
      fats in order to calculate a tailored 3.5 day meal plan to be consumed just prior to the&#xD;
      overnight Fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked not to eat or drink anything after midnight prior to this visit in&#xD;
      preparation for the day's study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic participants will withhold their oral diabetic agents for 3 days prior to the&#xD;
      Phenotyping visit and the day of the visit. During this time, they will be instructed to&#xD;
      check their blood glucose 30 minutes prior to each meal and at bedtime daily and will notify&#xD;
      the research nurse or study physician if their blood glucose level is below 70 mg/dl or above&#xD;
      250 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will arrive at the Advanced Imaging Research Center (AIRC) at approximately 8:30&#xD;
      AM. During the morning, participants will have measurements of liver fat in the 3 Tesla (3T)&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner and measurement of their respiratory quotient (RQ) using an&#xD;
      indirect calorimeter. Immediately following the scan, two intravenous catheters will be&#xD;
      placed in preparation for the insulin/clamp study: an antecubital vein catheter to infuse&#xD;
      dextrose and insulin and a dorsal hand vein catheter for blood sampling. The hand will be&#xD;
      kept in a hot box at 70 °C for arterialization of venous blood. Three 10 ml. blood draws will&#xD;
      be obtained for the baseline glucose level measurement, insulin infusate preparation, and&#xD;
      blood chemistry analysis. At approximately 11:30 A.M., a primed continuous infusion of&#xD;
      regular human insulin will be started for the duration of 2 hours. A 20% dextrose infusion&#xD;
      will be started after 4 minutes of insulin infusion and adjusted to maintain euglycemia. A&#xD;
      small amount of blood (1 ml.) will be drawn every 5 minutes for 2 hours to monitor plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration. The total amount of blood required for the whole procedure is&#xD;
      approximately 80 mls. A urine specimen will be collected for determination of urinary glucose&#xD;
      losses in the post-absorptive state. Approximately 3 healthy volunteers will have an&#xD;
      additional measurement of liver fat after the insulin clamp to determine if changes are&#xD;
      evident from the test. The participant will then be given a meal and discharged from the&#xD;
      AIRC. The duration of this visit is approximately 7 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Fast (Week 0) Diabetic participants will withhold their oral diabetic agents for 4&#xD;
      days prior to the Overnight Fast visit and the day of the visit. During this time, they will&#xD;
      be instructed to check their blood glucose 30 minutes prior to breakfast and at bedtime daily&#xD;
      and will notify the research nurse or study physician if their blood glucose level is below&#xD;
      70 mg/dl or above 250 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four days prior to metabolic studies, participants will begin a tailored diet provided by the&#xD;
      CTRC metabolic kitchen. The day prior to fasting studies, all participants will have the&#xD;
      final meal at noon and begin fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following day they will arrive at the Advanced Imaging Research Center for a liver&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Deuterium oxide (a.k.a. heavy water), the first stable&#xD;
      isotope, will be administered according to the participant's weight in three divided doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive carbon-13 labeled [U-13C]propionate (three 400 mg doses given by&#xD;
      mouth over 1 hour). During the study, subjects will also be given 0.5% heavy water ad&#xD;
      libitum. Subjects will undergo measurement of their respiratory quotient (RQ) using an&#xD;
      indirect calorimeter just prior to the infusion protocol. Subjects will then have an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter placed and an infusion of the stable isotopes carbon-13 labeled&#xD;
      [3,4-13C2]glucose, carbon-13 labeled [1,2-13C]acetoacetate and carbon-13 labeled&#xD;
      [3,4-13C]3-hydroxybutyrate initiated over two hours. During this period, 5 ml. blood draws&#xD;
      will occur every hour to determine plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), ketones,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels. At two hrs after initiation of the infusion, a 50 ml.&#xD;
      blood draw will be performed to obtain samples for spectroscopic determination of the rate of&#xD;
      ketogenesis and citrate oxidation in the citric acid (TCA) cycle. At the completion of study&#xD;
      procedures, the stable isotope infusion will be stopped and participants will be sent to the&#xD;
      CTRC outpatient clinic for Dual Energy x-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) to determine estimated&#xD;
      total body fat measurement. After the DEXA, healthy subjects will be discharged to home;&#xD;
      NAFLD subjects will be admitted to CTRC for liver biopsy, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusion of the metabolic studies in week 0 marks the end of the study for control&#xD;
      subjects, while NAFLD subjects will be initiated on Vitamin E or placebo therapy at this time&#xD;
      point. All subjects will be given a meal and evaluated for stability (vital signs within&#xD;
      normal limits) prior to discharge to home. The total amount of blood collected for overnight&#xD;
      fasting studies will be less than 325 mls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits (Weeks 4, 8, 12) Subjects will visit with the research nurse and/or Dr.&#xD;
      Browning to monitor compliance with the vitamin E/placebo regime. At each follow-up visit,&#xD;
      subjects will have blood collected (approximately 10mls.) per Table 1. Additionally, each&#xD;
      volunteer will have an MRS to measure liver triglyceride content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenotype Visit (Week 16) This is a repeat of the phenotype visit at Week -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Fast (Week 17) This is a repeat of the overnight fast at Week 0. All procedures,&#xD;
      including the isotope studies will be the same.&#xD;
