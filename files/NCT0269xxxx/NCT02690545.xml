  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by&#xD;
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which&#xD;
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or&#xD;
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most&#xD;
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more&#xD;
      effective treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted&#xD;
      against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will&#xD;
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T&#xD;
      cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma&#xD;
      cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies&#xD;
      have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most&#xD;
      patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating&#xD;
      free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in&#xD;
      this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination)&#xD;
      receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in&#xD;
      the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to establish a safe dose of ATLCAR.CD30 cells to infuse&#xD;
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and to estimate the number patients whose cancer does not&#xD;
      progress for two years after ATLCAR.CD30 administration. This study will also look at other&#xD;
      effects of ATLCAR.CD30 cells, including their effect on the patient's cancer.&#xD;

      complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients without complete&#xD;
      response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per the Lugano&#xD;
      classification&#xD;
&#xD;

      to date of death and will be measured separately in subjects receiving bendamustine alone for&#xD;
      lymphodepletion and those receiving a combination of bendamustine and fludarabine for&#xD;

&#xD;
      Progression free survival is defined from day of ATLCAR.CD30 infusion to relapse (in patients&#xD;
      with a documented complete response at time of cell infusion) or progression (in patients&#xD;
      without complete response at time of cell infusion), or death as a result of any cause per&#xD;

      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 mL per collection (up to 3 collections) of peripheral blood will be obtained from&#xD;
      patients for cell procurement. In patients with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      less than 200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to&#xD;
      isolate sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 Cells Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be administered as described below 1-14 days (preferably 1-2 days)&#xD;
      after lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine. ATLCAR.CD30 cells will be given by a&#xD;
      licensed provider (oncology nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 1-10 minutes&#xD;
      through either a peripheral or a central line. The expected volume will be 1-50cc. Patients&#xD;
      with a partial response or stable disease at 6 weeks may receive a second infusion of&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 if cells are available. Note: Lymphodepletion with bendamustine and fludarabine&#xD;
      will occur for three consecutive days and may be given prior to a second infusion of cells&#xD;
      (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) 1532 involves 1-2 infusions of&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 cells. Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR)&#xD;
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;

    <description>Phase Ib: In adults, and separately, in children, two doses will be investigated 1x10^8 cells/m2 and 2x10^8 cells/m^2. The study team will run two independent dose-escalation sequences, one for adults and another one for children. The study team plans to use the 3+3 design and start with a low dose of 1x10^8 cells/m2. If there are no DLT in first 3 patients, the study team will go up to the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2. If there is toxicity in 1/3 patients in the initial cohort, the study team would expand to enroll up to 6 patients. If there are dose limiting toxicities (DLT) at the dose of 2 x 10^8 cells/m^2, the study team will initially decrease the dose to an intermediate dose of 1.5 x 10^8 cells/m^.&#xD;
Phase II: The study team planning to enroll 31 patients to contribute data. Sequential boundary will be used to monitor DLT rate.</description>
