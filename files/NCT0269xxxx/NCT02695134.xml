    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigators proposed randomized, controlled study is to examine the&#xD;
      effect of 6 one hour treatments of Healing Touch (HT) over 3 weeks on post-cardiac event&#xD;
      patients, while they wait to enter a Cardiac Rehab (CR) program.Patients enrolled in the&#xD;
      Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine (SCIM) Cardiac Rehab Program typically experience a&#xD;
      waiting period of 3 weeks, or sometimes more, before starting the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims of the proposed study are to evaluate the effect of HT on CR program outcome&#xD;
      measures of METs, BMI, physical and mental well-being, and attendance in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New participants in the CR program who qualify and agree to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      consented and randomly assigned to the Intervention Group who will receive Healing Touch&#xD;
      therapy, or to the Control Group, which will not receive HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline both groups will complete the Dartmouth Quality of Life and SF-36 Health Surveys.&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be repeated at the end of the 3 week study period and at the end of&#xD;
      the 3 months SCIM CR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effect size of 15% was chosen, with an alpha level of 0.05, 80% power, 95% confidence&#xD;
      level, and using a two-tailed test, it was determined that a sample size of 56 patients in&#xD;
      each group would be needed for between group comparisons. To account for potential attrition&#xD;
      the study will enroll 124 subjects, 62 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our rationale is that Healing Touch, in addition to standard medical care will reduce&#xD;
      post-cardiac event stress and anxiety symptoms in patients waiting to enter a cardiac rehab&#xD;
      program, as measured by the Dartmouth Quality of Life Index and the SF36 questionnaire.&#xD;
      Further, the investigators suggest that Healing Touch treatments will improve patient's final&#xD;
      outcomes of the 12 week CR program.&#xD;

      Study Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALING TOUCH Healing Touch (HT) is an energy based approach to health and healing. It uses&#xD;
      light touch to influence the energy field that surrounds the body, and energy centers which&#xD;
      control the flow of energy to the physical body. HT can restore harmony and balance, which&#xD;
      can affect all physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health, as well as self-healing. HT&#xD;
      complements traditional health care and is used together with other approaches to health and&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healing touch has been studied for use in pain, cancer, endocrine-immune-HIV, mental health,&#xD;
      and cardiovascular factors in patients ranging from pediatric to the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-CARDIAC EVENT STRESS AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS Having a major cardiac event can be a&#xD;
      stressful, life changing occurrence. Often, the psychological impacts of having a heart&#xD;
      attack (myocardial infarction) are underestimated and can be long lasting. In fact, there is&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that the emotional stressors that occur post-MI are consistent with&#xD;
      symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      higher rates of recurrent coronary events and overall increased mortality in diagnosed&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that mental stress has a negative effect on a person's heart health. In&#xD;
      particular:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unmanaged stress can lead to high blood pressure, arterial damage, irregular heart&#xD;
           rhythms and a weakened immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with depression have been shown to have increased platelet reactivity,&#xD;
           decreased heart variability and increased pro-inflammatory markers (such as C-reactive&#xD;
           protein or CRP), which are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For people with heart disease, depression can increase the risk of an adverse cardiac&#xD;
           event such as a heart attack or blood clots. For people who do not have heart disease,&#xD;
           depression can also increase the risk of a heart attack and development of coronary&#xD;
           artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In one landmark study, the continued presence of depression after recovery increased the&#xD;
           risk of death (mortality) to 17 percent within 6 months after a heart attack (versus 3&#xD;
           percent mortality in heart attack patients who didn't have depression). Frasure-Smith N,&#xD;
           et al. Depression following myocardial infarction: Impact on 6-month survival. JAMA,&#xD;
           October 20, 1993. 270(15):1819-1825.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELATED STUDIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALING TOUCH has been in use at Scripps hospitals since 1993. The Cardiac Healing Touch&#xD;
      Program at the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine at Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green&#xD;
      Hospital collected data on 305 cardiac surgery patients. Unpublished outcomes revealed that&#xD;
      post-surgical cardiac patients experienced a 74% reduction in pain and a 71% reduction in&#xD;
      anxiety after receiving HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study performed by the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine at a Marine Base&#xD;
      near San Diego, called Complementary Medicine for PTSD and Related Symptoms in Returning&#xD;
      Active Duty Military, revealed statistically and clinically significant reduction in PTSD (p&#xD;
      &lt;.0005, Cohen's d = .85), as well as depression (p &lt;.0005, Cohen's d = .70) for the healing&#xD;
      touch and guided imagery intervention versus the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-cardiac event patients who have been referred to a Cardiac Rehab program often find that&#xD;
      they are being asked to wait before a position becomes available in the CR program. In some&#xD;
      programs this may involve a waiting period of several weeks. At the Scripps Center for&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine Cardia Rehab program the waiting period is typically 3 weeks, or slighly&#xD;
      more. During this period, many patients find that their stress and anxiety levels in reaction&#xD;
      to their recent cardiac event remain untreated. It is this group of patients the&#xD;
      investigators aim to enroll into the research study to determine whether 6 healing touch&#xD;
      treatments during a waiting period of 3 weeks will decrease their stress and anxiety before&#xD;
      entering the cardiac rehab program. Moreover, the investigators will follow the patients&#xD;
      through CR and determine whether the pre-program HT treatments improve the patient's overall&#xD;
      physical outcomes measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment Upon enrollment in the study, including signing the consent, participants&#xD;
      will answer questionnaires to assess their baseline status including demographics, brief&#xD;
      medical history, and the following two questionnaires: Dartmouth Quality of Life and SF-36&#xD;
      Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Following initial assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      Intervention Group who will receive Healing Touch therapy, or to the Control Group, which&#xD;
      will not receive HT. All study participants will enter the CR program after either 3 weeks of&#xD;
      HT intervention or a 3 week waiting period. If there is no opening available immediately&#xD;
      following the 3 week period, study subjects will be entered into the program as soon as a&#xD;
      space is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HT group will receive two one hour sessions per week for a total of 6 sessions, over 3&#xD;
      weeks. Healing Touch practitioners who have completed the healing touch program and are&#xD;
      certified healing touch practitioners will perform the healing touch sessions. Whenever&#xD;
      possible each patient will be given the treatment by the same practitioner for all 6&#xD;
      sessions. The healing touch practitioner will center his/her-self by bringing mind, body, and&#xD;
      emotions into a quiet and focused state of mind. They will then assess the patient's energy&#xD;
      field and implement healing touch techniques in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chakra Connection Chakra Connection is a full body technique to open, connect, and balance&#xD;
      the major and minor chakras and help clear the energy field. It promotes relaxation, reduces&#xD;
      pain and anxiety and promotes general well-being and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mind Clearing This HT technique is helpful in promoting mental clarity, peace, and calm. It&#xD;
      facilitates deep relaxation, clear thinking, and promotes healthy sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chakra Spread. Chakra Spread is a gentle energy technique designed to open the chakras and&#xD;
      produce a deep healing. It is helpful during life transitions to promote a deep sense of calm&#xD;
      and peace - physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other forms of healing will be administered by the HT practitioner. The HT practitioner&#xD;
      will use light touch to implement the healing touch techniques. Healing touch sessions will&#xD;
      last approximately one hour and will occur two times per week for three weeks for a total of&#xD;
      6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To complete the study, patients must receive all 6 sessions. For potential scheduling&#xD;
      conflicts, exceptions will be made to accommodate patients for a maximum of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Assessment After 3 weeks, all participants in both groups will complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires: Dartmouth Quality of Life Index and SF-36 Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will enter the CR program as soon as the CR staff can schedule each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group When subjects in this group have completed their CR program they are offered a&#xD;
      complementary one-time, one hour, healing touch treatment.&#xD;
