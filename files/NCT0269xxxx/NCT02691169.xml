  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several new therapies available to treat men with advanced prostate cancer;&#xD;
      however, the decision making tools needed to determine the best treatment for these patients&#xD;
      are noticeably absent. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is increasingly being&#xD;
      recognized as an important target for prostate cancer imaging and determining the most&#xD;
      effective therapy. Accordingly, a wide variety of agents are being used to image PSMA. One of&#xD;
      these agents is 18F-DCFPyL. In this study the investigators will image men with advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer using 18F-DCFPyL and a positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT)&#xD;
      scanner. The investigators will compare the results of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for the detection of&#xD;
      metastases and monitoring the effects of therapy with conventional imaging (CT, bone scan)&#xD;
      and clinical follow-up. In this way, the investigators will evaluate the benefit of using&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT to decide what is the best treatment strategy for a man with advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory single centre, non-randomized, open-label, study in male subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) being treated with a second-line anti-androgen&#xD;
      therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone). The purpose of the study is to assess if 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT: 1. Shows more sites of metastatic, castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with&#xD;
      standard imaging (bone scan and CT) at baseline and follow-up, 2. Shows response to therapy&#xD;
      that is associated with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will image male subjects with CRPC undergoing second-line anti-androgen therapy&#xD;
      (enzalutamide or abiraterone) using 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for detection of metastases and&#xD;
      therapeutic monitoring, with correlation to standard-of-care imaging (CT and bone scan) and&#xD;
      clinical follow-up over a 1-year time period. Subjects with CRPC and planned treatment with&#xD;
      evidence of metastases on standard-of-care imaging (CT and/or bone scan) will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline and mid-therapy 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design consists of three study clinic visits (screening, baseline 18F-DCFPyL&#xD;
      PET/CT, and 8-14 week follow-up 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT) and two follow-up safety phone calls. In&#xD;
      addition, all subjects will be followed clinically as per local standard of care with&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood levels and standard of care imaging for up to one year&#xD;
      following the baseline 18F-DCFPyL administration.&#xD;
