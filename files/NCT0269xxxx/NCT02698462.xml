  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify more persons with advanced neoplasia in the current&#xD;
      national CRC screening, by adding data on family history of CRC (using a validated online&#xD;
      questionnaire) to FIT. In addition, the aim is to identify those persons and their family&#xD;
      members who should not be participating in a FIT based screening but receive surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopies instead, because of a familial CRC syndrome. It is aimed to increase detection&#xD;
      without affecting participation, thereby increasing the yield of screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective CRC population-based screening trial, using FIT and a family history&#xD;
      questionnaire, inviting those with a positive FIT, a familial CRC syndrome, or both for&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All invitees receive an invitation to complete a FIT (FOB-Gold) and a validated, online&#xD;
      family history questionnaire. Answers from the questionnaire are compared with the Dutch&#xD;
      criteria for referral for genetic testing and/or surveillance colonoscopies for persons at a&#xD;
      potential familial risk for CRC. Invitees are invited to perform both tests, but if they only&#xD;
      perform one this will be assessed. Participants with a positive FIT (cut-off value 275 ng/ml)&#xD;
      and/or a positive family history and a diagnosis of familial CRC by a clinical geneticist&#xD;
      will be referred for colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the diagnostic yield, participation rate, and positive&#xD;
      predictive value for two strategies: referral for colonoscopy based on FIT and family history&#xD;
      versus referral for colonoscopy based on FIT-only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is justified by the anticipated gain in diagnostic yield from combining&#xD;
      FIT-only with family history screening. With a sample size of 6.000 persons the investigators&#xD;
      expect to detect 130 persons with advanced neoplasia after a positive FIT (21.7 per 1.000&#xD;
      invitees). By adding the family history questionnaire, the investigators anticipate detecting&#xD;
      an additional number of 11 persons with advanced neoplasia, resulting in a yield of combined&#xD;
      FIT-based and family history screening of 141 persons with advanced neoplasia (23.5 per 1.000&#xD;
      invitees), which is an increase of 1.8 per 1.000 invitees. Using the McNemar test with the&#xD;
      significance level set at 5%, there is a power of 91% to show that the gain in diagnostic&#xD;
      yield is statistically significant. Previous CRC test screening studies using FIT showed that&#xD;
      participation rates are approximately 60% in a first screening round. The participation rate&#xD;
      in the Dutch national CRC screening in 2014 (the first year of introduction) was even higher,&#xD;
      68%. The investigators expect that 80% of these persons will fill out the familial risk&#xD;
      questionnaire, resulting in 3.264 persons who perform both tests. As the investigators&#xD;
      recommend invitees to perform the questionnaire in addition to FIT, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that the percentage of persons only filling out the questionnaire and not performing FIT are&#xD;
      negligible. Based on previous screening studies using a FIT positivity cut-off value of 50 ng&#xD;
      Hb/mL for the OC-Sensor, it is assumed that 8% of these participants have a positive FIT&#xD;
      result. In the current Dutch screening program, a different FIT is used (FOB-Gold) with a&#xD;
      cut-off value of 275 ng Hb/ml. The FIT positivity rate with this test and with this cut-off&#xD;
      value is unknown. However, a governmental announcement recently reported that the positivity&#xD;
      rate is expected to remain 8% with this cut-off value. Therefore, the investigators expect&#xD;
      326 FIT positives in this study (8% of 4.080). Based on previous studies, approximately 40%&#xD;
      of all persons with a positive FIT result will have advanced neoplasia. In our sample this&#xD;
      concerns 130 persons. The percentage of persons with a familial CRC risk requiring&#xD;
      surveillance colonoscopies in a screening population varies between 2.3% and 4%. Differences&#xD;
      in the definition of an increased familial CRC risk could explain the variability in reported&#xD;
      numbers. As the investigators are using a relatively large range in criteria for fulfilling&#xD;
      the definition of a familial CRC risk, the highest reported percentage (4%) is assumed, which&#xD;
      concerns 131 persons. The previously developed family history questionnaire has a sensitivity&#xD;
      of 90% and 100% in identifying those persons qualifying for referral, in two subsequent&#xD;
      validation phases respectively. For the purpose of this study, this validated questionnaire&#xD;
      is adjusted to the recently renewed referral criteria. The investigators make the assumption&#xD;
      that the questionnaire can identify all persons with a familial CRC syndrome based on&#xD;
      referral criteria. Persons with a familial CRC syndrome who do not fulfill these criteria&#xD;
      will be missed. This concerns an unknown number and will not be taken into account. A&#xD;
      previous screening study showed that 6% of those with a positive FIT have an increased&#xD;
      familial CRC risk. One can calculate that 3.8% of persons with a negative FIT have a familial&#xD;
      CRC risk: 4% minus 6% of 8% (FIT positives), divided by 92% (FIT negatives). If one assumes&#xD;
      that there is no difference in familial CRC risk between those who do and those who do not&#xD;
      fill out the questionnaire, this involves 114 of 3.264 persons. Based on unpublished data by&#xD;
      this research group it is estimated that 10% of those with a negative FIT have a familial CRC&#xD;
      risk: 11 persons (10% of 114). A similar percentage was found in another screening study.&#xD;
      Additionally, all participants with a familial CRC syndrome will be offered surveillance&#xD;
      recommendations. In this sample, 131 persons are estimated to have a familial CRC syndrome.&#xD;
      Of these, 16 persons (12%) will undergo a colonoscopy due to a positive FIT (6% of 8% FIT&#xD;
      positives) and their familial CRC risk could be addressed at their visit to a colonoscopy&#xD;
      center. The other 115 persons (88%) are expected to have a negative FIT and these persons&#xD;
      (and their family members) would otherwise be unlikely to be identified as having a familial&#xD;
      CRC syndrome.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Six thousand persons eligible for the national CRC screening program,&#xD;
        consisting of persons from the birth years 1941, 1945, 1953, 1955 and 1957 will be&#xD;
        selected. These persons will be selected from four areas in North-Holland that are&#xD;
        considered representative of the Netherlands regarding ethnical distribution and&#xD;
        socioeconomic status: Aalsmeer, De Ronden Venen, Ouder-Amstel, Stichtse Vecht. These areas&#xD;
        had an average participation-rate in 2014 that was comparable to the national participation&#xD;
        rate (68.2%; a range from 65% to 75% is allowed). The distribution of age groups and gender&#xD;
        will be comparable to the national screening distribution in 2016. Those who have been&#xD;
        invited for a previous screening round in 2014 or for previous pilot-screening rounds will&#xD;
        not be selected. In order to be eligible for participation, a subject must have been&#xD;
        selected for participation in the national FIT-screening program in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No specific exclusion criteria apply for participation in Family Matters, meaning that all&#xD;
        invitees will receive a FIT as well as the questionnaire.&#xD;
