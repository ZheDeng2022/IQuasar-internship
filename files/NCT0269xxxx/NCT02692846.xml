      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Williams Syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder. People with WS have less of a protein that&#xD;
      allows parts of the body to stretch than other individuals. Researchers are interested in the&#xD;
      stretchiness of the skin of people with WS and how it may relate to cardiovascular problems&#xD;
      some people with WS develop. They are also interested in identifying exposures such as&#xD;
      medications that may change the elasticity of the skin and vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the skin and blood vessels in individuals with WS and how those tissues&#xD;
      change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 5-70 with WS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 1-70 with a medical condition that affects connective tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 visit. Participants with WS may do so at a Williams Syndrome&#xD;
      Association family meeting or camp, or at NIH. Other participants will be seen at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit, participants will have height, weight, and blood pressure measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will listen to the participant s chest and abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants skin will be examined. It may be photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have photos of their eyes and face taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use a DermaLab Suction Cup Probe. A small suction cup will be placed on the&#xD;
      arm with a sticker. It will pull lightly on the skin. This allows a computer to measure skin&#xD;
      flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use a SphygmoCor. A probe that looks like a dull pencil will be placed on&#xD;
      the wrist, neck, and groin area. A computer will measure how fast the pulse is moving and&#xD;
      will estimate blood vessel flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be invited to have these procedures repeated at a later date (2 years from&#xD;
      now or more).&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Williams syndrome (WS) is a multisystem developmental disorder caused by deletion of 26-28&#xD;
      genes, including the elastin gene, located on chromosome 7q11.23. Cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      WS, including obstructive vascular disease and hypertension, and relatively mild skin changes&#xD;
      are caused by the elastin gene deletion. Even though all WS subjects are missing one copy of&#xD;
      this gene, the expression of cardiovascular problems is highly variable, ranging from no&#xD;
      significant disease to severe generalized arteriopathy leading to infant death. The causes of&#xD;
      vascular variability are currently unknown, and male gender is the only disease modifier&#xD;
      described to date. Clinically, skin is described as abnormally soft, smooth and easily&#xD;
      mobilized , while ultrastructurally the elastic fibers are abnormal with reduced amorphous&#xD;
      elastin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to establish quantitative norms that can be used to&#xD;
      determine the severity of vascular disease in elastin insufficiency and then to identify risk&#xD;
      factors that contribute to that variability. It is also important to determine how&#xD;
      stable/variable these findings are over time.&#xD;

        We will recruit three subject populations, individuals with WS and two control populations,&#xD;
        one unaffected and one with known connective tissue disease. Affected subjects being&#xD;
        screened for a research protocol or already on a research protocol at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
        Center (CC) may be contacted by their physician about this study.@@@Subjects who are able&#xD;
        to visit the NIH CC will be enrolled in person by the PI or approved AIs of the study, as&#xD;
        mentioned in the previous section. For off-site subjects, the PI or approved AIs of this&#xD;
        protocol may conduct an in-person, off-site meeting with the subject to carefully explain&#xD;
        the research objectives, procedure(s), and relevant risks and discomforts of this protocol&#xD;
        or attend WSA meetings that occur every 2 years and consent the subject at the meeting&#xD;
        place.&#xD;
