  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this NIA sponsored ancillary study of phase 2 CALERIE is to measure&#xD;
      whether metabolic adaptation lasts up to 2 years in response to a 25% calorie restriction in&#xD;
      normal-weight and slightly overweight individuals. Energy metabolism (24-hour sedentary and&#xD;
      sleeping) will be measured in a respiratory chamber. Other measures include the activities of&#xD;
      the sympathetic nervous and thyroid axes, oxidative stress in lipids, protein and DNA, organ&#xD;
      size by MRI and echocardiography, and posture allocation (time spent engaging in different&#xD;
      activities and the energy expended during these activities), and activity temperament (the&#xD;
      innate predilection for movement). This set of studies will allow assessment of whether the&#xD;
      previously observed metabolic adaptation in response to 25% caloric restriction is long&#xD;
      lasting (up to two years), associated with reduced thyroid and sympathetic activities and&#xD;
      reduced oxidative damage. The studies of organ sizes (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, adipose&#xD;
      and muscle) by MRI and echo (heart) is essential to determine whether the metabolic&#xD;
      adaptation is related to decreased organ sizes or improved organ energy metabolism&#xD;
      efficiency. The above described measures will be performed at baseline and after 1 and 2&#xD;
      years of a 25% caloric restriction in 50 non-obese humans and in 25 sex-, BMI- and age-&#xD;
      matched subjects who will not engage in caloric restriction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypothesis 1: The decrease in energy expenditure (sedentary and sleeping) will be larger than&#xD;
      that expected on the basis of loss of fat-free mass and fat mass even after weight&#xD;
      stabilization. Aim 1: Determine the metabolic adaptation after 1 and 2 years of a 25% CR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The metabolic adaptation (what is not accounted by a decrease in FM and FFM) is&#xD;
      not entirely accounted by reduced organ/tissue size (liver, spleen, kidney, heart and brain)&#xD;
      but is accompanied by reduced activities of the sympathetic and thyroid systems. Aim 2:&#xD;
      Assess the contribution of organ sizes and activities of the thyroid and sympathetic systems&#xD;
      to the metabolic adaptation. Results will be compared to in vivo and in vitro oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation (Smith, PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: A decrease in markers of oxidative stress to lipid (urinary isoprostanes) DNA&#xD;
      (strand breaks) in blood and protein (carbonylation and thiol oxidation) in blood and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle tissue after 1 and 2 years of CR will be observed. Aim 3: Determine the&#xD;
      changes in oxidative stress after 1 and 2 years of 25% CR by measuring urinary isoprostanes,&#xD;
      serum carbonyls, DNA damage in nucleated blood cells and protein oxidation (carbonyls and&#xD;
      oxidation of cysteine residues) in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
