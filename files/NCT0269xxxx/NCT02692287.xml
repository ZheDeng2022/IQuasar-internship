  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) Butterfly is a simple, low-cost device which has been&#xD;
      developed as a treatment method for PPH. It will be used to stop the bleeding through&#xD;
      compression of the uterus of women having a PPH. It will be markedly easier to undertake than&#xD;
      traditional bimanual compression, whilst also being significantly more acceptable to women&#xD;
      themselves. Use of the PPH Butterfly will provide an alternative management option for PPH&#xD;
      and in some cases should avoid the need for women to have to go to theatre for treatment.&#xD;
      This research will allow the investigators to determine if they have the optimum size and&#xD;
      shape of the device, that it will operate as intended when compressing the uterus, and to&#xD;
      gauge its acceptability to participants and users. In phase I the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      &quot;healthy volunteers&quot; i.e. women who have delivered their baby vaginally following Induction&#xD;
      of labour (IOL) however these women will not be experiencing a PPH. The device is to be&#xD;
      assessed purely on size, usability and acceptability not for diagnosis or as a treatment&#xD;
      method. Following the delivery participants will be invited to have the PPH Butterfly&#xD;
      inserted vaginally for an average of 2 minutes. It is through this that the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the suitability of the device in its current design, when it is in practice. The&#xD;
      clinician who operates the device will complete a Likert scale questionnaire along with some&#xD;
      open questions following each administration. Participants will also answer a short&#xD;
      questionnaire. .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve 5-10 healthy women who deliver their baby vaginally following&#xD;
      Induction of Labour (IOL). The women will be given a short leaflet regarding the study.&#xD;
      During their time on the Induction of Labour (IOL) Suite, women will be seen by a member of&#xD;
      the research team, the research will be discussed with them and they will receive a&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet if they desire. The woman will also be shown a short video&#xD;
      regarding the Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH)Butterfly which is specifically for members of the&#xD;
      public. After a discussion of the research, women will be asked to indicate in writing&#xD;
      whether they may consider participation, whether they do not want to participate, or whether&#xD;
      they are undecided but are happy to be asked again. Only those women who are considering&#xD;
      participation, or who are happy to be asked again will be approached post-delivery. All of&#xD;
      the women can be approached up to 72 hours post-delivery and asked if they wish to&#xD;
      participate. If a woman has a vaginal delivery, a member of the research team will then&#xD;
      attend the Delivery Suite, maternity theatre (the woman may have had an instrumental delivery&#xD;
      in theatre) or the postnatal ward once informed by the midwife caring for her. They will&#xD;
      clarify with the woman if she wishes to participate. Assuming the woman wishes to&#xD;
      participate, informed, signed consent will be sought at this point and the device will be&#xD;
      used, with a speculum examination taking place before and after use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the device is of an incorrect size, then the device size will be changed before repeating&#xD;
      the process with 5-10 more women. In this way the final recruitment number may be more than&#xD;
      10 in total.&#xD;
