    <textblock>
      Investigators will compare 500 full term babies delivered by SCD randomized into two groups,&#xD;
      prone or supine position. Investigators will use a Panda warmer with built in Nellcor pulse&#xD;
      oximeter. Each infant will have heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and respiratory effort documented every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes of&#xD;
      life; beyond the initial 5minutes of life, monitoring as well as infant's management will be&#xD;
      done as per current Weiler hospital protocols. The intervention group will be placed in prone&#xD;
      position for first five minutes immediately after birth, and then changed to supine position.&#xD;
      The control group will be placed supine from birth. Investigators will check for the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of RD, supplemental oxygen need and duration, positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (PPV) need and duration or other use of respiratory support (intubation).&#xD;
      Additionally, investigators will record the number of infants requiring admission to the NICU&#xD;
      in each group, days of ventilatory support as well as the length of hospitalization.&#xD;

      1. Consent obtained prior to actual operative delivery and anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior to start of surgery an opaque envelope with random selection of post delivery&#xD;
           position, supine or prone, is opened&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pediatric team confirms with Obstetrician and delivery team the position in which the&#xD;
           infant will be given to pediatrics&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pediatric team member accepting the infant stays by the operating room table to observe&#xD;
           the delivery At actual delivery, the Panda radiant warmer Apgar clock will be started by&#xD;
           a Pediatric team member positioned at the warmer when the baby is delivered. Vitals&#xD;
           signs of HR, color and oxygen saturations will be recorded each minute for first five&#xD;
           minutes. Respiratory effort will be noted. The Apgar clock is available to document the&#xD;
           timing of the minute intervals heart rate and oxygen saturations on the preprinted grid&#xD;
           of the survey data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. When a Group A (supine) infant's transfer is made to Pediatrics, the infant will be kept&#xD;
      in the supine position in transit to warmer and on warmer until first towel drying completed,&#xD;
      30 - 60 seconds, consistent with NRP protocol. Pulse oximetry and temperature probe will be&#xD;
      placed. Vitals signs of HR, color and oxygen saturations will be recorded each minute for&#xD;
      first five minutes. Respiratory effort will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a Group B (start in prone position) the obstetrician places the baby in prone position,&#xD;
      clamps and cuts cord. The baby is given to Pediatrics in the prone position. The infant will&#xD;
      be kept in the prone position in transit to warmer and on warmer for first towel drying&#xD;
      completed. Pulse oximetry and temperature probe will be placed. Vitals signs of HR, RR and&#xD;
      oxygen saturations will be recorded each minute for first five minutes. Respiratory effort&#xD;
      will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. As toweling is changed the baby in prone position continues as such until five minutes&#xD;
      pass. After five minutes the baby is turned to supine position as per standard NRP protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Decision to initiate positive pressure ventilation and /or oxygen supplementation will be&#xD;
      guided by published NRP 2010 lower saturation targets (1 min &lt;60%, 2 min &lt;65%, 3 min &lt;70%, 4&#xD;
      min &lt;75%, 5 min &lt;80%) and/or by grunting, retractions ; discontinuation by high saturation&#xD;
      targets (1min &gt;65%, 2 min &gt;70%, 3min &gt;&gt;75%, 4 min &gt;80%, 5 min &gt;85%) and resolution of&#xD;
      respiratory distress. Positive pressure ventilation will be delivered via Neopuff device in&#xD;
      supine position (both groups); CPAP 5cm 21% initially, then the amount of oxygen will be&#xD;
      titrated to meet oxygen saturation target for given minute of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. After no more than 30 minutes, Primary Assignment for admission to the NBN vs. NICU is&#xD;
      made by a trained member of the study who was not in the operating room at the beginning of&#xD;
      the delivery when the initial positioning of the infant was revealed. This is possible with&#xD;
      24 hour coverage from attendings, fellows, and mid-level practioners. Determination is based&#xD;
      on Weiler NICU admission protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. If infant is to go to NBN then STS and breastfeeding protocols will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Infants developing respiratory distress in the NBN will be transferred to the NICU for&#xD;
      further evaluation and care 12. Infants admitted to NICU directly or via NBN would have vital&#xD;
      signs monitored as per NICU nursing protocol until discharge 13. Documentation of Length of&#xD;
      Stay in NBN or NICU will collected 14. Documentation of intensity of care, type of support,&#xD;
      maximum FiO2 required and duration of respiratory support in NICU will be collected.&#xD;
