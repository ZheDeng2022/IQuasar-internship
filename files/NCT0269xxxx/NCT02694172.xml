      The main objective of the clinical trial is to investigate whether overweight type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients have a different fecal microbiota profile compared with age, gender, BMI matched&#xD;
      subjects and with lean healthy subjects before and after the consumption of fiber rich cereal&#xD;
      bars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota refers to the bacterial communities in the gastrointestinal tract. The&#xD;
      diversity and quantity of bacteria vary depending on age of the individuals, daily diet and&#xD;
      the segment of the intestine, which makes the gut microbiota one of the most complex&#xD;
      bacterial ecosystems known to men. In general, over trillions of bacteria reside in human&#xD;
      gut. Recent evidence indicates that gut microbiota could be involved in host metabolism by&#xD;
      multiple pathways leading to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Increased fat&#xD;
      storage or obesity has become one of the leading public health issues in many developed and&#xD;
      developing countries. However, it is not clear whether type 2 diabetes is associated with a&#xD;
      unique gut microbiota profile. Therefore, the primary objective of the study is to compare&#xD;
      the fecal microbiota of overweight type 2 diabetic subjects to that of age, gender and BMI&#xD;
      matched subjects as well as with lean non-diabetic subjects. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that microbiota modifications with consumption of fiber rich food products can&#xD;
      improve the metabolic outcomes of type 2 diabetics. To test this hypothesis, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to provide each overweight participant with two cereal bars per day for 4&#xD;
      weeks. Anthropometric measurements and plasma parameters as well as the fecal microbiota will&#xD;
      be determined.&#xD;
