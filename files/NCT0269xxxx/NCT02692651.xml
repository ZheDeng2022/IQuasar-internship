  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of concomitant antibiotics (CA) is a known risk factor for treatment failure&#xD;
      in the treatment of CDI, as well as for recurrence of CDI. Recent data suggested that among&#xD;
      patients receiving CA, fidaxomicin is superior vancomycin. While these data are encouraging,&#xD;
      many clinicians remain unclear on how to apply these data to patient care. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients were excluded from the trials presented to the FDA if it was expected that they&#xD;
      would require ≥ 7 days of CA. Therefore, the clinical question still remains of how to apply&#xD;
      these data to the real world patient who requires a long course of CA and develops CDI while&#xD;
      on therapy. We therefore propose an open label, comparative and prospective study of&#xD;
      fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily vs oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for the treatment&#xD;
      of CDI among patients who are receiving a long course of CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that fidaxomicin will be superior to vancomycin with respect to clinical cure&#xD;
      for patients with CDI.&#xD;
