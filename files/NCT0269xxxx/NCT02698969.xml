  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a prospective, double-blind, single center randomized study&#xD;
      performed in 60 patients with ASA physical status I-II, between 18-80 years old, undergoing&#xD;
      dNMB with rocuronium during ear nose and throat (ENT) surgery. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed using a table created from the website www.randomization.com, and patients will be&#xD;
      divided equally into two groups: Treatment with Sugammadex (SUG group) or treatment with&#xD;
      Neostigmine (NEO group). Exclusion criteria will include: A history of hepatic or renal&#xD;
      disease, chron-ic or acute alcoholism, allergy or hypersensitivity to Sugammadex and/or&#xD;
      atropine or Neostigmine, current medications with CNS effects, a history of neurologic&#xD;
      disease, diaphragmatic palsy, pregnancy or nursing arrhythmias. Continuous neuromuscular&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed using TOF ratios obtained from ad-ductor pollicis muscle. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the surgical procedure, patients will receive either Neostigmine (NEO group) or&#xD;
      Sugammadex (SUG group) for NMB reversal. The physician who will administer the study drugs&#xD;
      will insure that is per-formed on an open-label (non-blinded) basis. All patients showing a&#xD;
      TOF ratio ≥0.9 will be extubated. Diaphragmatic function (assessed by ultrasonographic&#xD;
      evaluation of the TF and amplitude of excursion) will be evaluated in each subject at the&#xD;
      following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure when TOF ratio is 0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 15 and 30 minutes after discharge from the operating theatre. The physician who will&#xD;
           perform the ultrasound scan will be different from the one who involved with&#xD;
           administration of the drug for NMB reversal and the former will be blinded with respect&#xD;
           to treatment received by patients. It is likely that, despite a TOF value greater than&#xD;
           0.9, higher diaphragm recovery will occur earlier and last longer when reversal of the&#xD;
           NMB is achieved using Sugammadex (a specific antagonist) when compared with Neostigmine&#xD;
           (a non-specific reversal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to standardize the anesthetic technique, no premedication will be administered to&#xD;
      any patient candidate to undergo to microlaryngoscopy procedure. Besides each individual&#xD;
      enrolled will receive neuromuscular monitoring with ulnar nerve stimulation with TOF Watch®&#xD;
      (Organon, Oss, Netherlands). The device will be calibrated pre-operatively and parameters set&#xD;
      using standard train of four (TOF) methodology after administration of hypnotic drug prior to&#xD;
      muscle relaxation. Standard induction of general anesthesia will be performed using&#xD;
      intravenous (iv) fentanyl (2 mcg kg-1), propofol (2 mg kg-1), and rocuronium (0.6 mg kg-1).&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation will be performed when the patient fails to register signals with TOF.&#xD;
      Rocuronium (0.15 mg kg-1) will be re-administered when PTC elicits more than 5 twitches in&#xD;
      order to maintain a dNMB. Sevoflurane will be administered at1.0 MAC in an air/oxygen&#xD;
      mixture. Fentanyl will be titrated with a bolus of 0.5 mcg kg-1 every 30 minutes to maintain&#xD;
      analgesia. Prior to induction of anesthesia, ultrasonography diaphragm evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed using an ESAOTE ultrasound machine (ESAOTE MyLab, Genova, Italy) by assessing the&#xD;
      TF and amplitude of excursion. With the spontaneously breathing patient in semi-recumbent&#xD;
      position, the amplitude of excursion will be evaluated following the method of Kim et al (7)&#xD;
      using a 3.5-MHz ultrasound probe placed over the intercostal space above the 10th rib in the&#xD;
      right mid-axillary line for the right diaphragm and the left mid-axillary line for the left&#xD;
      diaphragm. The liver or spleen will be used as a window for each hemi-diaphragm. A&#xD;
      two-dimensional mode will be used to find the best approach and to select the exploration&#xD;
      line of each hemi-diaphragm. With the probe fixed on the chest wall during respiration, the&#xD;
      ultrasound beam will be directed to the hemi-diaphragmatic domes at an angle of not less than&#xD;
      70°. During inspiration, the normal diaphragm contracts and moves caudally toward the&#xD;
      transducer; this will be recorded as an upward motion of the M-mode tracing. The amplitude of&#xD;
      excursion will be measured on the vertical axis of the tracing from the baseline to the point&#xD;
      of maximum height of inspiration on the graph. Three measurements will be performed for each&#xD;
      patient and averaged for each side at each time point of the protocol (7). Moreover, TF will&#xD;
      be assessed following the method of Vivier et al (6) with a linear high frequency probe set&#xD;
      at 12 Mhz. The diaphragm will be located with same method described above and the zone of&#xD;
      apposition will assessed at 0.5-2 cm below the costophrenic sinus. The inferior border of the&#xD;
      costophrenic sinus will be identified at end-inspiration as the zone of transition from the&#xD;
      artifact representation of normal lung (the lung sliding) to the visualization of diaphragm&#xD;
      and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm thickness will be recorded in time motion (TM) mode. The diaphragm will be&#xD;
      outlined using the two clear bright parallel lines of the pleural and peritoneal membranes.&#xD;
      Measurements will be averaged out of three or more consecutive breaths on the last valid&#xD;
      image recorded at the end of each period (6) .At the conclusion of the surgical procedure and&#xD;
      when TOF neuromuscular monitoring shows a minimum of 2 twitches, patients will randomly&#xD;
      receive, as described above, either (NEO Group) iv Neostigmine 50 µg kg-1 and atropine 15 µg&#xD;
      kg-1 or (SUG group) iv Sugammadex 2 mg kg-1 to reverse residual curarization. Extubation will&#xD;
      be performed when all of the following criteria are met: Patient is awake and executes simple&#xD;
      commands, shows regular respiratory pattern with a tidal volume of 6-7 mL/kg referred to&#xD;
      ideal body weight (IBW) and a TOF ratio ≥0.9. During the period preceding a TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 ,&#xD;
      bilateral diaphragm ultrasonography evaluating amplitude of excursion and TF will be&#xD;
      performed to assess muscle recovery in spontaneous breathing patients. These measurements&#xD;
      will be compared with baseline muscle assessment. Three additional diaphragm ultrasound scans&#xD;
      will be performed 15 and 30 minutes after discharge from operating theatre. Follow up will be&#xD;
      performed to document every adverse event and complication that occurs until discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by the use of paper CRF pages. Data entry will be performed at one&#xD;
      central site that will maintain the overall database and will perform and be responsible for&#xD;
      the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted within 8 months -1 year from approval from our ethical committee.&#xD;
      A preliminary report will be completed and submitted after the first six months of data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by the use of paper CRF pages. Data entry will be performed at one&#xD;
      central site that will maintain the overall database and will perform and be responsible for&#xD;
      the data analysis. All the compiled CRFs will be archived. In order to eliminate possible&#xD;
      data entry errors, individual data will be compared to a range of plausible values. After&#xD;
      data entry, automated checks, that are defined beforehand (a priori), will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate internal inconsistencies, range errors, or missing data. For each&#xD;
      atypical/out-of-range/missing data, a query will be automatically sent to the investigator.&#xD;
      Once all the queries are solved, the database will be locked and used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.Statistical analysis will be performed in collaboration by the Department of&#xD;
      Statistics of the University of Florence. Complete data will not be unblinded until the&#xD;
      external medical and statistics review have been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and a single statistical analysis will be performed at the completion&#xD;
      of the study using an intention to treat (ITT) analysis. With regard to the primary endpoint,&#xD;
      differences between the two groups with respect to distribution of muscle function recovery&#xD;
      after deep muscular blockade will be subjected to non-parametric tests depending on the&#xD;
      characteristics of outcome distribution. To compare the primary endpoint between the 2&#xD;
      groups, the data will be analysed using Wilcoxon rank sum test for two independent samples as&#xD;
      they are expected to be continuous and not normally distributed. As a sensitivity analysis,&#xD;
      parametric tests will potentially be employed after thorough evaluation of the validity&#xD;
      distribution assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasonography and TOF data will be summarized by drug treatment group as mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, quintiles, and minim and maximum values. In addition, two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be calculated on the comparison between the two groups for the main&#xD;
      descriptive parameters of the primary and secondary variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to compare the different percentage of respiratory events in the two arms studied, a&#xD;
      chi square test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, descriptive statistics of all variables describing characteristics of the patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the study and of patients excluded from the study will be produced. The mean,&#xD;
      median, standard deviation and range will be calculated for continuous data by drug treatment&#xD;
      group. For categorical variables, frequency counts and percentages will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power/Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is the first clinical trial that proposes to evaluate this endpoint, no&#xD;
      published data are available at this time. However, assuming a 25% of difference of TF&#xD;
      between groups would be clinically meaningful, a confidence interval of 95% and power 80%,&#xD;
      sample size calculation provided by StatCalc EPI INFO ver 7.0 (Center for Diseases Control,&#xD;
      Atlanta, GA, USA) considered 28 patients for each group fundamental to reach the endpoint&#xD;
      predefined. This proposal requests funding for a pilot study, with a double blind design,&#xD;
      where participants will be randomly enrolled to receive Sugammadex or Neostigmine with a 1:1&#xD;
      allocation using the standardized table created with the website www.randomization.com.&#xD;
