      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the and performance of the Imricor Medical&#xD;
      Systems, Inc. (Imricor) MR Ablation Catheter when used with related accessories for the&#xD;
      treatment of type I atrial flutter. The Vision Ablation Catheter and its accessories have&#xD;
      been designed for use under fluoroscopic or magnetic resonance guidance. The study will be a&#xD;
      single center study conducted at the Leipzig University Hospital Heart Center in Germany. The&#xD;
      study population will consist of adult patients requiring ablation for type I atrial flutter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single center study conducted at the Leipzig University Hospital Heart&#xD;
      Center in Germany. 35 subjects including 5 roll-in subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will participate in the study. This study requires the use of investigational&#xD;
      products from two independent manufacturers: Imricor and Philips. Imricor has developed the&#xD;
      ablation catheter with related accessory cables and electrophysiology (EP)&#xD;
      recorder/stimulator system. Philips has developed an image guidance and mapping system that&#xD;
      is compatible with the Imricor products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vision-MR Ablation Catheter will be used in conjunction with the following&#xD;
      investigational products: Advantage-MR EP Recorder/Stimulator, Vision-MR Ablation Cable Set,&#xD;
      Vision-MR Diagnostic Cable, the interventional MRI Suite (iSuite) image guidance and mapping&#xD;
      system, and a dStream Interface (dSIF-FE). With the exception of iSuite and dSIF-FE, which&#xD;
      are manufactured by Philips, Imricor will provide all investigational devices used in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each procedure will require two single-use Vision-MR Ablation Catheters and one each of the&#xD;
      two single-use accessory catheter cables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation for the treatment of arrhythmia is an inherently complex procedure. Use of the&#xD;
      investigational products listed above under MR guidance is an emerging approach to performing&#xD;
      the interventional electrophysiology procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of adult patients requiring ablation for type I atrial&#xD;
      flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will require a follow-up visit or telephone call at seven days post procedure.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the expected total study duration is approximately 9 months with study start&#xD;
      planned for March 2016.&#xD;

    <description>Acute success defined as the demonstration of the established electrophysiological endpoint (e.g. bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block after radiofrequency application in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus) with the investigational device. Historically, the acute success rate for RF ablation of type I atrial flutter is 72%. Analysis will be based on a binomial proportion and expressed as a percentage. For a total of N subjects with S achieving success, the percentage, represented as P, will be calculated as P = 100*S/N.</description>

    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device or procedure. Analysis will be based on a binomial proportion and expressed as a percentage. For a total of N subjects with S experiencing an SAE related to the device or procedure, the percentage, represented as P, will be calculated as P = 100*S/N.</description>
