    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as a newly occurring or worsening adverse event (AE) observed after starting administration of study drug up until the end of study visit, inclusive. This includes abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram data that are defined as AEs if the abnormality induces clinical signs or symptoms, requires active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study drug or is clinically significant in the investigator's opinion. A serious AE (SAE) is defined as an AE with an outcome that results in death, is life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect or requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization.</description>
