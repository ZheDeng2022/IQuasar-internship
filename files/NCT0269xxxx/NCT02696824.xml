  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-arm effectiveness trial in Cape Town, South&#xD;
      Africa of a Xhosa-adapted, nurse-delivered, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for&#xD;
      depression and adherence, integrated into the HIV care setting in patients with HIV who did&#xD;
      not achieve viral suppression from first-line treatment. The CBT treatment will be compared&#xD;
      to enhanced usual care (Enhanced Treatment As Usual - ETAU) on study endpoints (as described&#xD;
      in study endpoints section below).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical Clinical depression is one of the highest comorbidities to HIV/AIDS, with estimated&#xD;
      rates up to 34.9 percent. Depression, in the context of HIV, leads to poor self-care behavior&#xD;
      such as non-adherence to ART and worse retention in care, which are critical for treatment&#xD;
      success. Based on our prior work, and given that CBT is an evidenced-based treatment for&#xD;
      depression, this is a two-arm effectiveness randomized controlled trial of nurse-delivered&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and adherence integrated into the HIV primary&#xD;
      care setting in S. Africa. To ensure that those who need this intervention the most will&#xD;
      receive it, participants will be patients with HIV who did not achieve viral suppression from&#xD;
      their first line ART, and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder.&#xD;
