      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of weight loss&#xD;
      counselling via a smartphone-app for patients with overweight/obesity in a 1-year long pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is organized in the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment (-14 to -2). Participants will be informed about the study. Participants agreed&#xD;
      to enter the study and signed an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening / Baseline measurement (week -2) Inclusion criteria will be checked. Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements: height, weight, waist circumference, body fat, blood pressure measurement,&#xD;
      blood sampling for blood glucose; HbA1c, Insulin; Triglyceride, HDL-Cholesterol (assessment&#xD;
      Part I). During the visit participants are requested to fill in a paper-pencil questionnaire:&#xD;
      socioeconomic background (only at the beginning of the study), dietary and exercise habits,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, self-effectiveness (assessment part II). The participants are&#xD;
      introduced to the smartphone assisted coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introductory phase (2 weeks): Participants take pictures of their meals with the app, which&#xD;
      they send to the dietitian. After the introductory phase, the patients and the dietitians&#xD;
      discuss via app how the patients should change their habits and agree on goals to reduce&#xD;
      their weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (12 weeks): Intensive online counselling with the smartphone app, with the agreed&#xD;
      upon goals in mind (5 days per week + one Skype call). Group counselling session with /&#xD;
      without a dietitian are held if necessary. Furthermore, the dietitians make available&#xD;
      information material for patient specific dietary topics online. Week 12: assessment I+II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (until week 25): The habits that further a weight reduction are being stabilised -&#xD;
      the frequency of the online counselling is reduced (3 days per week), group counselling with&#xD;
      / without a dietitian are held if necessary. Furthermore, the dietitians hand out information&#xD;
      material for patient specific dietary topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (week 26-52): This phase is relevant for maintaining the patient's wright. Online&#xD;
      counselling happens once every 2 weeks. Group counselling with / without a dietitian are held&#xD;
      if necessary. Furthermore, the dietitians hand out information material for patient specific&#xD;
      dietary topics. At the end end, the dietitians will again collect data (assessment I+II). The&#xD;
      online counselling process is evaluated with 3 group discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (week 104)&#xD;

      Recruitment process will be conducted in two parts. During the first part potential&#xD;
      participants will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the obesity centre during the current obesity consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During regularly information events at the obesity centre flyers will be handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During training courses for general practitioner at the obesity centre flyers will be&#xD;
           handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Through the network Medical AdiNetwork flyers will be send to general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;

           Anzeiger&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive written and verbal information about the study. After participants have&#xD;
      given informed consent for participation the second phase (screening process) take place. The&#xD;
      researchers determine eligibility of participants based on the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria at the Zentrum für Adipositas- und Stoffwechselmedizin Winterthur GmbH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight: Measurement take place in the morning, using a clinically validated and calibrated&#xD;
      scale (Seca mBCA 515, medical Body Composition Analyzer). The participant should be clothed&#xD;
      lightly, without shoes. Weight is recorded within 0.01 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI is calculated by dividing body weight (in kilograms) by height (in meters)2 Height is&#xD;
      measured using a calibrated stadiometer (Forma Seca). The subject stands erect with feet&#xD;
      positioned on the floor board of the stadiometer. Heels, buttocks, and back of head touch the&#xD;
      back board of the stadiometer with arms by sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waist circumference: For the measurement the tape will be located midway between the lower&#xD;
      rib and iliac crest. Each measurement is performed twice and recorded within 0.5 cm. If the&#xD;
      difference between the measurements is greater than 1 cm, a third measurement will be&#xD;
      performed, and the mean of the two closest measurements will be calculated. The participant&#xD;
      stand with feet close together, wear little clothing, should be relaxed, and the measurements&#xD;
      should be taken at the end of a normal expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body fat will be measured by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Seca mBCA 515, medical Body&#xD;
      Composition Analyzer). Participants will be asked not to eat, not to drink, not to smoke and&#xD;
      not to do any sport 1h before BIA measurement. They were also asked not to consume caffeine&#xD;
      or alcohol and other drugs 24 hours before. Bladder should be emptied before measurement.&#xD;
      Participants are lightly dressed during measurement and wear no tights. Measurement while&#xD;
      Standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters: Subjects have to be fasting over night (8 hours), abstained from&#xD;
      smoking, alcohol ingestion, caffeine-containing beverages, and vigorous exercise 48 h before&#xD;
      the experiments. The investigators inserted one venous catheter in a large antecubital vein&#xD;
      for blood sampling at week 0, 12 and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood glucose: filling in a small fluoride containing tube to put aside in the refrigerator&#xD;
      at 5°C. Standard value: &lt; 5.6 mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c: filling in a small EDTA containing tube to put aside in the refrigerator at 5°C.&#xD;
      Standard value: &lt;5.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triglyceride: filling in a special tube for centrifugation (10 min at 6000 rpm) for&#xD;
      extraction of blood serum to put aside in the refrigerator at 5°C. Standard value: &lt; 2.26&#xD;
      mmol/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin: filling in a special tube for centrifugation (10 min at 6000 rpm) for extraction of&#xD;
      blood serum to put aside in the refrigerator at 5°C. Standard value: 2.6-24.9 mIU/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDL-Cholesterol: filling in a special tube for centrifugation (10 min at 6000 rpm) for&#xD;
      extraction of blood serum to put aside in the refrigerator at 5°C. Standard value: &gt; 1.69&#xD;
      mmol/l (no cardiovascular risk); 1.15-1.68 mmol/l (moderate cardiovascular risk); &lt; 1.14&#xD;
      mmol/l (high cardiovascular risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-HCG filling in serum tube with seperating gel. Standard value: &lt;5 U/I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs: Blood pressure and heart rate will be investigated by the method of Riva Rocci&#xD;
      with a special measuring instrument (Firma boso-medicus SN 768 00 440 729 Bosch+Sohn GmbH und&#xD;
      Co) and a stethoscope. The patient has to be sit down for more then 15 min. These&#xD;
      measurements will be carried out 3 times in a row and the mean value will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following statistical hypotheses will be tested for the primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Change in weight from baseline to week 52 = 0 Alternative hypothesis: Change&#xD;
      in weight from baseline to week 52 ≠ 0 The sample size calculation was based on the&#xD;
      statistical hypotheses. Using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test with significance level&#xD;
      0.05 and power 80%, a sample size of 36 is needed to detect a weight change from baseline to&#xD;
      week 52 of 0.5 standard deviation, which corresponds to a medium effect size according to&#xD;
      Cohen. To account for drop-outs 50 patients will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis populations will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Per protocol (PP) Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be analyzed based on the ITT population. A supportive analysis based&#xD;
      on the PP population will be performed. For the primary outcome, the change in weight will be&#xD;
      calculated from baseline to week 52. The null hypothesis will be tested using a two-sided&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test with significance level 0.05. All outcomes will be analyzed based&#xD;
      on the ITT population. Supportive analyses based on the PP population will be performed. For&#xD;
      all secondary outcomes the changes will be calculated from baseline to the specified time&#xD;
      points. The changes over the whole observation period will be investigated using&#xD;
      non-parametric ANOVA methods for longitudinal data. Post-hoc tests for changes at all&#xD;
      measured time points may be performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Correlations between&#xD;
      outcome variables will be investigated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.&#xD;
      Two-tailed tests with significance level 0.05 will be used for all analyses. No adjustment&#xD;
      for multiple testing will be performed. All outcome variables will be summarized using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. All analyses will be performed using the latest version of R&#xD;
      (http://www.r-project.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No imputation of missing data will be performed. A row denoted &quot;Missing&quot; will be included in&#xD;
      count tabulations if necessary to account for drop-outs and missing values. For continuous&#xD;
      variables a column with the number of available observations will be added. Patients lost to&#xD;
      follow-up before reaching the primary outcome will not be replaced. The expected drop-out&#xD;
      rate has been accounted for in the sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for smartphone assisted coaching: Data entry by users (both the patient and the&#xD;
           dietitian) are always validated used predefined patterns and range checks. If for any&#xD;
           reason something goes wrong the user is informed about the unsuccessful data entry and&#xD;
           might be (depending on the severity of the error) forced to login to the respective&#xD;
           system again to assert that no inconsistent state is displayed to the user. Data is kept&#xD;
           consistent by validity checks defined by dietitians and is stored in a highly structured&#xD;
           and consistency-constrained database hosted by a medical infrastructure provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On-site clinical data management: All data are acquired by 2 persons (study nurse and&#xD;
           clinical subinvestigator) and are electronically immigrated from different equipment in&#xD;
           our electronically database. Data can than extracted for CRF and data analysis. The&#xD;
           patient key list will be archived at the clinic site, only the PI has the insight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All electronic data will be transferred via secure connections and stored in a secure&#xD;
           facility, according to regulations for sensitive private information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse or serious adverse events are not expected in this kind of intervention. But if&#xD;
      happen, these events will be described in the CRF, because they may be happened non-causal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance: All study personnel will be instructed by the PI for all study procedures.&#xD;
      The PI will furthermore ensure on-going correct data collection at the obesity center and the&#xD;
      Sponsor will ensure Oviva technical functionality and coaching operations. All study data&#xD;
      will be archived for a minimum of 10 years after study termination or premature termination&#xD;
      of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow standardized procedures and in accordance with the provisions blood samples are&#xD;
      generally stored at 5 degree celsius. Default storage: Blood samples (EDTA) for seven days;&#xD;
      Blood serum for one year. Afterwards, blood samples are destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject withdraws consent, the blood samples will be analyzed and afterwards destroyed&#xD;
      immediately. Data will be analyzed and anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: The monitor will visit the PI and study centre at periodic intervals, in addition&#xD;
      to maintaining necessary telephonic and written communication. The monitor will maintain&#xD;
      current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and&#xD;
      source documentation and discussion of the conduct of the study with the PI and their study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initiation visit will be performed before starting recruitment to ensure that the&#xD;
           site personnel have been thoroughly trained and the site is provided with all clinical&#xD;
           trial supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first monitoring visit will be conducted in March 2016 shortly after the first&#xD;
           participant has been enrolled to ensure that criteria for inclusion and exclusion have&#xD;
           been met and that all protocol procedures are being followed appropriately. All patients&#xD;
           enrolled will be verified to have met all inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent monitoring visits: Study Site will be monitored approximately 3 times&#xD;
           depending on the demands of the study (week 12, week 52, and week 104).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Closure of Study: A Site Close-Out Visit will be conducted after all participants have&#xD;
           completed the study and all queries have been answered. At this visit the monitors will&#xD;
           ensure that all trial documentation is in place, and will discuss archiving procedures&#xD;
           with the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communication between visits: Between monitoring visits, investigators will be&#xD;
           telephoned regularly by the monitors to verify patient enrolment status, review study&#xD;
           progress, answer protocol questions, CRF completion status and queries, and to ensure&#xD;
           that the study proceeds in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change Management: Basically, study will be conducted in compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
      If deviations are necessary, like changes to eligibility criteria, study design, recruitment,&#xD;
      assessment, intervention, outcomes, analyses) the proposed amendment will be submitted&#xD;
      well-founded to the sponsor. All investigators can make written suggestions in this regard&#xD;
      after consulting principal investigator. A written consent will be obtained from the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial amendments are only implemented after approval of the CEC. Under emergency&#xD;
      circumstances, deviations from the protocol to protect the rights, safety and well-being of&#xD;
      human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the CEC. Such deviations&#xD;
      will be documented and reported to the sponsor and the CEC as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Non-substantial amendments are communicated to the CEC within the Annual Safety Report&#xD;
      (ASR). Changes in the protocol are performed by the PI. The written correspondence is kept in&#xD;
      the Investigator Site File.&#xD;
