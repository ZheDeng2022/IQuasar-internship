    <textblock>
      This is a study of an investigational cancer vaccine called GRN-1201. Treatment with the&#xD;
      GRN-1201 vaccine is a type of immunotherapy. The goal of immunotherapy is to stimulate the&#xD;
      body's immune system (white blood cells) to attack cancer cells and kill them. GRN-1201&#xD;
      consists of 4 different peptides (small parts of proteins) that are expressed by melanoma&#xD;
      cells. The intent of treatment with GRN-1201 is to increase your body's immune response to&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further increase your body's immune response against tumor cells, the GRN-1201 vaccine&#xD;
      will be mixed with Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF, also known as&#xD;
      sargramostim). GM-CSF is a man-made protein that helps stimulate the immune system and&#xD;
      increase the response against the tumor cells. This is a phase I study which means that this&#xD;
      will be the first time GRN-1201 is given in combination with GM-CSF to humans. It will be&#xD;
      tested in a small number of people to evaluate its safety, find a safe dose, and identify&#xD;
      side effects. The safety of GRN-1201 will be tested at three different doses; the GM-CSF dose&#xD;
      will remain the same.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GRN-1201 is a novel HLA-A*02-restricted multiple-peptide, therapeutic cancer vaccine, being&#xD;
      developed by GreenPeptide for the treatment of melanoma because it can induce immune&#xD;
      responses against tumor associated antigens (TAAs), particularly cytotoxic T cell (CTL)&#xD;
      responses. Granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) (Leukine®,&#xD;
      SanofiAventis) will be administered in combination with GRN-1201 as an immuno-adjuvant&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to advanced melanoma, treatment options in the adjuvant setting are limited.&#xD;
      Surgical resection is the primary treatment of Stage IIb, IIc, and III melanoma patients. The&#xD;
      rate of disease recurrence in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM&#xD;
      Stage II (T2-4N0M0) and Stage III (TanyN+M0) disease ranges between 20 -60%, with 5-year&#xD;
      overall survival between 45 - 70%. Thus, safe and effective treatment options to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of recurrence are much needed. Considering their generally safe nature, peptide-based&#xD;
      cancer vaccines would be ideal to address this unmet medical need. Patients with Stage IIb,&#xD;
      IIc or III melanoma are, in general, healthy following local therapy. They are anticipated to&#xD;
      maintain an immune system uncompromised by chemotherapy or disease burden. Further, they may&#xD;
      have already developed immune response to TAAs targeted by GRN-1201, which may increase the&#xD;
      probability of developing effective immune responses. It is conceivable that the combination&#xD;
      of peptide vaccines with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, especially with a PD-1 pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor, could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy without increasing toxicity. Studies&#xD;
      evaluating the combination of a melanoma vaccine with nivolumab in advanced melanoma [14] and&#xD;
      resected high-risk metastatic melanoma patients [15] reported encouraging clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-clinical data suggest that GRN-1201 may have anti-tumor activity in the adjuvant&#xD;
      setting or may enhance activity of other drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant&#xD;
      or metastatic disease setting, by enhancing immune responses against TAAs.&#xD;
