      The ROSE-1 study is designed to determine the efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cell&#xD;
      therapy on ovarian function recovery in subjects with idiopathic and other types of premature&#xD;
      or primary ovarian failure (POF or POI) and low ovarian reserves.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), formerly referred to as premature ovarian failure&#xD;
      (POF), is defined as hypergonadotropic ovarian insufficiency occurring prior to age 40 (1).&#xD;
      It is surprisingly common and affects approximately 1% of women below the age of 40 (2, 3).&#xD;
      The incidence is 10% to 28% in women with primary amenorrhea and 4% to 18% in women with&#xD;
      secondary amenorrhea (2). The clinical manifestations include amenorrhea and abnormally high&#xD;
      levels of luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and low levels of Anti&#xD;
      Mullerian Hormone (AMH). The etiology of POI is unknown in most cases. It can be caused by a&#xD;
      combination of inherited conditions such as immune disorders, environmental toxins and&#xD;
      iatrogenic injury (2, 3). The majority of patients with POI are considered to have idiopathic&#xD;
      premature ovarian insufficiency because usually no cause can be identified (3). POI has been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with an increased incidence of other conditions, including&#xD;
      Alzheimer's, cardiovascular and immune system diseases, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis,&#xD;
      diabetes and cancer of reproductive organs. POI is characterized by loss of secondary&#xD;
      follicles, arrested folliculogenesis, decreased estrogen production, and infertility (3). The&#xD;
      mechanism of ovarian insufficiency is most likely accelerated follicular atresia but detailed&#xD;
      pathogenesis is yet to be fully understood (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women younger than 40, at least two menopausal FSH levels (â‰¥40 IU/L) will be sufficient&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of POI. It is not essential to have amenorrhea for the diagnosis of POI.&#xD;
      Subjects with oligomenorrhea or low ovarian reserve and elevated FSH, referred to as&#xD;
      transitional ovarian insufficiency (TOI), or at least 4 months amenorrhea together with FSH&#xD;
      levels exceeding 40 IU/liter, and are included in this category. Spontaneous menstrual cycles&#xD;
      can sometimes be seen after the diagnosis of POI as well. Resumption of normal ovarian&#xD;
      function, albeit temporary, in patients with normal karyotypes has been documented in 10 to&#xD;
      20% of patients; thus, spontaneous resumption of fertility is possible (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No therapeutic intervention has proven effective in restoring fertility in patients with POI.&#xD;
      Currently, egg donation remains the only reliable method to establish a pregnancy in women&#xD;
      with POI (2, 3). Even though this approach is attainable, resulting children will not be&#xD;
      genetically related to the recipient mother. Furthermore, egg donation is not ethically&#xD;
      acceptable to many couples. Various attempts at ovarian stimulation patients with POI are&#xD;
      usually unsuccessful because they are poor responders. Therefore, the diagnosis of POI can&#xD;
      cause great physical and mental suffering among these patients. Thus, there is critical need&#xD;
      to develop novel effective approaches for the treatment of POI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout life, there is an ongoing physiological level of atresia of oocytes. A decreased&#xD;
      germ cell endowment combined with an increased rate of germ cell destruction can explain POI&#xD;
      (1). The current concept that the ovary has a static ovarian reserve is entirely at odds with&#xD;
      the germ cell dynamics. Current research supports the concept that the ovary continues to&#xD;
      produce new germ cells into adult life, however, whether this occurs in humans is not&#xD;
      universally accepted. Recent research suggests that diminished ovarian reserve is a result of&#xD;
      the aging of the niche rather than a defect in the germ cells (4-6). Anti-mullerian hormone&#xD;
      has been used as a reliable biomarker for ovarian reserve in humans and the circulating AMH&#xD;
      levels change with age as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20-25: 1.23-11.51 ng/mL 26-30: 1.03-11.10 ng/mL 31-35: 0.66-8.75 ng/mL 36-40: 0.42-8.34 ng/mL&#xD;
      41-46: 0.26-5.81 ng/mL 47-54: &lt;0.82 ng/mL Emerging evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could restore the structure and function of injured tissues&#xD;
      (7). During embryologic development, cells of the mesodermal layer give rise to multiple&#xD;
      mesenchymal tissue types including bone, cartilage, tendon, muscle, and fat and marrow stroma&#xD;
      (8). These precursor cells, also present in the postnatal organism, are referred to as&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells. These stem cells have been shown to retain their developmental&#xD;
      potential following extensive sub-cultivation in vitro. Implantation of culture-expanded&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells has been demonstrated to effect tissue regeneration in a variety of&#xD;
      animal models and depends on local factors to stimulate differentiation into the appropriate&#xD;
      phenotype (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that stem cell therapy holds promise in treatment of variety of&#xD;
      diseases including reproductive dysfunction. In a recent investigation by Ghadami et al&#xD;
      (2012) in our lab at Augusta University in Georgia, BMSC treated animals resumed ovarian&#xD;
      function (9). In another investigation by Lui et al (2014), granulosa cell apoptosis induced&#xD;
      by cisplatin was reduced when BMSCs were migrated to granulosa cells in vitro. In this study,&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced POI rats were injected with BMSCs. The BMSCs treatment group's antral&#xD;
      follicle count and estradiol levels increased after 30 days, compared with untreated POI&#xD;
      group (10). In a recent clinical trial in Egypt, Edessy et al (2014) evaluated the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of autologous mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells transplantation in&#xD;
      women with POI. Ten patients with POI were selected and their ovaries were injected with&#xD;
      autologous BMSC at time of laparoscopy. The results revealed resumption of menstruation in&#xD;
      one case after 3 months; two cases showed focal secretory changes after having atrophic&#xD;
      endometrium (11). According to these results, BMSC seem to have the ability to revive&#xD;
      prematurely failed ovaries both in their hormonal and follicular development abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in this clinical trial, while at Augusta University, Georgia, USA, we have&#xD;
      successfully initiated two cases so far (8/10/2017). Both patients have tolerated the&#xD;
      procedure very well with no reported side effects or complications. Our first patient resumed&#xD;
      menses after 6 months post stem cell injection and she demonstrated decreasing levels of&#xD;
      serum FSH and increasing serum Estradiol levels (from undetectable levels pre-procedure, as&#xD;
      well as the one week, one month and 3 months' time points assessments to 96pg/ml at the 6&#xD;
      months' time point (latest data available so far). She also reported amelioration of her&#xD;
      post-menopausal symptoms including a decrease in hot flashes frequency and severity,&#xD;
      decreased vaginal dryness and improved sleeping patterns. The second patient will be finished&#xD;
      with the post-procedure follow up period on 2/21/2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell therapy has been shown to be beneficial and effective in various disease processes.&#xD;
      The safety of the stem cell therapy has been assessed in multiple clinical trials. Although,&#xD;
      autologous mesenchymal stem cell therapy for premature ovarian insufficiency is a novel&#xD;
      approach, the safety and success of such stem cell therapy has been demonstrated in many&#xD;
      other disease processes including graft versus host disease, acute myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and many other diseases (12-14). There are&#xD;
      additional ongoing trials (Pilot -Phase III) to further assess risk and safety of stem cell&#xD;
      based therapies (15-17). This interventional pilot clinical study will investigate the use of&#xD;
      stem cell therapy to restore steroidogenesis, folliculogenesis, menstruation, and fertility&#xD;
      in participants.&#xD;
