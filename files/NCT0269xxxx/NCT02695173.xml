    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare, by insulin use at the index date, the sex-specific&#xD;
      incidence of hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit for severe complications of&#xD;
      urinary tract infections (UTI), defined as pyelonephritis and urosepsis, among patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are new users of dapagliflozin with those who are new&#xD;
      users of antidiabetic drugs (ADs) in classes other than sodium-glucose cotransporter 2&#xD;
      (SGLT2) inhibitors, insulin monotherapy, metformin monotherapy, or sulfonylurea monotherapy.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this research study is to estimate the sex-specific incidence of&#xD;
      hospitalization or emergency department visit for severe complications of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections, defined as pyelonephritis and urosepsis, in patients who are prescribed&#xD;
      dapagliflozin compared to patients prescribed other specific oral antidiabetic drugs.&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Because of the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin and results from small safety monitoring&#xD;
      studies, there is interest in further evaluating the safety of dapagliflozin in large&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be implemented in three administrative health care data sources in two&#xD;
      countries: in the United Kingdom, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD); and in the&#xD;
      United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare databases and&#xD;
      the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM). Individuals in the databases will be&#xD;
      included in the study if they meet the following age criteria; 18 years and older (CPRD and&#xD;
      HIRD), or 65 years or older (Medicare); and if they did not have type 1 diabetes, are new&#xD;
      users of one of the study drugs and meet the criteria of at least 180 days of electronic data&#xD;
      before their first prescription of the study drug. The study period starts July 1, 2013 in&#xD;
      CPRD, January 1, 2014 in PHARMO and January 9, 2014 in the United States data sources, and&#xD;
      will end at the latest available data at each database at the time of analysis&#xD;
