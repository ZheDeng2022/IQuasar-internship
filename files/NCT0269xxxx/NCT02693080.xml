    <textblock>
      This study assesses computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging in predicting treatment&#xD;
      response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or tumors that have spread from the&#xD;
      primary site (place where it started) to the lungs (metastases) treated with stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative radiation therapy. CT perfusion imaging is a special type of CT that uses an&#xD;
      injected dye in order to see how blood flow through tissues, including lung tissue. CT&#xD;
      perfusion imaging of the lungs may help doctors learn whether perfusion characteristics of&#xD;
      lung tumors may be predictive of response to treatment and whether lung perfusion&#xD;
      characteristics can be used to follow response to treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of performing computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging (CT&#xD;
      perfusion imaging) at baseline, within 48 hours post-stereotactic ablative radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SABR), and at 2-4 months SABR in patients undergoing SABR for treatment of a lung tumor per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the range (variability) of perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48&#xD;
           hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the change in perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and&#xD;
           at 2-4 months post-SABR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate any change in perfusion parameters with circulating-tumor deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
           acid (DNA) levels at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate perfusion parameters with tumor response 1 year post-SABR&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive an infusion of Isovue-200 and undergo CT perfusion imaging of the lungs at&#xD;
      baseline, within 48 hours of first SABR, and at 2-4 months after completion of SABR. Cancer&#xD;
      Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) will be conducted evaluate&#xD;
      circulating-tumor DNA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion parameters will be correlated with tumor control at 1 year post-SABR, with tumor&#xD;
      control defined as no evidence of disease seen at the site of SABR by surveillance imaging at&#xD;
      1 year post-SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 months and then at 1 year.&#xD;
