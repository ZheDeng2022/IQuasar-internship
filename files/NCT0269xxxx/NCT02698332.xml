    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of diagnostic algorithm for urinary tract&#xD;
      infection (UTI) on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics and use of diagnostics for patients&#xD;
      with symptoms of urinary tract infection consulting their general practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 general practices participating in an observational study regarding UTI are randomized to&#xD;
      either receiving a diagnostic algorithm or not receiving anything additional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational on the patient level and interventional on the practice level.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Cluster randomized controlled single blinded study of a diagnostic&#xD;
      aid in general practice RECRUITMENT OF GENERAL PRACTICES Recruitment of general practices was&#xD;
      done through online advertisement in email newsletters for general practice, invitation by&#xD;
      post of 200 practices and invitation of 44 general practices already participating in a&#xD;
      medical audit project regarding UTI (ref til Gloria). Only practices in the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark could participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Randomization was performed using an online random number&#xD;
      generator and an employee not part of the investigation team sent out the diagnostic&#xD;
      algorithm to the intervention group. The practices were asked not to reveal their allocation&#xD;
      to the investigators in case of contact. Allocation was concealed to the investigators until&#xD;
      after analysis of the primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION AND CONTROLS The practices in the intervention group received a laminated&#xD;
      diagnostic algorithm by post and got access to a smart-phone integrated web-page, which could&#xD;
      calculate post-test probabilities based on pre-test probabilities and accuracy of diagnostic&#xD;
      tests .The diagnostic algorithm consists of three parts, one about urine dipstick, one about&#xD;
      point-of-care microscopy and one about urine culture . The practices were instructed, use of&#xD;
      the algorithm was voluntary. Control practices did not receive a diagnostic algorithm and did&#xD;
      not have access to the smart-phone integrated web-page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT OF PATIENTS The practices were told to register diagnostics and treatment on the&#xD;
      first 20-40 patients presenting in general practice with symptoms of UTI regardless of age,&#xD;
      sex and comorbidity. For each patient, the practice sent a urine sample to the&#xD;
      microbiological department as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Inclusion criteria were all patients with symptoms of UTI&#xD;
      who had not formerly participated in the study and where urinalysis was performed. The only&#xD;
      exclusion criterion was acute admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT On the patient-level, the study was observational and&#xD;
      anonymous. The practices registered clinical history, diagnostics and treatment using a&#xD;
      case-report form where data on all patients fit into one sheet of paper. On day one (the day&#xD;
      of consultation), clinical history, diagnostics, diagnosis and treatment were registered. On&#xD;
      day two (the day after the consultation), result of the point-of-care urine culture, if such&#xD;
      was performed, and the subsequent diagnosis and treatment were registered. The result of the&#xD;
      reference urine culture was registered when the result was reported back to the practice on&#xD;
      day 4-6. The intervention group could use the algorithm as they saw fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REFERENCE CULTURE Urine for the microbiological department was incubated in a standardized&#xD;
      boric-acid container (Urine-Monovette®, Sarstedt) and collected by a transport service from&#xD;
      the microbiological departments. At the microbiological laboratories (Herlev and Hvidovre),&#xD;
      urine sample were analyzed on Inoqul A™ Bi-plate (CHROMagar and blood agar) with 10 μL on&#xD;
      each half of the agar. The susceptibility pattern was determined on Mueller Hinton agars with&#xD;
      disks containing mecillinam, trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethizol. Significant&#xD;
      growth was defined as growth of ≥103 cfu/mL for E. coli and S. saprophyticus, ≥104 cfu/mL for&#xD;
      other typical uropathogens and ≥105 cfu/ml for possible uropathogens in accordance with&#xD;
      European consensus[21]. Plates with significant growth of more than two uropathogens were&#xD;
      labeled as mixed cultures (inconclusive). The result was sent to practices within 4-5&#xD;
      workdays electronically and practices registered the result of the culture and susceptibility&#xD;
      against mecillinam, trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethizol on the case-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS AND PATIENT SAFETY The study was presented to the ethical committee of Copenhagen and&#xD;
      did not require ethical approval since the study was purely observational on the patient&#xD;
      level and did not interfere with patient-treatment. Registration of patient data was done&#xD;
      anonymously and did not require approval from the Danish data protection agency.&#xD;
