  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked (DM), vehicle-controlled, single-center&#xD;
      study plus open label extension period (OLE) in which approximately 12 subjects with LHON&#xD;
      having the genetic mtDNA mutation m.11778G&gt;A were randomized in a masked manner into 1 of 3&#xD;
      groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: one drop of elamipretide 1.0% topical ophthalmic solution twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) in the: left eye, right eye, or both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the 52-week treatment period or the Week 56 follow-up period, subjects&#xD;
      were invited to participate in the OLE period for up to 108 weeks. During the OLE&#xD;
      participants received 1% topical opthalmic elamipretide in both eyes (OU) daily. If a subject&#xD;
      did not consent to the OLE, he/she completed the study at the Week 56 (±7 days) visit. There&#xD;
      were 4 periods in this study: (1) screening period (up to 6 weeks); (2) double-masked&#xD;
      treatment period (52 weeks); (3) OLE period (up to 108 weeks), and (4) follow-up period (4&#xD;
      weeks) after completion of End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit.&#xD;

    <description>Letters are arranged on a 60 x 85 cm chart in sets of triplets which contain the same contrast, decreasing in log10 contrast from top to bottom and left to right as participant progresses from one triplet to the other. Each group of three letters is decreased in contrast by a factor 0.71 (1/√2) (log contrast 0.15) of the proceeding set. Participant reads letters, starting with highest contrast, until unable to read letters in a single group. Score is based on the contrast of the last group read correctly.The size of the letters on the chart subtend 0.5 degrees at 3m, The test is scored in LogCS units, where each set of triplets advances in steps of 0.15 log units ranging from LogCS of 0.00 (approx. 100% contrast) to LogCS 2.25 (approx. 0.56% contrast). Change from baseline: the more negative the number means poor outcome, the more positive the number means better outcome.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) Distance Activities score. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <title>Double Masked Period: Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</title>
        <description>Double Masked Period: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale by visit. ETDRS charts present a series of five letters of equal difficulty on each row, with standardized spacing between letters and rows; there is a total of 14 lines (70 letters), with letter size increasing further geometrically and equivalently in every line by a factor of 1.2589 (or 0.1 log unit), moving up the chart. Minimum score of zero, maximum score of 100. Change from baseline: a more negative score is worse outcome, a more positive score is better outcome. A lower score means less letters were read correctly (worse outcome) and a higher score means more letters were read correctly (better outcome).</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period: Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Using the Using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Scale</title>
        <description>Open Label Extension Period: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale by visit. ETDRS charts present a series of five letters of equal difficulty on each row, with standardized spacing between letters and rows; there is a total of 14 lines (70 letters), with letter size increasing further geometrically and equivalently in every line by a factor of 1.2589 (or 0.1 log unit), moving up the chart. Minimum score of zero, maximum score of 100. Change from baseline: a more negative score is worse outcome, a more positive score is better outcome. A lower score means less letters were read correctly (worse outcome) and a higher score means more letters were read correctly (better outcome).</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR-ERG) a-wave amplitude by Visit. Photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR-ERG) assesses retinal cell function. A decrease in the amplitude of the a-wave is associated with worse outcomes. Change from baseline in a-wave amplitude: a more positive number equals a decrease in amplitude, and therefore a worse outcome, a more negative number mean a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR-ERG) a-wave Amplitude by Visit. Photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR-ERG) assesses retinal cell function. A decrease in the amplitude of the a-wave is associated with worse outcomes. Change from baseline in a-wave amplitude: a more positive number equals a decrease in amplitude, and therefore a worse outcome, a more negative number mean a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period: PhNR-ERG B-wave Amplitude</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR-ERG) b-wave Amplitude by Visit. Photopic negative response electroretinography (PhNR -ERG) assesses retinal cell function. A decrease in the amplitude of the b-wave is associated with worse outcomes. Change from baseline in b-wave amplitude: a more negative number equals a decrease in amplitude, and therefore a worse outcome, a more positive number means a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Double Masked: VFQ-39 Composite</title>
        <description>Double Masked: Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) Composite score by visit. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 measures health-related quality of life in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, peripheral vision, and composite score. For each domain: the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period: VFQ-39 General Health Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) General Health score. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period: VFQ-39 Ocular Pain Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in VFQ-39 Ocular Pain score by visit. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 measures health-related quality of life in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, peripheral vision, and composite score. For each domain: the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline in visual field Mean Deviation(MD) as measured by Humphrey automated visual field testing stimulus III by visit. The Humphrey visual field test measures the entire area of peripheral vision that can be seen while the eye is focused on a central point. Mean deviation (MD) is the mean deviation in the patient's results compared to those expected from the age-matched normative database. Lower/More negative scores mean worse outcome, higher/more positive score means better outcome.</description>

        <title>Double Masked Period: Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity by Pelli-Robson Contrast Sensitivity Chart by Visit</title>
        <description>Letters are arranged on a 60 x 85 cm chart in sets of triplets which contain the same contrast, decreasing in log10 contrast from top to bottom and left to right as participant progresses from one triplet to the other. Each group of three letters is decreased in contrast by a factor 0.71 (1/√2) (log contrast 0.15) of the proceeding set. Participant reads letters, starting with highest contrast, until unable to read letters in a single group. Score is based on the contrast of the last group read correctly.The size of the letters on the chart subtend 0.5 degrees at 3m, The test is scored in LogCS units, where each set of triplets advances in steps of 0.15 log units ranging from LogCS of 0.00 (approx. 100% contrast) to LogCS 2.25 (approx. 0.56% contrast). Change from baseline: the more negative the number means poor outcome, the more positive the number means better outcome.</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period: Change From Baseline in Contrast Sensitivity by Visit</title>
        <description>Letters are arranged on a 60 x 85 cm chart in sets of triplets which contain the same contrast, decreasing in log10 contrast from top to bottom and left to right as participant progresses from one triplet to the other. Each group of three letters is decreased in contrast by a factor 0.71 (1/√2) (log contrast 0.15) of the proceeding set. Participant reads letters, starting with highest contrast, until unable to read letters in a single group. Score is based on the contrast of the last group read correctly. The size of the letters on the chart subtend 0.5 degrees at 3m, The test is scored in LogCS units, where each set of triplets advances in steps of 0.15 log units ranging from LogCS of 0.00 (approx. 100% contrast) to LogCS 2.25 (approx. 0.56% contrast). Change from baseline: the more negative the number means poor outcome, the more positive the number means better outcome.</description>

        <title>Double Masked: VFQ-39 Distance Activities Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) Distance Activities score. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <description>Change in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) Distance Activities Score.National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) Mental Health score. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>

        <title>Open Label Extension Period:VFQ-39 Dependency Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39 ) Dependency Score. National Eye Institute VFQ-39 score measures health-related quality of life of subjects with visual impairment, in 12 domains: general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, vision-specific social functioning, vision-specific mental health, vision-specific role difficulties, vision-specific dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision and 1 composite score. Each domain is converted to a 0 to 100 scale; the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Higher score means higher functioning. Scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score. For the composite score, the vision-targeted sub-scale scores are averaged, excluding the general health questions. Domain scores from each cohort are averaged and the change from baseline per domain is calculated.</description>
