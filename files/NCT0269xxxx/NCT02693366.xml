      The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety, renal function, metabolic disorders and&#xD;
      quality of life data in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis treated with&#xD;
      endovascular infusion of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Will be studied five patients with progressive chronic kidney disease and estimated clearance&#xD;
      between 40 and 20 ml / min. Patients will be followed by clinical and laboratory examination&#xD;
      for 3 months prior to the procedure. These previous results serve as a control for comparison&#xD;
      with a second time when the same patients receive treatment with stem cells being&#xD;
      subsequently followed up for 9 months a total of one year of clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration and subsequent cell preparation were accomplished on the same day as&#xD;
      the endovascular infusion of autologous Bone Marrow derived Mononuclear stem cells (BMDMCs)&#xD;
      in both renal arteries. Collection was performed under spinal anesthesia and light sedation,&#xD;
      through puncture and repeated aspirations at the posterior iliac crest region. A total of 80&#xD;
      mL of bone marrow aspirate was collected from each patient, and after removal of bone and&#xD;
      fatty residues, mononuclear cells were isolated by a Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences,&#xD;
      São Paulo, Brazil).For each patient, 2×107 cells will be labeled with 99mTc. Briefly, 500 μl&#xD;
      of sterile SnCl2 solution is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at room&#xD;
      temperature for 10 min. Forty-five millicurie (mCi) of 99mTc is then added and incubation&#xD;
      continued for another 10 min. After centrifugation (500×g for 5 min), the supernatant is&#xD;
      removed and the cells are washed in saline solution. The pellet will be also resuspended in&#xD;
      saline solution. Viability of the labeled cells will be assessed by the trypan blue exclusion&#xD;
      test, and estimated to be greater than 93% in all cases.The labeling efficiency (%) will be&#xD;
      calculated by the activity in the pellet divided by the sum of the radioactivity in the&#xD;
      pellet plus supernatant and estimated to be greater than 90% in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the collection of the stem cells, the patient will be submitted to puncture the femoral&#xD;
      artery using the Seldinger technique under local anesthesia, followed by catheterization of&#xD;
      the ostium of the renal arteries with minimum use of nonionic iodinated contrast. With the&#xD;
      routing of diagnostic catheter or guide, the solution numbering about 30 to 100 million of&#xD;
      dissolved plasma cells will be divided and injected into two renal arteries. The infusion&#xD;
      volume is about 5 ml in each kidney. Whole body and planar scans will be performed 2 and 24h&#xD;
      after infusion to determine the migration and cell viability. The patient will remain&#xD;
      hospitalized for more 48 hours for clinical monitoring and collection of laboratorial tests.&#xD;
