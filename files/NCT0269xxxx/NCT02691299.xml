  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase III clinical trial&#xD;
      in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with&#xD;
      Fruquintinib who failed 2 lines of systemic chemotherapy or with non-tolerable toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 521 subjects will be randomized to Fruquintinib group or placebo group at a&#xD;
      ratio of 2:1. Patients in the two groups can receive supportive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by EGFR gene status (mutant vs. wild type) and history of&#xD;
      treatment by VEGF inhibitors (yes vs no) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive study treatment in 4-week cycles: Fruquintinib/placebo for 3&#xD;
      consecutive weeks, and then one week off. Tumor assessment will be performed every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      the first 2 cycles, and every 8 weeks since the 3rd cycle, until disease progression or&#xD;
      death. Subsequent anti-neoplastic treatment and survival status will be followed up after&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
