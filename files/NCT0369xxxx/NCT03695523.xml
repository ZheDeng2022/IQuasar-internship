  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effectiveness and appropriateness of a written physical activity&#xD;
      policy implemented in licensed centre-based childcare on the physical activity levels of&#xD;
      toddlers (1-2) and preschoolers (3-5 years). Half of the childcare centres will adopt the&#xD;
      physical activity policy while the other half will continue with their typical daily&#xD;
      programming and care. It is hypothesized that children enrolled in childcare centres that&#xD;
      adopt the policy will display increased levels of physical activity during, and after&#xD;
      participating in the policy intervention compared to children enrolled in centres that do not&#xD;
      adopt the policy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot, cluster single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted.&#xD;
      Approximately 8 licensed childcare centres will be randomly selected from an online listing&#xD;
      of centres in London, Canada. Since it is necessary to implement the policy at the&#xD;
      centre-level to groups of children, the childcare centres (i.e., the clusters) rather than&#xD;
      the individual participants, will be randomly allocated to either implement the physical&#xD;
      activity policy (experimental; n = 4), or maintain their daily programming (control; n = 4)&#xD;
      for the 8-week intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, toddlers' and preschoolers' physical activity will be objectively measured&#xD;
      using motion sensors (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers) worn on an elastic waistband for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days, during childcare hours, before the policy is implemented (baseline; week 0;&#xD;
      September 2018), mid-intervention (week 4; October 2018), one week after the intervention&#xD;
      period ends (post-intervention; week 9; November/December 2018), and 6-months&#xD;
      post-intervention (May-June 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the impact of a childcare physical activity policy on the&#xD;
      objectively measured physical activity levels (light physical activity, LPA;&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, MVPA), and combined total physical activity (TPA),&#xD;
      and sedentary time of young children in childcare centres compared to children from centres&#xD;
      that maintain their usual standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>Self-efficacy scale for physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Providers will be asked to complete this survey one week prior to baseline measures (Time 1), at baseline (i.e., week 0; Time 2), then again at mid-intervention (i.e., week 4; Time 3), post-intervention (i.e., week 9; Time 4), and at 6 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Developed for the study to assess childcare providers' self-efficacy to engage children in physical activity during hours of care. Providers are instructed to rate their confidence to each of 40 items on a Likert scale from 1 (no confidence at all) to 5 (somewhat confident) to 10 (completely confident). The psychometric properties of the scale will be evaluated, and childcare providers' self-efficacy may be examined as a correlate of children's objectively measured physical activity. Changes in self-efficacy across groups and time will be assessed.</description>

    <description>An evidence-based physical activity policy that was developed by researchers and childcare stakeholders and directed by the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for the Early Years will be adopted by experimental group childcare centres for 8 weeks. The policy incorporates 8 items (i.e., encouraging children to engage in higher intensity energetic play often, aiming to accumulate 40 minutes each day, exposing children to a variety of indoor and outdoor physical activities, child-directed and teacher-facilitated active play daily, short bouts of outdoor time for a total of 120 minutes each day made up of primarily unstructured free play, encouraging physical literacy by practicing fundamental movement skills, not exposing children to screen-based technology during childcare, and purposefully breaking up sustained sedentary time using physical activities).</description>
