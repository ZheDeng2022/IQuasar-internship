    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205&#xD;
      (BMS-986205) when given together with nivolumab and how well it works as first or second line&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with liver cancer. BMS-986205 may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      BMS-986205 and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain the safety and tolerability of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      unresectable / metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the first or second line setting&#xD;
      using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (V)5.0 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine efficacy as defined by objective response rate (ORR) of BMS-986205 in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab in unresectable / metastatic HCC in the first or second line&#xD;
      setting using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) by RECIST 1.1 and ORR using immune RECIST (iRECIST)&#xD;
      of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in unresectable HCC. (Phase II) II. To further&#xD;
      evaluate safety of BMS-986205 in combination with nivolumab in unresectable HCC. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
