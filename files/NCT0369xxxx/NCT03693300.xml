      This is a Phase II, open-label, multi-centre study to determine safety of a fixed dose of&#xD;
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500 mg) monotherapy in participants with unresectable Stage III NSCLC&#xD;
      who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT. Approximately, 150&#xD;
      participants will be treated with the study drug in Europe and North America. Participants&#xD;
      will be in complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or have stable disease (SD)&#xD;
      following definitive, platinum-based sCRT, as assessed by the Investigator and further&#xD;
      supported by the screening imaging radiological assessment. Participants must not have&#xD;
      progressed following definitive, platinum-based sCRT; radiation therapy must be completed&#xD;
      within 42 days prior to first Investigational product (IP) dose administration. Participants&#xD;
      must have histologically- or cytologically-documented NSCLC and locally-advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable Stage III disease. Participants will be treated with the study drug in 2&#xD;
      cohorts: approximately 100-120 participants in the World Health Organization/Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (WHO/ECOG PS) 0 to 1 Cohort and up to 30&#xD;
      participants in the WHO/ECOG PS 2 Cohort.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Receipt of sCRT which must have been completed within 42 days prior to first IP dose&#xD;
             administration in the study.&#xD;

                  (SoC) regimens. Platinum-based chemotherapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin&#xD;
                  and gemcitabine is permitted under certain conditions - refer to bullet point&#xD;
                  6(b).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must have received at least 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
                  before radiation therapy. The interval between administration of the last dose of&#xD;

             (HBV) infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and&#xD;
             absence of HbsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C antibody are&#xD;
             eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Patients with Grade ≥2 neuropathy or Grade ≥2 lymphopenia will be evaluated on a&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Patients with irreversible toxicity not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by&#xD;
                  treatment with durvalumab (MEDI4736) may be included only after consultation with&#xD;
                  the Study Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to durvalumab (MEDI4736) or any of the IP&#xD;
             excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have received cCRT for locally-advanced NSCLC, or who received sCRT with&#xD;
             at least 2 concomitant CRT cycles. Prior surgical resection (ie, Stage I or II) is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Patients whose platinum-based chemotherapy contained gemcitabine and who&#xD;
             received sCRT with at least 1 concomitant CRT cycle are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP.&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Prior exposure to immune-mediated therapy, including but not limited to, other anti&#xD;
             CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti PD L2 antibodies, excluding therapeutic&#xD;
             anticancer vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of IP. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  articular injection);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent;&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Previous IP assignment in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             first IP dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Prior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab (MEDI4736) ± tremelimumab&#xD;
             clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Judgment by the Investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Genetic research study (optional):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for participation in the optional (DNA) genetic research component of&#xD;
