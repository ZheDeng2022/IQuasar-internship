      This is an explorative, phase I clinical trial. The aim of this study is to establish the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of treating patients with early colorectal cancer with calcium&#xD;
      electroporation as a down staging and immune-response enhancing treatment prior to intended&#xD;
      curative surgery. The study involves recruitment of patients with histologically verified&#xD;
      rectal and sigmoid colon cancer with no indication for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      (experimental or standard care based) prior to intended curative surgery. In total the study&#xD;
      will involve 24 patients, of these, 12 patients with rectal cancer and 12 patients with&#xD;
      sigmoid colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In relation to the intervention, clinical examination, blood samples, biopsies and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be collected to evaluate safety, tumor respons and immunologic response&#xD;
      to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for one month after the elective surgery.&#xD;
