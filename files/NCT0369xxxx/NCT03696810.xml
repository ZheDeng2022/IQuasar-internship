      Characterization of Retinal vascular disease in eyes with mild to moderate NPDR in Diabetes&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a frequent complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and is the&#xD;
      main cause of vision loss in the working population in western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies provided evidence that good diabetic control is important to prevent and&#xD;
      delay disease progression, but while some patients develop sight-threatening DR (STDR)&#xD;
      despite good control, others escape the development of vison loss with poor metabolic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STDR is defined as DME and PDR. DME is defined as thickening of the macula and is mainly&#xD;
      due to accumulation of fluid in the central macular area resulting mainly from fluid leakage&#xD;
      due to the alterations of the BRB. Identifying the eyes/patients at risk to develop central&#xD;
      involved macular edema (CIME) and consequent vision-loss, as well as to understand its causes&#xD;
      is fundamental for its appropriate treatment and, finally, to avoid vision loss due to DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown different prevalence's of DR, ranging from 10.1% to 48.1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of DM in Portugal has increased and, between patients aged 20 to 79 years, was&#xD;
      11.7% in 2009, reaching 13.3% in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic diseases often begin with a symptom-free phase being biomarkers fundamental in the&#xD;
      identification of high-risk individuals in a reliably and timely manner, so that they can&#xD;
      either be treated before onset of the disease or as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has identified 3 different phenotypes of progression based on the microaneurysm&#xD;
      (MA) turnover rate (sum of MA formation and disappearance rates) and central retinal&#xD;
      thickness (RT) measurements obtained using non-invasive repeatable procedures: digital color&#xD;
      fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). MA turnover can identify&#xD;
      eyes at risk of progression to Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME), as shown by our&#xD;
      research results and an independent group. RT obtained with OCT provides insight into&#xD;
      morphological changes of the retina in DR and DME, allowing the detection of retinal edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will address only two of the published phenotypes, B and C, which show more&#xD;
      rapid progression to STDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an improved characterization of the main microvascular alterations that occur in NPDR,&#xD;
      the investigators will use novel noninvasive, direct, objective and quantitative OCT-based&#xD;
      methodologies: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and OCT-Leakage (OCT-L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCTA allows the construction of three-dimensional blood flow information, and therefore can&#xD;
      serve as a method to evaluate ocular circulation. OCTA is non-invasive and has the potential&#xD;
      to be superior to fluorescein angiography (FA) in the detection and follow-up of DR lesions&#xD;
      and mean vessel density measured in the superficial retinal layer in OCTA revealed to be a&#xD;
      good differentiator between healthy eyes and eyes with DR. Vessel density was also correlated&#xD;
      with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and severity of DR, suggesting that capillary&#xD;
      closure may provide relevant information regarding progression of DR in individual patients&#xD;
      with DM and may be a potential indicator for vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT-Leakage (OCT-L) is a new non-invasive imaging technique that performs automated analysis&#xD;
      of the retinal extracellular space using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (SD-OCT). Abnormal fluid accumulation is an indicator of breakdown of the blood-retinal&#xD;
      barrier (BRB), which is an early and frequent finding in DR. Our research group showed the&#xD;
      importance of this new method and demonstrated the increased sensitivity of OCT-L to detect&#xD;
      abnormal fluid in the retina when compared with FA. This can be particularly useful to better&#xD;
      characterize and identify features associated to leaky phenotype B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major objective of this study is to investigate changes in OCTA and OCT-L that may be&#xD;
      biomarkers in the diagnosis and progression of NPDR and its ability to distinguish different&#xD;
      stages of the disease. The identification with OCT-L of the abnormal fluid and alteration of&#xD;
      the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), its location and quantification, complementing conventional&#xD;
      OCTA, providing, therefore, information on capillary closure, vascular morphology and their&#xD;
      alterations over 2 years, are expected to contribute to our understanding of DR progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of biomarkers of DR progression, such as MA turnover and RT are important steps.&#xD;
      However, OCTA and OCT-L offer an opportunity of improved characterization of the different DR&#xD;
      phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to better characterize the main alterations of the different phenotypes of&#xD;
      DR considered to be leaky (OCT-L) or ischemic (OCTA), and to identify patients at risk of&#xD;
      progression to STDR, identified in this study as central-involved ME (CIME), objectively&#xD;
      measured by OCT or development of PDR, using these recent non-invasive techniques: OCTA and&#xD;
      OCT-L.&#xD;
