  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases remain a major public health issue affecting millions of people&#xD;
      worldwide. More than 15 million people are estimated to be diagnosed with COPD in the US&#xD;
      alone. In the US, the direct and indirect costs associated with COPD are estimated to be&#xD;
      about $50 billion. Clinical studies have shown that by providing ventilation to reduce&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency symptoms such as dyspnea, patients may become more tolerant to&#xD;
      exercise and be able to increase their participation in activities of daily living resulting&#xD;
      in an overall positive impact in their quality of lives. The Life2000 Ventilation System,&#xD;
      with the smallest tubing and comfortable interface solutions, is the only ventilator to&#xD;
      simultaneously provide full ventilatory support and enable patients to ambulate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Life2000 Ventilation System is an FDA-cleared critical care ventilator (K141943/S003,&#xD;
      June 2015) indicated for use for adult patients who require positive pressure ventilation&#xD;
      delivered invasively or non-invasively. The device, classified by FDA as a continuous&#xD;
      ventilator, can treat both acute and chronic respiratory failure and is suitable for use in&#xD;
      home and institutional settings by qualified, trained personnel under the direction of a&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Life2000 Compressor is intended to provide a 50-psi pressure source to the ventilator and&#xD;
      is currently in the FDA premarket notification (510 k) clearance process, so its use is&#xD;
      considered investigational.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a single-center, open-label, pilot study in 10 stable COPD subjects to assess&#xD;
      the ventilatory efficacy of the Life2000 Ventilation System, as compared to a control group.&#xD;
      Other important secondary endpoints as listed in this document will also be measured and&#xD;
      reported. Prospective participants are all current participants in the ongoing CATCH program&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be randomized to either continued monitoring alone or monitoring with&#xD;
      the use of the Life2000 Ventilation System for a period of six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial BODE Index (BMI, airway Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise intolerance), CO2 (carbon&#xD;
      dioxide) measurements, and questionnaires and surveys are captured prior to therapy&#xD;
      initiation. Thereafter, subjects will be randomly assigned to the Life2000 Ventilation System&#xD;
      or their routine plan of care, as determined previously by the CATCH program, and followed&#xD;
      for a period of six months. Both end tidal CO2 readings and the Physical Activity Scale for&#xD;
      the Elderly (PASE) results will be captured at pre-assigned intervals during the study.&#xD;
      Monthly phone assessments will be conducted with the subjects to track progress. An&#xD;
      additional BODE Index measurement will be taken at Day 90, the study mid-point. At the end of&#xD;
      six months, all baseline procedures and questionnaires will be repeated and the subject will&#xD;
      be discharged from the study.&#xD;
