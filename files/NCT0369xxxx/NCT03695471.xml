    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      IB-IV mycosis fungoides. Antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides (MF) as initial systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety of pembrolizumab in this patient population. II. To evaluate response&#xD;
      rates of pembrolizumab in this patient population. III. To determine the progression free&#xD;
      survival, duration of response, time to response and overall survival of pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the histologic features of the anti-tumor response in patients with&#xD;
      advanced MF before and after treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients receiving complete response during courses 2-9 are held for the remaining&#xD;
      courses. If patients relapse while treatment is being held, the patient will then complete&#xD;
      remaining courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT). All calculated values will use the last-observation-carried forward for any participants who withdraw, are lost to follow up, or exit the study per protocol. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients will be analyzed using Mann?Whitney U for nonparametric data and the student t-test. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mSWAT scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and course 9</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics will be calculated. Proportions of patients will be calculated and described using summary statistics. Proportions of interest are patients having CR, CR90 and PR; patients having stable subcutaneous disease; patients having progressive cutaneous disease; and patients having an overall systemic response rate.&#xD;
mSWAT is calculated using body surface area (BSA) of each MF lesion (palm plus fingers of the patient â‰ˆ 1% BSA) in each of 12 areas of the body, multiplying the sum of the BSA of each lesion type by a weighting factor (patch=1, plaque=2, and tumor =3) and generating a sum of the subtotals of each lesion subtype.</description>
