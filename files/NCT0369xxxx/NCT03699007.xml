  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad aim of this study is to implement and evaluate the efficacy of Graded Exposure&#xD;
      Treatment (GET Living) to target elevated pain-related fears in children with chronic pain at&#xD;
      the Stanford Pediatric Pain Management Clinic (PPMC). The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and acceptability of this intervention for children with high levels of&#xD;
      pain-related fear and functional disability. If proven efficacious, it will allow for the&#xD;
      dissemination of this innovative treatment model to others working with children and&#xD;
      adolescents with chronic pain.&#xD;

      The treatment intervention to be tested in this clinical trial is Graded in-vivo Exposure&#xD;
      Treatment (GET Living) compared to Typical Pain Management (TPM) in adolescents with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. Participants will be randomized into GET Living or TPM, and will be&#xD;
      instructed to not seek new treatments for pain for the duration of the study. Both treatments&#xD;
      consist of 12 1-hour patient sessions delivered twice a week across 6- weeks and 3&#xD;
      parent-only sessions.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Adolescents will be randomized to either GET Living or TPM and stratified on fear (moderate/high; FOPQ-C: moderate [35-49] high [50-96]) and disability (moderate/high; moderate [13-29] severe [30-60]), to minimize the possibility of imbalance between the two treatment arms. To allow the use of small blocks while minimizing the probability of a blinded staff member predicting the next assignment we will use blocks of size two and four and randomly choose block sizes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The protocol consists of 12 interdisciplinary sessions, 1-hour each, delivered twice a week, for an average of 6 weeks. Phase I-III are conducted with the psychologist, physical therapist, adolescent, and parent (as developmentally appropriate). Patient and parent will complete daily diaries and patients will wear the Actigraph throughout the duration of treatment.</description>

    <description>The protocol consists of 12 multidisciplinary sessions, 1-hour each, delivered twice a week, for an average of 6 weeks. Sessions will alternate between psychological CBT sessions and Physical Therapy sessions. Patient and parent will complete daily diaries and patients will wear the Actigraph throughout the duration of treatment. The parent will also participate in 3 additional parent-only sessions with the psychologist to address parental coping skills.</description>
