        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx,&#xD;
             hypopharynx, or larynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The recurrent disease is not suitable for curative surgery or definitive&#xD;
             chemoradiation, and/or metastatic diseases which are not amenable to surgery and/or&#xD;
             curative radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tumor progression or recurrence within 6 months of last dose of platinum therapy in&#xD;
             the adjuvant (ie with radiation after surgery), primary (ie, with radiation),&#xD;
             recurrent, or metastatic setting. Clinical progression after platinum therapy is an&#xD;
             allowable event for entry and is defined as progression of a lesion at least 10 mm in&#xD;
             size that is amenable to caliper measurement (eg superficial skin lesion as per RECIST&#xD;
             1.1) or a lesion that has been visualized and photographically recorded with&#xD;
             measurements and shown to have progressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously&#xD;
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such&#xD;
             lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age ≥ 20 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status: ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recovered from any previous therapy related toxicity to ≤Grade 1 at study entry&#xD;
             (except for stable sensory neuropathy ≤Grade 2 and alopecia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Agree to take biopsy before and during the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine&#xD;
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception, for the course of the study through 60 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred&#xD;
             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 150 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception&#xD;
        for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.3.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma or nasal cavity malignancies other than HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concurrent malignancies other than HNSCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior exposure to anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, or other immune checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior exposure to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib, or other known EGFR TKI&#xD;
             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as positive anti-HCV) infection.&#xD;

             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.&#xD;
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks before starting study treatment or scheduled for surgery&#xD;
             during the projected course of the study.&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Topical or inhaled steroids is not considered as systemic&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the test drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;

             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Any history or presence of poorly controlled gastrointestinal disorders that could&#xD;
