  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical myelopathy (CM) is one of the most common degenerative spinal cord disorders&#xD;
      affecting older people. The progression of CM is insidious and the neurological decline can&#xD;
      vary between patients. Surgical decompression is considered the most effective way to treat&#xD;
      CM, however, it is not free from risk and the surgical outcome is not always satisfactory.&#xD;
      The expected outcome of surgical intervention for CM remains a difficulty. There is a&#xD;
      pressing need for a reliable and quantitative approach to predict surgical outcomes of CM and&#xD;
      the precise prognosis. Previous studies have suggested a number of prognostic factors, such&#xD;
      as age, duration of symptoms, pre-operative neurological status and abnormal MRI, but their&#xD;
      prognostic value remains controversial. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fMRI&#xD;
      have been proposed as a promising tool for predicting the surgical prognosis of CM. In&#xD;
      previous study, the protocol was successfully established for DTI microstructural&#xD;
      characterization and resting state fMRI of the cervical spinal cord. This study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the value of DTI and fMRI in predicting the outcome of surgical treatment. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to establish a clinical protocol for quantitative DTI and fMRI analysis that&#xD;
      could give accurate prognosis for surgical intervention to CM.&#xD;

      Cervical myelopathy (CM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the elderly.&#xD;
      Symptoms often develop insidiously and are characterized by neck stiffness, arm pain,&#xD;
      numbness in the hands, and weakness of the hands and legs. The causes of this myelopathy are&#xD;
      many, such as spinal canal narrowing, osteophytes, herniated discs and hypertrophy of the&#xD;
      ligamentum flavum. Although the clinical signs and symptoms of CM are well documented in the&#xD;
      literature, a precise localization of the maximum level of compression is sometimes difficult&#xD;
      in the elderly patients where multiple levels of the cervical spine are degenerated. Also the&#xD;
      lack of understanding of the pathophysiology and pathomechanism of CM has significantly&#xD;
      hampered the development of a rational approach to the surgical treatment of such condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis is made based on clinical signs and symptoms with the help of conventional MRI&#xD;
      imaging which demonstrates the levels of anatomical stenosis. Surgical decompression of the&#xD;
      cervical spine is the most common form of treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has&#xD;
      been used widely in the evaluation of patients with CM. The commonly applied MR techniques&#xD;
      include spin echo sequence, both conventional spin echo and fast/turbo spin echo for T1 and&#xD;
      T2 information; gradient echo sequences, which generate T2 images; STIR (short tau inversion&#xD;
      recovery) images; fat suppressed T1 images; gadolinium enhanced images applied to either&#xD;
      routine T1WIs or fat suppressed T1WIs; MR spinal angiography; and cerebrospinal fluid flow&#xD;
      (CSF) studies (either magnitude or phase contrast). However, conventional MRI mainly concerns&#xD;
      anatomical information about CM, with less pathophysiological information. BOLD-fMRI is able&#xD;
      to present the activated neuronal volume decreased in CM patients along with an increase in&#xD;
      neuronal activities. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) permits the detection of tissue-water&#xD;
      molecular diffusion at microscopic dimensions. Previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      feasibility of DTI in evaluating microstructural changes in the myelopathic cervical cord.&#xD;
      The prognostic values of spinal cord DTI in CM have been addressed in several previous&#xD;
      studies. In recent years, combination of DTI and fMRI has been proposed to be an accurate&#xD;
      prognostic tool for surgical management of CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical myelopathy (CM) is caused by degenerative stenosis of the cervical spine with&#xD;
      progressive compression on the spinal cord resulting in loss of sensory and motor functions&#xD;
      in the upper and lower limbs. Surgical decompression of the cervical spine is the most common&#xD;
      form of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to evaluate the value of DTI and fMRI in predicting the&#xD;
      outcome of surgical treatment.&#xD;
