  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocrelizumab is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that showed in phase III trials a&#xD;
      powerful effect on relapse rate and lesion load accumulation in the relapsing form of&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (RMS). This therapeutic agent also showed for the first time a significant&#xD;
      reduction of disability progression in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)&#xD;
      patients, whereas all other anti-inflammatory drugs had failed to do so in well-conducted&#xD;
      studies. This raises the possibility that ocrelizumab, beyond its effects on the adaptive&#xD;
      immune system activation underlying white matter lesions and clinical relapses, could&#xD;
      beneficially influence other mechanisms involved in the progressive phase of the disease,&#xD;
      such as the innate immune microglial cells activation, that has been described to persist in&#xD;
      a diffuse manner in the Central Nervous system (CNS). To date the activation of these cells&#xD;
      is not accessible to classical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques, impeding the full&#xD;
      investigation of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs such as ocrelizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as two 300-mg IV infusions (600 mg total)&#xD;
      in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15), followed by&#xD;
      one 600-mg IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent doses (i.e., every 24&#xD;
      weeks) for 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication with 100 mg of methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) approximately 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to each ocrelizumab infusion and additional premedication with an antihistaminic drug&#xD;
      (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 - 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizumab to&#xD;
      reduce the frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). The addition of an&#xD;
      antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/ paracetamol) may also be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo PET scan with 18F-DPA714 and MRI exams at different time points as&#xD;
      mentioned in the assessment table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease will be clinically monitored at different time points with classical tests including&#xD;
      EDSS, MSFC, BICAMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses on complete blood count, lymphocytes subsets count, neurofilament will be&#xD;
      done. Analyses will not be limited to the above mentioned list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy tests and genetics will be done. An optional lumbar puncture will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline to assess cytokinic profile predictive of disease evolution and cortical pathology.&#xD;
      Patients who refuse to have a lumbar puncture can be included in the clinical trial if they&#xD;
      have eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TSPO polymorphism will be checked at baseline with other screening lab tests.&#xD;
