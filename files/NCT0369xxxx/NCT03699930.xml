  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of stroke survivors suffer from aphasia, making recovery of language abilities a&#xD;
      top priority in stroke rehabilitation. Conventional speech and language therapy may have&#xD;
      limited effectiveness. Leveraging multimodal data (behavioral, neuroimaging, and genetics),&#xD;
      this study aims to 1) evaluate the efficacy of combining tDCS with speech therapy, 2) examine&#xD;
      neural changes associated with recovery, 3) identify factors influencing response to&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one million people in the United States are living with aphasia, an acquired&#xD;
      neurological disorder affecting the ability to use and/or understand language. This&#xD;
      communication impairment affects up to 40% of stroke patients. Stroke victims usually&#xD;
      prioritize speaking, writing, and walking as the three most important rehabilitation goals,&#xD;
      two of these goals therefore involving communication. Conventional speech therapy strategies&#xD;
      have nevertheless limited effectiveness in post-stroke aphasia. Indeed, approximately half of&#xD;
      those affected will remain in this state despite intensive speech therapy. Effective novel&#xD;
      treatment is therefore warranted to improve recovery in these patients. Recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive, low-cost&#xD;
      neuromodulation technique, applied in conjunction with speech therapy may be more effective&#xD;
      in promoting language recovery than behavioral intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind quasi-randomized controlled study will be carried out in chronic post-stroke&#xD;
      aphasics. Participants will be assigned to either the tDCS group or to the sham (placebo)&#xD;
      group and will receive 20 minutes of concurrent speech and language therapy by a trained&#xD;
      speech therapist over five consecutive days. Behavioral, EEG, and MRI data will be acquired&#xD;
      within one week before and after intervention. Genetic samples will be collected once.&#xD;
      Secondary behavioral outcome measures will be performed again 3 months following tDCS/sham&#xD;
      intervention to assess long-term benefits.&#xD;
