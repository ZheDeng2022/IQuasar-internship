      This is a randomized controlled human exposure crossover study. Investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate the acute health effects of ozone exposure in healthy young adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled human exposure crossover study among&#xD;
      32 healthy young adults in Shanghai, China. Each subject will be exposed twice: once to clean&#xD;
      air and once to 200 ppb ozone in a chamber for 2 hours. During the 2-hour exposure, each&#xD;
      subject will be requested to alternate 20 minutes of rest and 10 minutes of exercise on a&#xD;
      treadmill. The exercise workload will be adjusted to achieve the targeted ventilation of 25 ~&#xD;
      27 L/min(approximately equal to 15 ~ 18L/min/m2 body surface area). Ozone will be generated&#xD;
      by a silent electric discharge method (HTU-500, AZCO Industries Ltd., Canada) and introduced&#xD;
      into the chamber. The temperature and relative humidity in the chamber will be maintained at&#xD;
      22±1℃ and 55%±5%, respectively. Health examinations will be conducted immediately prior to&#xD;
      exposure, immediately after exposure, 2 hours after exposure and again the next morning.&#xD;
      Health examinations include symptom questionnaire, skin tests, spirometry, and Holter&#xD;
      monitoring. We plan to collect blood, buccal, urine, nasal secretion, saliva, exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate, sebum, and D-squame samples.&#xD;
