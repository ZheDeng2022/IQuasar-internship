  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the effect of exclusive peer-to-peer virtual support on&#xD;
      pregnant women's well-being including physical symptoms, depression, social support, maternal&#xD;
      attachment, and pregnancy adaptation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pregnancy period is marked by not only the joy and excitement of bonding with her baby&#xD;
      but also dramatic changes in her body. The Internet's convenience and anonymity provide great&#xD;
      possibilities for pregnant women to create a social network for sharing personal stories,&#xD;
      seeking information and asking questions, and expressing own emotions and concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although health-related online communities are emerging rapidly around the globe, little is&#xD;
      known about the impact of a virtual peer community on pregnant women's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolled 138 pregnant women, who were assigned to either the experimental or&#xD;
      control groups. After obtaining informed consent from participants, we asked them to fill out&#xD;
      the baseline questionnaires (Time 1). The first and second follow-ups (Times 2 and 3) were&#xD;
      conducted at 22-24 and 36-38 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group received ordinary prenatal care in addition to virtual community&#xD;
      participation, and those in the control group received only ordinary prenatal care.&#xD;

    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of pregnancy adaptation. Items are scored from 0 to 3 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicate better pregnancy adaptation.</description>

    <measure>The Edinburgh Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of depression. Items are scored from 0 to 3 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 0 to 30. The cut-off point for depression is a total score of 12 or above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Symptoms Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of pregnancy-related physical symptoms. Items are scored from 1 to 4 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 22 to 88. Higher scores indicate experiencing more symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Social Support Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of social support perception. Items are scored from 1 to 5 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 20 to 100. higher scores indicate perceived higher social support from family, peer pregnant women, friends, and healthcare providers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Maternal-Fetal Attachment Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>repeated measured at second trimester (22-24 weeks of pregnancy), and the third trimester (36-38 weeks of pregnancy).</time_frame>
    <description>Used to investigate the changes in the scores of maternal-fetal attachment. Items are scored from 1 to 5 and they are summed to compute a total score ranging from 39 to 195. Higher scores indicate higher maternal-fetal attachment.</description>
