      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Performing procedures for investigation and treatment of gynaecological conditions&#xD;
      in the office setting is becoming commonplace. Outpatient gynaecological procedures can&#xD;
      reduce risks of general anaesthetic, decrease health care costs and make the procedure more&#xD;
      convenient for the patient and provider. However, ensuring adequate pain relief and allaying&#xD;
      anxiety during the procedure can prove to be challenging. Appropriate patient selection,&#xD;
      counselling and adequate pain management during the procedure can improve patient experience&#xD;
      and reduce the number of failed procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common office gynaecological procedures include outpatient hysteroscopy, colposcopy and large&#xD;
      loop excision of transformation zone, manual vacuum aspiration for treatment of miscarriages,&#xD;
      intrauterine contraceptive device insertion, hysteroscopic sterilisation and endometrial&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in gynaecological procedures can originate from the cervix and uterus. The uterine&#xD;
      fundus is innervated by sympathetic fibres from T10 to L2, which enter through the&#xD;
      uterosacral ligaments via the inferior hypogastric plexus, and by nerves from the ovarian&#xD;
      plexuses at the cornua. Parasympathetic fibres from S2 to S4 travel through the broad&#xD;
      ligament to enter the cervix at the 3 0 clock and 9 o clock positions to provide innervation&#xD;
      to the upper vagina, cervix and the lower uterine segment. The pudendal nerve (S 2,3, 4)&#xD;
      supplies the lower vagina and vulva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical, psychological and social factors influence the intensity of pain experienced.&#xD;
      Counselling the patients pre procedurally helps to better manage expectations and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient hysteroscopy is usually performed for patients having abnormal uterine bleeding&#xD;
      and subfertility. Pain levels during this procedure can be influenced by the diameter of the&#xD;
      hysteroscope. Mini hysteroscopes with an outer diameter of 3.5 mm have been associated with&#xD;
      lower pain scores. Additional procedures performed (like polypectomy or Coil insertions)&#xD;
      could increase the duration of the procedure and the pain experienced during the procedure.&#xD;
      Pain scores in the vaginoscopic approach have been noted to be 3.8 when compared to 5.3 in&#xD;
      the traditional group, which uses a speculum and tenaculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in hysteroscopy is significantly related to the presence of cervical synechiae, to the&#xD;
      duration of the procedure, and to the use of normal saline; conversely, parity seems to have&#xD;
      a protective role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous vaginal deliveries, experience of the operator and quicker operative time are known&#xD;
      to be associated with successful outcomes of the outpatient procedures. However, nulliparity,&#xD;
      postmenopausal status, anxiety and anticipated pain and a history of dsymenorrhoea are known&#xD;
      to be associated with higher perception of pain and reduced success rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of pain relief offered can include various levels of sedation, local anaesthetic,&#xD;
      analgesics and verbal support techniques through distraction by conversation, gentle&#xD;
      language, music, guided imagery and positive suggestion. A Cochrane Review showed no&#xD;
      consistent good quality evidence of a significant difference in safety or effectiveness&#xD;
      between different types of pain relief compared with each other or with placebo/ no&#xD;
      treatment. There is no consensus on the choice of analgesia for outpatient hysteroscopy and&#xD;
      rescue analgesia in the form of intracervical blocks is often used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United Kingdom, most units offer analgesics either as Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory&#xD;
      Drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen or oral opiods. NSAIDS such as ibuprofen decrease uterine&#xD;
      activity and pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and thereby reduce circulating prostaglandins.&#xD;
      They reduce pain levels especially postoperatively. Acetaminophen also inhibits the enzyme&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase, but its action is in the central nervous system rather in the periphery.&#xD;
      Hence is inferior to NSAIDS but is offered to women who cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Oral opiods&#xD;
      act by interacting with endogenous opioid mu receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only pharmacological method that has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing pain&#xD;
      during and 30 minutes after hysteroscopy in several meta-analysis and reviews is paracervical&#xD;
      block. However, it fails to anaesthetise the uterus for intrauterine procedures and a&#xD;
      previous Cochrane review was unable to confirm this. The administration of the local&#xD;
      anaesthetic itself may be uncomfortable, have side effects due to toxicity, may cancel the&#xD;
      beneficial effect of performing a vaginoscopic hysteroscopy and does not anaesthetise the&#xD;
      uterus. Addition of soda bicarbonate as a buffering agent to the local anaesthetic and using&#xD;
      dental syringes with a 27-gauge needle has been seen to decrease the pain during the&#xD;
      injection. Topical local anaesthetics on the cervix in the form of gel or sprays have not&#xD;
      been shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy experience significant levels of preoperative&#xD;
      anxiety which is higher than patients attending the gynaecology clinic and comparable to&#xD;
      those experienced before major surgery under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiolytics help reduce anxiety, however they do not have a direct analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Units often employ a trained person to engage with the patient to provide emotional support&#xD;
      during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distraction Techniques Type of distraction techniques range from active distraction&#xD;
      techniques to passive techniques. Active distraction included interactive toys, virtual&#xD;
      reality, guided imagery and relaxation and controlled breathing. Passive distraction&#xD;
      techniques included auditory distraction in the form of music and audio-visual distraction&#xD;
      through watching television. Intraoperative pain and anxiety rating have been noted to be&#xD;
      lower by use of simple intraoperative distraction techniques e.g. interacting with nurses,&#xD;
      watching Digital Video Discs or using stress balls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been limited research done on the role of distraction techniques in pain management&#xD;
      in outpatient gynaecological procedures. Music has been used as a complementary method to&#xD;
      control anxiety and reduce perception of pain by relaxing the patient and causing less&#xD;
      discomfort during outpatient hysteroscopy. . However, a RCT showed no positive effect of&#xD;
      music on patients' level of pain, anxiety or satisfaction of patient or doctor for office&#xD;
      hysteroscopy and colposcopy. Watching the procedure on the screen at office hysteroscopy has&#xD;
      not been shown to reduce pain scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with high level of preprocedural state- trait anxiety are more likely to perceive&#xD;
      higher levels of pain and discomfort during colposcopy. Simple passive visual distraction&#xD;
      during colposcopic examination was associated with a reduction in pain scores, however&#xD;
      anxiety levels were unchanged. A Cochrane review in 2007 concluded that anxiety appears to be&#xD;
      reduced by playing music during colposcopy. Although information leaflets did not reduce&#xD;
      anxiety levels, they did increase knowledge levels and helped with consenting for the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality is a relatively new intervention, which has been studied as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological method for pain relief. VR as a form of managing pain has been studied in&#xD;
      paediatrics, dentistry, burns treatment, treatment of chronic pain. It has not been studied&#xD;
      in the management of pain of gynaecological procedures, which are increasingly being&#xD;
      performed as office procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It acts as a method of distraction for pain relief by changing the activity of the body's&#xD;
      pain modulation system. This multisensory technology gives an immersive and engaging&#xD;
      experience and serves as a distraction technique. Head tracking systems, visually stimulating&#xD;
      scenery and audio and tactile feedback enable integration of many sensory experiences.&#xD;
      Different psychological factors influence the effectiveness of the analgesic effect of VR.&#xD;
      While sense of presence influence the effectiveness of VR as a distraction tool, anxiety as&#xD;
      well as positive emotions directly affects the experience of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR distraction has been associated with significant increases in pain threshold and pain&#xD;
      tolerance and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain, and&#xD;
      self-reported anxiety, relative to baseline. Repeated exposure did not appear to affect the&#xD;
      benefits of VR. Simultaneous exposure to VR and supplementary sound increases pain tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management in ambulatory procedures should be multimodal and should include both&#xD;
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Giving the patient a range of options&#xD;
      will increase the number of successful procedures in the outpatient setting and improve&#xD;
      patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the role of distraction techniques for management of acute pain in ambulatory&#xD;
      gynaecology procedures and to assess feasibility of using Virtual Reality for managing pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to recruit 40 patients and randomise them via computer generated random&#xD;
      number allocation to either the VR intervention group or those having treatment as per&#xD;
      routine protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients will fill a pre and post procedural questionnaire. Pain and anxiety&#xD;
      scores prior to the procedure and after the procedure will be compared against a control&#xD;
      group of 20 patients for pain management by standard protocol. Scores will be measured by a&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) which is a validated measure of pain which is easy to use, has&#xD;
      high compliance rates and is detects meaningful changes in pain. The NRS is an 11-point scale&#xD;
      consisting of integers from 0 through 10; 0 representing ''No pain'' and 10 representing&#xD;
      ''worst imaginable pain.'' Respondents select the single number that best represents their&#xD;
      pain intensity. Ratings of pre-operative anxiety were measured by an 11-point numeric rating&#xD;
      scale: 'How would you rate any anxiety you may currently be feeling' 0 (no anxiety) and 10&#xD;
      (worst anxiety imaginable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR intervention will involve watching a standard content of the video on a mobile device&#xD;
      using a VR headset to distract them during the procedure. The duration of the video will be&#xD;
      15 minutes; but the video will only be played for the duration of the outpatient&#xD;
      hysteroscopy. Patients are allowed to stop viewing the video if they so desire and this will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured interview will be conducted with the patients who have received the VR&#xD;
      intervention, each lasting approximately 20 minutes. The semi structured interviews will&#xD;
      allow for all participants to be asked similar question within a flexible framework. The&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted within 30 minutes of the procedure, in a suitable location and&#xD;
      will be recorded on a digital voice recorder. The questions will be focused on the women's&#xD;
      experiences of the procedure, in specific pain perception and questions around the VR&#xD;
      intervention as well as any other aspect of their hospital care they felt to be relevant. If&#xD;
      further clarification or exploration of any particular aspect of their care was required, the&#xD;
      interview will readdress these topics before the end of the interview. Interviews will&#xD;
      continue until no new information was being obtained, indicating that the theoretical&#xD;
      saturation point had been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician and nursing staff's perception regarding feasibility of using the VR equipment was&#xD;
      also assessed through a questionnaire. The clinician questionnaire will also assess the ease&#xD;
      of the procedure and perceived pain scores for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow up will not be routinely arranged for the purpose of the study. Routine follow&#xD;
      up as per clinical requirements will be arranged as routine for the procedure performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end once the proposed numbers of patients have been recruited and data&#xD;
      analysis completed. Participants will be debriefed after their participation in the study and&#xD;
      will be directed to suitable support agencies if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of women and interviewing proceeded alongside data coding and preliminary&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and initially coded by reading and re reading the&#xD;
      transcript and making notes, drawing on the observations made during the interviews and&#xD;
      transcription. Transcripts will be coded line-by-line, describing, summarising and attending&#xD;
      to linguistic elements such as pronoun and metaphor use. The transcripts will be entered into&#xD;
      a qualitative software package (N6) and a thematic analysis undertaken from the emergent&#xD;
      themes developed from these codes and cluster with related themes. Initial coding is Initial&#xD;
      phase will involve open coding. Axial coding and selective coding with use of constant&#xD;
      comparison will enable a cyclical and iterative process on the principles of grounded theory.&#xD;
      Analytic frame for the analysis will be linked to the primary and secondary aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistically analysis with include statistical comparison of pre and post anxiety and&#xD;
      pain scores as a function of membership of VR or control groups. Analysis of covariance&#xD;
      (ANCOVA) will be used to determine whether the VR intervention led to a significantly&#xD;
      difference between baseline and follow up pain and anxiety scores between VR and control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff questionnaires will be analysed to correlate pain scores of actual vs. perceived and&#xD;
      feasibility of carrying out the intervention will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data would include age, parity, menopausal status and ethnicity. Data and all&#xD;
      appropriate documentation will be stored for a minimum of 10 years after the completion of&#xD;
      the study, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
