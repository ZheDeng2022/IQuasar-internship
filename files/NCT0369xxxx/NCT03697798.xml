    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of aP booster vaccination in children, young&#xD;
      adults and elderly on the (long-term) immune response to B. pertussis in three European&#xD;
      countries with a different epidemiological background and primary vaccination schedule for&#xD;
      pertussis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in three European countries (UK, Finland and the Netherlands)&#xD;
      with a different epidemiological background for pertussis incidence and different age groups&#xD;
      will have had different primary schedules with whole cell pertussis (wP) or aP vaccines in&#xD;
      their first year of life. Long-term memory responses will be analysed following aP booster&#xD;
      vaccination including a detailed assessment of antigen-specific B and T cell responses,&#xD;
      serology assays for pertussis antigens and the effect of booster vaccination on dynamic&#xD;
      changes in immune cell subsets and gene transcription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four cohorts of healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A - children aged between 7-10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B - children aged between 11-15 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C - adults aged between 20 to 34 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D - adults aged between 60-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive one injection of reduced diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid and&#xD;
      reduced acellular pertussis vaccine (dTap)-IPV, (Boostrix® IPV, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK))&#xD;
      combination vaccine intramuscularly in the upper arm. Children (cohorts A and B) will be&#xD;
      asked to donate blood four times at different time points, and young and older adults&#xD;
      (cohorts C and D) will be asked to donate blood at set time points five times in total over&#xD;
      the 12 months duration of the study. The time points will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 0 - day of vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 1 - 1 day after T0 +/- 4 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 2 - 7 days after T0 +/- 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 3 - 14 days after T0 +/- 4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 4 - 28 days after T0 +/- 4 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timepoint 5 - 1 year after T0 +/- 4 weeks&#xD;
