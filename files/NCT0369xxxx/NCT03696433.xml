      This study aims to assess the salt sensitive blood pressure response to dietary salt load&#xD;
      compared with radiological markers of salt handling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major cause of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Hypertension, or&#xD;
      high blood pressure, affects people differently and is related to the body's ability to&#xD;
      maintain healthy circulation of salt. Some individuals may be affected by salt sensitive&#xD;
      blood pressure (SSBP), when their blood pressure changes in response to dietary salt load.&#xD;
      SSBP is a prevalent, independent risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease that&#xD;
      preferentially affects black individuals. Current methods to assess SSBP require dietary salt&#xD;
      loading over the course of days to weeks, and measurement of blood pressure following high&#xD;
      salt diet and low salt diet. Such lengthy protocols are not feasible in a clinical setting to&#xD;
      evaluate this risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and more importantly, these procedures&#xD;
      provide incomplete information about mechanisms of salt sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our knowledge regarding salt handling in the body is limited. While renal dysfunction is&#xD;
      partly responsible for SSBP, recent research points to the role of lymphatic vascular&#xD;
      clearance in regulating tissue salt storage and blood pressure control. To better understand&#xD;
      these mechanisms in vivo, we have recently developed a noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR)&#xD;
      lymphangiography method sensitive to lymphatic vasculature, and applied standardized MR&#xD;
      protocols for measuring tissue sodium and fat storage in adults with impaired lymphatic&#xD;
      clearance. We found evidence of lymph stasis and tissue salt deposition that correlated with&#xD;
      local subcutaneous fat volume. Here, we will test whether similar lymphatic pathways are&#xD;
      impaired in persons with SSBP, leading to tissue salt and fat storage, in comparison to the&#xD;
      involvement of renal dysfunction in SSBP tissue profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to improve our understanding of vascular mechanisms of human salt&#xD;
      storage, and to provide standardized radiologic biomarkers sensitive to the SSBP phenotype.&#xD;
      This study will test the primary hypothesis that the SSBP response is correlated with&#xD;
      baseline tissue sodium storage, and elevated in persons with salt sensitivity. Secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses will address whether the SSBP response is related to fat storage, lymphatic&#xD;
      vascular function, renal vascular function, and impaired target organ responses to salt&#xD;
      loading, including decreased urinary sodium excretion, and less suppression of plasma renin&#xD;
      and serum aldosterone.&#xD;

    <description>10 subjects will be enrolled and each will undergo study procedures at 4 separate visits. Subjects will be randomly assigned to this study arm, differing in the order of low and high salt diets. After a baseline visit to include a noninvasive MRI scan, the subject will begin this study diet: low-salt diet, then washout consisting of the subject's typical diet, then high-salt diet. Each dietary or washout period lasts for 7 days, and study visits will occur after each period.</description>
