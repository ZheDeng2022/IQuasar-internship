  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Remediation (CR) involving restorative and strategy-based methods has been&#xD;
      previously validated in a pilot study for late life schizophrenia (LLS), where CR&#xD;
      demonstrated a moderate effect on overall cognition. This study proposes to study the&#xD;
      efficacy of CR in a larger cohort of participants with LLS and to assess the interaction of&#xD;
      medication management with CR on cognitive outcomes. Eligible participants will receive CR&#xD;
      during 12 weeks. CR consists of a series of computerized exercises targeting various&#xD;
      cognitive functions, such as memory, attention and processing speed. It will be administered&#xD;
      during facilitated group sessions consisting of 4-6 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 40 participants with the aim to enroll 30 LLS participants age 55 or&#xD;
      older who will undergo the CR intervention for two, 2-hour weekly classes over 12 weeks (24&#xD;
      classes in total). There will be baseline assessments (clinical and NP) prior to enrollment&#xD;
      in the classes. In order to assess whether there has been a change in cognition, and some of&#xD;
      the assessments will be repeated after the 12-week intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty late life schizophrenia (LLS) participants, age 55 and over, will undergo the CR&#xD;
      intervention after completion of the baseline assessments. CR is a group-based psychotherapy&#xD;
      that will consist of two, 2-hour weekly therapist-guided classes over 12 weeks, with a&#xD;
      half-hour lunch break. The 24 classes are divided into two iterations of 12 exercises each,&#xD;
      repeated twice. CR consists of four techniques: (1) didactic teaching on the relevance of&#xD;
      cognition for everyday functioning and the association between cognitive strategies and&#xD;
      enhanced functioning (2) computerized drills targeting different cognitive domains, (3)&#xD;
      in-class strategic monitoring to enhance metacognitive skills, and (4) discussion of the&#xD;
      generalization of cognitive skills to daily life. The Brain Gym includes electronic tablets&#xD;
      for participant use both during classroom sessions in addition to elective, drop-in practice&#xD;
      sessions offered three times per week. Each group will consist of 4-6 participants. A group&#xD;
      will be started once four to six consecutively referred participants complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments. Each class is self-contained and the first class is always introductory to CR in&#xD;
      order to enhance the comfort level with the computer equipment and program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the 24 classes will have one, 5-10 minute block of didactic teaching, two 45-minute&#xD;
      blocks of drill-and-practice of the online exercises, and a 20-minute lunch break. Exercises&#xD;
      are delivered via Scientific Brain Training (SBT) Pro (2009). Computer exercises are designed&#xD;
      to be enjoyable and reinforcing, with the difficulty level gradually increasing over time.&#xD;
      The therapists optimize competency and motivation by individualizing the exercises for each&#xD;
      participant. The difficulty level parameters are manually titrated according to exercise&#xD;
      adherence and difficulty level progression, targeting 80 percent accuracy in order to&#xD;
      optimize competency and motivation. In order to optimize learning and retention outside of&#xD;
      weekly classes, participants are encouraged to return to the computer lab for ongoing&#xD;
      practice of the online exercises, targeting 40 minutes of homework exercises per weekday for&#xD;
      a total target of 200 minutes per week. Online logs allow for monitoring the time spent&#xD;
      completing the computer exercises. The therapists review the online logs on a weekly basis&#xD;
      with the participants at the end of the didactic class and before planning the homework for&#xD;
      the following week. Participants' successful completion of a given exercise to the highest&#xD;
      difficulty level is charted in the Brain Gym using their anonymized computer log-in name to&#xD;
      serve as positive reinforcement and recognition of their achievement while maintaining&#xD;
      privacy.&#xD;

    <description>CR is a form of group therapy that uses a hybrid approach of restorative and strategy based methods to improve areas of cognition (ie. attention, memory, processing speed and learning) through the use of computerized exercises. CR is administered in groups consisting of 2-8 participants and one or two therapists. The CR groups meet twice per week for two hours per session over twelve weeks, for a total of 24 sessions.</description>
