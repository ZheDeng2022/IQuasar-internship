  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research project for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer in which biological&#xD;
      material and health-related personal data are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate if an additional method (liquid biopsies) can predict the response&#xD;
      after chemo-radiotherapy and before surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (T3 -T4 and / or N+) is neoadjuvant&#xD;
      (pre-operative) chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) followed by radical surgery. In patients after&#xD;
      complete response following nCRT, surgery may not add any survival benefit but it is still&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since clinical complete response has only partial concordance with pathological complete&#xD;
      response, an additional method that helps identify those patients with a true complete&#xD;
      response is needed to avoid unnecessary surgery and its associated potential complications..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis underlying this study is that the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) of liquid biopsy, based on the amount of ctDNA or on the&#xD;
      detection of specific gene alterations respectively, may be directly correlated to the&#xD;
      clinical, histopathological and radiological response of the tumor to nCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not interfere with the patient's routine treatment pathway and there will be&#xD;
      no deviation from the standard of care. The only additional study intervention will be the&#xD;
      collection of blood samples at 6 different time points which can be combined with the regular&#xD;
      blood examination performed during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of diagnosis, tumor staging and histopathology on tumor biopsy will be performed.&#xD;
      Patients will receive standardized neoadjuvant therapy and will be operated after an&#xD;
      observational period of 10 weeks. Peripheral blood sample will be collected at 6 time points:&#xD;
      pre-nCRT, at the end of the nCRT, at 4th and 7th week post-CRT, on the day of the surgery&#xD;
      (before surgical resection), on the post-operative day 5 (in hospital). Mesenteric blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected intra-operatively on the day of the surgery. Tumor sampling will be&#xD;
      performed during tumor staging, as standard of care, and on the resection specimen. A&#xD;
      combined qualitative and quantitative approach for the molecular characterization of tissue&#xD;
      and liquid biopsy using next-generation sequencing will be carried out.&#xD;
