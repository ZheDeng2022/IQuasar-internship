    <textblock>
      External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is performed very often in neurosurgical&#xD;
      practices. EVD's are most commonly placed at the bedside using external anatomical landmarks&#xD;
      to guide the catheter into the frontal horn of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. EVDs are&#xD;
      often placed due to acute neurological compromise and require timely insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate catheter placement is essential to achieving effective external CSF drainage without&#xD;
      complications or occlusion/failure of the catheter. Catheter placement is most commonly&#xD;
      performed via a freehand approach using external anatomical landmarks to help identify the&#xD;
      location of the lateral ventricle within the brain without the aid of imaging. Proper&#xD;
      identification of the ventricles on pre-procedure imaging, surgeon skill, and estimation of&#xD;
      pathologic perturbations to the normal location of the ventricles all factor into the success&#xD;
      of catheter placement. Multiple passes are often required. The accuracy rate from the&#xD;
      freehand technique has been reported to range from 40 to 98 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for EVD placement do not compensate for superficial brain vessels or&#xD;
      pathology that may alter the intracranial anatomy such as trauma, hemorrhage, or mass&#xD;
      lesions. Some studies have attempted to use CTA imaging to identify intracranial vessels in&#xD;
      an attempt to avoid them during placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image guidance is a tool used very commonly for placement of EVD's and shunts in the&#xD;
      operating room. AxiEM Stealth is a noninvasive image localization modality that registers a&#xD;
      CT or MRI to the individual patients facial and scalp anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the current standard of care of freehand placement of bedside&#xD;
      external ventricular catheters to the placement of EVD catheters with AxiEM Stealth image&#xD;

    <textblock>
      External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is performed very often in neurosurgical&#xD;
      practices. EVD's are used most commonly to monitor intracranial pressure and divert&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with increased intracranial pressures. Pathologies&#xD;
      where EVDs are most frequently needed include hydrocephalus, malignancy, and/or trauma. EVD's&#xD;
      are most commonly placed at the bedside using external anatomical landmarks to guide the&#xD;
      catheter into the frontal horn of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. EVDs are often placed&#xD;
      due to acute neurological compromise and require timely insertion. This can increase the&#xD;
      associated risk and result in complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate catheter placement is essential to achieving effective external CSF drainage without&#xD;
      complications or occlusion/failure of the catheter. Catheter placement is most commonly&#xD;
      performed via a freehand approach using external anatomical landmarks to help identify the&#xD;
      location of the lateral ventricle within the brain without the aid of imaging. Proper&#xD;
      identification of the ventricles on pre-procedure imaging, surgeon skill, and estimation of&#xD;
      pathologic perturbations to the normal location of the ventricles all factor into the success&#xD;
      of catheter placement. Multiple passes are often required. The accuracy rate from the&#xD;
      freehand technique has been reported to range from 40 to 98 percent. A very basic grading&#xD;
      scale has been developed to assess placement but does not include items such as the number of&#xD;
      passes until successful placement and presence of post placement hemorrhage or other&#xD;
      neurological complications. An increased number of passes increases the risk of post&#xD;
      placement hemorrhage and may damage the brain. Hemorrhage has been reported to occur after&#xD;
      catheter placement at rates ranging from 0.2 to 41 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for EVD placement do not compensate for superficial brain vessels or&#xD;
      pathology that may alter the intracranial anatomy such as trauma, hemorrhage, or mass&#xD;
      lesions. Some studies have attempted to use CTA imaging to identify intracranial vessels in&#xD;
      an attempt to avoid them during placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image guidance is a tool used very commonly for placement of EVD's and shunts in the&#xD;
      operating room. AxiEM Stealth is a noninvasive image localization modality that registers a&#xD;
      CT or MRI to the individual patients facial and scalp anatomy. A probe can then be used to&#xD;
      identify, in real-time, the underlying anatomy and trajectories. This imaging guidance may&#xD;
      improve the accuracy of EVD placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the current standard of care of freehand placement of bedside&#xD;
      external ventricular catheters to the placement of EVD catheters with AxiEM Stealth image&#xD;
      guidance. Accuracy of the tip of the catheter, occurrence of post-placement hemorrhage, the&#xD;
      number of passes required for CSF flow, ventricle diameter, catheter clogging/failure, time&#xD;
      required for placement, patient demographics and other secondary outcome measures such as&#xD;
      Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Modified Rankin Score (MRS) will be collected. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that image guided EVD catheter placement will improve accuracy, decrease the number of&#xD;
      brain transgressions, and decrease complications of EVD placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What makes up an external ventricular drain and how does it work? An external ventricular&#xD;
      drain (EVD) is comprised of a catheter, drainage tubing, and a collection system. Once the&#xD;
      catheter is in the ventricular system, it works by measuring the intracranial pressure via a&#xD;
      transducer and drains excess CSF from the ventricular system to ensure pressures does not&#xD;
      exceed a set threshold. Normal intracranial pressures range from about 5-20 mmHg and are&#xD;
      usually around 10mmHg. The EVD system can be set at a certain level and when the intracranial&#xD;
      pressures rise above that level, CSF drains out the catheter into the collecting system. The&#xD;
      EVD system can be raised or lowered to create different intracranial pressure thresholds and&#xD;
      keep intracranial pressures controlled in patients that have a pathology, such as cerebral&#xD;
      swelling or ventricular obstruction, leading to increased pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the current technique used to place an EVD? A sterile field is prepared about 10-12&#xD;
      centimeters posterior to the eye (either right or left as clinically indicated) and about 2-3&#xD;
      cm lateral to the midline of the skull. This point should be about 1 cm anterior to the&#xD;
      coronal suture. An incision is made at this point and a burr hole is created using a hand&#xD;
      drill. The EVD catheter is prepared using a stylet to help with movement through the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma. The catheter is advanced in a trajectory perpendicular to the skull, which&#xD;
      results in a direction that is towards the ipsilateral medial canthus and ipsilateral tragus&#xD;
      which are other landmarks that can be used. The catheter is advanced to 5-6 cm and the stylet&#xD;
      is removed to assess for CSF flow. If CSF flow is not appreciated, then the catheter is&#xD;
      passed softly for about 1 more centimeter. If CSF flow is still not appreciated, the catheter&#xD;
      is removed and the stylet replaced for another attempt. If unsuccessful after 3 attempts, the&#xD;
      catheter can be left in place and a head CT can be done to assess the adjustments that need&#xD;
      to be made. This can often take up to 10 passes or more if there is significant brain shift&#xD;
      due to mass effect or aberrant anatomy. Once CSF flow is obtained, the catheter is tunneled&#xD;
      posteriorly and anchored to the skin with a stitch. The incision is then closed and the&#xD;
      catheter is connected to the drainage tubing of the collection system. The presence of CSF&#xD;
      drainage is checked at multiple points during closure to ensure that the catheter remains in&#xD;
      good position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does Axiem Stealth work as an image guidance system and how is it used for EVD placement?&#xD;
      The first step for using the image guidance system is to upload the most recent (since&#xD;
      admission or within 6 hours from bleeding) head CT or MRI into the Stealth station that has&#xD;
      been obtained since admission. The Axiem Stealth imaging guidance system uses a probe (AxiEM&#xD;
      Registration Probe) and a side mount emitter (AxiEM Side Mount Emitter) to register the&#xD;
      patient's head in relation to the probe. A trajectory (entry point and target) is then&#xD;
      planned. This registration process takes an estimated 5-15 minutes to perform. A separate&#xD;
      stylet (StealthStation EM Stylet) is designed specifically for the catheter and slides down&#xD;
      the center of the catheter. A burr-hole is created at the predefined precise location and the&#xD;
      catheter is passed to the target under electromagnetic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novelty of this study is to investigate whether using image guidance technology can&#xD;
      improve EVD catheter placement. Image guidance is used very commonly for EVD and shunt&#xD;
      placement in the operating room with excellent accuracy and precision. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      using this same workflow at the bedside will improve accuracy; decrease the number of passes&#xD;
      needed for a successful placement, decrease the number of post-placement hemorrhagic events,&#xD;
      and help improve the effectiveness of the catheter as well as patient outcomes.&#xD;
