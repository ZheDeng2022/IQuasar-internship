  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 100 HIV-positive people with&#xD;
      injection drug use, which aims to test the feasibility of the SCRIPT intervention and&#xD;
      evaluate its effectiveness on the reduction of internalized stigma, as well as entry into&#xD;
      substance use treatment or initiation of antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs often experience multiple layers of stigma when they are living with&#xD;
      HIV. Stigma is defined as the social exclusion and dehumanization of individuals in an&#xD;
      undesirable social category. Interventions to help affected people who inject drugs living&#xD;
      with HIV cope with the dual stigma related to HIV and substance use have not been studied&#xD;
      specifically in this population. Among people living with HIV, stigma adversely impacts all&#xD;
      aspects of the care cascade: timely HIV testing, diagnosis, treatment, adherence and&#xD;
      retention in care. Among people who inject drugs, drug use may add to adverse social factors&#xD;
      and create particular stigma vulnerability. Russia is a country where people who inject drugs&#xD;
      and other HIV key populations are highly stigmatized and face discrimination. Further&#xD;
      qualitative findings suggest that in the absence of public anti-stigma campaigns in Russia,&#xD;
      stigma reduction interventions should address internalized stigma and their determinants to&#xD;
      help affected people cope with the dual stigma. Stigma interventions should be adapted to&#xD;
      address not only affected people's shame and guilt, but also their felt hopelessness. These&#xD;
      emotions and related feelings such as avoidance and fear of being rejected may negatively&#xD;
      affect people's agency and mental health. We are proposing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) as a potential behavioral intervention to target the emotions underlying internalized&#xD;
      stigma and thus empower affected people. ACT has been shown to increase engagement in&#xD;
      addiction care. Its use and efficacy to reduce stigma has not yet been explored among&#xD;
      HIV-positive people who inject drugs. The objective of this study, &quot;Stigma, Risk Behaviors&#xD;
      and Health Care among HIV-positive Russian People Who Inject Drugs (SCRIPT),&quot;is to implement&#xD;
      and evaluate, the feasibility of ACT as an intervention to reduce dual HIV and substance use&#xD;
      stigma via a two-armed randomized controlled trial among 100 HIV-positive people who inject&#xD;
      drugs. The central hypothesis is that SCRIPT is feasible and can be delivered to decrease HIV&#xD;
      and substance use stigma scores.&#xD;
