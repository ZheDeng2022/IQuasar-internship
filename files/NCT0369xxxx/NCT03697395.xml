    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft rejection of the transplanted lung (CLAD) is a major health issue in&#xD;
      patients after lung transplant. This study is a registry-forming study with concurrent tissue&#xD;
      banking from surveillance bronchoscopy in addition to extra tissue sampling of blood and&#xD;
      urine. Patients will be characterized by usual clinical phenotyping and the latest imaging&#xD;
      methods so that diseased condition underlying CLAD can be better understood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic allograft rejection of the transplanted lung (CLAD) is a major health issue that lead&#xD;
      to almost 50% mortality within 5 years from the time of lung transplant. In the past CLAD was&#xD;
      exclusively occurring in small airways causing a condition called &quot;Bronchiolitis Obliteran&#xD;
      Syndrome&quot; (BOS). However, recently many have observed restrictive changes in lung physiology&#xD;
      with or without parenchymal abnormalities. This new CLAD is called RAS or RCLAD. What is also&#xD;
      concerning is that RAS is thought to be associated with disproportionally high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. This clinical trial intends to create a registry of patients who completed lung&#xD;
      transplant and who are undergoing routine surveillance bronchoscopy. A subgroup of patients&#xD;
      will be characterized by hyper polarized gas magnetic resonance image to enhance detection of&#xD;
      CLAD, and to be correlated between the MRI imaging results and clinical/biochemical results.&#xD;
      This study is anticipated to advance our understanding of CLAD which is currently inevitably&#xD;
      fatal outcome among patients after lung transplant.&#xD;
