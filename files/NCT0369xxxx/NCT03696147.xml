  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to identify the role of diffusion weighted MRI in the assessment of&#xD;
      the clinical significance and outcomes of asymmetric breast densities identified on&#xD;
      mammograms, and to identify the inconclusive mammographic findings most frequently associated&#xD;
      with occult breast carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although there is clearly a wide variation in breast size and parenchymal pattern, the&#xD;
      breasts are generally symmetric structures with similar density and architecture. However,&#xD;
      asymmetric breast tissue is encountered relatively frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymmetric breast tissue is usually benign and secondary to variations in normal breast&#xD;
      tissue, postoperative change from a previous biopsy, hormone replacement therapy , or merely&#xD;
      poor positioning. However, an asymmetric area may indicate a developing mass or an underlying&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Radiology (ACR), Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)&#xD;
      defined four different types of asymmetric breast findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Asymmetric Breast tissue: refers to a greater volume or density of breast tissue in one&#xD;
           breast than in the corresponding area in the contra lateral breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Densities seen in one projection: reflect a density seen in only one mammographic&#xD;
           projection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Architectural distortion: refers to a focal area of breast tissue that appears distorted&#xD;
           with no definable central mass. Speculations radiate from a common point, and there is&#xD;
           an area of focal retraction and tethering of normal parenchyma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Focal asymmetric densities: refer to focal asymmetric densities that are seen on two&#xD;
           mammographic views but cannot be accurately identified as a true mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These lesions are frequently encountered at screening and diagnostic mammography and are&#xD;
      significant because they may indicate a neoplasm, especially if an associated palpable mass&#xD;
      is present. Once these lesions are detected at standard mammography, supplementary breast&#xD;
      imaging with additional mammographic views and ultrasonography (US) can be a key aspect of&#xD;
      work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these techniques may be insufficient to make a final BI-RADS assessment and may have&#xD;
      limited sensitivity and specificity for the detection and diagnosis of breast lesions,&#xD;
      yielding equivocal results. Certainty of the presence or absence of a true lesion can be&#xD;
      difficult, and the findings remain inconclusive. Moreover, Architectural distortion should&#xD;
      always be regarded with suspicion but differentiation from summation artifact is problematic.&#xD;
      Developing asymmetric densities need to be evaluated unless they can be explained in terms of&#xD;
      benign causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these situations, MRI can be performed as an additional problem- solving procedure.&#xD;
      Positive MRI examination will prompt biopsy and allow for the timely detection of&#xD;
      malignancies that may otherwise would gone undiagnosed, while a negative MRI will allow&#xD;
      increased confidence that the equivocal finding was likely caused by summation artifact or&#xD;
      benign tissue , so follow-up surveillance mammography without biopsy will be undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although conventional breast MRI has a high sensitivity (89-100%) in the characterization of&#xD;
      breast lesions . However, an overlap between benign and malignant findings still persists,&#xD;
      resulting in a variable specificity (50-90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DWI derives images from the difference of water molecules motion (Brownian motion) in&#xD;
      tissues, resulting in quantitative and qualitative data reflecting changes at the cellular&#xD;
      level and, consequently, unique information on the tumor cellularity and cell membranes&#xD;
      integrity. This would allow the increase in breast MRI specificity and reduction of&#xD;
      false-positive results and unnecessary biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell density might play an important role in the different ADCs obtained from benign and&#xD;
      malignant breast lesions and the measurement of extracellular water content may be an&#xD;
      additional feature that can improve MRI specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives in using diffusion sequences are to optimize characterization of lesions&#xD;
      differentiating benign from malignant tumors; and to improve detection of small lesions,&#xD;
      which requires an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. several authors have shown that this&#xD;
      technique is relevant for smaller masses (5 mm) and even for non-mass like enhancements.&#xD;
