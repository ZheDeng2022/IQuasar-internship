      The primary objective is to patient-reported Quality of Life related to complete control of&#xD;
      Radiation Induced Nausea and Vomiting (RINV) between standard palliative radiotherapy and&#xD;
      VMAT. Secondarily, we will assess rate of complete control of RINV. However, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference in pain response between the two&#xD;
      arms, because they are receiving the same dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For this study, SUPR (simple unplanned palliative radiotherapy) refers to the delivery of&#xD;
      radiation to the treatment area with a simple technique, either two opposed fields (parallel&#xD;
      opposed pair), or a single direct field. The entire portal is exposed to the specified dose&#xD;
      and therefore does not spare normal tissue. This technique requires minimal calculation, and&#xD;
      typically the dose distribution is not reviewed by the radiation oncologist or medical&#xD;
      physics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the adverse event profile of RT is associated with irradiation of normal tissue&#xD;
      within the treatment field. With the dose prescribed in this study, the probability of&#xD;
      serious adverse effects is exceedingly low. However, fatigue, soreness, pain flare, and&#xD;
      skin-redness in the irradiated area are relatively common adverse events. In addition,&#xD;
      site-specific toxicity could occur, including esophagitis, nausea, or diarrhea when there is&#xD;
      dose delivered to the GI tract. Avoiding this toxicity is a motivating factor for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to deliver 3D Conformal Radiotherapy, a computerized tomography (CT) simulation is&#xD;
      used to develop the treatment plan. The goal is to deliver a conformal radiation dose to the&#xD;
      target volume with maximal sparing of the normal tissue. VMAT (Volumetric Modulated Arc&#xD;
      Therapy) is a type of 3D conformal RT, and delivers the radiation dose more conformally than&#xD;
      SUPR, possibly reducing acute and late toxicity. The disadvantages of VMAT include more&#xD;
      complex planning and quality assurance processes compared with SUPR. The complex planning&#xD;
      required can be time-consuming, which can have a significant impact on departmental&#xD;
      resources, and the wait time for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone metastases are the most common site of distant metastases and can cause severe and&#xD;
      disabling effects, including pain, spinal cord compression and pathologic fracture. These&#xD;
      complications can greatly affect a patient's quality of life and cause immense suffering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective treatment for palliative patients with painful bone&#xD;
      metastases. It is also efficacious in preserving function and maintaining skeletal integrity,&#xD;
      while minimizing the occurrence of adverse skeletal related events. There is a significant&#xD;
      amount of evidence showing that a single fraction (SF) of RT provides equivalent pain relief&#xD;
      as multiple fractions (MF), which are associated with more acute toxicity, are less&#xD;
      convenient for patients and costlier for the health care system. Therefore, single fraction&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SFRT) is encouraged, but 20 Gy in 5 fractions is also allowed in this&#xD;
      study, though should be chosen only in patients with a complicated bone metastases by&#xD;
      fracture, neurological deficit (e.g. spinal cord compression), or a large soft tissue&#xD;
      component. In patients with advanced disease, management strategies focus on improving&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL), rather than conventional endpoints such as survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard of care in British Columbia for palliative patients with bone&#xD;
      metastases is SUPR. In other jurisdictions, however, factors such as physician remuneration&#xD;
      make other complex planning techniques more popular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BC Cancer is publicly funded with no direct costs to patients. All RT in the province is&#xD;
      provided by 6 centres where radiation oncologists receive an annual salary, which are&#xD;
      independent of RT treatment technique and duration. Due to the lack of financial incentive&#xD;
      associated with a more complex RT plan, BC Cancer is a unique clinical setting to assess the&#xD;
      use of VMAT versus SUPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As facilities providing RT have gained more experience with VMAT and improvements to VMAT&#xD;
      planning software have been made, the planning time required has been reduced. Previously,&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks was required for a team at the BC Cancer to create a VMAT plan for a&#xD;
      palliative patient with bone metastases; however, we hypothesize this can now be reduced to&#xD;
      three days in settings with low dose prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow the investigators to determine if there is reduced toxicity associated&#xD;
      with VMAT compared to SUPR with only a modest impact on resources. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesis is that VMAT will have reduced toxicity compared with SUPR for palliative patients&#xD;
      with bone metastases. The investigators also hypothesize that there will be no difference&#xD;
      between the two arms in terms of pain response, due to the fact that the doses are equal.&#xD;
      This hypothesis is driven by the radiobiologic rationale, which defines effective RT as the&#xD;
      ability of radiation to induce tumour cell death while sparing normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance in determining if there is any benefit in terms of toxicity with VMAT compared&#xD;
      with SUPR for palliative patients with bone metastases is obvious when consequences related&#xD;
      to its adoption are considered. As previously discussed, although the planning time has been&#xD;
      drastically reduced, there is still an expected modest increase in resources required to&#xD;
      carry out a VMAT plan. For patients, the pre-treatment process of VMAT is more burdensome,&#xD;
      i.e. patients have to wait longer before receiving VMAT as compared to SUPR, due to the&#xD;
      increased plan complexity. Therefore, it is important to consider the patient experience in&#xD;
      relation to the RT administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, evidence that either supports or refutes the hypothesis that VMAT will have&#xD;
      reduced toxicity compared with SUPR for patients with bone metastases will be helpful in&#xD;
      guiding future practices. We are not aware of any other randomized control trials (completed&#xD;
      or ongoing) that have addressed this issue, though a London Ontario study is randomizing&#xD;
      patients receiving palliative lung RT to SUPR vs VMAT. Due to the implications of VMAT on&#xD;
      departmental resources and patient experience, better evidence from a randomized control&#xD;
      trial is required before the widespread use of this technique can be justified.&#xD;
