  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, prospective, open label, single arm, phase II-study for the&#xD;
      evaluation of efficacy and feasibility (as determined by safety and tolerability) of&#xD;
      olaratumab and doxorubicin rechallenge in anthracycline pretreated locally advanced&#xD;
      (unresectable) or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now, rechallenge with anthracyclines in patients with metastatic STS which had a&#xD;
      benefit from prior anthracycline containing therapy was never investigated in a prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the very promising effect of olaratumab and doxorubicin in anthracycline-naïve&#xD;
      patients and further taking into consideration the results of the retrospective anthracycline&#xD;
      rechallenge study, there is a clear rationale to evaluate the effects of olaratumab and&#xD;
      doxorubicin also in anthracycline pretreated patients by conducting a prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
