  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be designed to capture the full duration of mosquito-lethal effect&#xD;
      of single dose Ivermectin to aid efforts to characterize metabolites with mosquito-lethal&#xD;
      effect. Ivermectin and its metabolites likely have antiparasitic properties against asexual&#xD;
      and sexual stage Plasmodium parasites that will be investigated with plasma samples from this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label pharmacokinetic study. Ten healthy participants will be admitted in the&#xD;
      inpatient ward to receive a single oral dose of IVM (400 µg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another 10 healthy participants will be donate blood up to 42 ml each times for up to 3&#xD;
      times. There is no drug administration for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration for each volunteer's participation in the study is approximately 2 months.&#xD;

      HEALTHY PARTICIPANT FOR CLINICAL TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will enroll 10 Thai healthy participants, 5 male and 5 female, aged 18-60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive a single oral dose of IVM (400&#xD;
      µg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a volunteert has provided written informed consent, the investigator will determine if&#xD;
      the volunteer is eligible for enrollment in the study. This will be done by reviewing the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and completing all of the screening assessments. Screening&#xD;
      assessments may be carried out over more than one day, provided that all required assessments&#xD;
      are completed within the 14 days prior to admission for Ivermectin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood collection for Standard Membrane Feeding Assay, Direct Feeding Assays,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic analysis, Plasma for Plasmodium assays and mosquito IgG assays should be&#xD;
      obtained at the scheduled times relative to when the participant was dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration for each volunteer's participation in the study is approximately 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALTHY PARTICIPANT FOR BLOOD DONOR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will enroll 10 healthy participants, aged 18-60 years. Each participant will donate&#xD;
      blood up to 42 ml via venipuncture up to three blood donations. There will be at least 28&#xD;
      days between each blood donation from the same subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be maintained at 37°C in a warm water bath until mixed with ivermectin compounds&#xD;
      or metabolites by Pharmacology staff and fed to mosquitoes by Armed Forces Research Institute&#xD;
      of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) staff. Any remaining blood after SMFAs will be discarded. No&#xD;
      blood samples will be transferred to AFRIMS. Participants for blood donation should not be&#xD;
      the same participants enrolled in the clinical trial above.&#xD;
