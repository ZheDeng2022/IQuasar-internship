  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I / II study. The purposes of this study are to: 1) find out what effects,&#xD;
      good and/or bad, the combination of the experimental drug avelumab and the drug azacitidine&#xD;
      has on people with AML and MRD, and 2) test if the two drugs, avelumab and azacitidine, are&#xD;
      effective in getting rid of AML MRD when the drugs are given together in combination.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 6 pre-allo SCT patients who are evaluable for DLT will be enrolled, with the first 3 patients enrolled in a sequential manner with a 1-week interval between the start of dosing for each patient. If the regimen appears tolerable in the first 3 patients (i.e., ≤ 1 of the first 3 patients enrolled experiences a DLT), then the next 3 patients will be enrolled concurrently. If more than 1 out of 6 in the pre-alloSCT group has a DLT, the trial will stop accrual. The combination will be considered safe in pre-allo SCT patients if one or no patient has a DLT out of the six patients. If the combination is safe in pre-alloSCT patients, additional pre-alloSCT patients will begin enrollment for the expanded phase II portion of the study, and accrual of 6 post-alloSCT patients for separate safety evaluation will begin. Toxicity will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as described by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.</description>

             cytogenetic abnormalities are eligible except for patients with t (15;17) (acute&#xD;
             promyelocytic leukemia). AML patients who have never undergone allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant must have adverse-risk AML by ELN criteria77 to be eligible. Patients with&#xD;
             a history of therapy related AML, myeloid sarcoma, or patients whose AML evolved from&#xD;
             an antecedent MDS or MPN are also eligible. Patients with any molecular mutations are&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have received therapy for AML and have a bone marrow biopsy within 28&#xD;
             days prior to registration that demonstrates a morphologic complete remission (CR) or&#xD;
             morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) as defined&#xD;
             by European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria. Patients with prior myeloid sarcoma must have&#xD;
             no residual evidence of extramedullary leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received any prior therapy for AML including cytotoxic agents,&#xD;

             antigen-expression patterns seen in specific cell lineages at specific stages of&#xD;
             maturation. Any level of residual flow cytometric disease is considered MRD positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling,&#xD;
             and urine sampling during the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be recovered from any clinically relevant toxic effects of any prior&#xD;
             surgery, radiotherapy, or other therapy intended for the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
             (Subjects with residual Grade 1-2 toxicity, for example Grade 1-2 peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy or residual alopecia, are allowed with approval of the principal&#xD;
             investigator.)&#xD;
