    <textblock>
      Illegal gold miners in French Guiana, a French overseas territory ('département') located in&#xD;
      Amazonia, often carry malaria parasites (up to 46.8%). While the Guiana Shield Region aims at&#xD;
      malaria elimination, the high prevalence of Plasmodiumin this hard-to-reach population in&#xD;
      conjunction with frequent incorrect use of artemisinin-based anti-malarials could favor the&#xD;
      emergence of resistant parasites. Due to geographical and regulatory issues in French Guiana,&#xD;
      usual malaria control strategies cannot be implemented in this particular context.Therefore,&#xD;
      new strategies targeting this specific population in the forest are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous discussions among health institutions and scientific partners from French Guiana,&#xD;
      Brazil and Suriname have led to an innovative project based on the distribution of kits for&#xD;
      self-diagnosis and self-treatment of Plasmodium infections. The kit-distribution will be&#xD;
      implemented at &quot;resting sites&quot;, which are areas across the border of French Guiana regularly&#xD;
      frequented by gold miners. The main objective is to increase the appropriate use and complete&#xD;
      malaria treatment after a positive malaria diagnosis with a rapid test, which will be&#xD;
      evaluated with before-and-after cross-sectional studies. Monitoring indicators will be&#xD;
      collected from health mediators at the time of kit distribution and during subsequent visits,&#xD;
      and from illegal gold miners themselves, through a smartphone application. The project&#xD;
      funding is multisource, including Ministries of Health of the three countries, WHO/PAHO, and&#xD;
      the European Union.&#xD;

      Background Despite a decrease in the number of cases reported to CIRE &quot;Cellule de l'Institut&#xD;
      de Veille Sanitaire&quot;, an interregional epidemiological surveillance center, malaria affects&#xD;
      many gold miners working illegally in French Guiana. The ORPAL study carried out by CIC&#xD;
      &quot;Centre d'Investigation Clinique&quot; (clinical investigation center) in 2015, showed that the&#xD;
      prevalence of Plasmodium in illegal gold miners was 22.3%, of which 84% were asymptomatic.&#xD;
      Self-medication practices are very common (52.4%) using artemisinin derivatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key issues identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mobile population of workers in illegal gold mining sites is particularly affected&#xD;
           by malaria due to their living and working conditions and as such represents a reservoir&#xD;
           of transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their undocumented irregular status and difficult access to health centers makes care&#xD;
           from health professionals rare or belated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of inadequate drugs, without prior diagnosis and with improper compliance,&#xD;
           mainly due to the high cost of treatment on the black market, is common. These&#xD;
           non-recommended practices contribute to the risk of emergence of ACT resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge of the disease by illegal gold miners (causes, symptoms, preventive measures&#xD;
           and treatment) remains insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the problems, the identified need is to ensure sufficient intervention coverage&#xD;
      of appropriate and rapid care, amongst the malaria &quot;reservoir&quot; population, in order to&#xD;
      reduce:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria transmission and ACT non-compliance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ensuing risk of P. falciparum resistance to ACT;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The morbidity and mortality of illegal workers in gold-mining sites;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The free distribution of self-diagnosis and self-treatment kits, together with appropriate&#xD;
      training / information, at &quot;resting sites&quot;, Brazil and Suriname, would be a strategy relevant&#xD;
      to the specific context of French Guiana, and would respond to the identified need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This study aims to assess a new malaria control strategy targeting gold miners&#xD;
      working illegally in French Guiana, based on the distribution of self-diagnosis kits and&#xD;
      self-treatment against P. falciparum in cross-border areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective Increase the part of illegal gold miners in French Guiana who take ACT&#xD;
           entirely after a positive rapid diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improve the use of anti-malarial treatments against P. falciparum appropriately and&#xD;
                in compliance with WHO recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduce the prevalence of malaria among illegal gold miners in French Guiana.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increase the part of illegal gold miners in French Guiana who:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Know malaria, its causes, the symptoms and protection measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Have a positive attitude towards recommended prevention measures, the use of&#xD;
                     adequate anti-malarial treatment, and adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Report applying good preventive practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be carried out in cooperation with Brazil, Suriname and France. It is&#xD;
      divided into 2 sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Implementation and monitoring of the intervention Distribution of self-diagnosis&#xD;
           and self-treatment kits to people working illegally at gold-mining sites in French&#xD;
           Guiana, along with the provision of training. This distribution will take place at&#xD;
           resting sites by trained facilitators. Proactive digital collection of data will be&#xD;
           conducted by these facilitators and via gold miners themselves through a mobile&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Evaluation of the intervention The final evaluation of the project will be&#xD;
           carried out in a cross-sectional study &quot;Orpal bis&quot;, with a questionnaire on knowledge,&#xD;
           attitudes and practices and blood sampling to measure the prevalence of Plasmodium&#xD;
           carriers before / after the intervention. The same study (Orpal) was carried out in 2015&#xD;
           along the Surinamese border, and will be carried out before implementation along the&#xD;
           Brazilian border.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it will be a pre-post evaluation. Depending on the results, the sustainability of&#xD;
      the action will be determined by the Health Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration As a pilot project, the inclusion period for which the data will be processed in the&#xD;
      view of determining the potential sustainability is 12 months. The length of the results&#xD;
      capitalizing is estimated to be 6 months, during which the intervention will be maintained,&#xD;
      in order to avoid any useless gap. Therefore, the total duration of the pilot phase is 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
