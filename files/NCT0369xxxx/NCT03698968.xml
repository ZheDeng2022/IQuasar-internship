    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the safe and effective use of the PICO 7 system in&#xD;
      surgically closed incision sites and wounds requiring closure by skin graft or flap as part&#xD;
      of the PMCF plan for this product, for the purpose of continuing CE (Conformité Européene)&#xD;
      Mark approval in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12-2&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although evidence exists which supports the positive effects of NPWT on take of skin grafts&#xD;
      and flaps, there is limited evidence in relation to single-use systems such as PICO. Most&#xD;
      previous studies have used traditional NPWT systems as part of their design. Though the&#xD;
      technical applications of the traditional and newer single-use systems are comparable it is&#xD;
      possible that some of the features of the latter may influence clinical outcomes. In addition&#xD;
      to the limitations highlighted above, the cited studies have seldom assessed the ease of&#xD;
      management and acceptability of NPWT systems. Although clinical outcomes may be considered&#xD;
      paramount, these usability factors could also play a key role in ensuring compliance with&#xD;
      negative pressure protocols.&#xD;

      surgically closed incision sites and wounds requiring closure by skin graft or flap as part&#xD;
      of the PMCF plan for this product, for the purpose of continuing CE (Conformité Européene)&#xD;
      Mark approval in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PICO system has recently been updated with minor modifications that make the system&#xD;
      silent during wear. S &amp; N also wish to collect PMCF data in the indications of knee and&#xD;
      abdominal incisions in order to make retrospective comparisons with data previously collected&#xD;
      for these indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to assess whether the PICO 7 system is a safe and&#xD;
      effective therapy for surgically closed incisions, skin grafts and flaps. Effectiveness will&#xD;
      be defined by the ability of the system to deliver negative pressure and handle exudate and&#xD;
      by percentage of successful skin graft or flap survival at Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of known and potential risks and benefits to humans of each test article can be&#xD;
      found in the Instructions for Use of PICO 7.&#xD;
