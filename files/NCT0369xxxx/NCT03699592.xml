      This will be a time series prospective cohort and comparison group design to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect on home literacy environments of the Reach Home and Read intervention as compared to&#xD;
      standard programming provided by home visiting staff. The intervention will consist of staff&#xD;
      training for East Durham Children's Initiative (EDCI) early childhood staff and the provision&#xD;
      of an age appropriate book at their home visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be children receiving the current EDCI home visiting programming. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive standard EDCI programming and the Reach Home and Read&#xD;
      intervention administered by the EDCI early childhood home visiting staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standardized StimQ home literacy assessment tool will be used to measure changes in the&#xD;
      home literacy environment. Additionally, a qualitative portion of this study will inform&#xD;
      future research and tool-kit design. The design is a qualitative descriptive study that&#xD;
      utilizes the methodologies of focus groups for data collection.&#xD;

      The ROR-h Toolkit: The toolkit currently includes one age-appropriate book along with a set&#xD;
      of educational pamphlets explaining the importance home literacy. These educational materials&#xD;
      focus on appropriate literacy milestones and descriptions of how parents can engage with&#xD;
      their children around books. The investigators will conduct pre-study, preliminary testing of&#xD;
      the toolkit among at least five families and EDCI staff participating in EDCI's Parent Caf√©,&#xD;
      and incorporate changes. In addition, the investigators will create an information sheet&#xD;
      outlining zipcode-specific community literacy resources, including location and information&#xD;
      on how to access the library, where to obtain low-cost books, and a schedule of literacy&#xD;
      promotion activities in their community (e.g. community reading sessions). All materials will&#xD;
      also be translated into Spanish by a certified interpreter, and will be reviewed to ensure&#xD;
      that they are written at a fifth grade reading level using web-based technology (Microsoft&#xD;
      Word). Additionally, EDCI families receiving this intervention will also receive an&#xD;
      additional new book at each home visit conducted during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline cohort of 50 families will be recruited from families receiving EDCI early&#xD;
      childhood home visits. Families will be approached by EDCI staff and will be asked whether&#xD;
      they are interested in being contacted about participation in the study. Because our&#xD;
      intervention includes children aged 6-12 months, EDCI staff will approach all families with&#xD;
      children aged 5-11 months who participate in the early childhood program. If a family agrees&#xD;
      to be contacted, a trained research assistant will contact and consent the family by phone.&#xD;
      Once consent is obtained, baseline demographic information will be collected via REDCap. This&#xD;
      information will include patient age, patient race, number of children in the family, parent&#xD;
      age, parent education, insurance, and primary language spoken in the home. Baseline StimQ&#xD;
      assessment data will also be collected and entered into REDCap. When possible, information&#xD;
      will be entered into REDCap electronically by the family from their own electronic device.&#xD;
      When this is not possible, the research assistant will collect this data electronically in&#xD;
      person or by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the family is enrolled and baseline StimQ data has been collected, EDCI staff will&#xD;
      continue to provide their standard home visiting services. After three months, families will&#xD;
      be sent a follow up StimQ assessment to be completed electronically via REDCap. If the family&#xD;
      does not complete this follow up, they will be contacted by the research assistant to&#xD;
      complete this follow up at two week intervals for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the baseline cohort has completed their 3 month study period, EDCI staff will receive&#xD;
      tool-kit training. The study PI (Erickson) will conduct a one-hour training session with all&#xD;
      EDCI home visitors. The training will cover the importance of literacy in health and&#xD;
      wellness, the impact of exposure to books and reading in children and how this affects their&#xD;
      social and emotional development, and how to implement this model of teaching in their home&#xD;
      visit. EDCI home visitors will also complete online modules validated by ROR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once training is complete, recruitment and enrollment for the intervention group will begin.&#xD;
      Families will be approached by EDCI staff and will undergo the same recruitment and&#xD;
      enrollment procedure as above. We plan to enroll and additional 50 families in this cohort.&#xD;
      Demographic information and baseline StimQ data will be conducted as above. Once families are&#xD;
      enrolled, EDCI staff will provide the literacy toolkit described above at the next scheduled&#xD;
      home visit and engage actively with the family around the importance of early literacy using&#xD;
      the kit as a tool to model positive interactions. EDCI staff will provide an additional book&#xD;
      at each scheduled monthly visit over the next 3 months and an additional fact sheet outlining&#xD;
      age appropriate literacy milestones at 3 months. At the completion of the 3 month&#xD;
      intervention period, families will be sent a follow up StimQ assessment to be completed&#xD;
      electronically via REDCap. If the family does not complete this follow up, they will be&#xD;
      contacted by the research assistant to complete this follow up at two week intervals for 6&#xD;
      weeks. Families will also be provided with acceptability surveys at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative portion of this study, 15-20 key informants will be recruited. Interviews&#xD;
      and/or focus groups will be held at the EDCI office and facilitated by a member of the DOCR&#xD;
      research services team versed in qualitative data collection and analysis. The facilitator&#xD;
      will utilize a guide during group discussions and/or interviews which will serve to structure&#xD;
      conversations around relevant questions. Study participants will be asked to answer a few&#xD;
      demographic questions before sharing experiences and perspectives. The groups and/or&#xD;
      interviews will be recorded on a secure digital recorder; the audio file will be uploaded&#xD;
      immediately to a secure Duke server. Individual participation will last approximately 1 hour&#xD;
      and refreshments will be provided.&#xD;
