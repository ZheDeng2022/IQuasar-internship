      This study proposes to perform a pilot observational study looking at the doses of propofol&#xD;
      used for the induction of general anesthesia and its association with the development of&#xD;
      hypotension and AKI among elderly patients at YNHH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first stage of this study proposes to perform a pilot observational study looking at the&#xD;
      doses of propofol used for the induction of general anesthesia. We will determine the percent&#xD;
      (as a function of age, Elixhauser score, ASA status) of patients who receive more than the&#xD;
      FDA approved induction dosage. We estimate 30% with the power defined as the width of the 95&#xD;
      percent confidence interval around that number that is given by 80% power and n=500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, the investigators will look at the association between dose and the&#xD;
      development of hypotension (in the time after induction and before surgical incision) and&#xD;
      post-operative AKI among elderly patients at YNHH while controlling for age, Elixhauser&#xD;
      score, and ASA status. The results of this study will also hopefully be used in a quality&#xD;
      improvement project to prevent overdosing of the elderly patient population with induction&#xD;
      anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Elderly patients are being overdosed (per FDA guidelines) with anesthetic&#xD;
      agents for induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Overdose of anesthetic agents for induction of general anesthesia in the&#xD;
      elderly population leads to an increased chance of developing AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Overdose of anesthetic agents for induction of general anesthesia in the&#xD;
      elderly population leads to an increased chance of developing hypotension post-induction,&#xD;
      which may contribute to development of AKI or vice-versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be done via analysis of data and associated records contained in the&#xD;
      Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group databases at Yale (the latter is a research database&#xD;
      approved under HIC#1206010438).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible risks are primarily the risk to privacy that is inherent in any retrospective&#xD;
      chart review. The benefit may be to suggest areas for quality improvement in induction&#xD;
      practices for elderly patients at YNHH and elsewhere.&#xD;
