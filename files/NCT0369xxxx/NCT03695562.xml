      - Vitamin D considers as the most potent effect on calcium level in blood it was found that&#xD;
      vitamin D target mainly bone tissue intestine and kidney for calcium absorption In bone,&#xD;
      vitamin D stimulates mainly the activity of osteoclasts osteoblast activity on the other hand&#xD;
      it increases the production of extracellular matrix proteins by different osteoblastic&#xD;
      activity. Vitamin D also increase intestinal calcium absorption and regulate synthesis and&#xD;
      secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant consider as one of the most successful treatment modalities that usually used in&#xD;
      dental clinics for restoring single or multiple missed teeth knowing that successful rate of&#xD;
      dental implant may reach up to 99% however there are many different techniques for implant&#xD;
      placement they mainly depend on the same procedure for implant placement even sequential&#xD;
      drilling technique or single drilling technique some paper supported that sequential drilling&#xD;
      is much better than single drilling technique on other hand some assume that single drilling&#xD;
      is much better as it save time effort material less bone trauma &amp; less heat generation&#xD;
      although there are many studies performed on sequential drilling &amp; single drilling techniques&#xD;
      we still have a gap for understanding the ideal technique for implant placement in patients&#xD;
      with vitamin D deficiency&#xD;

      The high predictability of dental implants has led to routine use with a great expectation&#xD;
      for success There are many researches focused on the outcome of delayed dental implant Since&#xD;
      the first report of highly success rate after placement of a dental implant there has been&#xD;
      increasing interest in this technique for implant treatment The goal of modern dentistry is&#xD;
      to restore the patient's dentition to normal contour function comfort esthetics speech and&#xD;
      health regardless of the atrophy disease or injury of the stomatognathic system As a result&#xD;
      of disease related tooth loss and the value placed upon teeth there has been a continual&#xD;
      search for methods by which missing teeth could be replaced Early artificial replacements&#xD;
      were made from natural teeth and a variety of substitute materials All transplantation of a&#xD;
      tooth from one person to another was an early method by which lost teeth were replaced&#xD;
      Archeological discoveries indicate that many ancient civilizations practiced allogenic tooth&#xD;
      transplantation. In 1561 Ambrose Pare reported that decayed teeth could be replaced by using&#xD;
      extracted teeth from another individual and is credited with being the first to mention&#xD;
      transplantation The core objective of dental implant therapy is to improve functional&#xD;
      dentition throughout life Nevertheless there are many factors that may effect on implant&#xD;
      stability A significant part of implant failure may be related to systemic condition that my&#xD;
      retard dental implants osteointegration one of this factors is vitamin D deficiency recently&#xD;
      many paper focused on vitamin D deficiency and its impact effect on bone turn over around&#xD;
      dental implant There are many different techniques for implant placement even sequential&#xD;
      drilling or single drilling technique knowing that single drilling technique has a&#xD;
      compression effect which may enhance implant stability however sequential drilling don't have&#xD;
      compression effect on bone some paper supported that sequential is much better than single&#xD;
      drilling technique however some paper showed there is no clinical significance between two&#xD;
      techniques the main idea here that we need to find an ideal technique for implant placement&#xD;
      in patients with vitamin D deficiency knowing that vitamin D play an important role for bone&#xD;
      turnover around dental implant to attain the required dental implant stability also play a&#xD;
      role for osteoblast osteoclast activity Also vitamin D play a role for regulation of&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone which play a role for homeostasis of calcium level from bone in blood .&#xD;
