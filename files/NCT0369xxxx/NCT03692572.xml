  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who enter menopause early are at a greater risk for developing cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      later in life as compared to women with normal onset of menopause. This increased risk may be&#xD;
      due to a prolonged length of time with decreased hormone levels post-menopause; however, this&#xD;
      health risk remains understudied. The current study plan to study why women with early&#xD;
      menopause are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease by evaluating their sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system and heart-blood vessel function. In addition, there is lack of promising&#xD;
      treatment plans for cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women. Therefore, the current&#xD;
      study will also test the impact of dietary nitrate on post-menopausal women to determine if&#xD;
      it might serve as a potential treatment to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in older&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is recruiting two groups of women aged between 60-70 years old; 1) women&#xD;
      who had early natural/non-surgical menopause (age 40-44 yrs) and 2) women who had normal&#xD;
      natural/non-surgical menopause (age 50-54). The investigators are recruiting women who do not&#xD;
      have any cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other major health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the project is that early menopause negatively impacts the heart,&#xD;
      blood vessel and nerve system due to the increased length of time with reduced hormone&#xD;
      levels; which could explain the relationship between early menopause and greater risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in later life. Sympathetic nerve system and cardiovascular functions&#xD;
      will be evaluated in both groups to compare the impact of prolonged hormone deficiency. In&#xD;
      addition, current study will examine the impact of inorganic nitrate supplementation (beet&#xD;
      root juice) to see if there are any favorable changes after 2 weeks of beet root juice&#xD;
      intake. There are 2 main test visits in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1. Nerve system test (maximally take about 5 hours): Participants will rest in the&#xD;
      supine position for ≥ 20 mins. Resting heart rate, breathing rate, finger blood pressure will&#xD;
      be monitored. Cardiac output will be assessed using the acetylene gas rebreathing technique&#xD;
      (1 hour). IV will be inserted for blood draw. Nerve signal search will be performed using a&#xD;
      thin needle behind knee to find a signal from a specific nerve. At the same time,&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler probe will be placed on the head to look at brain blood flow using soft&#xD;
      head gear (1-2 hour). After acceptable signals are obtained, baseline data collection will&#xD;
      begin. It will be followed by handgrip exercise and hand immersion to cold water to examine&#xD;
      neural sympathetic response to different stimuli (30 mins). After this, to evaluate nerve&#xD;
      response to different degrees of passive standings, a bed will be tilted to 30° and 60° for 8&#xD;
      mins each. Blood samples will be obtained in the supine resting position and at the end of&#xD;
      60° tilt (45 mins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2. Heart and vessel function assessment (Proximately take 2 hours): All measurements&#xD;
      are non-invasive for this visit. Participants will rest in the supine position for ≥ 20 mins.&#xD;
      Resting heart function will be assessed by ultrasound echocardiography (30mins). Vascular&#xD;
      stiffness measurement will be performed using a probe placed on wrist, neck and leg groin&#xD;
      area (30 mins). Vascular endothelial function will be measured using flow-mediated dilation&#xD;
      and followed by smooth muscle responsiveness test will be performed by measuring brachial&#xD;
      artery diameter changes for 10 min following 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin administration&#xD;
      (1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 1-2, participant will be asked to drink either dietary nitrate supplementation or&#xD;
      placebo for 2 weeks (randomly assigned). After 2 weeks intervention, participant will come&#xD;
      back for post-intervention tests which are identical to visit 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the first intervention, participants will have at least 2 weeks of&#xD;
      wash-out period. After 2 weeks participant will be back to the lab and repeat the visit 1 and&#xD;
      2, as well as 2 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation or placebo. (For those who received&#xD;
      2 weeks of nitrate supplementation for the first intervention, it will be a placebo for this&#xD;
      intervention. For those who received placebo for the first intervention, it will be a nitrate&#xD;
      supplementation for this intervention). After intervention participants will repeat the visit&#xD;
      1 and 2 again.&#xD;
