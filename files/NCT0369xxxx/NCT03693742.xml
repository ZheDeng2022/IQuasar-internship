  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-DCFPyL is an agent that binds to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Due to high&#xD;
      levels of PSMA in prostate cancer, treatments targeting PSMA have been developed to deliver&#xD;
      therapy to these specific target cells. Unfortunately when this treatment is delivered there&#xD;
      is radiotracer uptake in the salivary glands and kidneys, not related to cancer, which causes&#xD;
      dry mouth and causes patients to stop treatment. It is proposed that having tomato juice&#xD;
      containing monosodium glutamate (MSG) may reduce radiotracer uptake in the salivary glands&#xD;
      and kidneys and reduce damage to these tissues.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single cohort study to evaluate the utility of MSG in reducing salivary&#xD;
      gland radiotracer uptake, in patients who undergo an 18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission tomography&#xD;
      / Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans Each participant will receive 2 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans at the BC&#xD;
      Cancer - Vancouver Centre, as part of this research sub-study. Each participant will receive&#xD;
      tomato juice before each appointment. One visit they will have tomato juice containing MSG&#xD;
      and the other will be a placebo (standard tomato juice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant will receive a bolus intravenous dose of 18F-DCFPyL. The participant&#xD;
      will rest in a comfortable chair for 120 minutes and will then be taken to the PET/CT scanner&#xD;
      for images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hour follow-up All participants will be requested to either return to the functional&#xD;
      imaging department approximately 24 hours (acceptable range 16-28 hours) after the injection&#xD;
      of 18F-DCFPyL and tomato juice consumption or agree to be contacted by phone. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects following the&#xD;
      administration of 18F-DCFPyL and tomato juice, or in the intervening 24 hours. The local site&#xD;
      attending nuclear medicine physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects&#xD;
      are likely related to 18F-DCFPyL and/or tomato juice administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to take approximately 1 year for accrual.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective double blind intra-participant comparison of [18F]-DCFPyL PET/CT scans performed after orally administered MSG or placebo. The participants will receive oral administration of MSG or placebo, in two different examination sessions, 30 minutes before [18F]-DCFPyL injection.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>For randomization, a computer generated random list will determine the order of the scans (MSG first, placebo first). Sealed envelopes will be prepared. A study coordinator or technologist not involved in measuring vital signs or collecting adverse events will prepare the tomato juice solution based on the randomization envelope. The rest of the team will not be informed of which tomato juice is used (placebo or MSG) but this information will be recorded and will be immediately accessible should a participant experience a severe adverse event.</masking_description>

    <description>Comparison of MSG and placebo 18F-DCFPyL tumour accumulation measured by the maximal standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SULmax). For determination of tumour uptake, all malignant lesions, the SULmax were measured using the PET Edge tool running on MIM.

The median SULmax in the malignant lesions will be used for this analysis.</description>
