  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. Individuals with hemiparesis&#xD;
      due to stroke often have difficulty bearing weight on their legs and transferring weight from&#xD;
      one leg to the other. The ability to bear weight on the legs is important during functional&#xD;
      movements such as rising from a chair, standing and walking. Diminished weight transfer&#xD;
      contributes to asymmetries during walking which commonly leads to greater energy expenditure.&#xD;
      Moreover, deficits in bearing weight on the paretic leg contribute to lateral instability and&#xD;
      are associated with decreased walking speed and increased risk of falling in individuals&#xD;
      post-stroke. These functional limitations affect community participation and life quality.&#xD;
      Thus, restoring the ability to bear weight on the legs, i.e., limb loading, is a critical&#xD;
      goal for rehabilitation post-stroke. The purpose of this research is to identify the&#xD;
      impairments in neuromechanical mechanisms of limb loading and determine whether limb loading&#xD;
      responses can be retrained by induced forced limb loading.&#xD;

      Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the U.S. Individuals with hemiparesis&#xD;
      due to stroke often have difficulty bearing weight on the paretic lower extremity and&#xD;
      transferring weight from one leg to the other. Impaired weight transfer and limb loading&#xD;
      contribute to lateral instability and are associated with decreased walking speed and&#xD;
      increased risk of falling. Consequently, restoring limb loading ability is an important goal&#xD;
      for rehabilitation post-stroke. Despite considerable rehabilitation efforts aimed at&#xD;
      enhancing paretic limb loading, their effectiveness on improving neuromotor and functional&#xD;
      outcomes remains limited possibly due to poorly understood limb loading mechanisms and the&#xD;
      reluctance to use the paretic limb. The coordination of neuromuscular actions to regulate&#xD;
      loading force during weight acceptance is an important component of functional limb loading.&#xD;
      Because altered neuromuscular control is common in persons with stroke, it is possible that&#xD;
      these abnormalities may impair limb loading ability. The long-term objective of this project&#xD;
      is to develop a mechanism-based framework for designing and testing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      novel rehabilitation interventions to enhance lower limb weight transfer and limb loading to&#xD;
      improve balance and mobility. This project aims to (1) identify the neuromuscular and&#xD;
      biomechanical abnormalities in limb loading responses in individuals post-stroke, (2)&#xD;
      determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for the deficits in limb loading, and (3)&#xD;
      test the short-term effectiveness of a 6-week perturbation-induced limb load training program&#xD;
      on improving limb loading responses and mobility function. The investigators propose to apply&#xD;
      a sudden unilateral lowering of the supporting surface to induce lateral weight transfer that&#xD;
      forces limb loading. Kinetic, kinematic, and lower extremity muscle activation patterns will&#xD;
      be recorded. The investigators expect that, compared to healthy controls, individuals with&#xD;
      stroke will show increased muscle co-activation of the knee musculature with decreased knee&#xD;
      flexion and torque production, and irregular impact force regulation during loading that will&#xD;
      disrupt weight transfer and loading of the paretic limb. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that compared to a conventional clinical weight-shift rehabilitation training&#xD;
      program, the imposed limb loading group will show greater improvements during voluntary&#xD;
      stepping and walking following training. Specifically, the investigators expect the knee&#xD;
      muscle co-activation duration will be reduced, with increased knee joint torque, and the&#xD;
      paretic single stance/double support time will increase, reflecting improved paretic limb&#xD;
      loading ability during gait following training.&#xD;
