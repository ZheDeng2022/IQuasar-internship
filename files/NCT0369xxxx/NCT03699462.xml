  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is being revealed that the more severe the damage of the endothelial glycocalyx (EG)&#xD;
      layer, the more likely it is that the prognosis of the patients is poor. For that reason,&#xD;
      research is being actively conducted on methods for reducing damage and promoting recovery of&#xD;
      the EG layer.The natural regeneration process of the EG layer is up to 7 days. Considering&#xD;
      the fact that it is quiet slow, reducing the damage of EG layer is considered to be very&#xD;
      important for improving the prognosis of patients undergoing surgery, but there is no&#xD;
      clinically proven method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the ways receiving attention to reduce damage of EG layer is to stabilize the layer&#xD;
      through fluid therapy with albumin. The purpose of this study is to compare the protective&#xD;
      effect of the EG layer according to the type of fluid (balanced crystalloid solution vs. 5%&#xD;
      albumin) during surgery in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;

    <masking_description>One researcher (Anesthesiologist) conducts randomized group assignment, and the researcher is not involved in other aspects of anesthesia and research.&#xD;
Therefore, other researchers, and all those involved in anesthesia, surgery, and postoperative management do not know the patient's group assignment.</masking_description>
