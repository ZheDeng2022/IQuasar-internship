      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label phase II study of a daratumumab accelerated infusion regimen and a&#xD;
      fixed pre- and post-medication regimen, in patients with relapsed and refractory Multiple&#xD;
      Myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive daratumumab, in the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab 8mg/kg in 500 mL over 4 hours Cycle 1 Day 1, Daratumumab 16mg/kg in 500 mL over&#xD;
      90 minutes (20% of dose given in first 30 minutes and remaining 80% of dose given over 60&#xD;
      minutes) Cycle 1 Days 8, 15 and 22; Cycle 2 Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and on Days 1 and 15 for&#xD;
      Cycles 3-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with a 6-patient lead-in phase where safety with regards to the number&#xD;
      of Grade 4 infusion related reactions with the accelerated infusion protocol will be&#xD;
      evaluated in real time. Accrual to the study will not stop during this evaluation. The safety&#xD;
      information obtained will be reviewed and evaluated in the context of previously published&#xD;
      data. The review will be conducted by a 3-physician panel and if serious safety concerns&#xD;
      (defined as Grade 4 infusion related reactions and/or death) are identified, the panel will&#xD;
      make recommendations about protocol modifications if deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-medication regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast 10 mg po x 2 days prior to daratumumab administration and 10 mg po the morning of&#xD;
      daratumumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetirizine 10 mg po x 2 days prior to daratumumab administration and 10 mg po the morning of&#xD;
      daratumumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone 20 mg on days of and day following daratumumab administration; starting Cycle 1&#xD;
      Day 15, dexamethasone 20 mg on day of daratumumab administration only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetaminophen 975-1000 mg po 1 hour prior to daratumumab administration. Diphenhydramine 50mg&#xD;
      IV 1 hour prior to daratumumab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects will remain on treatment as long as there is no evidence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity or until a patient/physician decision to discontinue is&#xD;
      made. Disease assessments as determined by the Site Investigator will be made according to&#xD;
      the IMWG response criteria guidelines for MM.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is designed to evaluate the IRRs associated with a shortened infusion time of&#xD;
      daratumumab administration over a 6-month time period, subjects will be followed on study for&#xD;
      a maximum of 6 months following enrollment. Following this time period, all subjects who&#xD;
      continue to have a response to daratumumab will be taken off study. Although the study may&#xD;
      end before subjects progress from their disease, daratumumab treatment will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression in the absence of uncontrolled side effects or voluntary discontinuation&#xD;
      of treatment for any reason, although drug will be supplied outside of the clinical trial&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
