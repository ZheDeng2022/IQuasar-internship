      The objective of the PRELUDE BTK study is to assess safety and efficacy of the Serranator®&#xD;
      PTA Serration Balloon Catheter (study device) in subjects with atherosclerotic peripheral&#xD;
      artery disease of the infrapopliteal arteries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single arm, prospective, multi-center feasibility study enrolling up to 48 subjects with&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions in the infrapopliteal arteries and/or Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).&#xD;
      The study will capture acute angiographic data to compare the pre-Serranator® inflation vs&#xD;
      post inflation effects and will include 6 month clinical follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of subjects with claudication or CLI, with de novo stenoses&#xD;
      or non-stented restenotic or total occlusion lesions in infrapopliteal arteries having lesion&#xD;
      length up to and including 12 cm in length and reference vessel diameter of 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm&#xD;
      inclusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject has Rutherford Clinical Category 3, 4 or 5. Enrollment of Rutherford 3 will be&#xD;
             limited to no more than 40% of total subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Estimated life expectancy &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Target lesion(s) has stenosis &gt;70% by visual assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. De-novo, or non-stented re-stenotic lesions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Reference vessel diameter is between 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm, inclusive;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target lesions involve infra-popliteal tibial arteries above the tibio-talar joint;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Up to two target lesion(s) may be treated. These target lesions may be located in a&#xD;
             single or two infrapopliteal arteries;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A target lesion may consist of one long or multiple serial lesions that are up to and&#xD;
             including 12 cm in length that can be covered by a single balloon (longest balloon&#xD;
             length for this study will be 12 cm);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If more than one critical lesion is identified in two different vessels but only one&#xD;
             lesion matches the inclusion criteria, that lesion should be treated as the target&#xD;
             lesion and the other non-qualifying lesion in the other vessel may be treated with&#xD;
             commercial devices in any manner the investigator decides except by atherectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If two critical lesions are identified in two vessels and both qualify for the study,&#xD;
             the investigator may treat both lesions with investigational balloons or may choose to&#xD;
             identify one lesion as the target lesion and treat the second lesion with commercial&#xD;
             devices except atherectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If two critical lesions are in one vessel and both lesions qualify for the study, both&#xD;
             lesions should be treated with investigational balloons. Lesions that are within 3 cm&#xD;
             of each other will be treated as a single lesion;&#xD;

             patent inframalleolar outflow vessel in each target vessel. If the peroneal artery is&#xD;
             the treated artery, it should supply collaterals at the ankle that reconstitute an&#xD;
             inframalleolar outflow vessel;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Successful treatment of inflow stenosis (DS&gt;50%), from the iliac to the target lesion.&#xD;
             Stenosis can be treated during the same procedure using standard angioplasty, DCB,&#xD;
             DES, and/or stenting but use of atherectomy is excluded. The inflow lesion(s) must be&#xD;
             treated first, prior to consideration of treatment of the target lesion. Subject can&#xD;
             be enrolled if the inflow lesion(s) are treated and results in &lt;30% residual stenosis&#xD;
