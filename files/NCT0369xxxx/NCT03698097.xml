  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practice of patient surveys for quality management is revised at the University Hospital&#xD;
      Basel (USB). One aspect is a more versatile data acquisition via online portals and/or paper&#xD;
      questionnaires, another aspect is the content of questions and the assessment of demographic&#xD;
      data. In this situation a tentative survey on their preferences in this context was realised&#xD;
      in patients who were treated in autumn 2016 at the Department of Orthopaedics and Trauma&#xD;
      Surgery (DOTS) using a cover letter informing them about the nature of the survey. They were&#xD;
      asked to provide few basic demographic data, they were furthermore asked whether they&#xD;
      favoured surveys by the USB and if so with which focus. Finally they had the option to name&#xD;
      three central topics for feedback and to quantify the number of questionnaires they had so&#xD;
      far received by the USB. The survey could be completed in a paper and survey monkey based&#xD;
      internet version accessible via a Quick Response (QR) code or link.&#xD;
