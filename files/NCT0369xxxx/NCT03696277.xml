  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic kidney cancer patients on systemic therapy often develop resistance to limited&#xD;
      sites that leads to changing of the systemic therapy. Local therapy to the sites of&#xD;
      progression may allow patients to continue on the same systemic therapy that is otherwise&#xD;
      effective and being tolerated well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic ablative radiation (SAbR) can delay the change of systemic therapy with&#xD;
      oligoprogressive renal cell cancer (RCC) and improve progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the benefit of SAbR for oligo-progressive mRCC (Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To measure the toxicity, safety and tolerance of concurrent systemic therapy and SAbR for&#xD;
      mRCC patients and its impact on quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective phase II, single arm, open label trial evaluating Stereotactic&#xD;
      Ablative Radiation Therapy (SAbR) for patients with oligo-progressive RCC (Renal Cell&#xD;
      Cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can local therapy (SAbR) for oligoprogression delay the change of systemic therapy if&#xD;
           progression is minimal to the progressive sites?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safely delaying the change of systemic therapy can have significant quality of life&#xD;
           benefits for patients with oligo-progressive RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can SAbR potentially improve progression free survival in oligoprogressive RCC patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Time to change of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PFS on subsequent systemic therapy (PFS-SST) after progression on SAbR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival(OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity, safety and tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 20 Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Time to event will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach along&#xD;
      with the 95% confidence interval.&#xD;

    <description>Severity or Toxicity will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.

    <description>HRQoL will be measured using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G)questionnaire. The FACT-G is a 28-item questionnaire that uses 5-point Likert-type response choices (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 =somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). Possible scores range from 0-4, where higher scores indicate better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL is measured using EuroQoL- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. EQ-5D is a patient self-administrated questionnaire. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension can be graded on 3 levels: 1-no problems, 2-moderate problems, and 3-extreme problems. Health states are defined by the combination of the leveled responses to the 5 dimensions, generating 243 health states to which unconsciousness and death are added. The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between. Possible scores range from 0-1, where higher score indicates better outcomes ( 0 =&quot;Worst health state,&quot; and 1=&quot;Best health state.&quot; )</description>
