      Many women at high risk for acquiring HIV infection are not aware of preexposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP), an efficacious, self-administered, woman-controlled, HIV prevention product. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based&#xD;
      intervention to promote PrEP uptake and adherence in a pilot trial among 80 women. The study&#xD;
      will also measure intention to use PrEP and actual initiation of PrEP use. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention will be acceptable and feasible and that the intervention&#xD;
      group will report higher levels of PrEP uptake, intention to use and adhere to PrEP, and&#xD;
      other variables regarding PrEP uptake, comparing baseline, post-intervention and 3 month&#xD;
      follow-up assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic among women in the US is a major public health issue and many women at high&#xD;
      risk for acquiring HIV infection are not aware of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an&#xD;
      efficacious, self-administered, woman-controlled, HIV prevention product. In 2014, the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians&#xD;
      and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued guidelines for evaluating and prescribing PrEP for women at&#xD;
      high risk for acquiring HIV. Yet, there are currently no interventions in the US to promote&#xD;
      PrEP uptake among high risk women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate an intervention to promote PrEP uptake in two&#xD;
      large metropolitan areas with local HIV rates that greatly exceed the national average but&#xD;
      with different PrEP public policy and access landscapes. The investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      theory-based, contextually relevant behavioral intervention combined with linkage to health&#xD;
      care and social services, with text message support for adherence, would be feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable and would improve PrEP uptake among high risk women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be recruited primarily via face-to-face recruitment and respondent driven&#xD;
      sampling. For respondent driven sampling, enrolled participants will be given three (3)&#xD;
      coupons to be given to women in her social network who she thinks would be interested in&#xD;
      joining the study. If the person referred attends a baseline visit, the referring participant&#xD;
      will receive $10. Assessment of eligibility will be conducted by telephone or in-person.&#xD;
      Participant initials and phone number will be recorded on the form. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled for a study visit at a day and time convenient for her. Study visits will&#xD;
      be held at UPenn School of Nursing (Philadelphia) or the New York Blood Center Project&#xD;
      Achieve office (NYC) or at a mutually agreeable location in the community that provides a&#xD;
      private place for study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the randomized trial, the investigators will conduct a study among 80 women to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Each of the two study sites will&#xD;
      enroll forty (40) women; thirty (30) participants will receive the theory-based, contextually&#xD;
      tailored education and activities intervention and ten (10) participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to the information only control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administering any study procedures women participants will participate in an&#xD;
      informed consent process. During the informed consent process research staff will explained&#xD;
      some participants will receive the education and activities intervention and some&#xD;
      participants will receive information control group. After their questions are answered and&#xD;
      participant signs the consent form, all participants will complete a computer-based baseline&#xD;
      assessment and receive a rapid HIV test. All participants (control and intervention) will&#xD;
      sign a release of information form authorizing the study team to contact the PrEP health care&#xD;
      site for the minimal information needed to assess if PrEP was prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed centrally by the project statistician, and implemented using&#xD;
      opaque sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be numbered and shipped to each study site. Balance&#xD;
      between arms will be maintained by use of randomly permutated blocks with unequal block sizes&#xD;
      of 4 and 8 (to allow for the 3:1 randomization ratio), and with stratification by site (2&#xD;
      strata). At each site, a sealed envelope will be opened, in consecutive order, indicating&#xD;
      study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completing the computer-based survey, participants randomized to the education and&#xD;
      activities intervention arm will receive an individual tailored in-person session, conducted&#xD;
      by a trained counselor/navigator (CN). Participants will also be asked to design simple&#xD;
      personalized text messages for asking about PrEP initiation and PrEP adherence reminders once&#xD;
      starting PrEP. Finally, the CN will also coordinate with the participant the best day and&#xD;
      time to schedule her four (4) follow-up phone calls. During the phone calls, the CN will&#xD;
      reinforce skills for PrEP uptake, review the action plan regarding identified vulnerability&#xD;
      factors that could interfere with PrEP uptake and reinforce strategies to access referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the information only arm will meet with the counselor/navigator to&#xD;
      review resources regarding PrEP and receive a list of providers/clinics prescribing PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the session, participants will complete a post-session computer-bases survey to assess&#xD;
      social-cognitive variables targeted in the intervention. Participants will also complete a&#xD;
      Participant's Brief Satisfaction Questionnaire to provide feedback on the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be compensated $50.00 All participants enrolled will return to the&#xD;
      study site for a three (3) month follow-up study visit to complete the computer-based survey&#xD;
      and a questionnaire evaluating her experience navigating through the process to obtain&#xD;
      provider appointment, medical assessment for PreP, prescription and taking PreP. Participants&#xD;
      will be compensated $50.00 upon completing the three (3) month follow-up study visit.&#xD;
