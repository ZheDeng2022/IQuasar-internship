      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prosodie is the study of the phenomena of accentuation and intonation (variation of pitch,&#xD;
      duration and intensity) allowing the conveyance of information related to the sense such as&#xD;
      the relief, but also the assertion, interrogation, injunction, exclamation ...&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has a role at the grammatical, emotional and pragmatic levels of communication by&#xD;
      informing about the emotional state of the speaker (sad / happy), about sex and identity,&#xD;
      about the type of statement (question / affirmation) and about the borders in the sentences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The auditory cues that play a role in the perception of prosody include changes in the&#xD;
      fundamental frequency F0 (ie vibrational frequency of the speaker's vocal cords) during a&#xD;
      speech, the duration of the syllables, or the rate or intensity of the speech. [Di Christo&#xD;
      2013] The cochlear implant is a device for auditory rehabilitation. Its principle is to&#xD;
      transform the analog signals recorded by a microphone into digital signals that directly&#xD;
      stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve through electrodes inserted into the cochlea. [HAS&#xD;
      2012, HAS 2007, http://www.has-sante.fr] Cochlear implants are indicated in cases of severe&#xD;
      or profound sensorineural deafness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional stimulation strategies in cochlear implants (e.g. ACE, CIS) use the place of the&#xD;
      electrode to code the frequency by sending low frequency information on the apical electrodes&#xD;
      and high frequency information on the basal electrodes. The stimulation rate of the&#xD;
      electrodes is constant. [Wilson &amp; Dorman 2008] The pitch is only partially transmitted by&#xD;
      these conventional strategies [Moore 2003; Oxenham 2008] which would explain the poor results&#xD;
      of cochlear implants in the perception of music [Bruns &amp; al. 2016; Galvin III &amp; al. 2009;&#xD;
      Veekmans &amp; al. 2009; Cooper &amp; al. 2008] and prosody [Kalathottukaren &amp; al. 2015 ; Meister et&#xD;
      al. 2011; Meister et al. 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FineHearing strategy of the MED-EL implant, the rate of stimulation on the&#xD;
      low-frequency electrodes is related to the frequency of the sound and makes it possible to&#xD;
      code the frequency information temporally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Rader &amp; al. 2016] have studied the contribution of adding to the tonotopic coding of the&#xD;
      frequency (classical strategy) a temporal coding of the information by varying the&#xD;
      stimulation rate. The results obtained show that providing this frequency information by time&#xD;
      coding makes it possible to obtain perceived pitch much closer to the expected pitch (of&#xD;
      normal-hearing) and less variability, especially at low frequencies. With fixed stimulation&#xD;
      rate (classical strategy) low frequencies are poorly coded, whereas with the variable&#xD;
      stimulation rate they are better coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FineHearing coding strategy of MED-EL with long insertion of electrode could therefore&#xD;
      make it possible to better transmit the prosody and specifically to better extract the&#xD;
      fundamental frequency F0 of the voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study The objective of the study is to evaluate if the FineHearing strategy&#xD;
      of the MED-EL implant allows to better transmit the prosody and specifically by the&#xD;
      fundamental frequency of the voice (F0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the MED-EL FineHearing strategy (with deep insertion of the electrode) allows to&#xD;
      extract prosody cues based only on the fundamental frequency F0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate differential frequency thresholds and correlation with prosodic performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the positioning of the electrode array and its effect on prosodic performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective open multicenter longitudinal study: measures will be done on the patient&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 month post-activation.&#xD;
