  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, Open-label, Multi-center, Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of Xeno-Skin® to provide temporary wound closure of severe and&#xD;
      extensive deep-partial or full-thickness burn wounds until definitive wound closure can be&#xD;
      achieved via permanent autografting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 total subjects will be enrolled. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      provide written informed consent will receive Xeno-Skin® placement at a single burn wound&#xD;
      site. The designated Xeno-Skin® product size will be placed on the burn wound following wound&#xD;
      site preparation, including necessary debridement and tangential excision as determined by&#xD;
      burn surgeon and secured in place via suturing or stapling. The remaining burn wound will be&#xD;
      covered with human cadaver allograft and treated according to local standard of care with&#xD;
      care to avoid any overlap or significant contact of the two temporary wound dressings. The&#xD;
      Investigator will assess the wounds and identify the matched pair of burn sites then the&#xD;
      treatments will be randomly assigned to the sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xeno-Skin® will remain in place until intentional removal per Investigator's direction&#xD;
      consistent with subject's overall clinical course, or if it is deemed to no longer provide&#xD;
      effective wound closure and barrier function to the wound bed. The Investigator will follow&#xD;
      local standard of care relevant to wound care and dressing changes while the Xeno- Skin® is&#xD;
      in place. Standard of care burn management will be provided by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine vital sign assessments, photography, laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and&#xD;
      urinalysis), physical exams, and adverse event monitoring will occur while Xeno-Skin® is in&#xD;
      place and for up to 1 year following initial placement. Subjects will be monitored via a&#xD;
      passive and active screening program using blood samples collected at time points throughout&#xD;
      the study period, as adapted from FDA Guidance for Industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of transmission of infectious disease is expected to be extremely low and while&#xD;
      limited human trial data are available there have been no reports of transmission of porcine&#xD;
      microorganisms to humans, and to date, there have been no adverse events (AEs) related to the&#xD;
      use of Xeno-Skin® observed or reported, and independent analysis of PERV data and medical&#xD;
      records by the Safety Review Committee has indicated no evidence of zoonotic transmission in&#xD;
      this trial.&#xD;

      Product Name: Xeno-Skin®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical Name: alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock-out (GalT-KO) porcine (Sus scrofa)&#xD;
      split-thickness skin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical Structure: Xeno-Skin® is a live biotherapeutic, split-thickness, xenotransplantation&#xD;
      skin product derived from specialized, genetically engineered (alpha 1,3&#xD;
      galactosyltransferase knockout [GalT-KO]), Designated Pathogen Free (DPF), porcine donors&#xD;
      containing live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells&#xD;
      of intact vasculature and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Indication: Xeno-Skin® is indicated for the treatment of a serious condition and&#xD;
      unmet medical need: severe and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds&#xD;
      requiring hospitalization, surgical excision, and skin grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Type: Xeno-Skin® is classified as a Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP). (Guidance to&#xD;
      Industry, Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products, Section 1.b.) Active&#xD;
      Ingredient: Live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells&#xD;
      of intact vasculature, and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Structure: Xeno-Skin® has an approximate thickness of 0.022 inches (0.55mm) and is&#xD;
      currently provided in one investigational size: approximately 5x15 cm2 (22.5g/75 cm2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation: Each lot or releasable batch of Xeno-Skin® is derived from a single source&#xD;
      animal and each batch is independently processed and tested for various adventitious agents,&#xD;
      histology, morphology, sterility, and purity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Route of Administration: Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples Dosing Regimen:&#xD;
      Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples, to provide temporary wound closure of severe&#xD;
      and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds requiring hospitalization, surgical&#xD;
      excision, and skin grafting. The amount is of temporary wound dressing is based on the depth&#xD;
      and size (TBSA) of the burn injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug's Mechanism of Action: Patients with severe burns are at high risk of mortality due to a&#xD;
      devastating sequela of complications such as increased capillary leak and release of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, infection from opportunistic pathogens, immune-compromise,&#xD;
      hypovolemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and pH imbalances, and other detrimental deviations to&#xD;
      pre-injury homeostasis as a result of a disruption in the skin barrier that contributes to&#xD;
      organ failure and often death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xeno-Skin® provides a temporary barrier against infection, helps prevent fluid loss, and&#xD;
      helps restore the functional skin barrier prior to definitive wound closure with the&#xD;
      placement of an autograft. Xeno-Skin®'s inclusion of viable epithelial, epidermal, and dermal&#xD;
      porcine cells permits revascularization of the wound bed, critical for efficient&#xD;
      re-epithelialization and wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mechanism of action closely mirrors today's clinical standard, human cadaver allograft.&#xD;
      The same progression of wound healing processes occurs in both human cadaver allograft and&#xD;
      Xeno-Skin®. This mechanism of action distinguishes Xeno-Skin® from traditional xenografts&#xD;
      products on the market today, which are terminally sterilized, rendering the cells inactive,&#xD;
      limiting their therapeutic capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Packaging: Each Xeno-Skin® product is individually packaged in a clear plastic,&#xD;
      externally threaded, 10-ml polypropylene vial with threaded seal-cap, stored on a rolled,&#xD;
      sterile nylon mesh backing on the dermal-side of the Xeno-Skin® product that serves to&#xD;
      support and protect the graft during processing and transport. Within this container, each&#xD;
      Xeno-Skin® product is individually immersed in 7-ml of sterile cryoprotective medium with 5%&#xD;
      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (CryoStor CS5, BioLifeSolutions). Source animal serum is NOT&#xD;
      included or used in this process. The contents are cryopreserved via controlled rate, phase&#xD;
      freezer and stored at -80o C until use. All packaging materials are removed prior to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure and dressing placement.&#xD;
