  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with NSCLC who have been&#xD;
      previously treated for a minimum of 12 weeks with any PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
      This is a phase 1b/2, multi-center, open label study designed to assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of grapiprant in combination with pembrolizumab, to determine the recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) with pembrolizumab, and to evaluate disease response with grapiprant&#xD;
      based on investigator assessments. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and response biomarkers&#xD;
      will also be assessed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Based on the totality of the generated combined safety and efficacy data in the interim period,&#xD;
    the company decided to terminate the combination study in NSCLC patients. There are no subjects&#xD;
    on study drug at this time or in the EOT Follow-up period.&#xD;
