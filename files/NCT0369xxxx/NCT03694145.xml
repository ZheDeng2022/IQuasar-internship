  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the results of a deep learning approach to diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy assessment with results from (1) an in-person examination with an&#xD;
      ophthalmologist, and (2) the assessments of optometrists involved in a teleretinal screening&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study represents the third aim of a grant with five aims. The study will compare and&#xD;
      evaluate the predictive accuracy of: (a) machine learning models developed to grade diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy and assess the presence or absence of diabetic macular edema and (b) the&#xD;
      assessments of optometrist readers, both from digital retinal images, against standard of&#xD;
      care dilated retinal examinations by board-certified ophthalmologists and/or&#xD;
      retinal-specialty fellows for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a Los Angeles County reading&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, the investigators will recruit 300-500 eligible diabetic patients for&#xD;
      in-person eye examinations performed by board certified ophthalmologists and/or&#xD;
      retinal-specialty fellows at Los Angeles County reading centers. The study will take place&#xD;
      over the course of two visits: a teleretinal screening and an in-person eye examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-person dilated eye examinations that the study participants will participate in and be&#xD;
      compensated for follow the usual standard of care that patients receive in a setting that&#xD;
      does not utilize teleretinal screening. Yearly dilated eye examinations are standard of care&#xD;
      for all persons with diabetes.&#xD;

        The study population comprises patients with Type I or Type II diabetes who are normally&#xD;

          -  Patients diagnosed with Type I or Type II Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are over the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not previously been seen in the current year by the LACDHS&#xD;
             Teleretinal Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and Reading Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose teleretinal screening exam images yield readable results&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gestational diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been seen in the current year by LACDHS's Teleretinal&#xD;
             Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and Reading Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose teleretinal screening exam images do not yield readable results, as&#xD;
             gradable images are needed for later comparison against ophthalmologist reads.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously eligible patients who do not return for an in-person eye exam within 3&#xD;
             months of receiving a teleretinal screening (In order for the results of the&#xD;
             teleretinal screening and in-person eye examinations to yield similar information,&#xD;
             patients who do not return for their in-person eye exam within 3 months of their&#xD;
             teleretinal screening will not be able to remain in the study. This is because&#xD;
             significant eye changes not documented by the teleretinal screening may occur after a&#xD;
             3-month period).&#xD;
