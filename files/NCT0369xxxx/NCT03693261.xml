      We hypothesize that human epicardial fat plays a thermogenic role to the myocardium. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that epicardial fat may express genes of brown fat and thyroid function that are&#xD;
      down-regulated by the presence of coronary artery disease. Because the postulated metabolic&#xD;
      role of the epicardial fat, we also hypothesize that the gene expression of these regulatory&#xD;
      thermogenic factors is higher in epicardial than subcutaneous fat&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cross-sectional study conducted over a one-year period in patients with or&#xD;
      without coronary artery disease who require elective cardiac surgery regardless their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group will be formed by 50 patients with clinically and angiographically established&#xD;
      CAD who will undergo coronary artery bypass graft, as part of their standard medical care.&#xD;
      Control group will be formed by 10 subjects, randomly selected, who will undergo cardiac&#xD;
      surgery for aortic or mitral valve replacement as part of their standard medical care (these&#xD;
      patients have no history, clinical signs of CAD, and show normal coronary arteries on&#xD;
      coronary angiography).&#xD;

      Our previous studies indicate that epicardial fat, the visceral fat depot of the heart, plays&#xD;
      a role in modulating the heart morphology and its function (Iacobellis et al 2005). Notably,&#xD;
      no muscle fascia divides the epicardial fat and the myocardium and the two tissues share the&#xD;
      same microcirculation (Iacobellis et al 2005). Epicardial fat has peculiar biochemical&#xD;
      properties and is actively involved in lipid and energy homeostasis. Epicardial fat is also a&#xD;
      source of several bioactive molecules that might directly influence the myocardium and&#xD;
      coronary arteries (Iacobellis et al, 2005,). Because of its anatomic proximity to the&#xD;
      myocardium and its intense paracrine and metabolic activity, it is suggested that epicardial&#xD;
      fat cytokines reach the myocardium through paracrine or vasocrine pathways and consequently&#xD;
      modify its function. Given all these effects and properties, epicardial fat is&#xD;
      pathophysiologically and clinically related to development and progression of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease and atherosclerosis, regardless of obesity (Iacobellis 2010). Additionally,&#xD;
      epicardial fat directly correlates with the intramyocardial lipid content, as we recently&#xD;
      described (Malavazos 2010), suggesting a real interaction between the two tissues. However, a&#xD;
      dichotomous role has been actually attributed to the epicardial fat. In fact, under&#xD;
      physiological conditions epicardial fat displays cardioprotective effects (Iacobellis 2009)&#xD;
      and potentially energetic and thermogenic properties, as brown fat (Sacks 2009). Although the&#xD;
      interpretation of this finding is still unclear, expression of uncoupling protein1 (UCP1), a&#xD;
      marker of brown fat, has been found in human epicardial fat and significantly higher than in&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat. We know that brown fat generates heat in response to cold temperatures and&#xD;
      activation of the autonomic nervous system under the direct control of thyroid hormones&#xD;
      (Bianco 2011). Although the interest in brown fat in humans is growing, our understanding of&#xD;
      its actual role in humans is still unclear. The heart is a highly demand organ, under the&#xD;
      metabolic control of the thyroid and possibly the epicardial fat. Interestingly experimental&#xD;
      models show that hypoxia induces type 3 deiodinase (D3) overexpression in the myocardium that&#xD;
      inactivates T3 during ischemia, to protectively decrease cardiomyocytes metabolism and energy&#xD;
      expenditure (Simonides et al 2008). Epicardial fat may function like brown fat and thyroid&#xD;
      target tissue to protect and defend the myocardium and coronary artery against hypothermia&#xD;
      and chronic hypoxia. Nevertheless, whether epicardial fat may have this role and whether this&#xD;
      may be affected by the presence of coronary artery disease is currently unknown. We therefore&#xD;
      hypothesize that human epicardial fat plays a thermogenic role to the myocardium. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that epicardial fat may express genes of brown fat and thyroid function that are&#xD;
      downregulated by the presence of coronary artery disease. Because the postulated metabolic&#xD;
      role of the epicardial fat, we also hypothesize that the gene expression of these regulatory&#xD;
      thermogenic factors is higher in epicardial than subcutaneous fat. These hypotheses will be&#xD;
      tested as follows:Specific Aims Ia)Does human epicardial fat express makers of brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue, such UCP1 and brown adipocyte differentiation transcription factors in subjects with&#xD;
      and without coronary artery disease?b)Does human epicardial fat express type 2 and type 3&#xD;
      deiodinase, thyroid hormones and 3 adrenergic receptors in subjects with and without coronary&#xD;
      artery disease?c)Is the thermoregulatory function of the human epicardial fat correlated to&#xD;
      the presence and severity of coronary artery disease? Specific Aims IIa)Does the expression&#xD;
      of brown fat and thyroid markers gene expression is higher in epicardial than subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat?b)Does epicardial fat thickness, as measured by echocardiography, correlate with the gene&#xD;
      expression of brown adipose tissue and thyroid markers?c)Does epicardial fat thickness, as&#xD;
      measured by echocardiography, correlate with the presence and severity of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease?&#xD;

      Adipose tissue will be collected during the cardiac surgery. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT)&#xD;
      biopsy samples (average 0.5-1.0 g) will be taken by cardiac surgeon after anesthesia, before&#xD;
      heparin administration, near the proximal tract of the right coronary artery. Each tissue&#xD;
      sample will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 Â°C until analysis in a&#xD;
      freezer . The subcutaneous fat tissue (SAT) will be harvested at the site of the thoracic&#xD;
