  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of Acute Pain Service (APS), 1985, specialized pain management could be&#xD;
      offered to the inpatient care. An example of this is patient-controlled analgesia (PCA),&#xD;
      which is a technique that is used mostly after surgery. A PCA pump is an electronic pump that&#xD;
      is prepared with pain relief medicine, usually an opioid, which is administered either&#xD;
      epidural or intravenously. PCA pumps are programmed with medical protocols. For prevent&#xD;
      overdose, there are blocking times between possible bolus doses and a maximum dose per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Cochrane review from 2015, PCA have shown to be more beneficial for the patient&#xD;
      especially when it comes to patient satisfaction, compared to conventional pain relief where&#xD;
      nurses administer pain relief on request. The authors could also demonstrate that patients&#xD;
      experience less pain and were more satisfied with patient-controlled analgesia. However,&#xD;
      studies have showing limitations in the ease of practice of the PCA pumps, which indicates&#xD;
      need for further development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today the major part of the documentation in the Swedish healthcare is computerized. Using&#xD;
      digital systems that communicate with each other should be seen as a matter of course.&#xD;
      Instead, a human intermediator is commonly used where documentation is performed by pencil&#xD;
      and paper. Due to the human factor that may affect the interpretation of the information the&#xD;
      patient safety is placed at risk. The elimination of the human intermediator could lead to a&#xD;
      safer transfer of information. There are already studies concerning computerized PCA pumps&#xD;
      and wireless communication by medical devices, but only studies that are conducted outside of&#xD;
      Europe and studies with the technical aspect in focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that wireless communication by medical devices in the nursing setting can&#xD;
      provide support for prioritization and increase the patient safety. However, the field of&#xD;
      research lacks of knowledge when it comes to the patients' and nurses' experience of using&#xD;
      PCA pumps with wireless communication system. Due to today's research field, further studies&#xD;
      will be needed to investigate how documentation can be safeguarded and how accessible&#xD;
      information regarding patients' need for pain relief can be linked to prescribed treatment.&#xD;
      This may also lead to the development of nurses' way of work with patient-controlled and&#xD;
      epidural pain relief in the postoperative pain management.&#xD;

      Investigators will conduct a prospective intervention study including both nurses and&#xD;
      patients in the study group. A web-based questionnaire will be used to collect the data from&#xD;
      the participators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the study group consisting of nurses will be registered nurses working&#xD;
      in one of the two surgical wards included in the study. The nurses shall also have education&#xD;
      and experience of working with PCA pumps and accepted participation in the study. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the nurses' group are lack of education and experience in working with PCA pumps&#xD;
      and lack of basic knowledge in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for patients are adult patients over 17 yrs., both men and women who has&#xD;
      been prescribed a PCA pump for postoperative pain management and accepted participation in&#xD;
      the study. Exclusion criteria for the patient group are patients under 18 yrs., old,&#xD;
      inability to carry out the survey, neuropsychiatric or psychiatric disease, non-Swedish&#xD;
      speaking and drug abuser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of the wards included in the study uses PCA pump, , Smiths medical modell CADD Solis.&#xD;
      Only one of the wards will use the wireless monitoring platform, , Smiths medical modell CADD&#xD;
      Solis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group; ward with PCA pumps using the wireless monitoring platform. Control&#xD;
      group; ward using regularly PCA pumps. The patients' survey includes questions regarding&#xD;
      satisfaction, participation and user-friendliness of the PCA pump. Patients will fill in the&#xD;
      survey after completion of PCA treatment. Investigators intend to investigate if there is any&#xD;
      difference in time of treatment between the intervention- and control group and if there is&#xD;
      an ability to individualize patients' pain relief based on improved monitoring as well as the&#xD;
      possibility of follow-up and quality work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurses' survey includes questions regarding the experience of monitoring and&#xD;
      documentation work regarding PCA treatment. Nurses will fill in a questionnaire consisting of&#xD;
      6 questions after each work shift where they have treated one or more patient(s) with a PCA&#xD;
      pump. Data analysis will take place in a computer program for statistical analysis. All data&#xD;
      collected during the course of the study will be unidentified and the result will be&#xD;
      presented at group level without the risk of tracking data to one individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The study population size is based on a p-value 0.05 for statistical significance&#xD;
      and 80 % power analysis, which generates need for at least 39 participants in each group.&#xD;
      With an estimated 10 % non-response rate, investigators need 45 participants in each group&#xD;
      consisting in a total of 90 patients. The estimated study time is 40 weeks depending on how&#xD;
      many PCA pumps that will be prescribed throughout the study. The study estimates to start in&#xD;
      November 2017.&#xD;
