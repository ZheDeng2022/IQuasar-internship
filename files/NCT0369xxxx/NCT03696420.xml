  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After having included the most improved patients by DBS among those implanted in Bordeaux&#xD;
      Hospital University, and having defined the most active plots on tremor by its prospective&#xD;
      grading on Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scale and accelerometry, coordinates of active plots and&#xD;
      landmarks will be calculated on post-operative imaging. Association between landmarks and&#xD;
      active plots coordinates will be modelled with machine-learning algorithms. The aim is to&#xD;
      retrieve the position of the VIM on the basis of the landmarks coordinates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intermedius ventralis nucleus of the thalamus (VIM), which represents the target for deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation (DBS) in essential tremor, still remains invisible to imaging in spite of&#xD;
      the development of new MR sequences. The coordinates currently used in the classical (ACPC)&#xD;
      system are so imprecise that per-operative electrophysiology is mandatory to locate the exact&#xD;
      position of this target. Micro-electrode recordings (MER) however improve hemorrhagic risk&#xD;
      and may be poorly tolerated by patients operated on 7 to 8 hours under local anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Based on litterature review, no one tried to retrieve the position of the VIM from anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks coordinates in the era of MRI. The patients operated will be clinically tested to&#xD;
      define those very well improved by the stimulation. Stimulation efficacy will be assessed by&#xD;
      comparing the clinical evaluation (FTM scale) with and without stimulation, and the four&#xD;
      contacts of each electrode will be tested clinically, with an accelerometer and an&#xD;
      electromyography to determine which one is the most active on tremor. Coordinates of the&#xD;
      anatomical landmarks will be calculated on the pre-operative MRI and those of the active&#xD;
      plots on the fusion between post-operative CT-scan and pre-operative MRI. These coordinates&#xD;
      will be analysed by machine-learning algorithms to create a model predicting the position of&#xD;
      the active contacts from the coordinates of the landmarks.&#xD;
