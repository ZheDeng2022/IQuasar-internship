  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor treatment may benefit patients with endometrial&#xD;
      cancer (EC) based on the following observations: 1) an overwhelming presence of PD-1 in ECs;&#xD;
      2) the well-known effect of obesity which activates pro-inflammatory white blood cells and&#xD;
      promotes the development of ECs; and 3) the high prevalence of a specific gene pattern (ie,&#xD;
      microsatellite instability hypermutated [MSI high]) among ECs that may be particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to this class of drugs. To identify potential biomarkers of response to PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors in EC, we will conduct a window of opportunity study of pembrolizumab in 20&#xD;
      patients with clinical stage 1, grade 3 EC, encompassing endometrioid, serous and clear cell&#xD;
      histologies. Eligible patients will undergo a research biopsy for collection of fresh tissue&#xD;
      at the time of enrollment, in addition to the routinely performed endometrial biopsy that led&#xD;
      to the diagnosis of their cancer. Patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab (200&#xD;
      mg IV) prior to undergoing their scheduled hysterectomy with surgical staging three weeks&#xD;
      later. As per standard of care, adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin will be&#xD;
      recommended after hysterectomy/surgical staging for women with endometrioid tumors and stage&#xD;
      III disease or women with serous/clear cell tumors at all stages of disease. However, in this&#xD;
      study pembrolizumab will be added to adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin for EC.&#xD;
      Pre-treatment endometrial biopsy specimens (fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
      embedded (FFPE)) and a post-treatment hysterectomy specimen (fresh frozen tissue and FFPE)&#xD;
      will be collected for translational studies. Blood, fecal and vaginal samples will be&#xD;
      collected pre-treatment, at the time of surgery and following 3 cycles of adjuvant&#xD;
      pembrolizumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to measure the change in number and phenotype of&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including delineation of effector and regulatory T cells,&#xD;
      before and after one cycle of pembrolizumab treatment. Other correlative secondary objectives&#xD;
      include investigation of associations among pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and&#xD;
      change in number and phenotype of TILs with samples collected after pembrolizumab treatment&#xD;
      between MSI and DNA polymerase (POLE) ultramutated ECs versus MSI low/stable ECs versus copy&#xD;
      number high (CNH) ECs, among others. To assess the complex interplay between obesity,&#xD;
      molecular subtype, the microbiome and immune regulation, gut, vaginal and uterine microbiota&#xD;
      profiles will be characterized and potential associations with body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      pre-treatment TIL numbers, clonality of TILs and change in the number and phenotype of TILs&#xD;
      will be investigated. Secondary clinical objectives include (1) of the pathologic response&#xD;
      rate after one cycle of pembrolizumab following hysterectomy and surgical staging in stage&#xD;
      I/II, serous/clear cell EC and stage III, G3 (serous, clear cell or endometrioid histologies)&#xD;
      EC and (2) characterization of the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab pre-hysterectomy and in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant therapy for EC.&#xD;
