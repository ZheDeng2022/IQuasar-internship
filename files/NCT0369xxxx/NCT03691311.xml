      This is a biomarker study designed to test in patients the preclinically generated hypothesis&#xD;
      of anti-tumoral activity of denosumab.The main objective is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      antiproliferative and/or pro-apoptotic activity of denosumab in early breast cancer. Other&#xD;
      endpoints are to correlate denosumab activity with RANK and RANKL expressions through mRNA&#xD;
      and protein; to characterize the differential antiproliferative activity of denosumab between&#xD;
      different phenotypes of breast cancer; to identify biomarkers, to identify global changes in&#xD;
      gene expression and validate the activity of RANKL antibody in clinical samples. A total of&#xD;
      60 patients with early breast cancer (Stages I and II) candidates to tumor excision as first&#xD;
      therapeutic approach will be randomized 2:1, a treatment arm that will receive two doses of&#xD;
      denosumab following diagnosis, and a control arm that will not receive treatment. At least 24&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor negative breast cancer and 24 premenopausal patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
