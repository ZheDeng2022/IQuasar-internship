      Evaluate if adding expiratory muscle strength training to traditional voice therapy for&#xD;
      individuals with dysphonia due to glottal insufficiency improves maximal expiratory pressure,&#xD;
      acoustic and aerodynamic measures (i.e. amplitude, maximum phonation time, peak expiratory&#xD;
      flow), and voice related quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Voice Handicap Index</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is quality of life assessment tool quantifying perception of the impact of their vocal disorder on various aspects of lifestyle. It is 30-questions in length and is divided into 3 subscales including emotional, physical, and functional, divided into 10 questions each. Each question scored from 0-4. Total score range from 0-120. Higher score indicates increased handicap.</description>

    <description>EMST150 used at 75% of their maximum expiratory pressure. Participants will be directed to perform 5 sets of 5 breaths, 5 days per week, for 5 weeks, at the pressure threshold established in therapy. Maximum expiratory pressure will then be determined at the beginning of each therapy session and recalibration of the device will be performed if indicated.</description>
