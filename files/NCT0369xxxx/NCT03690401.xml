  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how bone density and body composition changes after a&#xD;
      cancer patient completes treatment and through 12-weeks post-treatment. Patients who enroll&#xD;
      in the 12-week exercise program, Moving On, and those that do not elect to participate in the&#xD;
      Moving On program will both be tracked, with assessments including SOZO measurements, DEXA&#xD;
      scan (bone density and whole body composition), performance status tests, food log, urine&#xD;
      color test, and other study assessments.&#xD;

      This is an observational, prospective, parallel-arm device use study. 50 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The study will look at the changes in the participants body&#xD;
      composition post cancer treatment using the SOZO device. The SOZO device is intended to&#xD;
      estimate the following body composition parameters: Fluid status (TBW, ECF, ICF), Total body&#xD;
      composition (fat free mass, fat mass, % of weight), Metabolic report (active tissue mass,&#xD;
      extracellular mass, basal metabolic rate), Skeletal muscle mass, Phase angle, Body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), Weight, and Hydration index (Hy-Dex) analysis. Participants will have 5 study visits&#xD;
      during 12 weeks where SOZO measurements will be taken as well as other study measurements.&#xD;

    <description>Participants' body composition will be estimated using a SOZO device at 5 different time points over 12 weeks. Participant will also complete questionnaires and physical assessments during each study visit. These include waist &amp; hip measurements, weight/BMI, brief fatigue inventory, timed up and go test, 6 minute walk test, cancer distress assessment, ECOG performance status, hand grip strength test, and 3-day food diary. DEXA scans will be performed before treatment and after completion of treatment. Moving On assessments will be performed at first and last study visits.</description>

    <description>SOZO device will estimate fluid status, total body composition, metabolic report, skeletal muscle mass, phase angle, body mass index, weight, and hydration index analysis. Participants will be asked to fast for at least 8 hours before each visit, but water may be consumed to ensure they are well-hydrated. Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample at each visit and to report the color of your urine to the staff so they can determine how well hydrated the participants are. If not hydrated to the extent needed, participants will be asked to drink water and repeat the urine sample again after 30 minutes. A total of 5 SOZO measurements will be recorded over 12 weeks.</description>

Where DEXA cannot be collected on the same day as other study assessments, Weight/BMI, Urine Color, and SOZO should all be collected (or repeated if already done) to coincide with the DEXA scan if SOZO is available at DEXA location.</description>
