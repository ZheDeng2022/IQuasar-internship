      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of HER2-CAR T cells in treating&#xD;
      patients with cancer that has spread to the brain or leptomeninges and has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). HER2-CAR T cells delivered into the ventricles of the brain may recognize and&#xD;
      kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D) of intraventricularly&#xD;
      administered memory-enriched autologous HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells (HER2-chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor [CAR] T cells) - either HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ TCM in Arm 1, or HER2(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+&#xD;
      TN/MEM in Arm 2 - in participants with brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases from HER2&#xD;
      positive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood for HER2-CAR T cell persistence and&#xD;
      endogenous immune system activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe changes in cytokine levels in the CSF and peripheral blood. III. Describe&#xD;
      changes in circulating tumor cells in the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. In study participants who complete at least the first three cycles of HER2-CAR T cell&#xD;
      infusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Describe the CNS clinical benefit defined as disease response rate based on Response&#xD;
      Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) criteria (stable disease [SD], partial response&#xD;
      [PR], or complete response [CR] in the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVb. Describe the systemic clinical benefit based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVc. Estimate the median central nervous system (CNS) progression-free and overall survival&#xD;
      rates (mPFS and mOS), (newly diagnosed versus recurrent metastases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. In study participants who undergo tumor resection or biopsy during or after study&#xD;
      treatment or upon autopsy, evaluate the tumor micro-environment for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. HER2-CAR T cell persistence. Vb. Immune cell subsets. Vc. Cytokine levels. Vd. HER2&#xD;
      antigen expression levels. VI. Use biomathematical modeling of tumor growth to evaluate&#xD;
      benefit of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive HER2-CAR T cells via intraventricular administration over 5 minutes once&#xD;
      weekly for 3 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If&#xD;
      patients continue to meet all eligibility criteria, they may receive additional cycles of&#xD;
      HER2-CAR T cells at principal investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 8, 10,&#xD;
      and 12 months, and then for up to 15 years.&#xD;

             in an enhancing brain lesion seen on brain MRI could be due to tumor progression, then&#xD;
             the participant can undergo resection or biopsy of the lesion(s) to distinguish&#xD;
             between tumor progression versus radiation necrosis. If there is histopathological&#xD;
             evidence of tumor progression, then the participant can proceed with study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY TO START CYCLE 1: Research participant does not have&#xD;
             uncontrolled seizure following surgery prior to starting the first CAR T cell dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY TO START CYCLE 1: Participants must have recovered from&#xD;
             toxicity (=&lt; grade 1) of prior therapy (excluding alopecia and peripheral neuropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY TO START CYCLE 1: Wash-out requirements (standard or&#xD;
             investigational). The required waiting period between the last dose of the most recent&#xD;
             chemotherapy agent(s) and first dose of HER2-CAR T cells is:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Four weeks for a cytotoxic chemotherapy, except for capecitabine, which will only&#xD;
                  require a 1 week waiting period from the last dose (on a dosing schedule of bid x&#xD;
                  14 days, then off x 7 days);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 6 weeks must have passed since the completion of a&#xD;
                  nitrosourea-containing chemotherapy regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least four half-lives for a targeted agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Research participant requires supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen to keep saturation greater than 95% and the situation is not expected to&#xD;
             resolve within 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Research participants with a known history of&#xD;
             congestive heart failure (CHF) or cardiac symptoms consistent with NYHA classification&#xD;

             myocarditis, myocardial infarction (MI), exposure to cardiotoxic medications or with&#xD;
             clinical history suggestive of the above must have an EKG and echocardiogram (ECHO)&#xD;
             performed within 42 days prior to registration and as clinically indicated while on&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Research participants with new symptoms of CHF, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, MI,&#xD;
                  or exposure to cardiotoxic medications must have a cardiac consultation,&#xD;
                  creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and troponin testing at pre study and as&#xD;
                  clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Research participant requires dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Research participant has uncontrolled seizure&#xD;
             activity and/or clinically evident progressive encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Failure of research participant to understand&#xD;
             the basic elements of the protocol and/or the risks/benefits of participating in this&#xD;
             phase 1 study. A legal guardian may substitute for the research participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant is unwilling to stop treatment&#xD;
             with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy during the first 3 cycles of the HER2-CAR T&#xD;
             cell study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant has a coagulopathy or bleeding&#xD;
             disorder or cannot safely discontinue anticoagulation prior to placement of a Rickham&#xD;
             reservoir&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant has a chronic or active viral&#xD;
             infection of the CNS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant has any uncontrolled illness,&#xD;
             including ongoing or active infection; participant has known active hepatitis B or C&#xD;
             infection; participants with any signs or symptoms of active infection, positive blood&#xD;
             cultures or radiological evidence of infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant is human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV) seropositive based on testing performed within 4 weeks of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant has an autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant has another active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participants with lung metastases (exception&#xD;
             may be allowed per principal investigator [PI] discretion for participants that are&#xD;
             not symptomatic from their lung metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant is unable to undergo a brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Participant is breast feeding. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with HER2-CAR T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother wants to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY SCREENING: Patient has a serious medical or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements and completion of treatment according to this protocol&#xD;
