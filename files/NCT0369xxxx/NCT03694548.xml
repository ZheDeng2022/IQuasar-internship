  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Pain is associated with morbidity and poor quality of life in patients with Sickle&#xD;
      Cell Disease (SCD). Complementary therapies, such as yoga are beneficial in patients with&#xD;
      non-SCD chronic pain conditions. Yoga was shown to be acceptable, feasible and helpful in one&#xD;
      study in acute SCD pain. The purpose of the study is to assess the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and safety of yoga for chronic pain in SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a major cause of morbidity, impaired quality of life, and healthcare utilization in&#xD;
      SCD. Yoga is beneficial in patients with non-SCD chronic pain conditions. Yoga was shown to&#xD;
      be acceptable, feasible and helpful in one study in acute SCD pain, but there are currently&#xD;
      no data on yoga for chronic pain in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 1, the study will assess the acceptability of yoga for chronic pain in SCD. The study&#xD;
      will also assess the feasibility and safety of a yoga program for adolescents with SCD and&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, the study will study the feasibility of collection of psychological and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes in a study of yoga for chronic pain in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 3, the study will explore patient acceptability of yoga and conduct a needs assessment&#xD;
      for the development of a smartphone app for yoga through qualitative interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 2 parts, Part A and Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will assess attitudes and practices related to yoga and potential acceptability of a&#xD;
      yoga program in adolescents with SCD and chronic pain (Group 1), and their parents/guardians&#xD;
      (Group 2). Up to 40 adolescents who meet inclusion criteria, and do not meet exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and their parent/guardian will be enrolled on Part A until 20 adolescents are&#xD;
      enrolled on Part B. Only one parent/guardian per adolescent participant will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will assess the feasibility and safety of a yoga program for SCD and chronic pain.&#xD;
      This program will comprise of 8 instructor-led group yoga sessions. The study will measure&#xD;
      psychological factors implicated in chronic pain, and pain-related patient-reported outcomes,&#xD;
      and assess the feasibility of collection of these outcomes. The study will also explore&#xD;
      patient acceptability of yoga through qualitative interviews and conduct a needs assessment&#xD;
      for the development of a smartphone app for yoga. Up to 20 adolescents who meet inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and do not meet exclusion criteria will be enrolled in Part B.&#xD;

        <description>The study hypothesis that the proportion of adolescent patients with SCD and chronic pain approached that consent to complete a survey to assess attitudes and practices related to yoga (Part A) will be 50% or greater.</description>
        <time_frame>Enrollment visit</time_frame>
        <population>Unable to assess outcome: As eligibility for Part A was determined based on patient response regarding presence of chronic pain, and if patients were not interested when approached to determine eligibility or potential interest in the study, we were not always able to assess if they would have met eligibility criteria. Thus, we were not able to accurately estimate the proportion of individuals with SCD and chronic pain who agreed to participate in Part A.</population>

          <population>Unable to assess outcome: As eligibility for Part A was determined based on patient response regarding presence of chronic pain, and if patients were not interested when approached to determine eligibility or potential interest in the study, we were not always able to assess if they would have met eligibility criteria. Thus, we were not able to accurately estimate the proportion of individuals with SCD and chronic pain who agreed to participate in Part A.</population>
