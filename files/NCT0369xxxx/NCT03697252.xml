  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, inpatient study to examine&#xD;
      the efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of KarXT in adult subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      DSM-5 schizophrenia who are in an acute exacerbation phase. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the efficacy of KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium&#xD;
      chloride) (xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in reducing&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult inpatients with a&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall safety and tolerability of KarXT in&#xD;
      adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. The positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion of normal functions such as hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. The negative symptoms in schizophrenia are the diminution or loss of normal functions. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

          <description>Participants received oral Capsule KarXT (xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID) in a treatment period of 5 weeks. Participants were started on a lead in dose of xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg twice a day (BID) for the first 2 days followed by xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 7).&#xD;
On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID unless the Participant was continuing to experience adverse events from the previous dose increase of xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID. All Participants who were increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, had the option to return to xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID for the remainder of the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 5</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The total score is the sum of all scales with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>

        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. The positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion of normal functions such as hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49.

        <description>The CGI-S modified asked the clinician 1 question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; The clinician's answer rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

        <population>The MITT population included all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of study medication, and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline PANSS assessment. Here, the number of participants analyzed indicates participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group.</population>

            <description>Participants received oral Capsule KarXT (xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID) in a treatment period of 5 weeks. Participants were started on a lead in dose of xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg twice a day (BID) for the first 2 days followed by xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID unless the Participant was continuing to experience adverse events from the previous dose increase of xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID. All Participants who were increased to xanomeline 125 mg/trospium 30 mg BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, had the option to return to xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg BID for the remainder of the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Negative Score at Week 5</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. The PANSS rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative system scales, and 16 general psychopathology symptom scales. The negative symptoms in schizophrenia are the diminution or loss of normal functions. Participants were rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale, with a minimum score of 7 and a maximum score of 49. A decrease in PANSS total score correlates with an improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 5</time_frame>
        <population>The MITT population included all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of study medication, and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline PANSS assessment. Here, the number of participants analyzed indicates participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group.</population>
