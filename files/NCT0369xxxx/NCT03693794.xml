  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, naturalistic study conducted according to Italian law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators are interested in observing how often Evidence Based (EB) psychosocial and&#xD;
      rehabilitative interventions are actually offered to patients in the real world clinical&#xD;
      practice of psychiatric Italian services able to deliver this kind of treatments, focusing on&#xD;
      a cohort of patients with recent onset schizophrenia, for whom delivery of integrated&#xD;
      treatments is especially recommended, treated continuously with Long Acting Injection (LAI)&#xD;
      antipsychotics. The primary objective of this study is to explore the level of implementation&#xD;
      of EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatments during a prospective 12-month period in patients&#xD;
      with recent onset schizophrenia (≤ 5 years) being treated with a LAI Antipsychotic in&#xD;
      Psychiatric Departments with expertise in the application of such interventions and to&#xD;
      describe the reasons of implementing the particular EB psychosocial intervention and the&#xD;
      clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to them. The prospective design is&#xD;
      strictly required both for allowing consistent definition and application of such&#xD;
      interventions and for describing reliably the characteristics of patients assigned to them.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to describe the reasons for the choice of the specific assigned&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention (if any) and the clinical and functional treatment outcomes of&#xD;
      patients assigned or not-assigned to EB psychosocial therapies.The assignment of a patient to&#xD;
      any particular treatment is not decided in advance by the study protocol, but falls within&#xD;
      current clinical practice. Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with schizophrenia (F20 according to ICD-10 version 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Onset of schizophrenia, defined as the first onset of symptoms that required specific&#xD;
           antipsychotic treatment or hospitalization, as derived from anamnesis or available&#xD;
           clinical documentation, not more than 5 years before study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 18 and 40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients under treatment with a LAI on the basis of physician's decision (LAI started no&#xD;
           longer than 6 months before study entry) and clinically stable (no relapse requiring&#xD;
           hospitalization or change of treatment due to clinical worsening) during the last 1&#xD;
           month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome of interest (&quot;endpoint&quot;) is percentage of patients within the total study&#xD;
      population who have been assigned to any EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatment (listed&#xD;
      below) for at least 1 month consecutively during the 12-month observation period (given the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of interventions, this is an arbitrary duration which may reliably indicate a&#xD;
      significant exposure to a given intervention). The percentage of each type of psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention delivered together with frequency of sessions and length of treatment, and the&#xD;
      reasons (categorized) given by the clinicians to justify the selected psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention as well as the clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to them&#xD;
      will be described. Patient assignment to the different interventions and their delivery will&#xD;
      be traced in the patients' clinical charts. A list of key-words to describe each intervention&#xD;
      will be provided in order to identify reliably and univocally the activities delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients assigned during the 12-months period to at least one non EB&#xD;
           intervention for at least 1 month consecutively (given the heterogeneity of&#xD;
           interventions, this is an arbitrary duration which may reliably indicate a significant&#xD;
           exposure to a given intervention) but not to any of the EB interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of relapses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  % of patients who discontinue drug treatment (for ineffectiveness, side effects or other&#xD;
           reasons and patient/physician decision) and/or psychosocial interventions (for team or&#xD;
           patient decision)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in clinical, cognitive, functional and quality of life measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Health economic information collected through 3 specific questionnaires: detection of i)&#xD;
      health resources consumption for the care of the disorder (direct costs, eg. drug cost,&#xD;
      hospitalization, emergency visits, Day hospitals, General Physician visits…) and assessment&#xD;
      of indirect costs through evaluation of : ii) patient's potential income loss, absenteeism&#xD;
      and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment due to the mental&#xD;
      illness and of iii) caregiver's potential income loss, commitment of time for the patient's&#xD;
      care, absenteeism and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment&#xD;
      because of the patient's mental illness&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Italian document Stato Regioni (an agreement between Italian Government and local&#xD;
      regions) analyses objectives indicated by the PANSM (Piano Nazionale di Azioni per la Salute&#xD;
      mentale - National Plan of Actions for Mental Health) to identify pathways of care for severe&#xD;
      mental illnesses (schizophrenia, affective disorders and severe personality disorders) which&#xD;
      should be offered by Italian Departments of Mental Health in order to reduce the variability&#xD;
      of treatments and to increase the quality of the service offered and the efficiency of&#xD;
      resource use. As for schizophrenia, it is underlined the importance that the patient is&#xD;
      offered an integrated treatment which involves a multiprofessional team and the application&#xD;
      of several clinical and psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions based on the scientific&#xD;
      evidence and guidelines recommendations. The proposal of activities should be linked to the&#xD;
      patient degree of functional impairment or disability in order to improve patient's&#xD;
      functioning and level of personal and social autonomy. This consideration is consistent with&#xD;
      the evidence that antipsychotic therapy alone, even if effective on some clinical parameters,&#xD;
      should be integrated with psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions to achieve better&#xD;
      outcomes in terms of personal and social functioning and quality of life and that&#xD;
      &quot;evidence-based&quot; (EB) psychosocial treatments (such as cognitive behaviour therapy for&#xD;
      psychosis, cognitive remediation, family psychoeducation, social skills training and&#xD;
      supported employment) are considered more effective than nonspecific and unstructured&#xD;
      interventions, which, however, are more often implemented in the psychiatric services. In a&#xD;
      Survey recently performed in Lombardia Region the frequency with which community health&#xD;
      centers offer their patients any evidence based rehabilitative intervention has been found to&#xD;
      be less than 10%, while a percentage of about 18% of subjects undergoing EB treatments&#xD;
      (including supported employment) emerged in a wider national Survey promoted by the Italian&#xD;
      Society of Psychosocial Rehabilitation (SIRP National Congress, Salerno, 2014; Italian&#xD;
      Society of Psychiatry (SIP) National Congress, Taormina, 2015). Unfortunately, transversal or&#xD;
      retrospective study designs do not allow to assess accurately the frequency of implementation&#xD;
      of specific interventions, which are differently defined and applied in different contexts,&#xD;
      and to characterize the clinical-functional features of patients assigned to any specific&#xD;
      intervention. The Stato- Regioni document underlines also the importance of proposing an&#xD;
      integrated multidisciplinary approach as soon as possible after the diagnosis of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and the crucial importance of the continuity of treatment with antipsychotics&#xD;
      from the onset of psychosis onward. Unfortunately, no data are available on the&#xD;
      implementation of EB treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the&#xD;
      early phases of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In front of the importance of offering a wide range of activities to the patient, a high&#xD;
      variability of treatments is offered in the different Italian psychiatric departments, with&#xD;
      no data available for most Italian regions and, even in the case of the more advanced&#xD;
      regions, with a low delivery rate of evidence-based psychosocial activities as compared with&#xD;
      other non-evidence-based psychosocial activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological continuity is a challenge as well. Literature data confirm the importance&#xD;
      of poor adherence which may cause not only the occurrence of relapses and re-hospitalizations&#xD;
      but also other negative outcomes for the patient, such as the inability to access and&#xD;
      maintain rehabilitative interventions and reintegration. Treatment with antipsychotics of&#xD;
      patients suffering from schizophrenia should provide a good balance between efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and acceptability for the patient to determine the continuity and the use of&#xD;
      long-acting injection (LAI) antipsychotics is an effective response to these problems,&#xD;
      ensuring better outcomes than oral treatment. In addition, drug treatment applied promptly&#xD;
      and continuously is particularly important in order to prevent relapses in the early stages&#xD;
      of schizophrenia thus limiting the functional deterioration which generally occurs within the&#xD;
      first 5-10 years after the first episode and the clinical and psychosocial deterioration&#xD;
      which occurs mostly within the first 5 years from the onset of the illness. Moreover, there&#xD;
      is evidence in the literature that treatment of first episode patients with a LAI atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic increases treatment acceptability, adherence and the rate of sustained&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given all these premises the investigators are interested in observing how often Evidence&#xD;
      Based (EB) psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions are actually offered to patients in&#xD;
      the real world clinical practice of psychiatric Italian services able to deliver this kind of&#xD;
      treatments, focusing on a cohort of patients with recent onset schizophrenia, for whom&#xD;
      delivery of integrated treatments is especially recommended, treated continuously with LAI&#xD;
      antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to explore the level of implementation of EB&#xD;
      psychosocial/rehabilitative treatments during a prospective 12-month period in patients with&#xD;
      recent onset schizophrenia (&lt; 5 years) being treated with a LAI Antipsychotic in Psychiatric&#xD;
      Departments with expertise in the application of such interventions and to describe the&#xD;
      reasons of implementing the particular EB psychosocial intervention and the&#xD;
      clinical-functional characteristics of patients assigned to these treatments. The prospective&#xD;
      design is strictly required both for allowing consistent definition and application of such&#xD;
      interventions and for describing reliably the characteristics of patients assigned to these&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to describe the reasons for the choice of the specific assigned&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention (if any) and the clinical and functional treatment outcomes of&#xD;
      patients assigned or not-assigned to EB psychosocial therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, observational, naturalistic study conducted according to Italian law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment of a patient to any particular treatment is not decided in advance by the&#xD;
      study protocol, but falls within current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional diagnostic or monitoring tools apply to individuals, with the exceptions listed&#xD;
      and allowed by the Italian legislation. The administration of questionnaires and scales is&#xD;
      accepted by Italian law regarding non-interventional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the parameters will be evaluated when available and collected for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A scientific committee approves the scientific rationale of the protocol and approves the&#xD;
      final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the protocol, the current version of the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, the guidelines of Pharmacoepidemiology, and the Italian applicable regulations.&#xD;
      According to the latter, patients will sign a written informed consent to participate. For&#xD;
      each center involved, the investigator will provide all information to the subjects involved&#xD;
      in the study in a form that the person is able to understand, and will obtain written consent&#xD;
      before the collection of personally identifiable information. The data of consenting patients&#xD;
      will be recorded in an electronic database.&#xD;
&#xD;

                reference to manuals or standardized procedures - Percentage of relapses (*) - % of&#xD;
                patients who discontinue drug treatment (for ineffectiveness, side effects or other&#xD;
                reasons and patient/physician decision) and/or psychosocial interventions (for team&#xD;
                or patient decision) - Change of the Clinical Global Impression - Schizophrenia&#xD;
                (CGI-SCH) scale score to assess the evolution of the severity of symptoms - Change&#xD;
                of the PSP (Personal and Social Performance) scale score to assess the evolution of&#xD;
                psychosocial functioning - % of PSP responders (increase of 7 points of the total&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  Score change of the scales related to patient satisfaction with treatment: MSQ&#xD;
                     (Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire) and SWN (Subjective Well Being on&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  Score change of the SCoRS (Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale) to assess the&#xD;
                     evolution of the severity of cognitive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Safety assessments including monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  In this naturalistic study, a relapse is defined as a psychiatric&#xD;
                          hospitalization or as an increase in the overall score of the CGI-SCH of&#xD;
                          at least two points when the minimum score for the patient during&#xD;
                          follow-up was 1 (normal), 2 (borderline) or 3 (mildly ill) or of 1 point&#xD;
                          when the minimum score was 4 (moderately ill), 5 (very ill), or 6&#xD;
                          (seriously ill). The increase in the CGI score must take the patient to&#xD;
                          be at least moderately ill (CGI = 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Health economic information collected through 3 specific questionnaires: detection of i)&#xD;
      health resources consumption for the care of the disorder (direct costs, eg. drug cost,&#xD;
      hospitalization, emergency visits, Day hospitals, General Physician visits…) and assessment&#xD;
      of indirect costs through evaluation of : ii) patient's potential income loss, absenteeism&#xD;
      and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment due to the mental&#xD;
      illness and of iii) caregiver's potential income loss, commitment of time for the patient's&#xD;
      care, absenteeism and presenteeism to estimate work productivity, daily activity impairment&#xD;
      because of the patient's mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      If data collected will allow, exploratory analyses will be done to compare clinical and&#xD;
      functional outcomes among the potential group stratifications which are expected to be&#xD;
      composed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patients treated with EB interventions B. Patients treated with non-EB interventions C.&#xD;
      Patients who did not receive any EB or non-EB psychosocial/rehabilitative treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria/study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen in the context of usual clinical practice and data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. This visit program remains&#xD;
      indicative, ie the intervals between visits are the usual intervals of each center and the&#xD;
      closest to the expected time assessments will be considered for the study evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economic information will be collected at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variable of interest (primary endpoint) will be the proportion of the recruited&#xD;
      patients who, in the course of the 12-month follow-up, will be assigned to at least 1 month&#xD;
      of EB psychosocial treatment/rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, reliable estimates of such proportion are not available and, in fact, this is&#xD;
      expected to be surveyed through this study. In a Survey recently performed in Lombardia&#xD;
      Region the frequency with which community health centers offer their patients any evidence&#xD;
      based rehabilitative intervention has been found to be less than 10% , while in a wider&#xD;
      national Survey about 18% of included subjects were receiving any kind of EB treatment,&#xD;
      including supported employment. No data at all are available on the implementation of EB&#xD;
      psychosocial treatments in patients treated continuously with antipsychotics in the early&#xD;
      phases of the disease. However, the investigators believe that the proportion of patients on&#xD;
      EB rehabilitative interventions in this study could be higher than those reported above. The&#xD;
      participating centres are, in fact, able to apply effective EB psychosocial interventions.&#xD;
      Moreover, the survey applies to patients in the early phases of schizophrenia (&lt; 5 years of&#xD;
      illness), i.e. a group of patients who should be assigned systematically to an integrated&#xD;
      care according to the Stato- Regioni document, and more adherent to medication since treated&#xD;
      continuously with LAI antipsychotics. As the reliability of results depends on the proportion&#xD;
      of patients on EB interventions, and as this proportion is still to be defined, the&#xD;
      investigators will use an hypothetical percentage of 50% in determining the sample size&#xD;
      needed for a given level of accuracy. This assumption will prevent the investigators from&#xD;
      having an underpowered survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen is the number of centres identified and recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Overall, in 2014, 29527 patients were in charge at those centres. Of these, 4034 (14%) had a&#xD;
      clinical presentation compatible with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20 according to ICD-10&#xD;
      version 2013) and 1462 (5%) were also being in therapy with LAI antipsychotics. On the basis&#xD;
      of these data, it is estimated that eligible patients, namely those having a history of&#xD;
      recent illness (&lt;5 years), are approximately 1000, i.e.55 per centre. According to an initial&#xD;
      feasibility assessment, it is expected that each centre could include at least 15 patients.&#xD;
      Providing a proportion of patients lost to follow-up almost irrelevant, given the ease of&#xD;
      detection of the variable of interest, this will produce a sample of prevalence of 270&#xD;
      individuals with a two-tailed 95% Confidence Interval (CI) with a margin of error of around&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and functional characteristics of patients assigned to EB psychosocial treatment&#xD;
      / rehabilitation will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analyses will be carried out by calculating the arithmetic mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (median and interquartile range for data with skewed distributions) for&#xD;
      quantitative variables, and absolute frequency and percentage for qualitative variables. In&#xD;
      addition, calculations will be made of the relevant confidence intervals (95%) for the&#xD;
      clinically relevant variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If possible, exploratory comparisons of clinical and functional variables associated with the&#xD;
      group stratifications generated naturalistically will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered into a database specifically created for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
