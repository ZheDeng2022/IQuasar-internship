      Spinal cord injury (SCI): The World Health Organization estimates an incidence of 250,000 to&#xD;
      500,000 per year worldwide. In Denmark 130 new cases of SCI per year. SCI is a devastating&#xD;
      condition: paresis/paralysis of the skeletal muscles below the injury site, partial or&#xD;
      complete inability to walk, move and/or feel. Other sequelae are: infections, lifestyle&#xD;
      diseases (cardiovascular, diabetes, nephrologic disease), mental wellbeing/suicide-risk&#xD;
      profoundly raised , quality of life, next-of-kin affection. Recovery of motor function is&#xD;
      high clinical priority and crucial for improved ADL outcomes. Strength training regimens have&#xD;
      shown improved muscle strength in healthy subjects using near-maximal voluntary effort&#xD;
      contractions, and few studies have demonstrated similar effects in a SCI population. Atrophy&#xD;
      and fatigability and spasticity may reduce practical implementation for rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Therefore, low-load blood-flow restricted exercise (BFRE) may prove beneficial as supplement&#xD;
      to traditional rehabilitation, increasing muscle strength and inducing hypertrophy in healthy&#xD;
      persons. BFRE is performed as low-intensity strength training (20-30 % of max) while&#xD;
      simultaneously involving the use of circumferential placement of cuffs during exercise, to&#xD;
      maintain arterial inflow to the muscle while preventing venous return. Based on existing&#xD;
      scientific evidence, BFRE is acknowledged as a safe regime without serious side effects.&#xD;
      Previously, the method has shown increased muscle strength and inducing skeletal muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy in addition to improvement in gait performance in individuals with various&#xD;
      diseases causing reduced mobility. Purposes of this PhD project: to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility and effects of BFRE in individuals living with the consequences of SCI.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a major health concern; the World Health&#xD;
      Organization estimates an incidence of 250,000 to 500,000 per year worldwide. On average in&#xD;
      Denmark we register 130 new cases of SCI per year. SCI is a devastating condition, in which&#xD;
      paresis/paralysis of the skeletal muscles below the injury site results in a partial or&#xD;
      complete inability to walk, move and/or feel. Concurrent to functional disabilities,&#xD;
      infections, lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases are frequent sequelae due to&#xD;
      inactivity and overweight. Affecting primarily younger and previously healthy individuals&#xD;
      traumatic SCI also profoundly impacts the mental wellbeing of the patients and also their&#xD;
      next-of-kin; quality of life (QoL) suffers and subsequently the risk of suicide for patients&#xD;
      with SCI increases by two to five times as compared to the background population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a substantial effort is being put into the rehabilitation of individuals with SCI,&#xD;
      large gaps in knowledge still exist on this area. Recovery of motor function is of high&#xD;
      clinical priority as it is fundamental for improved ADL outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While various strength training regimens have been shown to increase muscle strength in&#xD;
      neurologically intact individuals using near-maximal voluntary effort contractions, few&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated similar effects from strength training regimens in persons with&#xD;
      SCI. Complications such as atrophy and easily fatigable neuromuscular system with various&#xD;
      degrees of spasticity often make these kinds of regimes less practical and rewarding for&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Therefore, the addition of low-load blood-flow restricted exercise (BFRE) may&#xD;
      prove beneficial as a supplement to traditional rehabilitation. Notable, BFRE is found to&#xD;
      increase muscle strength and induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Typically, BFRE is performed as low-load strength training (20-30 % 1 Repetition Maximum&#xD;
      (RM)) combined with concurrent partial occlusion of limb blood flow by means of pneumatic&#xD;
      cuffs placed proximal at the limb, to restrit arterial inflow to the exercising muscle and&#xD;
      preventing venous return. Based on existing scientific evidence and applying&#xD;
      pre-exercisescreening for known risk factors such as vascular dysfunction (AD) or prior&#xD;
      history of trombosis, BFRE is acknowledged as a safe exercise regime without serious side&#xD;
      effects. Previously, the method has shown increased muscle strength and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy in addition to improvements in gait and sit-to-stand performance in individuals&#xD;
      with various diseases causing reduced mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this PhD project is to;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a pilot study for investigate the safety and feasibility of low-load BFRE&#xD;
           training in adults with SCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a RCT to investigate the effects of low-load blood-flow restricted exercise&#xD;
           (BFRE) on physical function and neuromuscular recovery in individuals with SCI&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are as following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BFRE training protocol will be safe and applicable to individuals with a spinal cord&#xD;
           injury below Th7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants randomized to active BFRE treatment will exhibit greater increases in&#xD;
           physical function and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle volume, respectively,&#xD;
           than partici-pants receiving sham BFRE. Treatment effects will be documented using&#xD;
           functional disability assessment tools combined with measurements of maximum voluntary&#xD;
           isometric muscle strength, rapid force capacity (rate of force development: RFD) and&#xD;
           cross sectional area of the trained muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants allocated to active BFRE will exhibit less neuropathic pain and reduced use&#xD;
           of analgesic medication than participants receiving sham BFRE. This will be documented&#xD;
           by standardized questionnaires and quantitative assessment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Study (Study I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will be conducted by the applicant, Anette Bach Jønsson (ABJ).&#xD;
      Consecutively, prior to the RCT, 3 individuals with a SCI will be recruited between 1/4 2020&#xD;
      - 31/7 2021 using the same recruitment strategy and in- and exclusions criteria as in the&#xD;
      RCT. Additionally, 3 in-patients with sub-acute SCI (Time since injury &gt; 1 month and &gt; 1&#xD;
      year) will be recruited. The 6 patients will follow the same initial examination and training&#xD;
      protocol as in the active BFRE group as described below. However, the training will be&#xD;
      performed twice a week for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcome measurements will be performed at pre- and postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle testing Maximum, voluntary, isometric muscle strength that participants are able to&#xD;
      exert on a portable knee dynamometer (S2P, Science to Practice, Ljubljana, Slovenia).&#xD;
      Portable dynamometers are considered as valid and reliable instruments for measuring&#xD;
      strength. Measurements of muscle torque (Nm) and Rate of Force Development (RFD, Nm/s) will&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples Blood samples will be obtained pre (30 minutes) and post (0-60 minutes) the&#xD;
      first and last training session (4 blood samples in total). In-house physicians or laboratory&#xD;
      technician will be responsible for retrieving the blood samples. Markers of coagulation&#xD;
      (fibrinogen and D-dimer), fibrinolysis [tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)] and inflammation&#xD;
      [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)] will be analyzed. The blood samples will be&#xD;
      destroyed immediately after analyzing. The results will be obtained through the electronic&#xD;
      patient record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Tolerance to the selected occlusion pressure and pain perception throughout&#xD;
      training will be obtained by using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS 0-11 point) and interview.&#xD;
      Adherence to the planned training scheme will as well be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) may be a potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      condition for people with a high injury level (Th6 and above, Tetraplegia) and may be&#xD;
      provoked by cutaneous stimulation such as pain. Therefore, patients at risk of AD will be&#xD;
      excluded and the ISCOS Autonomic Standards Assesment Form will be fulfilled before and after&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for inclusion will be approved by specialist neurologist. Training sessions are&#xD;
      coordinated with the physician-on-call. To ensure patient safety blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate will be measured throughout training and will be closely monitored. In case of serious&#xD;
      adverse events the MD on duty will be contacted immediately. During study I and II regular&#xD;
      safety meetings in the research group will be scheduled. If serious adverse events occurs in&#xD;
      study I, a reconsideration of the design of study II would be necessary (e.g. changes in&#xD;
      BFR-dosage) and further pilot testing would be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial (Study II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Initial examination After inclusion, medical history, demographic and anthropometric&#xD;
      data, spasticity level and the neurological level of SCI will be obtained. Spasticity level&#xD;
      will be measures using Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Neurological level using the&#xD;
      International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI). Information about&#xD;
      trauma date and reason, plan of standard care during hospitalization (physiotherapy,&#xD;
      occupational therapy, hydrotherapy and other physical treatments/activities) will be obtained&#xD;
      through the electronic patient record. Furthermore, functional disability assessment in&#xD;
      addition to para-clinical tests will be conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/Control Prior to the first training session, participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either active BFRE (n=14) or sham BFRE (n=14), while controlling for age and gender. BFR will&#xD;
      be performed in the aBFRE group by use of pneumatic occlusion cuffs placed proximally on the&#xD;
      thigh close to the inguinal fold, using an occlusion pressure corresponding to 40 % of seated&#xD;
      arterial occlusion pressure (AOP). The individual AOP will be documented at baseline using&#xD;
      doppler ultrasound (Siemens ACUSON S2000TM). Previous studies have shown that this pressure&#xD;
      level can promote significant muscle adaptations to a similar degree and are associated with&#xD;
      significantly less discomfort than higher occlusion pressures. The occlusion pressure of the&#xD;
      participants in sham BFRE group will be 10mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects from both groups will participate in 45 minutes of low-intensity BFRE (30-40% 1RM)&#xD;
      of the lower extremities twice/week for 8 weeks, consisting of 5 minutes light warm-up of&#xD;
      low-intensity cycling followed by 4 sets (30x15x15x15 repetitions, 45 sec pause between sets)&#xD;
      of seated leg extension and leg curl with BFR. A 3 minutes pause is allowed between exercises&#xD;
      where the cuff will be deflated. Blood pressure will be measured with a temporal resolution&#xD;
      of approx. 5 minutes throughout training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Within-group changes from baseline to follow-up will be analyzed using paired&#xD;
      parametric or nonpar-ametric methods. Between-group differences will be compared as unpaired&#xD;
      data using a parametric or nonparametric methods. The type 1 level of significance is set at&#xD;
      0.05. The results will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. According&#xD;
      to sample-size calculation with an 80 % power and 5 % level of significance a difference of&#xD;
      20 % on MVC between the active and sham BFR groups are possible to detect with 24&#xD;
      participants. A total of 28 participants will be recruited to take a 20 % dropout rate into&#xD;
      account. A difference of 20 % on MVC is expected as a realistic suggestion as a minimal&#xD;
      clinical important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical framework This PhD project has received permission from SCIWDK. The initial&#xD;
      examination and tests at baseline and follow-up will be conducted at SCIWDK's laboratory by&#xD;
      the applicant, Anette Bach Jønsson (ABJ). She is an experienced physiotherapist. Training&#xD;
      sessions will be guided and supervised by in-house physiotherapists and ABJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
