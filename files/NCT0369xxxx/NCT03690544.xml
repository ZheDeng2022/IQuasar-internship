  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pilot study using apremilast 30mg orally twice daily, for treatment of&#xD;
      RAS in males and females between 18 and 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Department of Dermatology or&#xD;
      Division of Rheumatology at Mayo Clinic Florida. Fifteen males and females with RAS will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and an 8&#xD;
      week posttreatment observational follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase will consist of: obtaining informed consent, demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, inclusion and exclusion criteria, prior and concomitant medication use,&#xD;
      adverse events; collecting vital signs and weight; performing complete physical examination&#xD;
      and limited physical examination; obtaining hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis,&#xD;
      pregnancy test and providing contraception education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 16-week treatment phase, all subjects receive apremilast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who complete the active treatment phase are to enter the 8-week posttreatment&#xD;
      observational follow-up phase.&#xD;

    <description>Apremilast is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 that works intracellularly to modulate a network of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. PDE 4 is a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory response by modulating the expression of TNF-alfa, IL-23, IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines. Cyclic AMP also modulates levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Apremilast has immunomodulatory activity and, therefore, has the potential to be effective in the treatment of RAS.</description>
