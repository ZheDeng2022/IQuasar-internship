    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a health coaching intervention that&#xD;
      includes exercise, good dietary habits, and good relaxation methods helps overweight men&#xD;
      improve health and lose weight. The investigator's hope is to enroll 30 men in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Health coaching helps patients gain the knowledge, skills, tools and confidence to become&#xD;
      active participants in their care so that they can reach self-identified health goals. Health&#xD;
      coaching: 1) provides self-management support, 2) bridges gaps between health professionals&#xD;
      and patients, 3) helps patients navigate the health care system, 4) offers emotional support,&#xD;
      and 5) serves as a continuity figure. The intervention will consist of tailored health&#xD;
      coaching, goal setting, and behavioral contracting for healthy actions to create a supportive&#xD;
      context for participants that supports health promoting behaviors (HPBs), with efforts to&#xD;
      enhance HPB reinforcement through established networks. After baseline assessment, the men&#xD;
      will participate in a 45-minute educational meeting with the principal investigator (PI) to&#xD;
      discuss self-reported measures from baseline instruments and the importance of health&#xD;
      promoting behaviors (HPBs) to overall heart health. Afterwards, a research study team&#xD;
      (research trained undergraduate and graduate student assistants) will perform case management&#xD;
      and health advisement (bi-weekly continuity phone calls 2x / month) to support protocol&#xD;
      adherence and tracking of participant goals over a period of 120 days. The research team will&#xD;
      be guided by a coaching manual created for the purposes of the study. The M for H study will&#xD;
      also create and provide health-oriented emails (2x / week), daily tracking text messaging on&#xD;
      weekdays, monthly face-to-face coaching group meetings during community-based organization&#xD;
      (CBO) set times (i.e. meetings, events), and access to an optional social media platform&#xD;
      supporting peer interactions. After 120 days, participants will be reassessed to determine&#xD;
      impacts related physical activity (PA) measures, knowledge, attitudes, &amp; practices (KAPs),&#xD;
      and interviewed to discuss M for H feasibility and acceptability. The targeted outcome for&#xD;
      the 120 day period will be improvement toward the performance of &gt;150 minutes of moderate to&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity accumulated as indicated by accelerometry, increase in distance&#xD;
      walked during a six (6) minute walk test, and improvement in theoretical construct measures&#xD;
      indicative of performance of HPBs among participants.&#xD;
