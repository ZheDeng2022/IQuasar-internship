      The objective of this study is to determine the effect on quality of care when introducing&#xD;
      smart technology in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery. Patients who consent to&#xD;
      take part in the study, receive a box containing two smartphone compatible ECG monitors, an&#xD;
      oxygen saturation monitor, a weight scale, a thermometer, an activity tracker and a blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor. They will be followed up by replacing one of the outpatient clinic visits&#xD;
      by an e-consult, in which a patients does not have to go to the hospital. Instead, he or she&#xD;
      will talk with his or her doctor or nurse practitioner via a secured video connection. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the study will be the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation within 3 months&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past five years, smartphone compatible detectors of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      parameters have been released on the consumers market. Examples of these include heart rate&#xD;
      monitors, ECG monitors, blood pressure monitors, activity trackers and fat percentages&#xD;
      monitors. These monitors have often been validated and are CE-marked for use in the European&#xD;
      Union within their intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications implicate that home monitoring with such consumer devices might improve&#xD;
      quality of care. A study by Bosworth et al. in patients with hypertension showed that&#xD;
      increased monitoring and subsequent treatment led to a better controlled blood pressure in&#xD;
      patients who were treated for hypertension. Another study, which is currently being carried&#xD;
      out at the LUMC, is investigating whether patients benefit from a smart technology&#xD;
      intervention after they had a myocardial infarction. Preliminary (unpublished) results show&#xD;
      that clinical outcomes are similar, with higher patient satisfaction. Cost analyses show that&#xD;
      there is a cost reduction per patient with smart technology follow-up. Therefore, smart&#xD;
      technology could be a useful tool to improve patient monitoring and therefore patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are discharged after they underwent cardiovascular surgery are at risk to&#xD;
      develop one or more of three most seen late complications: sternal wound infection, cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation or rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation. This is not always&#xD;
      detected before those patients are discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery return to the outpatient clinic 14&#xD;
      days and three months after discharge. They are seen by a specialist nurse or cardiologist,&#xD;
      who will perform a general check-up and inspect the sternal wound. An echocardiogram will be&#xD;
      performed before the three-month visit. If there is suspicion for a rhythm disturbance on the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visit, the cardiologist might decide to perform Holter monitoring during 24&#xD;
      hours. As this is a small window of time, not all rhythm disturbances will be diagnosed.&#xD;
      Smart technology is hypothesized to increase the chances of diagnosing rhythm disturbances.&#xD;
      In the case of sternal wound infection and cardiac decompensation, smart technology may show&#xD;
      a declining trend before a patient visits the outpatient clinic, which can lead to early&#xD;
      detection and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small pilot study by McElroy et all found that after cardiovascular surgery, both the&#xD;
      patient as well as the health care team are highly satisfied with added smart technology, due&#xD;
      to the ease of use of the technology and platform. There was a main focus on readmission&#xD;
      rates, which did not differ between the groups. However the trend shows an increase in&#xD;
      diagnosing atrial fibrillation (15,4 vs 29,6%), sternal wound infection or cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation were not studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no other study has yet looked into diagnosing late complications after&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgery with the help of smart technology. It is hypothesized that smart&#xD;
      technology could help diagnose the main three diagnoses mentioned above early on and with&#xD;
      that, improve quality of care in patients after cardiovascular surgery. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      study, the clinical effectiveness of a smart technology intervention is investigated in&#xD;
      patients who have underwent cardiovascular surgery at the department of Thoracic Surgery at&#xD;
      Leiden University Medical Center.&#xD;
