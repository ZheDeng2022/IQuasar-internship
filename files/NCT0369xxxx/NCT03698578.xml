      Introduction: Evidence indicates that muscle damage caused by exercise can lead to&#xD;
      functional, biochemical and clinical damage. Therefore, it is pertinent to perform&#xD;
      investigations related to the muscle damage marker, creatine kinase with clinical and&#xD;
      functional responses. These outcomes encompass an intrinsic potential for understanding the&#xD;
      real magnitude of interpretation of classic signals in athletic environments and monitoring&#xD;
      of athletes, contributing to specific actions. Objective: To verify the correlation between&#xD;
      clinical signs (pain and perception of recovery), functional (muscular strength) and the&#xD;
      behavior of CK levels, in the moments following a simulated fight. METHODS: Six male&#xD;
      parajiu-jitsu practitioners (34-44 years) were included in the study. The participants&#xD;
      attended the collection site 4 times, with a 24-hour interval between sessions,&#xD;
      characterizing the following collection moments: baseline, post-exertion, 24, 48 and 72 hours&#xD;
      after the simulated fight. Data on pain (visual analogue scale - EVA), perception of recovery&#xD;
      (Likert Scale), muscle strength (Dynamometry) and blood samples for CK analysis were&#xD;
      collected. All parameters described were measured at all times of collection. For the&#xD;
      analysis of the association between behavior of CK levels, clinical and functional variables,&#xD;
      the Odds Ratio test and 95% confidence interval were used. For the gross values, the Pearson&#xD;
      test was used according to the normality of the data.&#xD;

      Participants will be intentionally allocated into two groups, G1 consisting of professional&#xD;
      athletes and G2 consisting of amateur athletes. This division was carried out to guarantee&#xD;
      homogeneous stratification between participants with level of conditioning and similar&#xD;
      training. The anonymity of the participants will be guaranteed. There will be masking of the&#xD;
      participants, investigator and evaluator of the results that were blind to the hypotheses and&#xD;
      allocation in groups, adopted in the study. All participants regularly attended the same&#xD;
      training center and no sports injuries that might compromise athletic performance will be&#xD;
      reported during the survey.&#xD;
