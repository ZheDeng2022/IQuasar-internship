      Investigate myelin alterations in patients with neurosurgical diseases&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While a number of advanced imaging techniques, notably magnetization transfer, diffusion&#xD;
      tensor and quantitative T1 and T2 imaging (MTI, DTI, qT1 and qT2, respectively), have been&#xD;
      used previously to study white matter in neurosurgical diseases, these methods provide only&#xD;
      indirect, non-specific information related to myelin content. For example, these modalities&#xD;
      can tell when there is swelling that is affecting the movement of water, which may be&#xD;
      indicative of a process that would affect myelin, but they cannot tell us specific&#xD;
      information about the amount of myelin surrounding a nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose using a MRI sequence, mcDESPOT (multicomponent driven equilibrium&#xD;
      potential of T1 and T2) that utilizes a computer model that takes T1 and T2 sequences and&#xD;
      derives a quantitative value for the myelin content in the myelin sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present program, the investigators propose adding the mcDESPOT sequence to the MRI&#xD;
      scanner in accordance with the MRI manufacturer's technical requirements. When this sequence&#xD;
      is added, the normal sequences are done first and mcDESPOT is done last. Although the&#xD;
      sequences obtained for mcDESPOT are sequences used in clinical practice, the flip-angles are&#xD;
      changed so that they cannot be read like a traditional image. Rather, the data have to be&#xD;
      post-processed by a computer in order to be able to derive myelin information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McDESPOT is a 10 minute sequence that can be added to any MRI scanner. It is a obtained from&#xD;
      standard T1 and T2 sequences.&#xD;
