  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an Interactive Computer-based&#xD;
      Intervention to enhance safe sex practice among female university students. Based on Health&#xD;
      Belief Model, the intervention comprising: (1) personalized perceived susceptibility and&#xD;
      perceived severity of STIs and cervical cancer; (2) perceived benefits and perceived barriers&#xD;
      of safe sex practice via knowledge- based information; (3) cue to action via the local&#xD;
      resources; and (4) self-efficacy via narrative stories, which are tailored for female&#xD;
      university students, to communicate safe sex messages. The investigators hypothesised that&#xD;
      the intervention will enhance consistency of condom use, knowledge, attitude, norms,&#xD;
      self-efficacy towards condom use, sexual consent, sexual communication and reduce sexual&#xD;
      coercion and casual sex among participants in intervention group compared to those in control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicentered randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 500 female university&#xD;
      students in 5 universities with dormitories. Inclusion criteria are unmarried female&#xD;
      university Chinese students aged at least 18-year and not received any sexual health&#xD;
      intervention in the past 12 months. The main outcome measures will be self-reported&#xD;
      consistency of condom use with every partner in 3-month assessments, sexual coercion, sexual&#xD;
      consent, casual sex and sexual communication. The study instruments used will be UCLA&#xD;
      Multidimensional Condom Attitudes Scale; Sexual Consent Scale-Revised; Conflict Tactic&#xD;
      Scale-Revised; and Sexual Communication Self-Efficacy Scale. The data analysis will be a&#xD;
      linear mixed effects model with intervention group and baseline consistency of condom use as&#xD;
      the covariates. The investigators expected that the intervention will enhance consistency of&#xD;
      condom use with Cohen effect size of 0.3.&#xD;

      Subject recruitment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants will be conducted by using bulk electronic mails, promotional&#xD;
      brochures, posters and campus booths. An invitation card with a QR code of the web-based&#xD;
      intervention will be used for inviting female university students to enrol the study. Online&#xD;
      enrolment will be done for screening participants for eligibility. From the investigators'&#xD;
      past experience in recruiting university students, the investigators shall be able to reach&#xD;
      over 30,000 female university students in five universities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the web-based baseline survey at enrolment. The&#xD;
      web-based questionnaire will be set up under an online platform. Participants may use their&#xD;
      mobile devices including laptop computers and smartphones to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participation is entirely voluntary. Written informed consent will be obtained via the&#xD;
      web-based platform before completing the baseline questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the questionnaire, the recruited students will then be randomized to&#xD;
      either intervention group or control group, according to a list prepared by blocked&#xD;
      randomization of a size decided by a randomizer. The block size and order of allocation will&#xD;
      be kept securely in the randomizer to avoid selection bias. Allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      done at the online platform according to the participants' enrolment sequence. The&#xD;
      participants will then be guided to a web-page according to their group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3-month and 6-month after the entry of the study, participants will receive a link through&#xD;
      their e-mail to complete a follow-up questionnaire (T2). Three months later, another e-mail&#xD;
      link will be sent to participants for completing the last follow-up questionnaire (T3). If no&#xD;
      response from a participant, a follow-up telephone text-message and/or telephone call will be&#xD;
      sent after 1 week as a reminder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female university students (n = 500), across disciplines and year of study, will be recruited&#xD;
      from five universities with dormitory or residential halls in Hong Kong. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on the primary comparison of behavioural change in consistency of condom&#xD;
      use. A previous study showed the mean percentage of condom use was 67.8% (SD 39.3%) in people&#xD;
      under an ICBI and 23.5% (SD 35.3%) in those under usual care, corresponding to a moderate to&#xD;
      large Cohen effect size of 0.6.(20) To detect a conservative small Cohen effect size of 0.3&#xD;
      with 80% power and maximum 5% false positive error rate by a two-sided two-sample t-test, the&#xD;
      investigators need a total of 352 (176 per group) female university students. Assuming 30%&#xD;
      attrition based on a previous study using web-based intervention (21), the investigators plan&#xD;
      to recruit a total of 500 female university students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The web-based intervention is password-protected and &quot;Pseudo-Codes&quot; will be used to ensure&#xD;
      anonymity and confidentiality to minimize social desirability of the responses. By asking the&#xD;
      participant to create his/her own &quot;pseudo-code&quot;, a code that can be accurately retyped each&#xD;
      time the participant completes pre-test and post-test. There will otherwise no other&#xD;
      vulnerable subjects involve in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data check and analysis method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of ICBI in increasing consistency of condom use, a linear mixed&#xD;
      effects model will be adopted with intervention group and baseline consistency of condom use&#xD;
      as the covariates. The group by time interaction shall be assessed for changes of ICBI&#xD;
      effects over time. When the interaction effect is insignificant, it will be removed from the&#xD;
      model and the overall ICBI will be estimated. Otherwise, liner contrasts will be used to&#xD;
      assess the ICBI effect at each time epoch. In case of baseline imbalance, additional analysis&#xD;
      with adjustment of variables that show imbalance at baseline will be performed. The mixed&#xD;
      effects model was to take account of the extra covariance of repeated measurements at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months. The intention-to-treat principle will be adopted and all study subjects will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis. Missing values at 3- and 6-month follow-up will be replaced by the&#xD;
      last observed value and multiple imputation. The analysis will be repeated on the&#xD;
      per-protocol set comprising individuals without missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcomes that were assessed approximately on a continuous scale, the same&#xD;
      analysis approach as mentioned above will be adopted. For those assessed on a dichotomous&#xD;
      scale, e.g. sexual coercion, similar approach by a non-linear mixed effects model with a&#xD;
      logit link will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be performed by using the IBM SPSS (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Each&#xD;
      estimated effect will be accompanied by a 95% confidence interval and 5% level of&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators and the research assistants of the research team are responsible for data&#xD;
      collection and they will be permitted to access to source data and study record. Daily logs&#xD;
      will be recorded by the research assistants to monitor the study progress including the&#xD;
      number of respondents approached, interviews completed or refused and incomplete interviews.&#xD;
      All data entered in the database will be verified and cleaned. After completion of data&#xD;
      entry, computer logic checks will be run for consistency of related code. Necessary&#xD;
      corrections will be made to the database.&#xD;
