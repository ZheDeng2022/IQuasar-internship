      This project will complete a long-term follow up for children that have received cochlear&#xD;
      implants (CI) early in life and had their CI's programmed based on objective measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, generally, all younger children (0-3&#xD;
      years), the last ten years, had their CI's programmed based on objective measurements. The&#xD;
      programming of the CI carried out during the first year after the surgical insertion is done&#xD;
      on the foundation of the objective measurements and is generally what the child will live&#xD;
      with thereafter. This method also seem to be close to other clinics in Sweden and the rest of&#xD;
      the world, however, there are no specific guidelines regarding the how the programming of the&#xD;
      CI is to be carried out on small children. To this date there are no studies, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, that have confirmed the validity of using these objective measurements and if it&#xD;
      is the best for the child. We therefore aim to do a long term follow up on children that have&#xD;
      received CI and programmed this way, and study if there would be beneficial to redo the&#xD;
      programming when the child is old enough to actively participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim with this project is evaluate how suitable it is to mainly use objective measurements&#xD;
      when programming the cochlear implant and, in addition to this, examine if the children's&#xD;
      hearing can be improved if the programming is based on the behavioral measurements of sound&#xD;
      when the children are old enough to participate in such. It will examine what happens with&#xD;
      the end result if the programming foundation differentiates from one another; if there are&#xD;
      any measurable differences in hearing skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result from this project expects to generate knowledge that is highly important for those&#xD;
      working with small children receiving CI's, and by extension it will benefit the children&#xD;
      that rely on this device in there every day life.&#xD;

      Cochlear implants (CI) enable hearing for persons who otherwise would have been deaf. A CI&#xD;
      substitutes the sensory cells in the cochlea and stimulates the auditory nerve directly with&#xD;
      weak electrical pulses. For children born deaf, or become deaf at an early age, prompt&#xD;
      detection of this condition is important to since it enables the possibility of an early&#xD;
      implantation of the CI and facilitates the child's development of a spoken language. When it&#xD;
      comes to detecting deafness in newborns, Sweden has a well-functioning and widespread hearing&#xD;
      screening program for infants, permitting children born deaf, or with severe hearing&#xD;
      impairments, to be discovered very early. In general, children that are born deaf can get a&#xD;
      CI implanted at about one year of age, if there are no other contraindications.&#xD;
      Internationally it has become increasingly common for implants to be inserted at even lower&#xD;
      ages, sometimes even as young as five months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For small children who receive CI's at an early age it is not possible to perform&#xD;
      measurements based on the child making subjective assessments of how the sound is perceived&#xD;
      when the electrical stimulation is altered through the implant. Also, small children cannot&#xD;
      judge and report back the quality of the sound. Instead, objective measurements are commonly&#xD;
      used since they do not require the active participation of the child, along with observations&#xD;
      of the child and how it spontaneously reacts to the sound stimulation. A common objective&#xD;
      measurement is to find the lowest level of electrical stimulation required to obtain a&#xD;
      response from the auditory nerve, i.e. the electrically evoked action potential (ECAP)&#xD;
      threshold. The CI manufacturer Cochlear Ltd has developed an automatic system for this&#xD;
      measurement. Based on such measurements, as the automatic ECAP-measurement, the electrical&#xD;
      stimulation from the implant can adjusted to the so-called MAP, where the minimum and maximum&#xD;
      stimulation levels (T- respectively C-levels) are set for each individual electrode on the&#xD;
      implant to create the dynamic range of electrical stimulation. This MAP then becomes the&#xD;
      basis for the child's ability to perceive sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, today (at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden) a basic&#xD;
      programming of the MAP is performed based on ECAP measurements, after which adjustment of&#xD;
      only the overall level is carried out based on the child's reactions. However, no subjective&#xD;
      measurement is made regarding threshold levels of stimulation through the implant or that the&#xD;
      child actually perceives medium sound equally across the different channels. When the child&#xD;
      can participate in sound field audiometry, adjustments of the MAP settings are made to get a&#xD;
      straight audiogram, but basically, the children continue to use the setting based on the ECAP&#xD;
      measurement. Adult patients with acquired deafness receiving CI are managed in a different&#xD;
      manner than the children. The programming of the implant for adults is based on subjective&#xD;
      measurements of how stimulation via individual electrodes is perceived. By measuring&#xD;
      thresholds for individual electrodes, i.e. minimum audible stimulation (T-levels) and levels&#xD;
      where stimulation is immediately below unpleasant strong (C-levels), then the MAP is&#xD;
      programmed with an individual dynamic range for each electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge no previous study have explored how the MAP based on an ECAP measurement&#xD;
      endures over time or if a re-programming should be carried out when the child reliably can&#xD;
      participate in behavioral measurements, which is about seven years of age in terms of&#xD;
      measuring T-levels. Studies have shown that there is a correlation between ECAP-thresholds&#xD;
      and T- and C-levels for people who can participate actively. However, the relationship is&#xD;
      relatively weak and some researchers have even considered it too weak for ECAP thresholds to&#xD;
      be the basis for programming the implant. However, in most clinics, these thresholds are used&#xD;
      as a basis for programming CI to small children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several of those who work with programming the MAP in small children claims to witness an&#xD;
      adaptation in sensitivity of the auditory nerve to the applied stimulation; indicating that&#xD;
      the results of the objective measurement could gradually change if there is an alternation in&#xD;
      stimulation levels. However, there are no studies at this time that neither confirm nor deny&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate and clarify how children who receive CI at an early&#xD;
      age should be monitored and to evaluate the objective ECAP measurement as a basis for setting&#xD;
      stimulation levels. It also aims to investigate if there is any change in the result of the&#xD;
      ECAP measurement after adjustment has been made in the MAP. After completion of the study,&#xD;
      the goal is to offer a better and more knowledge-based (re-) habilitation for children who&#xD;
      receive CI's, for whom there are currently no definite guidelines for programming and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
