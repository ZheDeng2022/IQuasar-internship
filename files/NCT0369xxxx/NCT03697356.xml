      A multicenter prospective phase II study of rituximab combined, lenalidomide, dexamethasone&#xD;
      followed by lenalidomide maintenance in patients with newly diagnosed Waldenström's&#xD;
      macroglobulinemia (Ballondor trial)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Most patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia are rare, and most studies are based on&#xD;
      Phase II clinical studies, so the most effective regimen has not been established. However,&#xD;
      in patients without experience of treatment with rituximab monotherapy targeting CD20 antigen&#xD;
      expressed on lymphocytic cells, the response rate is reported to be approximately 25% -45%.&#xD;
      Combined chemotherapy including rituximab is recommended as a primary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Korea, there are few studies on Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and a relatively large&#xD;
      number of patients have studied the data of 71 patients in 2014, retrospectively. In the&#xD;
      present study, we found that the combined chemotherapy regimen with rituximab significantly&#xD;
      improved the overall response rates. Bortezomib may also be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Based on this, clinical trials of combined chemotherapy with&#xD;
      rituximab or dexamethasone have been conducted and 80-90% reported However, lenalidomide 15mg&#xD;
      alone was administered, lenalidomide was effective in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia with a&#xD;
      29% overall response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors concluded that the combination therapy of rituximab, bortezomib, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone is an effective treatment regimen that can improve the overall response&#xD;
      rate including complete remission. Patients with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia diagnosed in&#xD;
      Korea we planned this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance&#xD;
      therapy with chemotherapy with chemotherapy including rituximab, bortezomib, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone&#xD;
