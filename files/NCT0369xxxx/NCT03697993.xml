  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multi-center, open-label, randomized pragmatic superiority clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing two strategies for initial or step-down oral therapy for complicated urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (cUTI) after 0-48 hours of parenteral antibiotic therapy. The trial will evaluate&#xD;
      the success and safety of a strategy of initial or step-down fosfomycin, administered at a&#xD;
      dose of 3 g once daily, vs. a strategy of initial or step-down levofloxacin administered at a&#xD;
      dose of 750 mg once daily. Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy&#xD;
      is allowed 1) if the causative pathogen is not susceptible in vitro to quinolone initial or&#xD;
      step-down therapy in a subject randomized to the levofloxacin strategy, OR 2) if the subject&#xD;
      develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion, OR 3) the subject has an underlying condition posing increasing&#xD;
      risk for adverse events from quinolone therapy. The duration of oral therapy (initial +&#xD;
      investigator-directed adjustment if indicated) in each strategy is 5-7 days of any per&#xD;
      protocol antibiotic to which the pathogen is susceptible. The dosing of oral therapy depends&#xD;
      on creatinine clearance (CrCl). The trial will enroll approximately 634 patients that are&#xD;
      either male or female aged 18 or older with cUTI from outpatient and inpatient settings. The&#xD;
      study will take place over 25 months in up to 15 US sites. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      compare Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 in terms of treatment success rates at Test of Cure (TOC).&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were males and non-pregnant females aged &gt;=18 years and diagnosed with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) without bacteremia with a uropathogen. Participants were enrolled between 14NOV2018 and 03OCT2019.</recruitment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Strategy 1</title>
          <description>Fosfomycin 3 grams oral powder once daily for 5-7 days as initial or step-down oral therapy for cUTI without bacteremia with a uropathogen after 0-48 hours of parenteral antibiotic therapy, and if indicated a subsequent investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy.&#xD;
Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy is allowed if the subject develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the investigator's discretion, OR the subject has an underlying condition posing increased risk for adverse events from quinolone therapy. The duration of oral therapy (initial + subsequent if indicated) in each strategy is 5-7 days of any per protocol antibiotic to which the pathogen is susceptible. The dosing of oral therapy depends on creatinine clearance (CrCl).&#xD;
Another adequate oral therapy is defined as an oral therapy to which the pathogen shows in-vitro susceptibility AND to which the subject is tolerant based on history AND which is listed below:&#xD;
Levofloxacin 750 mg oral tablet once daily (Strategy 1 only)&#xD;
Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg oral tablet twice daily&#xD;
Cefixime 400 mg oral tablet once daily&#xD;

Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy is allowed if the causative pathogen is not susceptible in vitro to quinolone initial or step-down therapy in a subject randomized to the levofloxacin strategy, OR if the subject develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the investigator's discretion.

        <description>Treatment success is defined as a combination of clinical cure and microbiological success.&#xD;
Clinical cure is defined as: 1) Resolution of UTI symptoms from presentation and 2) No new UTI symptoms and 3) Avoidance of parenteral antibiotic therapy, in or out of hospital, at any time after randomization OR oral antibiotic therapy different from per protocol.&#xD;
Microbiological success is defined as a reduction of the pathogen found at presentation to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL for non-catheter specimens or &lt;10^3 for catheter specimens on urine culture.&#xD;
A TOC visit was scheduled at 21 days (+7 days) after randomization.</description>

Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy is allowed if the subject develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the investigator's discretion, OR the subject has an underlying condition posing increased risk for adverse events from quinolone therapy. The duration of oral therapy (initial + subsequent if indicated) in each strategy is 5-7 days of any per protocol antibiotic to which the pathogen is susceptible. The dosing of oral therapy depends on creatinine clearance (CrCl).&#xD;
Another adequate oral therapy is defined as an oral therapy to which the pathogen shows in-vitro susceptibility AND to which the subject is tolerant based on history AND which is listed below:&#xD;
Levofloxacin 750 mg oral tablet once daily (Strategy 1 only)&#xD;

Clinical cure is defined as: 1) Resolution of UTI symptoms from presentation and 2) No new UTI symptoms and 3) Avoidance of parenteral antibiotic therapy, in or out of hospital, at any time after randomization OR oral antibiotic therapy different from per protocol.&#xD;
Microbiological success is defined as a reduction of the pathogen found at presentation to &lt;10^4 CFU/mL for non-catheter specimens or &lt;10^3 for catheter specimens on urine culture.&#xD;
The EOT visit occured within 2 days of the completion of oral therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 5 through Day 10</time_frame>
        <population>The microbiologic Intention-to-Treat population includes all randomized participants who have a positive baseline bacterial culture of urine.</population>

            <description>Fosfomycin 3 grams oral powder once daily for 5-7 days as initial or step-down oral therapy for cUTI without bacteremia with a uropathogen after 0-48 hours of parenteral antibiotic therapy, and if indicated a subsequent investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy.&#xD;
Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy is allowed if the subject develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the investigator's discretion, OR the subject has an underlying condition posing increased risk for adverse events from quinolone therapy. The duration of oral therapy (initial + subsequent if indicated) in each strategy is 5-7 days of any per protocol antibiotic to which the pathogen is susceptible. The dosing of oral therapy depends on creatinine clearance (CrCl).&#xD;
Another adequate oral therapy is defined as an oral therapy to which the pathogen shows in-vitro susceptibility AND to which the subject is tolerant based on history AND which is listed below:&#xD;
Levofloxacin 750 mg oral tablet once daily (Strategy 1 only)&#xD;
Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg oral tablet twice daily&#xD;

Investigator-directed adjustment to another adequate oral therapy is allowed if the causative pathogen is not susceptible in vitro to quinolone initial or step-down therapy in a subject randomized to the levofloxacin strategy, OR if the subject develops an intolerance or allergy to the initial step-down oral therapy and at the investigator's discretion. The duration of oral therapy (initial + subsequent if indicated) in each strategy is 5-7 days of any per protocol antibiotic to which the pathogen is susceptible.

      <time_frame>The solicited events were collected after first dose of study product was given and until the end of therapy (EOT). If subject was on fosfomycin, solicited AEs were collected for 2 days after last dose of fosfomycin or until EOT, whichever occurred last. The unsolicited AEs were collected in participants who received at least two doses of Fosfomycin from the time of second dose of fosfomycin until the end of therapy (EOT) or 2 days after last dose of fosfomycin, whichever occurred last.</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were only recorded in participants receiving at least two doses of fosfomycin and were not collected for other interventions. Therefore the at risk population for SAE is a subset of the safety population who received any study drug.</desc>
