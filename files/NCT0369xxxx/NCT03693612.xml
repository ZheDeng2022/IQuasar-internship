  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the combination of GSK3359609 and tremelimumab is&#xD;
      safe and tolerable (Part 1) and provides significant survival benefit to subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC) to warrant further&#xD;
      clinical investigation (Part 2). Part 1 (dose escalation) will enroll subjects with advanced,&#xD;
      selected solid tumors. Subjects will receive escalating doses of GSK3359609 and tremelimumab&#xD;
      in combination in Part 1. Part 2 is randomized expansion and will enroll subjects with R/R&#xD;
      HNSCC who have disease progression after receiving at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy and&#xD;
      at least 1 anti-programmed death receptor protein-1 (PD-1)/anti-programmed death-ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) therapy, whether in combination or separately. In Part 2, subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either GSK3359609 in combination with tremelimumab at the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose or investigators choice of a single-agent standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      therapy including paclitaxel, docetaxel or cetuximab. The total duration of subjects in the&#xD;
      study will be approximately 4 years.&#xD;
