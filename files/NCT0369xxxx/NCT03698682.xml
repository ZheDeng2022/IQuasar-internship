  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases in the world.&#xD;
      Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) refers to an exaggeration of the symptoms of the disease.&#xD;
      Currently, the 3 Anthonisen criteria appear to be most satisfactory in defining the AECOPD:&#xD;
      The increase in the volume of sputum, the alteration of its appearance which becomes purulent&#xD;
      and The increase in dyspnea. Our recent study, showed that administration of levofloxacin is&#xD;
      superior to placebo in the treatment of AECOPD; it is accompanied by a substantial reduction&#xD;
      in mortality and a significant reduction in the residence time in hospital.The choice of&#xD;
      antibiotic to be used in this situation is challenging to the clinician who must choose&#xD;
      between traditional antibiotics (cyclins, aminopenicillins, cotrimoxazole...) and new&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents. Antibiotic treatment duration was not based on a strong scientific&#xD;
      rationale. Yet at the time of the dramatic emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing the&#xD;
      selection pressure by reducing the exposure to antibiotic should be a major issue. In&#xD;
      addition, the decrease in costs and associated side effects reinforces the interest of short&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, few studies with a satisfactory methodology are available in the literature.&#xD;
      In fact, we present the rational and the interest in shortening the durations of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment of AECOPD by levofloxacin in patients admitted to the emergency for exacerbation of&#xD;
      COPD and to study the epidemiology of viral and bacterial AECOPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective double-blind, accomplished with sealed envelopes ,with&#xD;
      two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Short treatment duration: 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day for two days&#xD;
           completed by 1 tablet Placebo Levofloxacin 500mg / day for the remaining 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Standard treatment duration (control group): 1 tablet Levofloxacin 500mg / day&#xD;
           for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted by recruiting AECOPD patients to collect their blood samples and&#xD;
      sputum samples. These samples will be used for the inflammatory analyses and the study of&#xD;
      bacterial and viral serology. The results were seized by the SPSS.20.0 software.&#xD;
