      Background: Deep caries is the most frequent reason for performing root canal treatments.&#xD;
      Minimally invasive methods for the treatment of deep carious lesions might therefore be&#xD;
      relevant to avoid pulp exposures and consequently to prevent root canal treatments. A 2 step&#xD;
      carious removal approach has shown to avoid exposures. But we do not know whether a selective&#xD;
      removal of carious tissue in well-defined deep caries lesions involving the pulpal quarter of&#xD;
      the dentin can be successfully completed in 1 step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate partial (selective) excavation by 1 vs 2 step in the treatment of&#xD;
      deep caries in permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: RCT multinational superiority study with 2 parallel groups and blinded outcome&#xD;
      assessment. The allocation sequence for partial (selective) carious removal vs 2 step&#xD;
      stepwise carious removal (1:1) will be centralized and computer-generated, stratified for age&#xD;
      and centre and concealed for the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: children (≥9 years) and adults with primary well-defined deep caries in a&#xD;
      permanent tooth. The lesion should reach the pulpal ¼ of the dentin with presence of a&#xD;
      radiodense zone on a bitewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: spontaneous and prolonged pain within the last 6 months; pain causing&#xD;
      disturbed night sleep; negative pulp test; apical radiolucency; restoration in close contact&#xD;
      with pulp; the patient has communication problems; no written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental intervention: 1-step selective carious removal to soft or firm dentine at&#xD;
      central site , and peripheral non selective carious removal to hard dentin followed by a&#xD;
      permanent resin restoration. Control intervention: Stepwise excavation (2- step, involving&#xD;
      first step which is identical to the experimental intervention but a base material and a&#xD;
      temporary glass-ionomer restoration is placed. The amount removed is as much as a proper&#xD;
      restoration can be placed. After 4-6 months the patients are recalled and the temporary&#xD;
      restoration is removed and final selective carious removal is completed until firm dentin&#xD;
      remains followed by permanent resin restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to avoid pulp complication at the 1-year follow-up evaluating. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are to arrest caries progression and sufficient restoration at the 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up. All outcomes will further be assessed 3 years after inclusion.&#xD;

      Originality of the project: The originality of the PAPRICA project will be to provide&#xD;
      high-quality clinical evidence for optimal treatment of deep caries lesions which is urgently&#xD;
      needed. The project is very relevant within an area that has been known for suggestions of&#xD;
      many treatments with the most invasive ones being the most popular ones. Only few previous&#xD;
      studies define the depth of the carious lesion, data on well-defined lesions will clarify&#xD;
      guidelines. Also, our design of this trial will attempt to reduce the risk of bias which is&#xD;
      always critical when the investigator can't be blinded. In this respect the randomization&#xD;
      will first be initiated after the 1 step of carious removal is completed. Results from a&#xD;
      systematic review and a recent meta-analysis support stepwise excavation compared to complete&#xD;
      excavation. However, firm evidence for one visit selective caries removal to soft dentine&#xD;
      (previously defined as partial excavation) is still lacking. The project will for the first&#xD;
      time investigate the caries treatment dilemma within a broader clinical context and thus&#xD;
      aiming to reduce number of dental visits and to reduce acute pain. In the PAPRICA project a&#xD;
      well-defined selective caries removal to soft dentine will be used as the lack of definitions&#xD;
      are frequent in previously published clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we are aiming to 1) improve the treatment of deep caries by markedly reducing&#xD;
      tooth-related pain, and consequently reduce the number of sick days due to toot-related pain;&#xD;
      2) reduce the number, complexity and duration of dental visits needed to treat deep caries;&#xD;
      3) provide data for an updated evidence-based treatment guideline for an improved health-care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants: All patients at a participating clinical trial site are considered&#xD;
      for participation. Patients will be eligible, if they comply with well-defined inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan and data analysis: Sample size is 668 patients, based on the primary outcome&#xD;
      'pulp complications' among controls being 25%, and 15% in the experimental group, and&#xD;
      combined with a type-I error of 5%; and a type-II error of 10%. Blinded interim analyses will&#xD;
      be carried out. Statistical analysis of data from outcome measures - the gained frequencies&#xD;
      of treatments leading to preservation of vital tooth without pain, apical pathology and no&#xD;
      root filling will be examined using logistic regression analysis to assess the treatment&#xD;
      effect adjusted for stratification variables. Odds ratio estimates will be used with 95% CI.&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled using multiple imputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Only one deep caries lesion per patient will be randomized. The trial will use&#xD;
      block randomization with the following to stratifications variables: 1) Center; 2) Age (9-20&#xD;
      years/over 20 years). The randomization in the PAPRICA trial will be performed using an&#xD;
      online system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: The investigator performing the follow-up examination is not the same who performed&#xD;
      the treatment. The analysis of the radiographs of the tooth at follow-up is carried out by an&#xD;
      observer-committee being blinded for the intervention. The statistical analyses are carried&#xD;
      out blinded. Patient blinding is not possible as the two intervention groups are performed as&#xD;
      either a one-treatment procedure or a two-treatment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who will be randomly allocated to 1-step partial caries removal will receive a&#xD;
      treatment that normally is not practiced in relation to deep caries. However, there is a lack&#xD;
      of randomised clinical trials investigating, whether partial caries removal has a positive&#xD;
      prolonged effect with respect to maintained vital pulp and absence of apical pathology. The&#xD;
      possible gain with the proposed treatment concept could be that the treatment of deep caries&#xD;
      could be rationally performed without an extra treatment session and it may to a larger&#xD;
      extent lead to an avoidance of exposure to the pulp. Patients who will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to 2-step partial caries removal receive a well-known treatment of deep caries. The intention&#xD;
      is that we will gain data to reduce the risk of pulp exposures and thus the number of root&#xD;
      canal treatments and possible reduce the number of days 'out-of' work due to tooth pain&#xD;
      following an unnecessary invasive treatment of deep caries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation and withdrawal: If a patient does not show-up for an appointment, attempts to&#xD;
      make a re-appointment are carried out up to 3 times. It is important to stress that great&#xD;
      effort should be carried out in order to find reasons for not attending an established&#xD;
      appointment or if a patient wishes to withdraw from the trial. he investigators shall&#xD;
      discontinue a participant from the trial intervention at any time, if: 1) There are signs of&#xD;
      caries progression or failure of the restoration; 2) The participant is diagnosed with any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria during the intervention period (except 'deep carious tooth has&#xD;
      restoration in close contact with pulp'); 3) The participant experiences intolerable adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
