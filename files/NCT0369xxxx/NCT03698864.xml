    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study that will evaluate the safety of PCS499 for the treatment of&#xD;
      necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) and will inform the design of future studies. Approximately 12 NL&#xD;
      patients (6-9 patients without ulceration and 3-6 patients with ulceration) who also meet&#xD;
      other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of PCS499 in patients with&#xD;
      Necrobiosis Lipoidica.&#xD;

          1. Male or female patients age 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of NL. Biopsies of continually active lesions performed&#xD;
             outside of this clinical study will need to be reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed by&#xD;
             the study pathologist. For patients with no previous history of biopsy, no biopsy&#xD;
             within the previous 5 years, a biopsy that is not confirmed to be NL, or newly active&#xD;
             lesion, a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of NL will be performed at the Screening&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Reference NL lesion with a score of 2 or greater on the Investigator Global&#xD;
             Assessment: Necrobiosis Lipoidica (IGA:NL) Activity scale AND surface area with&#xD;
             minimum size of 10 cm2. If more than one lesion is present, the reference lesion area&#xD;
             is the lesion with the highest disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline before dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of childbearing potential must use one of the following acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study: oral contraceptive medication, intrauterine device&#xD;
             (IUD), hormonal implants, injectable contraceptive medications, double-barrier&#xD;
             methods, or tubal ligation.&#xD;

          6. Females who are postmenopausal (age-related amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months and&#xD;
             increased follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 mIU/mL. If necessary to confirm&#xD;
             postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening) or who have undergone&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing.&#xD;
