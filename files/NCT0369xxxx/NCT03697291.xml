    <textblock>
      Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is considered a central venous line placement&#xD;
      (CVL) which mandates the confirmation of the tip's location. At present, most CVL's position&#xD;
      are confirmed by radiographic method either by in-procedure fluoroscopy or post-insertion&#xD;
      x-ray. For CVLs placed from upper body (from internal jugular vein, subclavian veins or upper&#xD;
      arm veins), the intracavitary electrocardiogram (iECG) can also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracavitary ECG are proven effective for tip confirmation and provide some benefits i.e.&#xD;
      lower cost, decrease exposure to harmful radiation for care providers and also the patients,&#xD;
      require less personals and equipments, provide real-time confirmation as comparable to&#xD;
      fluoroscopy, etc. There are several devices and makes of iECG apparatus but B.Braun-Certodyn®&#xD;
      remains the only available system in our institution. The limitation is the availability of&#xD;
      the Certodyn devices on each locations where CVL will be placed i.e. operating theater,&#xD;
      intensive care unit, bedside placement, radiology suite, etc. Since the connecting wire is&#xD;
      only supplied in the certain CVL kits under B.Braun brand, this has rendered iECG for other&#xD;
      types or makes of CVL or PICC line become even more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-invented connector wire for iECG (PS wire) has been made and used effectively in the&#xD;
      past few years at Siriraj hospital. The patent registration is underway and the author seek&#xD;
      to compare this PS wire against the commercial Certodyn system.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the success rate of iECG CVL tip confirmation by self-invented iECG&#xD;
           connector wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare quality of iECG tracing produced from both of self-invented iECG wire versus&#xD;
           the Certodyn system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials, participants and study method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipments required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Self-invented iECG wire (PS wire) 2) Commercial iECG system which consists of the Certodyn&#xD;
      and the wire. 3) Standard ECG monitoring system which can display and printout the ECG&#xD;
      tracing. 4) A digital ECG caliper which can measure P wave amplitude and noise segment in&#xD;
      millimeter up to 2 decimal points. Study method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient presented for PICC line from upper torso will be screened and assessed for&#xD;
           eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria includes children younger than 18 yo, patient with atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation or other rhythms not generated from intrinsic SA node i.e. pacer, unstable&#xD;
           hemodynamic, patient with history arrhythmias, HR &gt; 120 bpm, patients with&#xD;
           hypercoagulable state, allergy to heparin or patients with known heparin induced&#xD;
           thrombocytopenia, patients with known Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient will be monitored with standard 3-lead ECG, the baseline lead II ECG will be&#xD;
           printed out and tagged with a serial number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient will undergo the standard PICC line placement using Seldinger or modified&#xD;
           Seldinger technique. The catheter will be pre-flushed with 10 units/mL heparinized NSS.&#xD;
           When catheter is inserted into the proximal SVC (guided by landmark measurement), the&#xD;
           wire will be retracted to the marked location where the tip of the wire is at the end of&#xD;
           the catheter. The iECG connection by Certodyn will be applied. The catheter and wire&#xD;
           will be adjusted until the giant P wave (highest P) was detected on screen, this ECG&#xD;
           tracing will be printed out and tagged with another non-sequential serial number. The&#xD;
           iECG will then switched to the PS wire and the iECG tracing will be printed out again&#xD;
           and tagged with another non-sequential serial number. All 3 ECG printouts will be&#xD;
           stapled together for measurement by cardiologist who is blind to the intervention later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The intervention related to research study is considered ended at this point. The&#xD;
           patient will have their CVL/PICC line adjusted to the proper position (mid to distal SVC&#xD;
           for mid-long term and long term catheter). The CVL or PICC will be secured, flushed and&#xD;
           locked per standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Portable CXR will be routinely obtained when patients arrived to the ward. The&#xD;
           information of the tip of the catheter will be recorded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data, type of catheter, depth of catheter where giant P wave obtained and&#xD;
           final position of catheter will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each study patient produce 3 ECG print outs which are -baseline surface lead II ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  iECG produced by Certodyn system&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  iECG produced by PS wire Each ECG tracing will be evaluated and measured by a&#xD;
                cardiologist who is blind to the intervention. The 2 measured parameters includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The amplitude of P wave in mm from baseline surface ECG of each cardiac cycle. -The&#xD;
                amplitude of giant P wave in mm from iECG from both Certodyn and PS wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All 3 ECG print outs will be compared for quality and the length noisy ECG segment&#xD;
           (determined as the ECG with interference artifact of baseline &gt; 1 mm) will also be&#xD;
           measured in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) All measurement will be analyzed statistically to determine the differences between the 2&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
