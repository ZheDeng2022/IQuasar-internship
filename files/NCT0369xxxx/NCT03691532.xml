    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of upper extremity exercise on postprandial lipemia (PPL)&#xD;
      in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Participants are measured at rest and fed a&#xD;
      standardized meal following seated rest (CON) or arm cycling exercise (ACE). The meal is&#xD;
      infused with &quot;stable isotope lipid tracers&quot; that allow for determination of the end fates of&#xD;
      the fat in the meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in dysregulation of fat metabolism that increases the risk&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality from cardioendocrine disease. Excessive accumulation of visceral&#xD;
      fat after SCI is a serious risk component for cardioendocrine disease and results in part&#xD;
      from pronounced hypertriglyceridemia following ingestion of fat-containing meals (i.e.,&#xD;
      exaggerated postprandial lipemia; PPL). Although exaggerated PPL is well documented in&#xD;
      persons with SCI, its etiology is unknown. Specifically, it remains to be determined to what&#xD;
      extent exaggerated PPL in those with SCI results from impairments in the use of exogenous&#xD;
      (dietary) and/or endogenous (stored) fats. Additionally, it is not known if exercise improves&#xD;
      postprandial fat use in a manner that alleviates the exaggerated PPL in this population and&#xD;
      reduces the risk of cardioendocrine disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the this study is to examine the mechanisms of exaggerated PPL in those with&#xD;
      SCI and the effects of an acute pre-meal exercise bout by employing novel stable isotope&#xD;
      tracer techniques. In persons without SCI, it is well established that pre-meal exercise&#xD;
      lowers PPL in part by improving the use of exogenous and endogenous fats. While muscle&#xD;
      atrophy and blunted sublesional sympathetic activity following SCI may hinder fat use,&#xD;
      preliminary data indicate that fat use is increased during recovery from exercise in the&#xD;
      postabsorptive (fasted) state in this population. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      decreased use of exogenous and endogenous fats contributes to exaggerated PPL in SCI, and&#xD;
      that pre-meal exercise will reduce PPL due to increased use of both fat sources.&#xD;
