    <textblock>
      The Pulmonary Specialist-Health Coach Consultation (PuSHCon) study examines the&#xD;
      implementation of health coach-assisted consultations to improve access to specialist care&#xD;
      and implementation of specialist recommendations for patients with COPD, asthma, and asthma&#xD;
      COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) for low-income and vulnerable patients seen at public health&#xD;
      clinics. Three hundred sixty (360) patients from ten clinics will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and randomized at the individual level to receive health coaching or usual care; 180 patients&#xD;
      will receive usual care and 180 patients will receive the PuSHCon model.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While evidence-based care for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma can&#xD;
      substantially reduce disease burden and prevent emergency visits and hospitalizations, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 55% of patients with COPD do not receive all recommended care and that less&#xD;
      than 50% of patients with asthma are well controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of a novel model for pulmonary&#xD;
      specialist-health coach consultations (PuSHCon) in its ability to increase access to&#xD;
      specialty recommendations and the provision of evidence-based care for patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or asthma receiving care at federally qualified&#xD;
      health centers (FQHCs). The specific aims of the study are to compare the use of&#xD;
      evidence-based care and of patient reported outcomes 4 months after the consultation. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will evaluate the cost per patient in each model to determine the model's&#xD;
      effectiveness in increasing access and lowering cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of comparing the use of evidence-based care will be measured as the proportion&#xD;
      of guideline-based recommendations that are ultimately received by the patients. The&#xD;
      secondary endpoint for this aim will be measured through the proportion of patients receiving&#xD;
      guideline-concordant medications at 4 months after consultation compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the study regarding patient-reported outcomes will be measured primarily&#xD;
      through the change in COPD and/or asthma related quality of life measures from baseline to 4&#xD;
      months post consultation. The secondary measure for this aim will look at changes in COPD&#xD;
      and/or asthma specific symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third aim of the study is to assess the impact of this model on access to care and cost&#xD;
      of care. Access will be measured by tracking the number of patients who successfully complete&#xD;
      a consultation per month. Costs will be determined by calculating time spent per patients, as&#xD;
      well as by health care utilization.&#xD;

    <description>A health coach will contact patients with poorly controlled asthma or COPD. The health coach will gather information from the patient and medical record and review the case with a pulmonary specialist. The specialist will provide recommendations to the primary care clinician based on the case review; the specialist may request an in-person patient visit if needed. The health coach will follow up with the primary care clinician and will support implementation of recommendations that the the primary care clinician accepts,</description>
