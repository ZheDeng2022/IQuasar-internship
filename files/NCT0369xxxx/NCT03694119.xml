  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of ozanimod on pressor response&#xD;
      when co-administered with oral tyramine in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind (subjects and study site personnel&#xD;
      [except pharmacist or designee] are blinded to the treatments until 7 ± 2 days postdose&#xD;
      follow-up), placebo- and positive-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design is described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for participation in this study within 28 days prior to dosing in&#xD;
      Period 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: To exclude subjects with very low or very high sensitivity to tyramine, oral&#xD;
      tyramine pressor tests will be performed prior to randomization on all subjects after&#xD;
      eligibility has been confirmed at Screening (in the absence of any other investigational&#xD;
      product [IP] treatment) to determine the pressor response to tyramine. The pressor response,&#xD;
      referred to hereafter as Tyr30, is defined as the tyramine dose required to increase systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (SBP) by at least 30 mm Hg from daily defined baseline in three consecutive&#xD;
      measurements within 4 hours after tyramine dosing. The test consists of daily administration&#xD;
      of escalating doses of tyramine (up to 10 days) until a sustained SBP increase of ≥ 30 mm Hg&#xD;
      is observed relative to the daily-defined baseline values. Sustained increase is determined&#xD;
      by 3 consecutive SBP measurements within 4 hours after tyramine administration. The&#xD;
      daily-defined baseline SBP value is defined as the average of five SBP measurements with&#xD;
      approximately 5-minute interval after an initial 10- minute rest in the supine position and&#xD;
      within 30 minutes prior to tyramine administration. Only subjects who present Tyr30 ≥ 200 mg&#xD;
      and ≤ 800 mg will then be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups (phenelzine, ozanimod, or&#xD;
      placebo) in a 1:1:1 fashion while stratifying for sex in such a manner that each treatment&#xD;
      will have a minimum of 30% of either sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Subjects will receive IPs (active and/or placebo) twice daily (BID) depending on&#xD;
      the randomization. Subjects randomized to the phenelzine group will receive phenelzine 15 mg&#xD;
      BID for 7 days from Days 32 to 38. Subjects randomized to the ozanimod group will receive&#xD;
      ozanimod 1.84 mg once daily (QD) for 28 days (including the initial 10-day dose escalation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive placebos for 28 days. Placebos will be&#xD;
      matched to phenelzine or ozanimod in appearance to blind the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: Upon completion of Period 2, subjects in all three treatment groups will undergo a&#xD;
      second Tyr30 test for up to 11 days. Tyramine challenge in Period 3 will remain blinded since&#xD;
      phenelzine group has different tyramine dose schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The study will enroll approximately 92 healthy men and non-pregnant,&#xD;
      non-lactating women, ages 25 to 55 years, inclusive, with a body weight of at least 110&#xD;
      pounds (50 kg) and body mass index within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive. This is&#xD;
      to ensure a total of 69 subjects with Tyr30 ≥ 200 mg and ≤ 800 mg at the end of Period 1 to&#xD;
      be randomized and to allow approximately 54 subjects (18 subjects per group) to complete all&#xD;
      three periods. A minimum of 30% of each sex will be randomized into each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study The study duration is up to 84 ± 2 days (including a 28-day Screening period,&#xD;
      Period 1 of up to 10 days, Period 2 of 28 days, Period 3 of up to 11 days, and a follow-up&#xD;
      period up through 7 ± 2 days after the last dose of IP).&#xD;
