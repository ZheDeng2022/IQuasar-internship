  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Oncology Care Coordination study is designed to evaluate use of a care coordination tool&#xD;
      for lung cancer patients and their caregiver on quality of care and performance outcomes.&#xD;
      Eligible patients need to be receiving treatment at Geisinger. Participation in the study&#xD;
      involves completion of surveys, permission to review information from the patient's&#xD;
      electronic health record, and for some enrollment in the care coordination tool called&#xD;
      Harmonized Care. Geisinger oncology care providers who have patients enrolled the study will&#xD;
      be invited for interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The case-matched controlled design, exploratory evaluation study will look at how exposure to&#xD;
      a care coordination tool impacts quality and performance indicators associated with oncology&#xD;
      care from the perspective of patients, caregivers, and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geisinger research staff will recruit lung cancer patients and their caregivers across three&#xD;
      Geisinger locations: Geisinger Medical Center (GMC), Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center&#xD;
      (GWV) and Geisinger Community Medical Center (GCMC). GMC will serve as the intervention site&#xD;
      and GWV and GCMC as control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be identified by the study staff through the electronic health&#xD;
      record as well as through clinical staff and approached in the oncology clinic as part of a&#xD;
      schedule office visit and/or treatment. For the purpose of study awareness, informational&#xD;
      flyers will be available to patients in the exam rooms, waiting rooms, and through Oncology&#xD;
      Care's Multi-Disciplinary clinic. Participants will asked to identify a caregiver who will&#xD;
      participate in the study as well, however this is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case dyads enrolled at the intervention site (GMC) will be asked to complete a survey when&#xD;
      they join the study and at the end of the study. Participants will also be asked to enroll in&#xD;
      the care coordination tool, a health information solution that integrates the patient,&#xD;
      caregiver, and clinical data to enhance communication and improve quality of care and&#xD;
      performance outcomes. Patients will also be asked to give permission to the study team to&#xD;
      access their health information via the e electronic health record. Participants will be in&#xD;
      the research study for about 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control dyads enrolled at the control site (GWV and GCMC) will be asked to complete a survey&#xD;
      eight weeks after consenting to participate. Patients will be asked to give permission to the&#xD;
      study team to access their health information via the electronic health record. Participants&#xD;
      will be in the research study for about 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also enroll oncology care providers within the Medical Oncology or Radiation&#xD;
      Oncology departments at GMC and who have patients enrolled in the study. Providers will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a 30-minute interview to get their feedback and insights on the care&#xD;
      coordination tool.&#xD;
