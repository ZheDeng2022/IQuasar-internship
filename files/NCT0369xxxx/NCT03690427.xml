  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hookah (water-pipe) smoking has quickly grown to become a major global tobacco epidemic among&#xD;
      youth; with electronic hookahs more recently increasing in popularity especially among young&#xD;
      female adults, who endorse marketing claims that these products are a safer alternative to&#xD;
      traditional hookah, but scientific evidence is lacking. The study aims to elucidate the&#xD;
      comparative effects of traditional hookah smoking vs. electronic hookah inhalation on human&#xD;
      vascular and endothelial function; and examine the role of inflammation and oxidative stress&#xD;
      as likely mechanisms in hookah-related cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hookah (water-pipe) smoking is rapidly increasing in popularity worldwide. Contributing to&#xD;
      this popularity is the unsubstantiated belief that traditional hookah smoke is detoxified as&#xD;
      it passes through the water-pipe. More recently, electronic hookah bowls-containing e-liquid&#xD;
      that is heated electrically but inhaled through traditional water-pipes-are increasing in&#xD;
      popularity in the United States among young female adults, who endorse marketing claims that&#xD;
      these products are even safer than traditional hookah. With traditional hookah, in addition&#xD;
      to nicotine and tar, smokers are exposed to carbon-enriched fine particles and significant&#xD;
      amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), the latter of which has been shown to constitute an&#xD;
      endothelial-dependent vasodilator. Though toxicant exposure is much lower than traditional&#xD;
      hookah and without any CO exposure, e-hookah bowls deliver nicotine and fine particles that&#xD;
      constitute putative vascular toxins. The main objective of this project is to investigate the&#xD;
      comparative effects of traditional hookah smoking versus electronic hookah bowl inhalation on&#xD;
      endothelial and vascular function and their mechanistic role in the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Specifically, the investigators will examine the role of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammation as potential mechanisms of action in hookah-induced cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. The investigators will test the hypothesis that; 1) in the absence of charcoal&#xD;
      briquettes and virtually any CO exposure, e-hookah bowl inhalation acutely impairs&#xD;
      endothelial function and evokes acute central stiffness, opposite from the endothelial&#xD;
      function augmentation observed after traditional hookah smoking, which is likely mediated by&#xD;
      the large CO boost emitted from burning charcoal briquettes used to heat the flavored&#xD;
      tobacco; and 2) the processes of oxidative stress and inflammation play a pivotal mechanistic&#xD;
      role underlying these vascular changes. In a cross-over study comparing traditional hookah&#xD;
      smoking to e-hookah bowl inhalation, the investigators will assess endothelial function&#xD;
      measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and aortic stiffness by pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity and augmentation index in 18 young healthy hookah smokers 21-39 years old, before&#xD;
      and after ad lib 30-minute smoking/ inhalation session. To test for oxidative stress&#xD;
      mediation, the investigators will determine if any acute impairment in endothelial function&#xD;
      after e-hookah can be prevented by intravenous Vitamin C infusion, a potent anti-oxidant.&#xD;
      Antioxidant defensive buffers, such as protective HDL or paraoxonase-1 activity, or an&#xD;
      increase in oxidized lipoproteins will be collected. To test for inflammatory mediation,&#xD;
      biomarkers including anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines hsCRP,&#xD;
      TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 will be collected before and after the sessions as well as smoking exposure&#xD;
      biomarkers (plasma nicotine and expired CO). The results of this proposal: (a) stand to fill&#xD;
      in gaps in our mechanistic understanding of the comparative effect of traditional vs.&#xD;
      e-hookah bowl on vascular and endothelial function; and (b) help inform policy decisions by&#xD;
      the FDA about regulation of hookah products.&#xD;
