  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed Tomography Derived Fractional Flow Reserve (CT-FFR) is a noninvasive method for&#xD;
      evaluating the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions by using coronary CT&#xD;
      Angiography (CCTA) as opposed to invasive FFR examination under invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography. The purpose of the CT-FFR-CHINA study is to verify that the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of hemodynamically significant lesions by CT-FFR is superior than routine&#xD;
      anatomic evaluation of diameter stenosis using CCTA alone using invasive FFR as the reference&#xD;
      standard, exclusively in Chinese population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of CCTA to detect and exclude&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). One main limitation of CCTA, however, is a tendency to&#xD;
      overestimate the severity of coronary artery stenosis against invasive coronary angiography&#xD;
      (ICA). On the other hand, FFR, invasively measured under ICA, is recognized as the current&#xD;
      gold standard in determination of coronary artery lesions due to improved long-term clinical&#xD;
      outcomes when revascularization is guided by FFR instead of ICA. Moreover, prior studies&#xD;
      indicated unreliable relationships between detection of obstructive anatomic coronary artery&#xD;
      stenoses defined by CCTA and hemodynamically significant lesions by invasive fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve (FFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computational modeling techniques now permit&#xD;
      construction of a 3-dimensional model of coronary arteries visible from CCTA images and&#xD;
      computation of FFR anywhere in the entire 3D model noninvasively. Several prior prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter studies have reported promising results for the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR&#xD;
      using invasive FFR as the reference standard. However, the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR&#xD;
      in Chinese population is not clear. Therefore, we hereby designed the CT-FFR-CHINA study to&#xD;
      determine the hemodynamically significant lesions, exclusively in Chinese subjects. It is a&#xD;
      prospective and multi-center trial with a total of 326 subjects enrolled at 4 Chinese&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
