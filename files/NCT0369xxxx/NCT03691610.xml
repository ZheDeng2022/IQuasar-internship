    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine&#xD;
      seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following administration of 2 doses&#xD;
      of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of MENVEO® when given concomitantly with&#xD;
      routine pediatric vaccines to infants and toddlers 6 to 7 months of age and 12 to 13 months&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the percentage of participants with antibody&#xD;
           titers to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W ≥ 1:8 following administration of 2&#xD;
           doses of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to 2 doses of MENVEO® when given&#xD;
           concomitantly with pediatric routine vaccines to infants and toddlers at 6 to 7 months&#xD;
           of age and 12 to 13 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W 30&#xD;
           days after the second vaccination at 12 to 13 months of age with MenACYW conjugate&#xD;
           vaccine or MENVEO®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W 30&#xD;
           days and 6 months after the first vaccination at 6 to 7 months of age with MenACYW&#xD;
           conjugate vaccine or MENVEO®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the antibody response against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W 30&#xD;
           days after the second vaccination at 20 to 23 months of age with MenACYW conjugate&#xD;
           vaccine or Menactra®.&#xD;
