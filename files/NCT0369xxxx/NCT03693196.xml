      Objectives: To assess the levels of TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL, RANK, OPG, which are immunological&#xD;
      markers of peri-implant disease and F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia,&#xD;
      P. intermedia, S. oralis, which are microbiological agents of peri-implantitis, in areas&#xD;
      where SLA, fluorine-modified and anodized implant surfaces are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: In this study, 71 implants of 37 patients were assessed. The patients&#xD;
      were grouped according to the surface characteristics of the implants. Group 1: SLA surface,&#xD;
      Group 2: Fluorine modifying surface, Group 3:Anodization surface Plaque index (PI), gingival&#xD;
      index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), pocket depths (PD), clinical attachment levels (CAL)&#xD;
      and keratinized tissue width (KTW) were measured. Peri-implant sulcus fluid and subgingival&#xD;
      plaque samples were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: PI was found to be significantly lowest in Group 1, higher in Group 3. Group 3&#xD;
      implants were found to have more bleeding on probing significantly. It was found to be higher&#xD;
      peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis in Group 3. GI, PD, CAL, KTW were not found to&#xD;
      differ between groups. No significant differences were found between TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL,&#xD;
      RANK, OPG. While F. nucleatum, T. forsythia, T. denticola and P. intermedia were found to be&#xD;
      significant highest in Group 3, P. gingivalis and S. oralis were found to be high in Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Peri-implantitis rate, BOP and PI were found to be higher in Group 3. F.&#xD;
      nucleatum, T. forsythia, T. denticola, and P. intermedia were found to be significantly high&#xD;
      in Group 3 implants. This situation can be associated with the porous structure of anodized&#xD;
      surface.&#xD;

      1. | INTRODUCTION Dental implants are commonly used in partly and completely edentulous&#xD;
           patients in order to improve function, aesthetic appearance and life quality. Successful&#xD;
           osseointegration is provided with recently developed surface modifications. Some of&#xD;
           these are SLA (Sand-blasted, Largegrit, Acid-etched), fluorine modified surface and&#xD;
           anodized surfaces. SLA implants are obtained by spraying large sand grits on the&#xD;
           implant. Modification of dental implants with fluorine is a chemical method in which&#xD;
           fluorine, one of the basic elements of bone, is added on the surface to increase&#xD;
           osteogenesis. Implants with anodized surface form with micro or nano porous surfaces as&#xD;
           a result of high intensity (200 A/m2) or potential (100 V) potansiostatic or&#xD;
           galvanostatic anodization of titanium inside strong acids such as H2SO4, H3PO4, HNO3,&#xD;
           HF. When this application is compared with passivated surfaces, it results in the&#xD;
           thickening of titanium oxide layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to assess comparatively the levels of TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL,&#xD;
           RANK, OPG, which are immunological markers of peri-implant disease and Porphyromonas&#xD;
           gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Treponema denticola (T. denticola), Tannerella forsythia (T.&#xD;
           forsythia), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), Prevotella intermedia (P.&#xD;
           intermedia), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), which are microbiological agents of peri&#xD;
           implantitis, in areas where SLA, fluorine-modified and anodized implant surfaces are&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. | MATERIAL AND METHODS 2.1 | Study Population The study was conducted by calling back&#xD;
           patients whose partial missing teeth were treated with implant supported fixed&#xD;
           restorations at Necmettin Erbakan University Faculty of Dentistry, Department of&#xD;
           Periodontology and whose implants had been functioning for at least a year. The&#xD;
           inclusion criteria of the study were not having any systemic disorders that can affect&#xD;
           bone metabolism and wound healing, being older than 18, having prostheses in the&#xD;
           posterior area, having received cement retained implant prosthesis in which standard&#xD;
           abutment was used, having implant prosthesis which had been functioning for at least a&#xD;
           year, not having received bone augmentation procedure or advanced implant surgery during&#xD;
           implant surgery, not having received periodontal treatment during the previous year, and&#xD;
           having received one of SLA, fluorine modified or anodized implants. The exclusion&#xD;
           criteria were uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and other uncontrolled diseases, pregnancy,&#xD;
           lactation, aggressive periodontitis, overdenture patients and parafunctional habits such&#xD;
           as bruxism. In the study, 71 implants of 37 patients, 24 females and 13 males, were&#xD;
           assessed. The patients called were grouped in three according to the surface&#xD;
           characteristics of the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Titanium implants the surfaces of which were roughened with SLA (sandblasted and&#xD;
      acid-etched titanium surface) (Straumann®, Basel, Sweden), Group 2: Implants the surfaces of&#xD;
      which were roughened by modifying with fluorine (Astra Tech, OsseoSpeed™, Sweden) Group 3:&#xD;
      Implants the surfaces of which were roughened by anodization (TiUnite Nobel Biocare, Replace®&#xD;
      Conical Connection, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implants included were grouped in three as healthy, peri-implant mucositis and&#xD;
      peri-implantitis. Peri-implantitis group included implants which had bleeding and/or&#xD;
      supuration at probing, pocket depth &gt; 4 mm at least in one area and 2 mm or more radiographic&#xD;
      bone loss around the implant, peri-implant mucositis group included implants which had&#xD;
      bleeding and/or supuration at probing and no radiographic bone loss around the implant and&#xD;
      the healthy group included implants which did not have inflammation around the implant,&#xD;
      bleeding or supuration at probing and radiograph bone loss around the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 | Clinical Periodontal Measurements The indexes and measurements used in the study were&#xD;
      measured within a specific order and recorded in data recording forms prepared according to&#xD;
      this order. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), pocket depths (PD), bleeding on probing,&#xD;
      clinical attachment levels (CAL) and keratinized tissue width around the implant (KTW) were&#xD;
      recorded. Panoramic radiographs were taken to assess the interproximal bone levels around the&#xD;
      implant (Morita, Veraviewepocs 3D F40, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 | Collecting the Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) and Subgingival Plaque Samples&#xD;
      After taking PI from all individuals, plaques and soft additions around the implant were&#xD;
      removed and after the area was isolated with the help of cotton rolls, the teeth were dried&#xD;
      with air. PICF was collected from the mesio-buccal area of the implant by using paper tapes&#xD;
      (Perio-paper, Oraflow Inc, New York, USA). Subgingival plaque samples were collected about 15&#xD;
      minutes after PICF was collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 | PICF analysis Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were purchased&#xD;
      for the measurement of TNF-α, PGE2, RANKL, RANK, OPG and assays were carried out according to&#xD;
      the manufacturers' recommendations (Elabscience Biotechnology Co.,Ltd, Wuhan, China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 | Preparation and Assessment of Genomic DNA Forthe DNA extraction, the collected&#xD;
      subgingival plaque samples were processed using a commercially available kit (GF-1 bacterial&#xD;
      DNA extraction kit, Vivantis, Malaysia) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 | Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Selected putative periodontal&#xD;
      pathogens (P. intermedia, T. forsythia, T.denticola, F. nucleatum, P.gingivalis,&#xD;
      Streptococcus oralis) and total bacterial load in the subgingival biofilms were detected as&#xD;
      described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 | Statistical Analysis SPSS 19.0 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program was used for the&#xD;
      statistical analyses of the study. Normality test for continuous numerical variables was&#xD;
      conducted with Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis method. Since all of the variables were not&#xD;
      normally distributed, non-parametrical methods were preferred in the analyses. Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      method was preferred for two independent groups, while Kruskal-Wallis was used for multiple&#xD;
      groups. p&lt;0,05 was accepted statistically significant.&#xD;
