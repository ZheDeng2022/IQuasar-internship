  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are numerous conditions that may benefit from TMS but they lack definitive data from&#xD;
      clinical trials with sufficient scientific rigor, which includes large, multi-site,&#xD;
      randomized sham-controlled trials. This is the status for a variety of psychiatric and&#xD;
      neurological disorders such as tinnitus, central pain, movement disorders, stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, obsessive compulsive disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, and addiction. In&#xD;
      certain instances there may be sufficient evidence supporting the treatment efficacy of TMS&#xD;
      that it is reasonable to offer TMS as an off-label treatment, a term for clinical treatments&#xD;
      that have not received FDA approval but may nonetheless be helpful for patients. In other&#xD;
      cases there is such a paucity of clinical trial data that the use of therapeutic TMS is less&#xD;
      appropriate as a clinical treatment that the patient is charged for out of pocket and may&#xD;
      cost several thousand dollars, but is better suited for clinically-oriented research. This&#xD;
      has the added benefit of potentially helping the patient and providing investigators with&#xD;
      additional information from which to inform future clinical trials. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators propose to use TMS to treat tinnitus, for which few other treatments currently&#xD;
      exist. Tinnitus affects approximately 1% of the population and can be debilitating for&#xD;
      patients. Recent studies have shown some promise in reducing symptoms through&#xD;
      neuromodulation, but results are variable and more research is needed to improve treatment&#xD;
      protocols. The investigators plan to contribute to this body of research by taking an&#xD;
      evidence-based approach to test whether TMS is effective at reducing symptoms of tinnitus.&#xD;
      Each subject's MRI will be used to perform neuronavigated TMS stimulations while documenting&#xD;
      changes in symptom severity with self-report questionnaires and symptom severity scales. If&#xD;
      it is determined that a stimulation protocol is effective, 1-2 weeks of daily treatments will&#xD;
      be scheduled as part of that subject's personalized treatment plan.&#xD;

      1. Consent patients that have been referred to the Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Clinic at&#xD;
           the University of Iowa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will complete the following before any treatments occur: Tinnitus Intake&#xD;
           Questionnaire, Tinnitus Functional Index, Tinnitus Questionnaires, Iowa Tinnitus Primary&#xD;
           Function, Clinical Global Improvement Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients may undergo audiological assessment if they have not already been tested prior&#xD;
           to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will be required to obtain an MRI prior to treatment to aid in neuronavigated&#xD;
           stimulation unless there is have access to a previous clinical MRI for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. MRI images will be loaded into BrainSight or Localite, which are both frameless&#xD;
           stereotactic systems for MRI-guided TMS localization. If no MRI is acquired, the&#xD;
           subject's head will be transformed to MNI standard space within the software.&#xD;
           Neuronavigation allows us to place specific stimulation targets onto each subjects's&#xD;
           MRI. For this study, the investigators will be targeting left dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
           cortex, auditory cortices, and auditory association cortices; all targets are placed&#xD;
           anatomically by a neurologist. Infrared trackers on the subject's head and TMS coil&#xD;
           allow for neuronavigated stimulation of anatomical targets on the cortex with millimeter&#xD;
           precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The motor threshold of the subject will be assessed, which is the intensity of TMS&#xD;
           required to elicit motor evoked potentials from the hand 50% of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects will be fitted with an EEG cap to record neural activity before, during, and&#xD;
           after the initial test session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Single TMS pulses or brief trains of repetitive TMS lasting a few seconds will be&#xD;
           administered at 80 - 120% of motor threshold to targeted regions of the cerebral cortex&#xD;
           and cerebellum. A typical experiment will last 30 minutes to 2 hours. The patients are&#xD;
           told they can stop the experiment at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. After each stimulation, patients will be asked to rate any changes in symptom severity&#xD;
           and whether any side effects were experienced (Tinnitus Questionnaires, Clinical Global&#xD;
           Improvement Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. After the treatment session, the TMS pulse locations will be related to changes in&#xD;
           symptom severity as measured by self-report. If any stimulation treatments were&#xD;
           successful in reducing symptom severity, a treatment plan for that target will be&#xD;
           discussed and follow-up treatments may be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Follow up treatments will vary between patients but will typically consist of daily&#xD;
           treatments for up to 4 weeks or until treatment response is sustained. The patient can&#xD;
           withdraw from follow treatments at any time. Patients will be asked to complete the&#xD;
           following at these visits: Tinnitus Functional Index, Tinnitus Questionnaires, Iowa&#xD;
           Tinnitus Primary Function, Clinical Global Improvement Scale.&#xD;
