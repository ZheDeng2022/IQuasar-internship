  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare a dyadic intervention (Recovering Together) with an attention&#xD;
      placebo educational control in dyads of patients with acute neurological illnesses and their&#xD;
      caregivers at risk for chronic emotional distress. The primary aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility, credibility, and satisfaction with Recovering Together. The second&#xD;
      aim is to show proof of concept for sustained improvement in emotional distress, post&#xD;
      traumatic stress (PTS), resiliency and interpersonal communication outcomes in patients and&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to improve the care of patients (pts) admitted to the Neuroscience&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and their family caregivers (cgs) by conducting a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=80 dyads; 60 completers) of the dyadic&#xD;
      resiliency program (&quot;Recovering Together&quot;) to prevent chronic emotional distress in both pts&#xD;
      and their cgs. Eligible dyads include adult, English speaking pts with acute neurological&#xD;
      injury (ANI) admitted to the NICU, cleared medically and cognitively for participation by the&#xD;
      nursing team, and their primary cgs. Dyads who are randomly assigned to &quot;Recovering Together&quot;&#xD;
      will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person at hospitalization and 4 through live video&#xD;
      after discharge, to reduce burden and facilitate access to care) led by a clinical&#xD;
      psychologist. Dyads who are randomly assigned to the attention placebo educational control&#xD;
      condition will receive 6 manualized sessions (2 in person and 4 through live video with a&#xD;
      clinical psychologist), modeled after the Recovering Together program that will control for&#xD;
      the dose of the intervention and support from therapist. Dyads will complete assessment&#xD;
      surveys before, after the intervention and 3 months later. Clinical data on demographics,&#xD;
      diagnosis, ANI severity, and any medical complications will be extracted from electronic&#xD;
      health records.&#xD;

    <description>Dyads who are randomly assigned to the Recovering Together program will receive any usual clinic care as determined by their clinicians. Additionally, dyads will be invited to participate in 6 30-minute skills sessions. All sessions will include both pt and cg. A clinical psychologist will deliver the majority of sessions while the PI will deliver at least 10% of the sessions. The main intervention goal is to provide dyads with resiliency and interpersonal communication skills necessary to optimize their recovery and reduce emotional distress and PTS.</description>

    <description>Patients randomly assigned to the control condition will receive an educational program that mimics the dose and duration of the Recovering Together Program but without teaching any of the resiliency or interpersonal communication skills that are hypothesized to be responsible for improvement in emotional distress. The control will entail 2 in-person dyadic visits in the NICU and 4 dyadic virtual visits after discharge.</description>
