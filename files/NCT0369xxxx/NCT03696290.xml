  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial of the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of 2 doses of&#xD;
      Cayston (Aztreonam Lysine) compared to placebo in participants with bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by&#xD;
      cough, sputum production and frequent respiratory tract infections. There are currently no&#xD;
      licensed therapies for bronchiectasis approved by regulators in the United States or Europe.&#xD;
      The disease has a high morbidity, particularly in the presence of chronic P. aeruginosa and&#xD;
      other chronic Gram-negative infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will test the hypothesis that 12 months treatment with Aztreonam lysine for&#xD;
      inhalation will be safe and well tolerated, and will result in a significant increase in the&#xD;
      time to first pulmonary exacerbation in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo controlled parallel group trial with&#xD;
      four treatment arms. It will enroll 100 bronchiectasis patients with a history of at least 3&#xD;
      exacerbations in the previous year and the presence of chronic Gram-negative infection in&#xD;
      sputum at screening. Patients will be treated following a one month on, one month off&#xD;
      treatment regimen for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Aztrenam lysine in these&#xD;
      patients by recording adverse events and trial treatment withdrawals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neutrophilic inflammation is a feature of bronchiectasis and the levels of&#xD;
      neutrophilic inflammation predict the risk of future exacerbations. Neutrophilic inflammation&#xD;
      is highest in participants with P. aeruginosa and other Gram negative pathogens and&#xD;
      inflammation can be suppressed by inhaled antibiotic treatment . There is therefore a strong&#xD;
      rationale for the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of inhaled antibiotics in bronchiectasis have given mixed results to date. Several&#xD;
      open label studies in the late 1980's, testing nebulised Î²-lactams, demonstrated reduced&#xD;
      sputum purulence, sputum volume and improvements in inflammatory markers. In an early phase&#xD;
      II double-blind placebo-controlled trial by Barker et al. nebulised tobramycin significantly&#xD;
      reduced the primary outcome of P. aeruginosa bacterial load but was poorly tolerated by some&#xD;
      participants. Subsequently a single centre randomised controlled trial of nebulised&#xD;
      gentamicin for 12 months reported significant benefits but was limited by open label design&#xD;
      and small sample size. Haworth et al recruited 144 participants with chronic P. aeruginosa&#xD;
      infection and randomized participants to nebulised colistin or placebo. The trial narrowly&#xD;
      failed to meet its primary end-point (colistin group 165 days versus placebo 111 days;&#xD;
      p=0.11). In the secondary end-points, a large improvement in quality of life using the SGRQ&#xD;
      was noted (mean difference -10.5 points; p=0.006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aztreonam is an inhaled antibiotic licensed for treatment in cystic fibrosis. Two recent&#xD;
      phase III trials in bronchiectasis randomised 266 (AIR-BX1) and 274 (AIR-BX2) participants to&#xD;
      Aztreonam 75mg three times daily or placebo over the course of two 28-day treatment cycles&#xD;
      (with 28 days off treatment between cycles). The primary outcome was the newly developed&#xD;
      Quality of Life Bronchiectasis (QoL-B) questionnaire. Unfortunately the trial failed to meet&#xD;
      its primary end-point, with a significant change observed in the QOL-B respiratory symptom&#xD;
      score in AIR-BX2 but not in AIR-BX1. Treatment related adverse effects were also increased in&#xD;
      the Aztreonam treated participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likely explanations for the difficulties encountered in this previous trial include that the&#xD;
      trial population was quite heterogeneous, with many participants having no history of&#xD;
      exacerbations and appearing to have relatively mild disease. Many patients did not have a&#xD;
      history exacerbations in this trial whereas the ERS bronchiectasis guidelines suggest&#xD;
      limiting inhaled antibiotic use to patients with a history of 3 or more exacerbations per&#xD;
      year. The characteristics of the included participants included high rates of pulmonary&#xD;
      non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease and COPD. Nadig and Flume compared the characteristics&#xD;
      of included participants in this trial to their own population of participants with severe&#xD;
      bronchiectasis treated with inhaled antibiotics and identified little correlation, suggesting&#xD;
      that the trials included a skewed population that was not representative of real-life&#xD;
      clinical practice (Nadig and Flume AJRCCM 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, no dose finding studies were performed in bronchiectasis. The dose of 75mg three&#xD;
      times daily was chosen based on efficacy and safety in cystic fibrosis. The rates of adverse&#xD;
      events appear to be higher in bronchiectasis suggesting that doses selected for CF may not be&#xD;
      fully appropriate for participants with non-CF bronchiectasis. Whether lower doses may have&#xD;
      efficacy and better safety has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to determine the safety and efficacy of Aztreonam lysine in participants with&#xD;
      bronchiectasis and a history of frequent exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesise that Aztreonam lysine will be safe and well tolerated and will&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of exacerbations in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations. This trial will test two different doses of Aztreonam lysine compared&#xD;
      to placebo. The efficacy and safety of Aztreonam is supported by the evidence for Aztreonam&#xD;
      in cystic fibrosis where Aztreonam prolonged the time to first exacerbation by 21 days&#xD;
      compared to placebo and improved quality of life. The AIR-BX studies evaluated Aztreonam for&#xD;
      inhalation for only 2 treatment cycles. They showed suppression of chronic Gram-negative&#xD;
      airway bacterial load but were not designed to evaluate the impact of Aztreonam on the&#xD;
      frequency or time to first exacerbation. No attempt to identify the optimal dose was made.&#xD;
      The incidence of treatment related adverse effects was increased in AIR-BX1 but was more&#xD;
      balanced in AIR-BX2, a trial conducted primarily in European bronchiectasis participants. The&#xD;
      reason for this imbalance is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesise that 12 months treatment with Aztreonam lysine for inhalation&#xD;
      will be safe and well tolerated, and will result in a significant increase in the time to&#xD;
      first pulmonary exacerbation in participants with bronchiectasis and a history of frequent&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vital BE trial will evaluate two doses of aztreonam lysine to determine the optimal dose&#xD;
      for testing in future phase 3 trials.&#xD;

Scores are calculated for three domains:&#xD;
Symptoms, Activity and Impacts (Psycho-social) as well as a total score. The score correlates significantly with other measures of disease activity such as cough, dyspnoea, 6-min walk test and FEV1 as well as other measures of general health. http://www.healthstatus.sgul.ac.uk/sgrq</description>

    <description>QOL Bronchiectasis Questionnaire is a new, disease-specific health-related qualify of life (HRQOL) measure for adults with non-CF bronchiectasis. It has several different scales, including symptoms, physical, social and emotional functioning. It was developed using the FDA Guidance on Patient-Reported Outcomes1 beginning with interviews with health care providers, open-ended interviews with patients, item generation, cognitive testing and then a national psychometric validation. It is being used internationally in several clinical trials. It is also used clinically during routine clinic visits.&#xD;
Speight, J., &amp; Barendse, S. M. (2010). FDA guidance on patient reported outcomes. BMJ, 340. The questionnaire measures functioning in a variety of domains, including Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Vitality, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, Treatment Burden, Health Perceptions, and Respiratory Symptoms. High scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>
