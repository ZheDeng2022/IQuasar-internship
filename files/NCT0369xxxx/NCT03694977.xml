      &lt;Background&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Current status of treatment options in advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The cytotoxic chemotherapy, usually fluoropyrimidine + platinum combination regimen&#xD;
                is current standard of care. In case of HER2(+) gastric cancer, the addition of&#xD;
                trastuzumab on top of cytotoxic chemotherapy is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In second-line setting, the cytotoxic chemotherapy in combination with Ramucirumab&#xD;
                improved the patients' survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are few treatment options for gastric cancer patients who have been treated&#xD;
                with more than two lines of palliative chemotherapy. Patients with good performance&#xD;
                status even after failure to 2 kinds of palliative chemotherapy still need the&#xD;
                active anticancer treatment options. Therefore, this is the high unmet medical&#xD;
                need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current status of immunotherapy development in gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The importance of tumor microenvironment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The role of polarized macrophage in TME&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The role of polarized macrophage in gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential of combination of PD1 inhibitor and CSF-1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these rationales, we hypothesized that the combination of PD1 inhibitor and CSF1R&#xD;
      inhibitor might be synergistic in gastric cancer. However, the exact in vivo immune&#xD;
      modulation by each inhibitor has not been revealed so far. Therefore, we will conduct this&#xD;
      &quot;biomarker study of PDR001 in combination with MCS110 in gastric cancer&quot; to see the biologic&#xD;
      dynamic modulation with MCS110 and combination (MCS110/PDR001) and to see preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy signal with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Trial objectives&gt; Primary objective: To see biomarker changes (PDL1, TAM, TIL) by MCS110&#xD;
      monotherapy and MCS110/PDR001 combination (To see the biomarker changes by MCS110 monotherapy&#xD;
      at first, then, by MCS110/PDR001 combination in gastric cancer) Secondary objective: To see&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy (ORR, irRR, PFS, DOR, DCR, OS) and safety.&#xD;

      &lt;Background&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Current status of treatment options in advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Current status of immunotherapy development in gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Harnessing immune system to fight against cancer cells is one of highlighting&#xD;
                strategy in new drug development in almost all kinds of solid tumor including&#xD;
                gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In PD L1expressing gastric cancer, the anti-PD1 antibody monotherapy&#xD;
                (pembrolizumab) shows the antitumor efficacy. (Bang YJ et al. 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anti-PDL1 antibody (Avelumab) used in the first-line maintenance setting or&#xD;
                2nd-line setting of biomarker-unselected gastric cancer also shows promising&#xD;
                antitumor efficacy (Chung HC et al. ECCO/ESMO 2015, Oh DY et al. ASCO GI 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are many clinical trials using immune-oncology (IO) agents are ongoing in&#xD;
                1st-line setting, 2nd-line setting, 3rd-line setting and refractory setting.&#xD;
                Several strategies are being used, that is, IO monotherapy in biomarker-selected&#xD;
                population, IO+IO combination, IO+cytotoxic chemotherapy , and IO+other targeted&#xD;
                agents to improve the efficacy of harnessing immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Still, we don't know the exact biomarker for these IO agents in gastric cancer. Not&#xD;
                all patients get the benefit with these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The importance of tumor microenvironment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  From the immunotherapy point of view, the tumor microenvironment (TME) should be&#xD;
                considered for the successful immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In TME, many components working for antitumor immunity and intratumoral&#xD;
                immunosuppression exist. (Pitt JM et al. 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The most crucial and direct control of tumor cells is performed by CD4+ T helper&#xD;
                cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL). Th1 response, characterized by T cell&#xD;
                production of IFN-ɣ, TNF-α, IL-2 are considered to be the essential subset for&#xD;
                tumor rejection. However, Th1 response also contributes to tumor escape via&#xD;
                IFN-ɣ-mediated expression of the inhibitory checkpoint molecules PDL1 or via the&#xD;
                selection of resistant clones through tumor immunoediting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Long-term exposure to tumor antigen induces Th1 cells and other T cells that lack&#xD;
                the typical poly-functional phenotype and that express inhibitory receptors such as&#xD;
                PDL1. LAG-3, and TIM-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other subsets of CD4+T cells inhibit antitumor immune responses. CD4+Tregs is the&#xD;
                example. Tregs inhibit the antitumor activity of CTLs and NK cells either directly,&#xD;
                or indirectly via APCs. In addition to Tregs, Th2 cells can also block&#xD;
                Tcell-induced tumor rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TME can also directly impair intratumoral T cell proliferation, acting as another&#xD;
                mechanism for tumor evasion of immune surveillance. IDO production within the TME&#xD;
                is the example. IDO produced by myeloid cells and cancer cells catabolizes&#xD;
                tryptophan to generate kynurenine, which together promotes the conversion of naïve&#xD;
                T cells to Tregs,inhibition of Treg reprogramming to potentially anti-tumoral Th&#xD;
                cells, and increases MDSC functions through upregulation of IL-6 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The role of polarized macrophage in TME&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Macrophages are one of the major components of the TME, are recruited by chemokines&#xD;
                such as M-CSF and chemokine C-C motif ligand 2, and are produced mainly be tumor&#xD;
                cells (Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W, et al. 1996)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Macrophages are dynamic cells that can express different functional programs in&#xD;
                response to microenvironmental signals (Mantovani A, et al. 2004)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bacterial stimuli, IFN-ɣ and GM-CSF promote a proinflammatory M1-polarized&#xD;
                phenotype, whereas M-CSF, IL-4, and IL-13 favor the generation of folate receptor b&#xD;
                positive, IL-10 producing, immunosuppressive, M2-polarized macrophages. (Murray PJ,&#xD;
                et al. 2011). M1 macrophages also amplify TH1 responses, providing a positive&#xD;
                feedback loop in the antitumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Macrophages that infiltrate tumor tissues, also termed tumor-associated macrophages&#xD;
                (TAMs), can be driven by tumor-derived and T-cell derived cytokines to acquire such&#xD;
                a polarized phenotype, and have a key role in subversion of adaptive immunity and&#xD;
                in inflammatory circuits that promote tumor growth and progression. (Mantovani A,&#xD;
                et al. 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fully polarized M1 and M2 macrophages are the extremes of a continuum of functional&#xD;
                states; in contrast to this binary M1/M2 definition, there are several other&#xD;
                distinct populations that share features of both types.( Ojalvo LS, et al. 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The M2-polarized macrophages promote tumor progression and metastasis by activating&#xD;
                circuits that regulate tumor growth, adaptive immunity, stroma formation, and&#xD;
                angiogenesis, and can be used as prognostic indicators. ( Balkwill F, et al. 2001)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The role of polarized macrophage in gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In gastric cancer, infiltration of polarized TAMs is an independent prognostic&#xD;
                factor. (Zhang, et al. 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The number of peritoneal macrophages with the M2 phenotype (CD68+CD163+ or&#xD;
                CD68+CD204+) was significantly higher in gastric cancer patients with peritoneal&#xD;
                dissemination than in those without peritoneal dissemination. (Yamaguchi et al.&#xD;
                2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Higher expression of M2-related messenger RNA (IL-10, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, MMP-1,&#xD;
                amphiregulin), lower expression of M1-related messenger RNA (TNF-am CD80, CD86,&#xD;
                IL-12p40) were confirmed in the TAM of gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interestingly, macrophage co-culture with gastric cancer cells converted M1&#xD;
                phenotype into M2 phenotype. Moreover, the coexistence of MKN45 cells with M2&#xD;
                macrophages resulted in cancer cell proliferation and an acceleration of tumor&#xD;
                growth in the xenograft model.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In our hospital, we investigated the prognostic significance of TAM in MSI-high&#xD;
                gastric cancers using IHC. (Kim et al. 2015) CD68 and CD163 were used as markers&#xD;
                for total infiltrating macrophages and M2-polarized macrophages, respectively. The&#xD;
                density of CD68+ or CD163+ TAMs in four different areas (epithelial and stromal&#xD;
                compartments of both the tumor center and invasive front) were analyzed in 143&#xD;
                cases of MSI-high advanced gastric cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In multivariate survival analysis, CD163+ TAMs in four combined areas, stromal and&#xD;
           epithelial compartments of both tumor center and invasive front were independent&#xD;
           prognostic indicator in MSI-high gastric cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Polarized CD163+ TAM was also reported to be associated with increased angiogenesis&#xD;
                and CXCL12 expression in gastric cancer (Park et al. 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We investigated the role of cytokine and angiogenic factors in the gastric cancer&#xD;
                (Ock et al. 2015, Ock et al. 2016). High serum level of M-CSF is associated with&#xD;
                poor survival outcome in gastric cancer patients who received standard 1st-line&#xD;
                chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential of combination of PD1 inhibitor and CSF-1 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blockade of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) limits macrophage infiltration and&#xD;
                improves response of mammary carcinomas to chemotherapy. ( Ruffell B et al. Cancer&#xD;
                Cell 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In BRAF mutant melanoma model, CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397) reduced the recruitment of&#xD;
                CD11bC Gr1lo and CD11bC Gr1int M2-like macrophages, but this was accompanied by an&#xD;
                accumulation of CD11bC Gr1hi cells. PDL1 expression on remaining myeloid cells&#xD;
                potentially dampened the antitumor efficacy of BRAF inhibitor (PLX3397) and PLX4720&#xD;
                in combination, since PD1/PDL1 axis blockade improved outcome. (Ngiow SF et al.&#xD;
                2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In pancreatic cancer model, inhibiting signaling by the myeloid growth factor&#xD;
                receptor CSF1R can functionally reprogram macrophage responses that enhance antigen&#xD;
                presentation and productive antitumor T-cell responses. (Zhu Y et al. 2014)&#xD;
                However, CSF1R blockade also upregulated T-cell checkpoint molecules, including&#xD;
                PDL1 and CTLA4, thereby restraining beneficial therapeutic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In these cases, combination of CSF1R blockade and PD1 or CTLA4 inhibitor potently&#xD;
                decreased tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Trial design and plan&gt; Each dosing interval will be 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before 1st dosing of MCS110, 1st fresh tumor biopsy will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After 1st dosing of MCS110 monotherapy, 2nd fresh tumor biopsy will be done&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Then, combination of MCS110 with PDR001 will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After 1st dosing of MCS110/PDR001 combination, 3rd fresh tumor biopsy will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After that, the MCS110/PDR001 combination will be delivered to the patients until&#xD;
           disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or patient's consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At the time of disease progression, fresh tumor tissue will be obtained if possible&#xD;
           (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. In each tumor biopsy time point, blood sampling will be accompanied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Tumor response evaluation will be done every 2 cycles of MCS110/PDR001 combination&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational research that will be performed. The description of biomarker changes will be&#xD;
      the main purpose of this biomarker study. Therefore, the translational research is the main&#xD;
      interest of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The candidate biomarkers are as below, which was adopted from the MCS110Z2102 clinical trial.&#xD;
      However, the exact analysis items will be chosen based on the tumor tissue amount and&#xD;
      developing science during study period. The main focus will be on PDL1, TAM, TIL.&#xD;
