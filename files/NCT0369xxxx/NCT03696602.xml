  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep inhalation (DI) dilates normal airway precontracted with methacholine. The fact that&#xD;
      this effect is diminished or absent in asthma could be explained by the presence of bronchial&#xD;
      inflammation. The hypothesis tested was that DI induces more relaxation in methacholine&#xD;
      induced bronchoconstriction-solely determined by the smooth muscle contraction-than in&#xD;
      exercise induced bronchoconstriction, which is contributed to by both smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction and airway wall inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children were referred to the lung function department by their pediatric pulmonologist.&#xD;
      Asthma was defined by a complaint of wheezing, cough, dyspnoea or chest tightness at rest or&#xD;
      on exercising and a positive response to methacholine or exercise challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to exercise was considered positive when Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1)&#xD;
      decreased at least 8% from Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to methacholine was considered positive when FEV1 decreased at least 20% or Rrs&#xD;
      increased at least 50% from baseline, at or below a cumulated dose of 1,200 μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchodilator medications were discontinued at least 12 hours prior to the testing and&#xD;
      provocation allowed when the child had been free of respiratory symptoms for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
      and baseline FEV1 was larger than 70% pred. Exercise and methacholine groups were matched for&#xD;
      age, height, baseline FEV1 z-score, a moderate level of airway response to challenge and DI&#xD;
      amplitude ranging 40-60% of the predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from the children and their parents for the procedures. Procedures for&#xD;
      spirometry, exhaled fraction of NO (FENO), GrsDI (Respiratory conductance response to a deep&#xD;
      inhalation) and challenges have been described previously. Acceptable GrsDI's were analyzed&#xD;
      at a 10-20% FEV1 decrease from baseline. Statistics were performed using Mann-Whitney, Chi&#xD;
      square tests and multiple regression as required. Data are median and interquartile range.&#xD;
