  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study evaluating the safety and tolerability of TEW-7197 in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel in metastatic gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the dose escalation step (phase 1b), 3 subjects are registered for each dose step, and the&#xD;
      DLT is evaluated by administering the investigational product for 1 cycle (28 days). However,&#xD;
      for reasons other than toxicity related to the test drug, the patient was given a combination&#xD;
      of Paclitaxel and TEW-7197 (Vactosertib) during the DLT evaluation period during the first&#xD;
      cycle of the planned TEW-7197.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than 80% of the administered dose of (Vactosertib) is not administered, the patient&#xD;
      will be considered unevaluable for DLT and another patient will be enrolled. At the end of&#xD;
      one cycle of each cohort, the SMC decides whether to proceed to the next cohort. After&#xD;
      completing the DLT evaluation of the final phase 1 cohort, the recommended dose to proceed in&#xD;
      the dose expansion phase (Phase 2a) is determined. For subjects who have completed one cycle&#xD;
      (DLT evaluation period), administer the investigational drug at the same dose until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Tumor imaging (CT or MRI) for tumor evaluation&#xD;
      is performed after screening and C1D1. Assessment every 6 weeks (±2 weeks) and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment (EOT/DC). As efficacy evaluation items, PFS, OS, ORR, and DCR are evaluated&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1, and the amount of change in the biomarker is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion phase (phase 2a), 50 patients will be enrolled at the dose determined&#xD;
      in the dose escalation phase. Tumor imaging (CT or MRI) for tumor evaluation is evaluated&#xD;
      every 6 weeks (±2 weeks) after screening and C1D1, and at the end of treatment (EOT/DC). As&#xD;
      validity evaluation items, PFS, OS, ORR, and DCR according to RECIST 1.1 are evaluated, and&#xD;
      the amount of change in the biomarker is confirmed.&#xD;
