  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of LET-IMPT and standard chemotherapy, and how&#xD;
      well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III anal canal squamous cell&#xD;
      cancer. LET-IMPT is a type of radiation therapy that uses high energy proton &quot;beamlets&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;paint&quot; the radiation dose into the target and may help to kill tumor cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. Giving LET-IMPT and standard chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      anal canal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess physician-reported acute grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal, genitourinary and&#xD;
      hematologic toxicities at 12 weeks post-treatment for patients treated with linear energy&#xD;
      transfer (LET)-optimized, intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and compare to&#xD;
      contemporary controls treated with volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of this outcome for a future randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients on a prospective trial delivering&#xD;
      LET-optimized IMPT for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop guidelines and workflow to create and deliver anal canal cancer treatments&#xD;
      using LET-optimized IMPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate complete response rate at 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate local progression free survival, distant metastasis-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival at 24 and 48 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate rates of patient-reported acute toxicity, function, distress and quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate rates of patient-reported late toxicity, function, distress and QOL every 6&#xD;
      months for 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the value of proton therapy by comparing Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing&#xD;
      data from the date of consultation until the date of the 12-week follow up visit&#xD;
      post-treatment with contemporary controls treated with VMAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare dose to the pelvic bone marrow, bowel, bladder and genitalia between&#xD;
      LET-optimized IMPT, traditionally-optimized IMPT and VMAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess rates of leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia at 12-weeks post-treatment for&#xD;
      patients treated with LET-optimized IMPT and compare to contemporary controls treated with&#xD;
      VMAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate white blood cell counts (WBC), absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and&#xD;
      absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) with dose to the pelvic bone marrow for patients treated&#xD;
      with LET-optimized IMPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To encourage optional co-enrollment on study 2014-0543 so that tumor deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA), rectal microbiome and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging-based biomarkers&#xD;
      can be assessed for patients receiving LET-optimized IMPT and compared with other patients&#xD;
      enrolled on 2014-0543 receiving VMAT-based radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo linear energy transfer-optimized intensity modulated proton therapy 5 times&#xD;
      per week for 5-6 weeks. Patients also receive standard cisplatin and fluorouracil&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) weekly for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 weeks.&#xD;
