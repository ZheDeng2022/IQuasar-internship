      Investigate myelin alterations in high school football players with mTBI&#xD;

      The lack of highly sensitive clinical neuroimaging and neuropsychiatric markers of subtle&#xD;
      changes due to mTBI makes it difficult to characterize injury severity and to predict&#xD;
      outcomes. White matter tracts in the brain, both myelinated and non-myelinated, are&#xD;
      susceptible to damage from impact-acceleration forces experienced during a TBI,5-7 and there&#xD;
      is evidence that significant white matter injury and myelin loss occurs in mTBI. In addition,&#xD;
      this damage may be chronic and can negatively affect neural processing speed and cognitive&#xD;
      function. Traditional anatomical and function MRI imaging sequences include clinical&#xD;
      sequences such as traditional T1 and T2 sequences, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery&#xD;
      (FLAIR), three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE),&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and gradient MRI. While a number of advanced imaging&#xD;
      techniques, notably magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor and quantitative T1 and T2&#xD;
      imaging (MTI, DTI, qT1 and qT2, respectively), have been used previously to study white&#xD;
      matter in neurosurgical diseases, these methods provide only indirect, non-specific&#xD;
      information related to myelin content. For example, these modalities can tell when there is&#xD;
      swelling that is affecting the movement of water, which may be indicative of a process that&#xD;
      would affect myelin, but they cannot give specific information about the amount of myelin&#xD;
      surrounding a nerve. An emerging multicomponent relaxometry technique, termed multicomponent&#xD;
      driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT), provides a voxel-wise&#xD;
      estimation ranging from 0 to 1 for myelin content, with higher values providing an indirect&#xD;
      marker of greater myelin integrity. Two studies have shown increased myelin after injury in&#xD;
      football and ice hockey players.8 DTI, which primarily gives information about the&#xD;
      myelin-axon bundle interactions, has shown decreased fractional anisotropy after&#xD;
      mTBI,myelin-axon bundle interactions, has shown decreased fractional anisotropy after mTBI,&#xD;
      indicating that the myelin that is present is less organized.8 Combining mcDESPOT and DTI&#xD;
      findings, it is possible to see a more nuanced picture of the remyelination process after&#xD;
      mTBI. In the present program, the investigators propose adding the mcDESPOT sequence to the&#xD;
      MRI scanner in accordance with the MRI manufacturer's technical requirements. Although the&#xD;
      sequences obtained for mcDESPOT are nearly identical sequences used in clinical practice, the&#xD;
      flip-angles are changed so that they cannot be read like a traditional image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rather, the data have to be post-processed by a computer in order to be able to derive myelin&#xD;
      information. The mcDESPOT sequences are FDA approved, and present no additional risk over&#xD;
      traditional clinical MRI sequences. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a class of proteins involved&#xD;
      in the metabolism of fats in the body, and is important in Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. How the body makes this protein is genetically coded in the APoE&#xD;
      gene. One form of this gene, APoE allele 4 (APoE4) is found in about 25% of the population,&#xD;
      but in 60% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Infants with this allele also show&#xD;
      decreased myelination at a young age. It is postulated that this defect affects the brain's&#xD;
      ability to myelinate and remyelinate, leading to decreased or disorganized myelination, which&#xD;
      then leads to an increased risk for development of dementia. This study aims to build upon&#xD;
      preliminary data collected by the principal investigator (PI) showing increased but&#xD;
      disorganized myelin in collegiate football players, by confirming and reproducing these&#xD;
      results in a larger population. This study will also add the component of genetic testing for&#xD;
      the APoE4 allele to see if there is a sub-segment of the study population that may be at&#xD;
      increased risk for brain injury after mTBI and subsequent findings in the research scans. The&#xD;
      mcDESPOT and genetic testing findings will also be correlated with routine neuropsychology&#xD;
      concussion assessment results.&#xD;
