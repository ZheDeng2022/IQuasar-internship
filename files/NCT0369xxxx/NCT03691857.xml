  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of chest pain has revolutionized its prognosis, primarily by improving urgent&#xD;
      diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Currently, acute dyspnea is twice as frequent as chest&#xD;
      pain and its associated mortality is much higher (16% of acute dyspnea admitted to emergency&#xD;
      departments (ED) ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inappropriate treatment of acute dyspnea in the ED is frequent (30%) and is associated with a&#xD;
      tripling of intra-hospital mortality after adjustment for confounding factors (2.83, IC 1.48&#xD;
      to 5.41, p=0.002). Other elements have also highlighted the importance of a quick and&#xD;
      appropriate acute dyspnea diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 2015 European Guidelines on acute heart failure emphasize the need for appropriate&#xD;
           treatment within 90 minutes after the first medical contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inadequate treatment of chronic bronchitis decompensation is associated with a doubling&#xD;
           of intra-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initiation of antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission for pneumonia is&#xD;
           recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30% of pulmonary embolisms are not diagnosed during the initial emergency department&#xD;
           visit, whereas their mortality in the absence of treatment is 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung, venous and (simplified) cardiac ultrasound is associated with improved diagnostic&#xD;
      performance in ED. However, no ultrasound algorithm dedicated to emergency physicians has&#xD;
      been formally validated. The Blue Protocol (Lichtenstein et al., Chest 2008) has been&#xD;
      validated in intensive care patients with very different phenotypes than those admitted to&#xD;
      the ED. Pivetta et al. (Chest 2015) proposed an algorithm focused solely for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      heart failure, thus not providing a diagnosis for all the other causes of dyspnea in ED.&#xD;
      Finally, Zanbonetti et al. (Chest 2017) proposed an &quot;unguided&quot; ultrasound use, notably&#xD;
      integrating inferior vena cava evaluation. However, measuring the inferior vena cava is&#xD;
      difficult at the start of ED management when patients are in acute respiratory distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess the feasibility and accuracy of a new pragmatic and original&#xD;
      ultrasound algorithm adapted for acute dyspnea diagnosis in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This primary objective of this prospective multicenter study is to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of an ultrasound algorithm (EMERALD-US) dedicated to emergencies using lung, cardiac&#xD;
      and vascular ultrasound for the 3 main dyspnea causes (heart failure, pneumonia and&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) in patients with acute non-traumatic dyspnea&#xD;
      managed in the emergency department. Ultrasound exams will be blindly read by a centralized&#xD;
      core laboratory after the standardized acquisition of all exams by a physician not involved&#xD;
      in the care of patients in the ED. The main discharge diagnosis from initial hospitalization&#xD;
      (heart failure, pneumonia and obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation) will be adjudicated&#xD;
      by a college of 3 senior physicians (emergency physician, cardiologist and internist) blinded&#xD;
      to the use of ultrasound in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A/ Assess the feasibility of the ultrasound algorithm (EMERALD-US) in emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/ Assess the association between the diagnosis obtained from the ultrasound algorithm&#xD;
      (EMERALD-US) and the results of additional (laboratory and radiological exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C/ Assess the diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound algorithm (EMERALD-US) for less frequent&#xD;
      dyspnea causes (pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D/ Assess, the diagnostic accuracy of clinical (including BREST score), laboratory and&#xD;
      radiological variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E/ Assess, the improvement in diagnosis accuracy with the ultrasound algorithm (EMERALD-US)&#xD;
      on top of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical, laboratory and radiological exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F/ Assess the association between misdiagnosis (without using ultrasound) and survival at&#xD;
      D30.&#xD;
