    <textblock>
      Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system fight cancer. When the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these drugs wears off, it may be possible to renew their effectiveness by&#xD;
      combining it with a special type of radiation therapy called stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT). SBRT is a commonly used type of radiation therapy that gives high dose&#xD;
      radiation with high precision to tumors in 1-5 treatments. Radiation therapy, such as SBRT&#xD;
      can also treat sites of metastases. The use of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with SBRT&#xD;
      has been suggested to improve the immune response against cancer but has not been tested in a&#xD;
      formal clinical trial. Up to three lesions can be treated with SBRT. This study only allows&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors that are already approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of your disease. All radiation therapy will be done on machines which are FDA&#xD;
      approved.&#xD;

             at least 25% in the cross-sectional diameter of a known lesion) on most recent&#xD;
