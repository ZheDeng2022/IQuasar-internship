  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma patients who are ineligible for a transplant have inferior&#xD;
      outcomes to that of the transplant population. This is an area of high unmet need and calls&#xD;
      for newer therapies with novel mechanisms of action to improve survival in this&#xD;
      non-transplant eligible (NTE) group. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38&#xD;
      expressed at high levels on myeloma plasma cells. In phase 1/2 studies, it has demonstrated&#xD;
      impressive single agent activity in relapse and refractory myeloma with a very acceptable&#xD;
      toxicity profile. This set the stage for combinations with daratumumab to increase efficacy&#xD;
      and improve outcomes of patients in both the relapse refractory and newly diagnosed settings.&#xD;
      Two large Phase 2 trails using lenalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib and dexamethasone&#xD;
      along with Daratumumab demonstarted the impressive efficacy of antibody based 3 drug&#xD;
      combinations in the relapsed refractory myeloma setting. More recently a large clinical trial&#xD;
      using a Bortezomib based 4 drug combination with Daratumumab was reported from Europe in the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of transplant ineligible Myeloma patients showing very good survival&#xD;
      outcomes. Hence the investigators hypothesize that the combination of Daratumumab with&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone in the NTE population may therefore improve efficacy and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma patients who ineligible for a transplant have inferior&#xD;
      outcomes compared to that of the transplant population. This is an area of high unmet need&#xD;
      and calls for newer therapies with novel mechanisms of action to better improve survival in&#xD;
      this non-transplant eligible (NTE) group. Currently NTE patients will be treated with a&#xD;
      Bortezomib based or Lenalidomide based doublet or triplet regimen as first-line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38 expressed at high levels on myeloma&#xD;
      plasma cells. In phase 1/2 studies, it has demonstrated impressive single agent activity in&#xD;
      relapse and refractory myeloma with a very acceptable toxicity profile and is a promising new&#xD;
      treatment. This set the stage for combinations with daratumumab to increase efficacy and&#xD;
      improve outcomes of patients in both the relapse refractory and newly diagnosed settings.&#xD;
      Addition of daratumumab to any number of the backbone regimes have been shown to be of good&#xD;
      efficacy. 2 phase 1 / 2 studies established the dosing regimen for Daratumumab as a single&#xD;
      agent in patients who relapse after prior lenalidomide and bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, results from 2 randomised studies comparing Daratumumab plus lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and Daratumumab plus bortezomib and&#xD;
      dexamethasone compared to bortezomib and dexamethasone, showed that the addition of&#xD;
      Daratumumab significantly improved response and progression free survival, including a high&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate of more than 20% in the relapse myeloma&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent study showed that a different 4 drug combination of Daratumumab, bortezomib&#xD;
      and Melphalan and Prednisolone in the front line setting of non-transplant Myeloma had&#xD;
      promising response rates and was a quite tolerable combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above Daratumumab trials demostrated that deeper responses are achieved by antibody -&#xD;
      Proteasome inhibitor or Antibody - ImiD combinations. It is known that deeper response in&#xD;
      myeloma are associated with longer progression free and overall survival. Hence this trial&#xD;
      using the three drug combination of Daratumumab, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone is proposed to&#xD;
      explore its efficacy by demonstarting an improvement in overall response rates, complete&#xD;
      response rates and to document its safety/tolerability in our population.&#xD;
