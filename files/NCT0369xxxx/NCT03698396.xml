    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of allogenic islet&#xD;
      transplantation in type 1 diabetic patients performed at the University of Virginia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to demonstrate that islet transplantation can be performed safely and reliably&#xD;
      achieves better glycemic control than state-of-the-art insulin treatment in management of&#xD;
      type 1 diabetic patients with brittle control and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
      with hypoglycemia unawareness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by islet autoimmunity followed by immune destruction of the&#xD;
      β-cells. In 2015 the International Diabetes Federation reported that 36 million people suffer&#xD;
      from T1D globally, while it is estimated that 1.4 millions of Americans have T1D. Although&#xD;
      life expectancy of patients with T1D has much improved since the introduction of insulin&#xD;
      therapy, chronic complications, including blindness and renal failure, are hampering the&#xD;
      quality of life and represent a multi-billion dollar annual burden on the health care system&#xD;
      of industrialized countries. Keeping blood glucose levels under tight control represents the&#xD;
      most effective way either to prevent the onset or to reduce the progression of the chronic&#xD;
      complications of T1D. At present, such a goal may be accomplished by treating patients with&#xD;
      intensified therapy regimens consisting of multiple insulin injections, which involve&#xD;
      accurate blood glucose monitoring. However, administration of subcutaneous insulin can never&#xD;
      approximate pulsatile insulin secretory patterns of the normal β-cells, and rarely attains&#xD;
      normal blood glucose levels without the risk of major hypoglycemic episodes. In addition,&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy is only suitable for selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreas transplantation is an alternative therapeutic modality which can stop the&#xD;
      progression of diabetic complications without increasing the incidence of hypoglycemic&#xD;
      events. Unfortunately, this procedure, usually performed simultaneously with a kidney graft,&#xD;
      has a high morbidity and a significant mortality rate. Pancreas transplantation, in spite of&#xD;
      an important impact on the quality of life in successful cases, is often restricted to&#xD;
      selected patients. In this context, islet transplantation offers and alternative treatment&#xD;
      solution, normalizing glucose metabolism without the risk of hypoglycemia and avoiding the&#xD;
      potentially life threatening complications of whole pancreas grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical islet transplantation has continuously advanced over the past two decades, with&#xD;
      clear improvements in islet manufacturing and clinical outcomes, therefore restore insulin&#xD;
      production and ameliorate glycemic instability in patients with T1D. Currently, the procedure&#xD;
      is primarily indicated for patients with a history of life threatening severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
      and hypoglycemia unawareness for which islet transplantation has been highly effective both&#xD;
      in the short and long terms. According to the most recent public presentation from the&#xD;
      collaborative islet transplant registry (CITR), 1055 allogeneic islet transplantations have&#xD;
      been reported by 50 islet transplantation centers in North America, Europe, Australia, and&#xD;
      South Korea. Of these cases, islet transplant alone was the most frequent procedure (n=858)&#xD;
      followed by islet after kidney (IAK) and simultaneous islet and kidney transplantation (SIK)&#xD;
      (n=197). CITR data has identified factors that predict the achievement and maintenance of&#xD;
      insulin independence as recipient age over 35 years, more than half a million infused islet&#xD;
      equivalent (IEQ), islet glucose stimulation index &gt;1.5, induction therapy with Tcell&#xD;
      depletion, and TNF-α inhibitor and maintenance with calcineurin inhibitor and mTOR&#xD;
      inhibition. The combination of these factors in 60 recipients resulted in stable insulin&#xD;
      independence after 5 years in 60 % of the patients. Recipient age, IEQ, and calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor (CNI) maintenance were also predictive of positive C-peptide levels (≥0.3 ng/ml;&#xD;
      n=308) and HbA1c (&lt;6.5 % or drop ≥2 %; n=530) and age and IEQ predicted absence of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events (SHE) (&gt;90 % of patients at 5 years). As another indicator of&#xD;
      improvements in the procedure, the number of adverse events has dropped significantly in the&#xD;
      past 5 years, with 80 % free of any adverse events.&#xD;
