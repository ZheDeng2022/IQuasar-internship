  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after endodontic treatment is considered the most disturbing problem facing both the&#xD;
      patient and the dentist especially in cases of symptomatic pulpitis as the patient is&#xD;
      expecting to relief the pain that already exists.Therefore, this study aims to find a&#xD;
      solution for the post-operative pain felt by the patient with symptomatic pulpitis in&#xD;
      mandibular molars through comparing post-operative pain following use of 2Shape and Protaper&#xD;
      Next rotary systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Root canal preparation is the most important step in endodontic treatment. For successful&#xD;
      treatment, pulp tissue, dentin debris and microorganisms should be completely eradicated from&#xD;
      the root canal system.However, it has been reported that all the instrumentation techniques&#xD;
      (manual or mechanical) cause debris extrusion into the periradicular tissue resulting in&#xD;
      periapical inflammation that causes post-operative pain and flare up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation technique and instrument design were found to be related to the amount of&#xD;
      debris extruded which is the main cause of post-operative pain. It has been reported that&#xD;
      rotary NiTi systems cause less debris extrusion than manual instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within NiTi systems, instrument design, taper and tip size were found to affect debris&#xD;
      extrusion. Therefore, new innovations in the instrument designs are introduced in order to&#xD;
      reduce post-operative pain and flare up incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is established to compare the effect of 2 different rotary systems on&#xD;
      postoperative pain in patients with symptomatic pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of rotary instrumentation using Protaper&#xD;
      Next rotary system versus 2Shape rotary system on postoperative pain and the number of&#xD;
      analgesics taken by the patient following single visit root canal treatment in mandibular&#xD;
      molars with symptomatic pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing the intensity of post-operative pain using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) immediately&#xD;
      after root canal treatment and post-appointment at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for / and number of analgesic tablets taken within 3 days after end of&#xD;
           endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instrument separation during instrumentation.&#xD;
