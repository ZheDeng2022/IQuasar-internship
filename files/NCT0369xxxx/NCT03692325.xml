  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an immunotherapy drug, as a possible treatment for oral&#xD;
      proliferative verrucous leukoplakia (OPVL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether it&#xD;
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug/s is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug works) of nivolumab&#xD;
      in treating OPVL and or prolonging the onset of possible malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a type of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the body's own&#xD;
      immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been demonstrated to activate the immune&#xD;
      system to attack cancer cells in participants with different types of cancers. OPVL has a&#xD;
      high risk for turning into cancer and the investigators are testing if nivolumab may help to&#xD;
      shrink the white lesions in the participant's mouth and reduce cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab for the treatment&#xD;
      of participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      (SCCHN). Squamous cell carcinoma is the kind of cancer that OPVL can transform into.&#xD;

             (OPVL), as defined by: multifocal lesions (≥ 2) or contiguous lesions ≥ 3 cm or a&#xD;
             single lesion ≥ 4 cm in largest diameter (at least one lesion with any degree of&#xD;
             dysplasia). (Note: no restriction on the length of time that patients have had one or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide blood and tissue from diagnostic biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. WOCBP should plan to use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5&#xD;
             months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after&#xD;
             the last dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 iu/l or equivalent units of hcg) at screening. Pregnancy test&#xD;
             will be repeated on the day of the first dose of study drug (before administration),&#xD;
             although results of this test are not required for registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &quot;Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced&#xD;
             menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12&#xD;
             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or&#xD;
             physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented&#xD;
             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method with&#xD;
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will&#xD;
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (ie, who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require&#xD;
             contraception&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known carcinoma in situ (CIS) or invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.&#xD;

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus carrier or a diagnosis of immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating&#xD;
             presence of virus, e.g., Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, Australia antigen)&#xD;
             positive, or Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-RNA is negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A personal history of other active malignancies, with the exception of&#xD;
             non-melanomatous skin cancers, low-risk prostate adenocarcinoma on active&#xD;
             surveillance, or treated cancers in remission for the last 5 years&#xD;
