  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potentially powerful&#xD;
      diagnostic tool for the management of brain cancer and other conditions in which the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier is compromised. This trial studies how well precise DCE MRI works in&#xD;
      diagnosing participants with high grade glioma that has come back or melanoma that has spread&#xD;
      to the brain. The specially-tailored acquisition and reconstruction (STAR) DCE MRI could&#xD;
      provide improved assessment of brain tumor status and response to therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To optimize and technically validate specially-tailored acquisition and reconstruction&#xD;
      (STAR) DCE-MRI based on the accuracy and reproducibility of whole-brain tracer-kinetic (TK)&#xD;
      parameter maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To develop a robust clinical implementation of STAR DCE-MRI. II. To clinically evaluate&#xD;
      STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Participants with recurrent high-grade glioma undergo STAR DCE-MRI every 2 months,&#xD;
      and just prior to and 4-6 weeks after starting bevacizumab treatment. If there is concern for&#xD;
      tumor progression (i.e. increased contrast enhancement), more frequent MRI scans will be&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Participants with melanoma brain metastases undergo STAR DCE-MRI at baseline and&#xD;
      4-6 weeks after therapy. Participants may undergo more frequent MRI if there is concern for&#xD;
      tumor progression.&#xD;

    <description>The raw data will be acquired at the voxel level. Then the analytic parameters will be extracted from voxel-wise data such as the mean, median, interquartile range, skewness and kurtosis. Receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC) will be used to illustrate the univariate prediction accuracy for each parameter in predicting the clinically determined outcome. The pattern of change with different clinical response status will be visually illustrated using spaghetti plots or other graphical approaches. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) with 10-fold cross validation will be used for building the final prediction model and determine the diagnostic cut point(s). CART analysis will also include demographics, comorbidity information, and relevant biological variables including sex. The final model accuracy will be assessed using area under the curve (AUC) when fitting a ROC curve using predicted outcome against the actual outcome.</description>
