    <textblock>
      Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is the standard treatment for patients with a large vessel&#xD;
      occlusion (LVO) stroke. Direct presentation of patients with an LVO to a comprehensive stroke&#xD;
      center (CSC) reduces onset-to-treatment time by approximately an hour and thereby improves&#xD;
      clinical outcome. However, a reliable tool for prehospital LVO-detection is currently not&#xD;
      available. Previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies have shown that hemispheric hypoxia&#xD;
      quickly results in slowing of the EEG-signal. Dry electrode EEG caps allow reliable EEG&#xD;
      measurement in less than five minutes. We hypothesize that dry electrode EEG is an accurate&#xD;
      and feasible diagnostic test for LVO in the prehospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELECTRA-STROKE is a diagnostic pilot study that consists of four phases. In phases 1, 2 and&#xD;
      3, technical and logistical feasibility of performing dry electrode EEGs are tested in&#xD;
      different in-hospital settings: the outpatient clinic (sample size: max. 20 patients),&#xD;
      Neurology ward (sample size: max. 20 patients) and emergency room (sample size: max. 250&#xD;
      patients), respectively. In the final phase, ambulance paramedics will perform dry electrode&#xD;
      EEGs in 386 patients with a suspected stroke. The primary outcome is specificity of dry&#xD;
      electrode EEG for LVO-detection. Secondary outcomes include sensitivity of dry electrode EEG&#xD;
      for LVO-detection and technical and logistical feasibility of performing dry electrode EEGs&#xD;
      in the prehospital setting. Sample size calculation is based on an expected specificity of&#xD;
      70% and an incidence of LVO stroke of 5%.&#xD;

      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) if&#xD;
      there is a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation (LVO-a). Because of its&#xD;
      complexity, EVT is performed in selected hospitals only. Currently, approximately half of EVT&#xD;
      eligible patients are initially admitted to hospitals that do not provide this therapy. This&#xD;
      delays initiation of treatment by approximately an hour, which decreases the chance of a good&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Direct presentation of all patients with a suspected AIS in EVT capable&#xD;
      hospitals is not feasible, since only approximately 7% of these patients are eligible for&#xD;
      EVT. Therefore, an advanced triage method that reliably identifies patients with an LVO-a in&#xD;
      the ambulance is necessary. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be suitable for this purpose, as&#xD;
      preliminary studies suggest that slow EEG activity in the delta frequency range correlates&#xD;
      with lesion location on cerebral imaging. Use of dry electrode EEG caps will enable&#xD;
      relatively unexperienced paramedics to perform a reliable measurement without the EEG&#xD;
      preparation time associated with 'wet' EEGs. Combined with algorithms for automated signal&#xD;
      analysis, we expect the time of EEG recording and analysis to eventually be below five&#xD;
      minutes, which would make stroke triage in the ambulance by EEG logistically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that dry electrode cap EEG can be used in patients with a suspected AIS to&#xD;
      identify patients with an LVO-a in the ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and validate an algorithm based on dry electrode cap EEG data that accurately&#xD;
      determines the likelihood of an LVO-a in patients with a suspected AIS in the ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diagnostic study consists of four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Optimization of measurement time and software settings of the dry electrode cap EEG&#xD;
      in a non-emergency setting in patients in whom a regular EEG is/will be performed for&#xD;
      standard medical care. Sample size: maximum of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Optimization of measurement time and software settings of the dry electrode cap EEG&#xD;
      in patients close to our target population in a non-emergency setting. Sample size: maximum&#xD;
      of 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Validation of several existing algorithms and development of one or more new&#xD;
      algorithms for LVO-a detection, as well as optimization of logistics and software settings of&#xD;
      the dry electrode EEG cap in patients close to our target population in an in-hospital&#xD;
      emergency setting. Sample size: maximum of 250 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Validation of several existing algorithms and algorithms developed in phase 3 for&#xD;
      LVO-a detectionin patients with a suspected AIS in the ambulance, as well as assessment of&#xD;
      technical and logistical feasibility of performing EEG with dry electrode caps in patients&#xD;
      with a suspected AIS in the ambulance. Sample size: maximum of 386 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Patients in the outpatient clinic of the Clinical Neurophysiology department of the&#xD;
      AMC, in whom a regular EEG has been/will be performed for standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Patients with an AIS admitted to the Neurology ward of the coordinating hospital&#xD;
      with an LVO-a (after reperfusion therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Patients with a suspected AIS in the emergency room (ER) of the coordinating&#xD;
      hospital (before reperfusion therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Patients with a suspected AIS in the ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing a dry electrode cap EEG (in phase 1 in the outpatient clinic, in phase 2 during&#xD;
      hospital admission, in phase 3 in the ER and in phase 4 in the ambulance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN END POINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: specificity of dry electrode cap EEG for diagnosis of LVO-a in suspected&#xD;
      AIS patients in the ambulance;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing one or more new EEG data based algorithms, with optimal diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
           for LVO-a detection with ambulant EEG;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of dry&#xD;
           electrode cap EEG for diagnosis of LVO-a in suspected AIS patients in the ambulance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical and logistical feasibility of performing dry electrode cap EEGs on patients&#xD;
           with a suspected AIS in the ambulance.&#xD;

To do this, the investigators will use the WaveguardTM dry electrode EEG cap and compatible eegoTM amplifier, developed by ANT Neuro B.V. Netherlands and both CE marked as medical devices in the European Union (see appendices 1 and 2). Both products will be used within the intended use as described in the user manuals.
