    <textblock>
      This study will describe the treatment of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) in clinical&#xD;
      practice and explore the effect of patient characteristics on treatment response. This study&#xD;
      will follow 200 people with hyperhidrosis over 18 months. Anyone with primary hyperhidrosis&#xD;
      (excessive sweating not due to another medical condition) over the age of 12 may participate.&#xD;
      Study participants will have multiple office visits during which they will asked to rate the&#xD;
      severity of their sweat production in multiple areas (i.e. underarms, hands, feet), answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding their disease and treatment, and undergo a non-invasive measurement&#xD;
      of sweat production called gravimetry. Gravimetry is performed by placing absorbent material&#xD;
      in an area, such as the underarms, for a set amount of time and then measuring the amount of&#xD;
      sweat collected. In between clinic visits, study participants will be contacted&#xD;
      electronically to answer several questions regarding their disease and treatment.&#xD;

      Subject Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place at SLUCare Dermatology Des Peres Clinic. Patients with non-study&#xD;
      related appointments with Dr. Glaser regarding the management of primary hyperhidrosis will&#xD;
      be approached by a research member. Patients will be given ample time to review study design&#xD;
      and have questions and concerns addressed. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, study&#xD;
      purpose and design, signed consent (parent or guardian will sign if subject is a minor),&#xD;
      assent (for minors only, not signed) and HIPAA release are attained, the patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be recruiting two types of patients for this study. (1) New patients&#xD;
      being seen for evaluation for primary hyperhidrosis. These subjects will be presenting to the&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis clinic for the first time. If enrolled, these subjects will have all data&#xD;
      prospectively collected. (2) Established patients being seen for ongoing management of&#xD;
      primary hyperhidrosis who have documented baseline gravimetric measurements (defined as&#xD;
      measurements taken while the patient was undergoing no active therapies for primary&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis). These subjects will be presenting to the hyperhidrosis clinic for continued&#xD;
      care. If enrolled, these subjects will have some data collected retrospectively with the&#xD;
      remainder collected prospectively (see below for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal or Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. If a subject desires withdraw from the&#xD;
      study, the subject will be give a reason for study withdraw which will be included in&#xD;
      publication. If a subject misses a scheduled visit the subject will be contacted via phone to&#xD;
      ask if the subject is withdrawing from the study or reschedule a visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the subjects are only undergoing gravimetry, a non invasive way of measuring sweat&#xD;
      production, it is highly unlikely that there would be any reason to discontinue a subjects&#xD;
      participation due to safety. However, if at any point the supervising provider feels that a&#xD;
      patient is at risk of harm the subject may be withdrawn from the study. In this case, a&#xD;
      reason would be recorded for publication purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen Failures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those that fail screening, all information collected prior to that time will be shredded&#xD;
      and disposed of in confidentiality trash bins. Only a reason for failing to pass screening&#xD;
      will be recorded for publication purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened, sign consent (parent or guardian will sign if subject is a minor),&#xD;
      review assent (only applicable to minors) HIPAA release, and enrolled at an initial visit.&#xD;
      Patients will have a monthly electronic or telephone survey to fill out. Patients will be&#xD;
      seen every 3 months in clinic until the patient has achieved treatment response and/or no&#xD;
      treatment changes are required. 6 months after this visit, the patient will be seen in clinic&#xD;
      again***. If the subject has a sustained treatment response and/or has no treatment change,&#xD;
      the subject will exit the study. If these conditions are not met, then the subject will&#xD;
      resume 3 month visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that these visit will overlap with non-study related visits that&#xD;
      occur as a part of management of the patient's disease. Disease management decisions, such as&#xD;
      which therapy to prescribe, will occur independently of this study and will not be affected&#xD;
      by study participation. All visits will occur within 18 months after the study begins. No&#xD;
      further study encounters will occur after this time period regardless of treatment changes or&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** Subjects may choose to forgo this 6 months visit and complete it electronically or by&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Visit 1, 1 hour:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will first verify his or her name and contact information. After the subject&#xD;
      agrees to study participation they will sign a consent (permission) and a release of health&#xD;
      information. Consent will be signed by parent or guardian if the subject is a minor. If the&#xD;
      subject is a minor assent will also be reviewed with the subject. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through an interview with a research team member and chart review, the following data will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale score (a scale that rates how the subject feels&#xD;
           sweating affects daily activities) for all sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scalp&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Underarms&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo gravimetric measurements of all sites affected by hyperhidrosis as&#xD;
      detailed in the attachment. Areas affected by HH will be defined by areas with an HDSS 3 or&#xD;
      greater. For details on the gravimetry protocol, see attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Visits, follow-up, 30 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected through subject interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HDSS for all sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire regarding the subject's disease state (see attachment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo gravimetric measurements for sites with previous measurements. For&#xD;
      detailed protocol see attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Established Patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Visit 1, 1 hour:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will first verify his or her name and contact information. After the subject&#xD;
      agrees to study participation they will sign a consent (permission) and a release of health&#xD;
      information. Consent will be signed by parent or guardian if the subject is a minor. If the&#xD;
      subject is a minor assent will also be reviewed with the subject. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through chart review, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (defined as data collected while the patient was not undergoing any treatment)&#xD;
           HDSS score and gravimetric measurements for all sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of treatment changes since initiating care&#xD;
&#xD;
