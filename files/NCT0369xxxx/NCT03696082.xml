      This study examines the behavioral, molecular, and structural biomarkers of brain health that&#xD;
      will allow for the stratification of individuals according to their &quot;cognitive signature&quot; and&#xD;
      function. This study will randomize older adults into one of four interventions for a period&#xD;
      of 12 months: 1) Aerobic Exercise, 2) Resistance Exercise, 3) Yoga Exercise, 4) Health&#xD;
      Education (involves stretching and range of motion activities). This aims of this study will&#xD;
      examine whether and how these different types of training interventions exert effects&#xD;
      cognitive function, brain structure, biomarkers of brain health and cognition, and physical&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is increasingly recognized to play a role in maintenance of brain health&#xD;
      and attenuation of physical decline associated with aging. While physical activity has been&#xD;
      shown to gradually decline with increasing age, initiation of an exercise protocol attenuates&#xD;
      declines in cognition associated with advancing age, including impaired neurogenesis as well&#xD;
      as decreased attention and learning. These benefits may be attributed, at least in part, to&#xD;
      physical activity's role in maintaining an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and several clinical&#xD;
      observational studies performed in older adults have shown an inverse relationship between&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity and inflammatory biomarkers. Pre-clinical studies have also&#xD;
      revealed that exposing aged animals to circulating factors derived from young animal&#xD;
      counterparts significantly improves cognitive function and promotes neurogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major limitation of clinical studies investigating the effect of physical activity on&#xD;
      cognitive function is that subjects display considerable variability in their responses to&#xD;
      the intervention. There are likely to be multiple biological pathways by which physical&#xD;
      activity influences brain structure and function, and the type of physical activity that may&#xD;
      be effective for influencing these pathways is likely to vary greatly. A better mechanistic&#xD;
      understanding of how different modes of physical activity may target varying regions of the&#xD;
      brain and other aspects of aging is therefore warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines the behavioral, molecular, and structural biomarkers of brain health that&#xD;
      will allow for the stratification of individuals according to their &quot;cognitive signature&quot; and&#xD;
      function. This study will randomize older adults into one of four interventions for a period&#xD;
      of 12 months: 1) Aerobic Exercise, 2) Resistance Exercise, 3) Yoga Exercise, 4) Health&#xD;
      Education (involves stretching and range of motion activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This aims of this study will examine whether and how these different types of training&#xD;
      interventions exert differential effects on potential pathways of cognition and function in&#xD;
      aged individuals, and the role of baseline subject characteristics in mediating these&#xD;
      responses. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare changes in cognitive function in response to three different types of&#xD;
           physical activity (aerobic activity, resistance training activity, yoga) versus health&#xD;
           education control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare changes in brain structure in response to three different types of physical&#xD;
           activity (aerobic activity, resistance training activity, yoga) versus health education&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare biomarkers of brain health and cognition in response to three different types&#xD;
           of physical activity (aerobic activity, resistance training activity, yoga) versus&#xD;
           health education control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine changes in physical function in response to three different types of physical&#xD;
           activity (aerobic activity, resistance training activity, yoga) versus health education&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To conduct post-hoc analyses to examine whether baseline measures of cognitive function,&#xD;
           brain structure, biomarkers, or physical function influence responsiveness to any of the&#xD;
           three different types of physical activity (aerobic activity, resistance training&#xD;
           activity, yoga) versus health education control.&#xD;
