  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emil project aims to design, develop, implement and evaluate a digital service to support&#xD;
      a healthy lifestyle among men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this second study, men with a history of prostate cancer are invited to participate in the&#xD;
      scoping and design of a digital platform, through three iterations of workshops and&#xD;
      individual interviews, which includes prototyping and other ideation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the men with a history of prostate cancer will be involved in the usability testing&#xD;
      of the design, to ensure a platform fit for use by the intended users.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this user-driven study, the methods will be workshops, interviews, usability testing and a&#xD;
      concluding proof of concept testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workshops constitutes the bigger part of the user-driven design and ideation in this project.&#xD;
      In workshops a group of people will generate a synergy that opens up for new ideas in a&#xD;
      framed setting. The workshop format uses methods such as affinity diagrams; innovation jams;&#xD;
      and ideation guided through artefacts such as Lego or paper cuts, with the researcher as the&#xD;
      facilitator. After analysing the outcome of each design iteration, the findings will be&#xD;
      incorporated into the design and focus the planning of the succeeding workshops in an&#xD;
      iterative process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usability of the design will be tested in between workshops in interviews. The test will&#xD;
      be performed by think aloud testing with the current prototype, recording for data collection&#xD;
      and researchers in the room to observe, facilitate and probe for reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a more elaborate usability testing to conclude the design phase, a proof of concept will&#xD;
      be performed. In this living lab scenario, the tool will be used at home by end-users in the&#xD;
      intended way. Issues with technical functionality, user interphase, data management and&#xD;
      workflow will surface and can be corrected during the proof of concept, thus consolidating&#xD;
      the service before the feasibility study. Data collection from this part of the study will be&#xD;
      by ongoing dialogue with participants, by e-mail and telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide the broadest possible foundation for recruitment in terms of diversity in&#xD;
      lifestyle and socioeconomic status, invitation to the study is done by mail directly to a&#xD;
      randomly chosen group of men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All iterations will be based on the results of the previous. The first iteration is based on&#xD;
      the ethnographic input from the first study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in study 2 will be met with a baseline questionnaire to evaluate digital&#xD;
      readiness and e-health literacy and adjust participant configuration to ensure diversity. The&#xD;
      questionnaire include self-reported educational level, health issues, treatments, diet,&#xD;
      physical activity level and other lifestyle factors as well as eHLQ as part of the READHY&#xD;
      questionnaire toolkit. The 13 dimensions of READHY comes from heiQ, HLQ and eHLQ, and work as&#xD;
      a multidimensional validated robust psychometric instrument evaluation and can be used in&#xD;
      combination to describe user's health technology readiness level and degree of enablement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each activity of the user-driven design process will be documented in a report, that will&#xD;
      serve as the data foundation for a scientific publication.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is a design product which supports men in their everyday life to have a healthy lifestyle through digital means.&#xD;
A process of 3 iterations of workshops and individual interviews produces data in the form of notes, sketches, pictures, recordings and prototype-products. By iterative analysis and confirmation and ideation in the following iteration, the primary outcome of this process is the design of a digital health service intervention to support men with prostate cancer in a healthy lifestyle.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants in the study will be men with prostate cancer, included in the Danish&#xD;
             Cancer Registry under the IDC-10 code DC61 in the years 2014 or 2015.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men with known non-localized prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis. Non-localised&#xD;
             cancer will be defined by use of the TNM classification in the Danish Cancer Registry&#xD;
             as proposed by Outzen et al [17]: Tis1-4,x and N1-3 and M0,1,x or Tis 1-4,x and N0,x&#xD;
             and M1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be excused from participation if they do not have sufficient written&#xD;
             and spoken Danish language skills for participation in the activities involved in the&#xD;
             studies. The researcher will assess whether the participants have sufficient cognitive&#xD;
             functions to participate in the study, including be able to contribute to design&#xD;
             workshops or report on everyday living. The researcher can also judge from an ethical&#xD;
             perspective that the participant, for reasons not stated in the protocol, should be&#xD;
             excused from participation in the study.&#xD;
