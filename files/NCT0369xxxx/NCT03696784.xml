    <textblock>
      This research study combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells.&#xD;
      Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and both have&#xD;
      shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study&#xD;
      combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment&#xD;
      being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted&#xD;
      against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their&#xD;
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this&#xD;
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells&#xD;
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this study, the&#xD;
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it&#xD;
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called&#xD;
      a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to&#xD;
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of&#xD;
      fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results have shown that subjects receiving this treatment have experienced&#xD;
      unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxocity. In this study,&#xD;
      to help reduce cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells&#xD;
      have a safety switch that, when active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the subject&#xD;
      experiences moderate to severe cytokine release syndrome and or neurotoxicity as a result of&#xD;
      being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the subject can be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903,&#xD;
      if standard interventions fail to alleviate the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome and/or&#xD;
      neurotoxicity. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch, reducing the number of the&#xD;
      iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood. The ultimate goal is to determine what dose of AP1903 can be&#xD;
      given that reduces the severity of the cytokine release syndrome and/or neurotoxicity, but&#xD;
      still allows the remaining iC9-CAR19 cells to effectively fight the lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9-CAR19 cells is safe&#xD;
      and tolerable in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I dose finding trial to determine if chimeric antigen receptor T&#xD;
      (CAR-T) cells targeting the CD19 antigen and containing the inducible caspase 9 safety switch&#xD;
      can be safely administered to adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell Lymphoma. The&#xD;
      safety of iC9-CAR19 cells will be investigated using the 3+3 design. The starting dose of 1 x&#xD;
      106 transduced cells/kg (dose level 1) will enroll at least 3 subjects in the initial cohort.&#xD;
      If there are no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 4 weeks of the cell infusion in these&#xD;
      3 subjects, then the next cohort will evaluate 2 x 106 transduced cells/kg. If there is&#xD;
      toxicity in 1/3 subjects in the initial cohort, the cohort will be expanded to enroll up to 6&#xD;
      subjects. During iC9-CAR19 T cell dose exploration, AP1903 (0.4 mg/kg), a dimerizing agent&#xD;
      that is designed to engage and activate the caspase 9 safety switch to trigger iC9-CAR19 T&#xD;
      cell death by apoptosis will be given to subjects who develop grade 4 cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome (CRS) or grade ≥3 CRS that is unresponsive to standard of care interventions, and to&#xD;
      subjects who develop grade ≥3 CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) or grade 2&#xD;
      CRES that does not improve to grade ≤1 within 72 hours with standard of care interventions,&#xD;
      and subjects with grade 4 ICANS of any duration that have evidence of cerebral edema and/or&#xD;
      generalized convulsive status epilepticus. After the tolerable cell dose (TCD) of iC9-CAR19 T&#xD;
      cells has been determined, up to 18 additional adult subjects may be enrolled in an expansion&#xD;
      cohort at the TCD. Rimiducid will be given to subjects in the expansion cohort who develop&#xD;
      grade ≥3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) that does not improve&#xD;
      to grade ≤1 within 72 hours with standard of care interventions, and subjects with grade 4&#xD;
      ICANS of any duration that have evidence of cerebral edema and/or generalized convulsive&#xD;
      status epilepticus. Subjects in the expansion cohort who experience ≥grade 2 CRS that remains&#xD;
      ≥grade 2 twenty four hours after an initial dose of tocilizumab may be part of the sub-study&#xD;
      of rimiducid. These subjects will receive one of two assigned dose levels of rimiducid with&#xD;
      their second tocilizumab infusion. The percent reduction in CAR T cells will be measured in&#xD;
      these subjects. If the subjects' CRS is unresponsive to tocilizumab and the assigned dose&#xD;
      level of rimiducid, subjects with ≥grade 3 CRS will then be given a full dose (0.4 mg/kg) of&#xD;
      rimiducid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects for&#xD;
      cell procurement. In subjects with low T-cell count (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      less than 200/μL) in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate&#xD;
      sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphodepleting Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a &quot;pre-conditioning&quot; cytoreductive regimen of bendamustine 70 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      administered IV followed by an IV dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3&#xD;
      consecutive days. These agents will be administered per institutional guidelines. Prophylaxis&#xD;
      (e.g., hydration, antiemetics, etc.) needed prior to fludarabine and bendamustine&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be provided per institutional guidelines. At the discretion of the clinical&#xD;
      investigator, subjects with a known history of intolerance to bendamustine may be considered&#xD;
      for lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered by IV followed by an IV&#xD;
      dose of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day administered over 3 consecutive days. These agents will be&#xD;
      administered per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will&#xD;
      receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2 - 14 days after completing the lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer iC9-CAR19 post lymphodepletion at dose levels&#xD;
      specified in the table in section 4.1. A recently published trial in refractory DLBCL&#xD;
      established that a dose of 2 x 106 CAR19+ T cells/kg was safe and associated with significant&#xD;
      in vivo expansion and we anticipate similar results with iC9-CAR19+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in this study involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive a cell infusion will be followed for up to 15 years for&#xD;
      replication-competent retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects&#xD;
      who are removed from study and do not receive the cellular therapy product due to&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;

Responses are provided on a 5-point Likert scale: Frequency item: How OFTEN did you have? (Never / Rarely / Occasionally / Frequently / Almost constantly); Severity item: What was the SEVERITY of your at its WORST? (None / Mild / Moderate / Severe / Very severe);Interference item: How much did INTERFERE with your usual or daily activities?

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0. assesses one's ability to carry out activities that require physical actions, ranging from self-care (activities of daily living) to more complex activities that require a combination of skills, often within a social context. &quot;Physical Function&quot; is inclusive of the term &quot;disability&quot; and includes the full spectrum of physical functioning from severe impairment to exceptional physical abilities. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, resulting in a total score (T-score) from 0 to 100. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For positively-worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is one SD better than average. By comparison, a Physical Function T-score of 40 is one SD worse than average.</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health measures assess an individual's physical, mental, and social health. The measures are generic, rather than disease-specific, and often use an &quot;In General&quot; item context as it is intended to globally reflect individuals' assessment of their health. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five, which are summed into T-score values for physical and mental health. A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. Thus, a person who has T- scores of 60 for the Global Physical Health or Global Mental Health scales is one standard deviation better (more healthy) than the general population.</description>
