    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with ascites.Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with effective antibiotics&#xD;
      significantly improves the prognosis of this complication. The recommended treatment is a&#xD;
      third generation cephalosporin given intravenously for five days.Following recovery patients&#xD;
      should receive secondary prophylaxis with a quinolone such as oral norfloxacin 400&#xD;
      mg/day.Also all patients should be assessed for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most commonly used antibiotic for both primary and secondary prophylaxis is norfloxacin 400&#xD;
      mg once daily.Other antibiotics like cotrimoxazole,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin and rifaximin&#xD;
      have also been evaluated in various studies.Use of antibiotic prophylaxis has been evaluated&#xD;
      to decrease recurrence of SBP in treated groups than in control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is an oral antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity that is gut-selective&#xD;
      and nonsystemic. Rifaximin appears to have a low level of selection for resistant bacterial&#xD;
      mutants. Intestinal decontamination is known to increase peripheral blood counts by&#xD;
      suppressing endotoxemia and inhibiting the effects of cytokines and nitric oxide on blood&#xD;
      counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this mechanisms rifaximin has been already proven to decrease recurrence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy.The most important mechanism for development of SBP is bacterial translocation&#xD;
      (BT).Translocation of enteric flora occurs via defective mucosal barrier.BT is considered the&#xD;
      key step in pathogenesis of SBP and cirrhotic patients.It is also the critical factor that is&#xD;
      responsible for host immune response and secreation of inflammatory mediators that is&#xD;
      responsible for hemodynamic changes in cirrhotics.Three most important mechanism of bacterial&#xD;
      translocation include bacterial overgrowth,physical disruption of gut mucosal barrier and&#xD;
      impaired host defence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin by mechanism of gut decontamination may reduce translocation of intestinal bacteria&#xD;
      into mesenteric lymph nodes then into ascitic fluid.Thus it may prove useful in preventing&#xD;
      recurrence of SBP.There was no study till date that has compared efficacy of Norfloxacin and&#xD;
      rifaximin to prevent development of SBP.This pilot study was done to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      rifaximin with norfloxacin in both primary and secondary prophylaxis of SBP in a prospective&#xD;
      randomized open-label and non-inferiority trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis, and 60% of patients with compensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis develop ascites within 10 years during the course of their disease . Ascites occurs&#xD;
      only when portal hypertension has developed and is related to inability to excrete an&#xD;
      adequate amount of sodium into urine, leading to a positive sodium balance.Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that renal sodium retention in patients with cirrhosis is secondary to arterial splanchnic&#xD;
      vasodilation. This causes a decrease in effective arterial blood volume with activation of&#xD;
      arterial and cardiopulmonary volume receptors, and homeostatic activation of vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      and sodium-retaining systems (i.e., the sympathetic nervous system and the&#xD;
      (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). Renal sodium retention leads to expansion of the&#xD;
      extracellular fluid volume and formation of ascites and edema . The development of ascites is&#xD;
      associated with a poor prognosis and impaired quality of life in patients with cirrhosis .&#xD;
      Thus, patients with ascites should generally be considered for referral for liver&#xD;
      transplantation. There is a clear rationale for the management of ascites in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis, as a successful treatment may improve the outcome and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with ascites.Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with effective antibiotics&#xD;
      significantly improves the prognosis of this complication. The recommended treatment is a&#xD;
      third generation cephalosporin given intravenously for five days. The most commonly used is&#xD;
      cefotaxime, up to 4 g/day in 2-4 divided doses because of its proven efficacy and safety3.&#xD;
      Repeat diagnostic paracentesis to document response by a greater than 25% decrease in ascitic&#xD;
      fluid neutrophil count at 48 hours after commencement of antibiotic is recommended. With this&#xD;
      regimen, recovery from SBP is higher than 80-90% and 30-day survival is at least&#xD;
      80%.Following recovery patients should receive secondary prophylaxis with a quinolone such as&#xD;
      oral norfloxacin 400 mg/day.Also all patients should be assessed for liver transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      .Most commonly used antibiotic for both primary and secondary prophylaxis is norfloxacin 400&#xD;
      mg once daily.Other antibiotics like cotrimoxazole,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin and rifaximin&#xD;
      have also been evaluated in various studies.Use of antibiotic prophylaxis has been evaluated&#xD;
      to decrease recurrence of SBP in treated groups than in control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin is an oral antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum activity that is gut-selective&#xD;
      and nonsystemic. Rifaximin appears to have a low level of selection for resistant bacterial&#xD;
      mutants and may not confer the same risks as those associated with systemic antibiotics. A&#xD;
      study in patients with alcohol-related decompensated cirrhosis reported that rifaximin&#xD;
      treatment reduced endotoxin levels and resulted in significantly decreased hepatic venous&#xD;
      pressure gradient values, which decreased the occurrence of complications in advanced liver&#xD;
      disease.13Intestinal decontamination with rifaximin has been shown to increase platelet count&#xD;
      significantly in thrombocytopenic patients with cirrhosis.This benefit is thought to be&#xD;
      achieved through a concomitant reduction of endotoxemia.Improvements in platelet counts in&#xD;
      patients with thrombocytopenia could decrease bleeding risks and complications of medical&#xD;
      procedures, and help stabilize underlying liver disease. Intestinal decontamination is also&#xD;
      known to increase peripheral blood counts by suppressing endotoxemia and inhibiting the&#xD;
      effects of cytokines and nitric oxide on blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this mechanisms rifaximin has been already proven to decrease recurrence of hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy.The most important mechanism for development of SBP is bacterial translocation&#xD;
      (BT) which refers to entry of bacteria or their products into regional lymph nodes,systemic&#xD;
      circulation and extraintestinal organs.Translocation of enteric flora occurs via defective&#xD;
      mucosal barrier.BT is considered the key step in pathogenesis of SBP and cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients.It is also the critical factor that is responsible for host immune response and&#xD;
      secreation of inflammatory mediators that is responsible for hemodynamic changes in&#xD;
      cirrhotics.Three most important mechanism of bacterial translocation include bacterial&#xD;
      overgrowth,physical disruption of gut mucosal barrier and impaired host defence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin by mechanism of gut decontamination may reduce translocation of intestinal bacteria&#xD;
      into mesenteric lymph nodes then into ascitic fluid.Thus it may prove useful in preventing&#xD;
      recurrence of SBP.There is no study till date that has compared efficacy of Norfloxacin and&#xD;
      rifaximin to prevent development of SBP.This pilot study was done to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      rifaximin with norfloxacin in both primary and secondary prophylaxis of SBP in a prospective&#xD;
