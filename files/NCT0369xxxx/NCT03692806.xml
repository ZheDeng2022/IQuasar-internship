    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of STABLOR® consumption on&#xD;
      visceral fat mass compared to placebo, in persons with metabolic syndrome during 12 weeks of&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is expected that the food product STABLOR will reduce visceral fat mass in subjects with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and therefore will improve cardiometabolic risk factors. The aim of the&#xD;
      current study is to assess the impact of a 12-week intake of STABLOR, compared to a placebo,&#xD;
      on visceral fat in patients with metabolic syndrome. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of 12-week STABLOR® consumption on visceral fat mass compared to placebo,&#xD;
      in persons with metabolic syndrome. The Secondary outcomes include Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and body composition, metabolic syndrome status, STABLOR® metabolism,&#xD;
      Cardiovascular biomarkers, Systemic inflammation, Quality of life and Behavior.&#xD;
