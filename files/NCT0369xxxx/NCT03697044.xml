      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is: to assess and define the current practice of the delivery of&#xD;
      irinotecan loaded drug eluting beads in the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal&#xD;
      cancer; to correlate how the delivery of this drug compares to worldwide/European guidelines,&#xD;
      and to determine which individual variations in delivery may be associated with an increased&#xD;
      complication profile or better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively evaluate the number of centres providing DEBIRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the number of patients being treated nationally per year&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate individual variations in practice with respect to number of treatments,&#xD;
           method of pain control, side effect profile, and complication profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect patient specific data subsets to allow correlation and causal associations&#xD;
           between these individual variations, and relate these to efficacy and survival during&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate and audit the use of drug eluting beads loaded with irinotecan&#xD;
      chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the&#xD;
      third most common malignancy in men and the second in women, affecting more than 1.2 million&#xD;
      people per year worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of metastases is the main cause of death in patients with CRC. Surgical&#xD;
      resection is the first-line treatment for hepatic CRC metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, despite the progress of modern surgical techniques, radical resection is&#xD;
      possible only in l0%-25% of patients with CRC metastases confined to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that DEB-IRI TACE may offer a novel approach to locoregional hepatic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. DEB-IRI TACE allows a dose of irinotecan chemotherapy to be delivered directly&#xD;
      into the liver, and thus has a significantly reduced side effect profile in comparison to&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy. It can be given alongside a reduced dose of systemic therapy or in&#xD;
      some cases can be given instead of systemic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic analyses have shown the bioavailability from DC Bead (Biocompatibles UK,&#xD;
      Farnham, United Kingdom)- based delivery of irinotecan is double that of intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, attributable to reduced drug clearance for the former. Experimental animal studies&#xD;
      have confirmed that DEB-IRI TACE induces lower early serum levels of irinotecan, a high and&#xD;
      prolonged intratumoral level of irinotecan, and a greater rate of tumor necrosis compared&#xD;
      with intraarterial or intravenous injection of irinotecan. Pilot clinical trials have&#xD;
      suggested that DEB-IRI TACE administered in combination with systemic 5-fluorouracil and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients or as a stand-alone regimen in patients with&#xD;
      disease refractory to multiple lines of intravenous chemotherapy- may result in high rates of&#xD;
      tumor response. In a randomized controlled study, DEB-IRI TACE showed a significant overall&#xD;
      survival benefit with respect to a systemic regimen including irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and&#xD;
      leucovorin in a series of 74 patients who had received at least two or three lines of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this initially promising evidence base, and a consensus document for treatment&#xD;
      pathways, DEBIRI TACE use is not widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is partly due to a side effect profile, and partly due to a lack of standard technique&#xD;
      or consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a known side effect common to all forms of liver embolization, with or without the&#xD;
      addition of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The side effect profile is due to the mechanical&#xD;
      effect of the device (beads) blocking small arteries within tumour tissue and normal liver&#xD;
      tissue. The most common side effects and complications include pain and abscess formation due&#xD;
      to embolic tissue ischaemia. These side effects are due to the device (DC Beads) rather than&#xD;
      the addition of irinotecan chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DEBIRI expert consensus meeting held in London in January 2017 suggested that UK practice&#xD;
      varies very significantly between individual Trusts, despite a European consensus document&#xD;
      which has suggested a defined treatment pathway. Only 2 of 12 UK centres had up to date&#xD;
      retrospective information clarifying numbers of treatments, side effects, and length of&#xD;
      hospital stay etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest variations in individual practice was deemed to be three-fold&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of treatments each patient receives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The type of pain control given (General anaesthesia, sedo-analgesia, PCA pump, nerve&#xD;
           block, or intra-arterial local anaesthetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The size and type of embolic bead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors create a need for a registry to define current practice and analyse and compare&#xD;
      individual and national variations within the centers already performing this procedure as a&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry would establish the varying national delivery techniques, complication profiles,&#xD;
      quality of life, and health economic measures associated with delivery of the DC Bead device.&#xD;
      This may help to determine causal associations between varying methods of device delivery and&#xD;
      complication profiles and technical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective registry and service evaluation of current practice with respect to&#xD;
      delivery of a CE marked device - DC Beads(BEBIRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospectively evaluate the number of centres providing DEBIRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the number of patients being treated nationally per year&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate individual variations in practice with respect to number of treatments,&#xD;
           method of pain control, side effect profile, and complication profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect patient specific data subsets to allow correlation and causal associations&#xD;
           between these individual variations, and relate these to efficacy and survival during&#xD;
           the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to assess current practice, to determine how well or poorly current&#xD;
      practice correlates to published guidelines, and to determine which individual variations are&#xD;
      associated with an increased complication profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to provide evidence to provoke reflection on individual variation in practice to&#xD;
      assist the development of future clinical trials.&#xD;
