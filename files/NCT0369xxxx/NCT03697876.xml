      Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of the PRO-165 formulation on the ocular&#xD;
      surface of ophthalmologically and clinically healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Ophthalmic gel PRO-165 presents a safety and tolerability profile similar to&#xD;
      Artelac® Nightime Gel in ophthalmological and clinically healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I clinical study, controlled, of parallel groups, double blind, randomized, exploratory&#xD;
      Therapeutic indication of PRO-165: Eye lubricant&#xD;

      The study subjects will be recruited from various research centers in western and central&#xD;
      Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each research center has a monitoring plan specified according to the recruitment&#xD;
      capabilities of the same, which must be at least once a month, where the queries of your data&#xD;
      entered into the electronic case report report will be reported to the center. (e-CRF) for&#xD;
      which it has as time limit the next monitoring visit to make the pertinent changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report of adverse events will be made according to the standard operating procedure (PNO)&#xD;
      where it specifies, according to Official Mexican Standard 220 (NOM 220), that the signs or&#xD;
      symptoms of adverse events will be reported based on the Medical Dictionary. for Regulatory&#xD;
      Activities, for which the sponsor has version 20.1 in Spanish. For serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) will be reported in accordance with the standardized operation procedure of&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance of the sponsor, which adheres to the guidelines of NOM 220 and&#xD;
      international regulations, these will be reported in the regulatory framework to the&#xD;
      regulatory entity within a period of time no more than 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is registered in the National Registry of Clinical Trials (RNEC), entity equivalent&#xD;
      to Clinical Trials in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality assurance plan is carried out by the sponsor through the Quality Assurance agent&#xD;
      in Clinical Research, whose function is to conduct inspections and audits of the research&#xD;
      sites to document and generate reports of deviations from the protocol. In addition to the&#xD;
      visits of the monitoring plan, the reliability of the data is guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify the integrity, veracity and reliability of the data entered into the e-CRF, the&#xD;
      monitors of each center will check the information uploaded to the portal with that reported&#xD;
      in the source document of the principal investigator (PI), such as clinical notes, clinical&#xD;
      history and documents. and formats attached to the research protocol, physical case report&#xD;
      format, as well as those provided by the sponsor to the PI (subject's diary and quality and&#xD;
      satisfaction survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-CRF used for this clinical study is provided by an internationally certified provider&#xD;
      with the highest quality standards, protection of information under current regulations and&#xD;
      confidentiality guarantee. The information that the PIs enter into the e-CRF is collated and&#xD;
      verified by the clinical monitors and by the service provider's personnel, later reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by the medical ophthalmologist researcher and by the Clinical Security&#xD;
      Pharmacologist, who authorize the monitored data of clinical information and safety of the&#xD;
      study molecule, respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>during the 13 days of evaluation, including the safety call (day 13).</time_frame>
    <description>The Principal Investigator will register the Events Adverse (EA) that the subjects of the study will present. The EAs will be expressed as absent or present and the number of cases will be counted by study group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eye comfort index</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire designed to measure the irritation of the ocular surface with Rasch analysis to produce estimates on a linear scale of intervals (ratings: 0-100). Similar to the index for ocular surface diseases, the ocular comfort index (ICO) evaluates symptoms. The ICO contains 6 items that focus on the discomfort associated with the ocular surface. Each of these questions has two parts, which inquire separately the frequency and severity of the symptoms.&#xD;
The evaluator will deliver the questionnaire to the subject and allow the subject to answer it calmly without any pressure and / or coercion, will only assist him if he has difficulty understanding any of the questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual ability (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>The VA will be evaluated basally, without refractive correction with the Snellen chart. Which will be located in a place with adequate lighting, natural or artificial and at a distance of 3 meters from the subject to be evaluated</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraocular pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>Tonometry is the objective measure of Intraocular pressure, based primarily on the force required to flatten the cornea, or the degree of corneal indentation produced by a fixed force. Goldman's tonometry is based on the Imbert-Fick principle. the result will be expressed in millimeters of mercury and the comparison between groups will be carried out.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatology post instillation</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will be questioned if after applying the medication he felt burning, pruritus, a foreign body sensation and blurred vision.&#xD;
Presence or absence: it will be marked as present (1) or absent (0) for each of the symptoms questioned</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>breakup time (BUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>breakup time lacrimal film is a continuous variable that will be measured in seconds, evaluating the time it takes to break it, is done by direct counting and the normality range and mayor to 10 seconds.</description>

    <measure>epithelial Defects (ED)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 11 at the final visit</time_frame>
    <description>The epithelial defects will be evaluated by means of two stains, green lysine and fluorescein, it is a discrete variable that will be realized by direct observation, it will be staged according to the degrees of the oxford scale that go from 0 to 5 (0-V) according to its severity, where 0 is the normal lower limit and 5 the upper limit of defects.</description>
