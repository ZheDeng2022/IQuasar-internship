  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, in regards to acceptability and&#xD;
      implementation, of the Pre-Active PD intervention for increased high intensity goal-directed&#xD;
      aerobic exercise engagement in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr&#xD;
      stage I &amp; II). In addition, the study aims to explore the effect estimates of the Pre-Active&#xD;
      PD intervention on self-efficacy, motivation, stage of behavior change, and physical activity&#xD;
      levels in people with early stage Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 14 individuals with early stage Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and&#xD;
      Yahr stage I &amp; II). The investigators will conduct a single arm cohort. (pre and post&#xD;
      intervention) pilot feasibility study over 4 months with embedded process analyses of&#xD;
      Preactive-HD, a physical activity coaching intervention program. Previous studies conducted&#xD;
      by the investigators will be utilized to adapt the Engage-HD physical activity coaching&#xD;
      program to people with early stage PD. The intervention will include a participant/coach&#xD;
      interaction and disease-specific workbook grounded within the framework of self-determination&#xD;
      theory. The coaching sessions will be conducted by an occupational therapist and will entail&#xD;
      six coaching sessions (either face-to-face or remote video sessions via secure Webex&#xD;
      connection via computer or smart phone, or phone call if internet/smart phone is not&#xD;
      available to participant). The first session (approximately 45 min) will lay the groundwork&#xD;
      for the program, and the remaining sessions will serve to provide directed support in&#xD;
      relation to regular physical activity and exercise. Participants will develop physical&#xD;
      activity goals and will be supported with individual physical activity progression.&#xD;
      Participants will be given Fitbit devices as a motivational tool and to track activity&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity Using Actigraph at 4 Months</measure>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Behavioural Regulation In Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BREQ-2 is a 19-item questionnaire that measures each of the subscales of the self-determination continuum: external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulations, as well as amotivation. Each subscale is represented by 4 questions, except for introjected regulation which has 3. Questions are scored using a 5-point Likert scale; Answers range from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). Composite scores were calculated from these subscales. Autonomous motivation was calculated from the intrinsic motivation and identified regulation subscales, with possible scores ranging from 0 (low autonomous motivation) to 4 (high autonomous motivation. Controlled motivation was calculated from the introjected regulation and external regulation subscales, with possible scores ranging from 0 (low controlled motivation) to 4 (high controlled motivation).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Brunel Lifestyle Inventory at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brunel lifestyle inventory is a 10-item questionnaire that measures both pre-planned (6 items) and un-planned (3 items) lifestyle PA. Scoring for each item is on a scale of 1-5, and the scores for each subscale are averaged. Scores range from 1 (low level of physical activity) to 5 (high level of physical activity).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -III (WAIS-III) Digit Span Forward and Backward at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test evaluates the number of digits a person can remember in both a forward and backward recall. WAIS-III subscale measures sequential processing, mental manipulation, attention, concentration, memory span, and short-term auditory memory. Higher numbers would indicate a greater number of digits remembered (better outcome). Minimum value is 0 and there is no maximum.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Autonomy Support Healthcare Climate Questionnaire is from the Health-Care, Self-Determination Theory Questionnaire Packet that was designed to assess constructs encompassed within Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as it applies to health-care behavior. This is a measure of acceptability of the intervention administered only the 4 month assessment. Scores on this 15-item questionnaire are calculated by averaging the individual item scores, which are rated on a 1-7 Likert scale. Scores range from 1-7, with higher average scores (7 max) represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support.</description>

    <description>Based in the self-determination theory, participants will be coached on beneficial exercises, how to utilize supports and overcome barriers to PA engagement. Emphasis of exercise coaching will be on increasing aerobic exercise engagement and will include us of Fitbit devices to facilitate uptake and monitor aerobic exercise. Intervention will be delivered by a physical or occupational therapist, who will work with the participant to develop a plan, set goals and targets, and track changes. Additional resources that will support exercise engagement will be provided. Participants will have the choice to receive their face-to-face session either in person or remotely via secure video-based service.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Behavioural Regulation In Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2)</title>
        <description>The BREQ-2 is a 19-item questionnaire that measures each of the subscales of the self-determination continuum: external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulations, as well as amotivation. Each subscale is represented by 4 questions, except for introjected regulation which has 3. Questions are scored using a 5-point Likert scale; Answers range from 0 (not true for me) to 4 (very true for me). Composite scores were calculated from these subscales. Autonomous motivation was calculated from the intrinsic motivation and identified regulation subscales, with possible scores ranging from 0 (low autonomous motivation) to 4 (high autonomous motivation. Controlled motivation was calculated from the introjected regulation and external regulation subscales, with possible scores ranging from 0 (low controlled motivation) to 4 (high controlled motivation).</description>

WAIS-III subscale measures sequential processing, mental manipulation, attention, concentration, memory span, and short-term auditory memory.

          <description>This test evaluates the number of digits a person can remember in both a forward and backward recall. WAIS-III subscale measures sequential processing, mental manipulation, attention, concentration, memory span, and short-term auditory memory. Higher numbers would indicate a greater number of digits remembered (better outcome). Minimum value is 0 and there is no maximum.</description>

        <description>This test evaluates the ability to state the color of a word but not the written word. The cognitive dimension tapped by the Stroop is associated with cognitive flexibility, resistance to interference from outside stimuli, creativity, and psychopathology. The number of correct words in 45 seconds is recorded.</description>

        <description>The Perceived Autonomy Support Healthcare Climate Questionnaire is from the Health-Care, Self-Determination Theory Questionnaire Packet that was designed to assess constructs encompassed within Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as it applies to health-care behavior. This is a measure of acceptability of the intervention administered only the 4 month assessment. Scores on this 15-item questionnaire are calculated by averaging the individual item scores, which are rated on a 1-7 Likert scale. Scores range from 1-7, with higher average scores (7 max) represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support.</description>
