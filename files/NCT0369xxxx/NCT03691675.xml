  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intro-stent restenosis, bifurcation lesions and small vascular lesion with diameter &lt;2.75mm&#xD;
      is the indication of drug coated balloon. In the era of traditional coronary artery balloon&#xD;
      dilatation, it is believed that muscle fiber of coronary artery great vessels is more&#xD;
      abundant than that of small vessels, and elastic recoil and dissection are easier to appear&#xD;
      upon dilatation, which will result in acute vascular occlusion and restenosis, so it is not&#xD;
      recommended for great vessels to only receive PTCA therapy. But for patients with good&#xD;
      angiography result without combination of serious dissections after predilation, the acute&#xD;
      thrombosis seems to be a key factor for acute vascular occlusion. Traditional antiplatelet&#xD;
      drug doesn't have a good effect, but the application of new-generation antiplatelet drug&#xD;
      (clopidogrel, ticagrelor and tirofiban) has greatly reduced the occurrence rate of acute&#xD;
      thrombosis. Therefore, under the guarantee of fully antiplatelet action of new-generation&#xD;
      antiplatelet drug, for the patients with good angiography result without combination of&#xD;
      serious dissections after predilation, Drug coated balloon seems to be an alternative of the&#xD;
      stent. This research is to verify the safety and efficacy of Drug coated balloon in de novo&#xD;
      coronary artery lesion with vascular diameter ≥2.75mm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stable or unstable angina patients who accept drug coated balloon dilatation therapy with&#xD;
      diameter stenosis≥50%, reference diameter≥2.75mm will be enrolled. OCT examination should be&#xD;
      carried out after radiography, predilation, Drug coated balloon dilatation and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For target lesion, balloon should be used for predilation (the ratio of balloon diameter to&#xD;
      vascular diameter being 0.8-1.0:1), and for good predilation effects, high pressure balloon,&#xD;
      cutting balloon, dual-wire balloon and spines balloon can be adopted. OCT examination should&#xD;
      be carry out after balloon satisfactory predilation. Satisfactory predilation radiography&#xD;
      result is residual stenosis≤30%,TIMI 3 flow without major dissections (type C or higher) in&#xD;
      NHLBI classification. OCT satisfactory result is residual stenosis≤30% without dissection, or&#xD;
      with dissection but the dissection angle is ≤90°. Then carry out DCB balloon dilatation&#xD;
      therapy. The ratio of balloon diameter to vascular diameter is 0.8-1.0:1, and both ends of&#xD;
      DCB exceed the preprocessing area of lesion for 2-3mm, thus avoiding the occurrence of&#xD;
      geographical mismatch. Dilation pressure is 8-10atm, lasting for at least 30s. Each DCB&#xD;
      catheter can be used once only.&#xD;
