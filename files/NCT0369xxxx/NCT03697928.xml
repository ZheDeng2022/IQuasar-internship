  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure skeletal muscle metabolism in vivo during exercise using the&#xD;
      non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) technique. Specifically, phosphocreatine&#xD;
      (PCr) kinetic and Acetylcarnitine levels will be determined at resting, during exercise and&#xD;
      during the recovery post exercise. The target population is adult healthy men, with a wide&#xD;
      range of maximal physical capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle mitochondrial activation during the transition from resting metabolism to&#xD;
      exercise may modulated by CrAT activity. Furthermore, dynamic changes in acetylcarnitine&#xD;
      during the transition from exercise to resting metabolism (acetylcarnitine off-kinetic) may&#xD;
      also reflect the action of CrAT protein. To date, the only possibility to get information on&#xD;
      CrAT activity is by taking a muscle biopsy and perform enzyme activity assays ex vivo. By&#xD;
      dynamic MRS scanning, it might be possible to deduce information that reflects CrAT activity,&#xD;
      thereby making the biopsy sampling unnecessary.&#xD;
