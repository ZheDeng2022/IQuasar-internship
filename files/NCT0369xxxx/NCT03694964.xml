  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its very high bioavailability and its specific and direct action on protein&#xD;
      synthesis, the investigators hypothesize that citrulline supplementation would be an&#xD;
      innovative nutritional strategy to improve the peripheral muscle mass and strength in COPD&#xD;
      patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This supplementation would be more effective if the pathology is severe and the chronic&#xD;
      systemic inflammation important. The benefits of this supplementation could help the most&#xD;
      severe patients break out of the cycle of inactivity and thus optimize their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of 45-day nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation with Citrulline (10 g / day) on the body composition (lean body mass) in&#xD;
      malnourished COPD patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Denutrition in patients with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is characterized by&#xD;
      muscle atrophy and loss of strength in the lower extremities. It worsens the symptomatology,&#xD;
      exercise intolerance, impaired quality of life and prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequence of a protein deficiency associated with systemic inflammation, denutrition is&#xD;
      becoming increasingly important in patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF).&#xD;
      L-citrulline is an amino acid having a direct action on muscle protein synthesis. The&#xD;
      citrulline supplementation is an effective treatment to fight against muscle loss in aging&#xD;
      subjects. Its impact on the functional and nutritional status of COPD patients has not been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to determine the impact of supplementation with Citrulline on mass and&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength in COPD with CRF. Our secondary objectives are to identify whether&#xD;
      these benefits are dependent on the severity of the disease and if they are associated with&#xD;
      increased physical activity, exercise tolerance and an improvement in symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life. This prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study will include 60 stable&#xD;
      COPD patients (stage 3 and 4), with long-term oxygen therapy and / or non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation, BMI &lt;25 kg.m2 and suspicion of sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 45 days, patients will receive either citrulline (ProteoCIT®, 10mg) or placebo. The&#xD;
      severity of COPD will be assessed by spirometry and blood gas data, the BODE index,&#xD;
      exacerbations, comorbidities, nutritional status and systemic inflammation (CRPs,&#xD;
      Fibrinogens). the investigators will evaluate before and after supplementation: body&#xD;
      composition (DEXA), quadriceps strength and grip strength, walking speed, the exercise&#xD;
      tolerance (6MWD), dyspnea (MMRC scales, BDI / TDI), quality of life (CAT and VSRQ&#xD;
      questionnaires). Physical activity will be assessed by continuous actigraphy. This&#xD;
      multicenter study will be conducted in 3 French hospitals: Grenoble, Nancy, Dijon.&#xD;
