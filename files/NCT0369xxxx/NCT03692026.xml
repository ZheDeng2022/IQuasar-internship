  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placing implants immediately after tooth extraction offers several advantages such as&#xD;
      preventing bone resorption, maintaining alveolar crest width and height, reducing surgical&#xD;
      procedures and treatment time, in addition to good esthetic results. Immediate implant&#xD;
      placement after tooth extraction is often associated with a residual gap between the implant&#xD;
      surface and the residual bone walls. Osseointegration between the implant surface and the&#xD;
      surrounding osseous walls of the extraction socket should increase using materials that&#xD;
      promote new bone formation. Since both melatonin and hyaluronic acid are thought to have a&#xD;
      positive effect on increasing osseointegration and decreasing inflammation of the tissues;&#xD;
      the investigators want to test if adding a mix of hyaluronic acid and melatonin to&#xD;
      immediately implant, will give a better implant stability, decreased peri-implant bone loss&#xD;
      and decreased post-operative pain versus immediate implant placement without adding any&#xD;
      material.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral rehabilitation with dental implants has become an established therapy in the past&#xD;
      decades. Installation of implants in extraction sockets was advocated for to reduce the&#xD;
      number of surgical procedures, time between tooth removal and installation of implant&#xD;
      supported restoration, and to preserve the dimensions of alveolar ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence exists demonstrating that early implantation may preserve the alveolar&#xD;
      anatomy and that the placement of a fixture in a fresh extraction socket may help to maintain&#xD;
      the bony crest structure. Fresh extraction sockets offer better opportunities for bone&#xD;
      regeneration because of their particularly elevated healing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant stability is directly related to the percentage of the bone to implant contact area&#xD;
      (BIC). Studies had reported that osseointegration occurs following immediate implant&#xD;
      installation in extraction sockets despite presence of marginal gap between bone and implant&#xD;
      surface up to 4 mm. Different approaches have been introduced lately to positively enhance&#xD;
      the healing around dental implants. One approach to enhance osseointegration of dental&#xD;
      implants is the coating with organic components of the extracellular matrix. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown promising results using different organic surface modifications on dental&#xD;
      implants, such as glycosaminoglycans, collagen and Hyaluronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans which plays a&#xD;
      role in the inflammatory process and wound healing of mineralized and non-mineralized tissues&#xD;
      of the periodontium including granulation tissue formation and tissue remodeling. It also&#xD;
      supports the structural and homeostatic integrity of tissues regulating properties as osmotic&#xD;
      pressure and tissue lubrication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found that coating the implants with low sulfated HA increased peri-implant bone&#xD;
      formation around dental implants in maxillary bone compared to uncoated implants in early&#xD;
      healing period. Another study proved that application of 1% HA associated with a collagen&#xD;
      scaffold can improve bone formation in critical-size defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine) is a substance secreted by multiple&#xD;
      organs including the pineal gland, retina, bone marrow, the gastro-intestinal tract and the&#xD;
      immune system. It plays an anti-inflammatory, anti-oncotic, and immunomodulatory role by&#xD;
      scavenging free-radicals and by interacting with cell membrane and intracellular proteins. It&#xD;
      was found to have a positive effect on new bone formation around implants as it promotes&#xD;
      osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Experimental evidence suggests that topical&#xD;
      application of melatonin may be useful in oral surgery and implant dentistry, increasing BIC&#xD;
      values and new bone formation, and so improving the success and long-term survival of the&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation for choice of comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both melatonin and hyaluronic acid are thought to have a positive effect on increasing&#xD;
      osseointegration and decreasing inflammation of the tissues, the synergistic effect of both&#xD;
      materials on the following outcomes will be investigated; implant stability, decreasing the&#xD;
      horizontal dimensional bone loss around the implant and post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims at assessing the effect of adding a mixture of hyaluronic acid and melatonin&#xD;
      to the implant surface in immediate implants; regarding implant stability, peri-implant&#xD;
      horizontal bone changes and post-operative pain, in comparison to immediate implant placement&#xD;
      without adding any materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the implant stability in immediate implants with hyaluronic acid and melatonin&#xD;
      mixture, versus immediate implants placed without adding any materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the peri-implant horizontal bony changes and post-operative pain with topical&#xD;
      application of hyaluronic acid and melatonin mixture to immediately placed implants, versus&#xD;
      immediate implant placement without addition of any materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;

           Post-operative care: (T2) 1. Sutures will be removed after 10 days. 2. Patients in both&#xD;
           groups will receive restoration after implant being osseointegrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Post-operative pain will be assessed using Numerical scale for pain (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up (T0, T1, T2):&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Patients will be recalled for follow up after 10 days, then every month to check on&#xD;
           the healing of the implantation site without complications (dehiscence, inflammation,&#xD;
           excessive pain), and to ensure that they are following proper oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. At the same day of surgery, implant stability will be measured using Ostell (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. After 10 days, following suture removal, post-operative pain will be assessed using&#xD;
           the Numerical scale of pain (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. After six months, implant stability will be measured again (T2) for all patients in&#xD;
           both groups. Also, all patients will do a CBCT to compare peri-implant horizontal bony&#xD;
           changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prosthetic phase (T3):&#xD;
&#xD;

           abutment (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Impressions (Express, 3M ESPE, 3 M Corporate Headquarters, Maplewood, Minnesota) will&#xD;

           (T1) and after 6 months (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Peri-implant horizontal bone changes: Peri-implant horizontal bone measurements in mm&#xD;
           will be taken from pre-operative CBCT (T0) and post-osseointegration CBCT (T2) to assess&#xD;
           the change in the horizontal bone dimensions of the peri-implant area between the two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Post-operative pain: Post-operative pain will be recorded for all patients using the&#xD;
           Numerical scale (NRS) of pain to compare between the values obtained for the study group&#xD;
           and those for the control group.&#xD;
