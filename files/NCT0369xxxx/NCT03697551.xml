  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research is to define the optimal uptake time of 68Ga-OPS202 as&#xD;
      a PET imaging agent to be used to detect and localize breast cancer somatostatin receptor&#xD;
      subtype 2 (SSTR2) positive lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      68Ga-OPS202 is a radiolabelled imaging agent to be used in association with PET. 68Ga-OPS202&#xD;
      is made of two main components: 1) OPS202, an antagonistic somatostatin analogue which binds&#xD;
      to the somatostatin receptor (type 2) present on the surface of the tumor cells and 2)&#xD;
      Gallium 68, a radioisotope that, combined with OPS202, can be seen in the PET scanner.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Female subjects with newly diagnosed breast cancer who had a somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sstr2) positive lesion were recruited to this study from 22 October 2018, and the last subject last visit was on 6 February 2019. The study was terminated early on 9 August 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Six subjects were screened and 4 subjects were eligible to receive gallium-68 (68Ga)-satoreotide trizoxetan (formerly 68Ga-OPS202) as a sstr2 positive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. The screening period was up to 14 days prior to the 68Ga-satoreotide trizoxetan administration on Day 1, with a follow-up visit at Day 14.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The percentage of subjects with sufficiently avid lesion(s) to be identified as a sstr2 positive lesion using 68Ga-satoreotide trizoxetan was to be determined.</description>
        <time_frame>At 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 hours post injection on Day 1.</time_frame>
        <population>The study was stopped prematurely and only four patients were imaged, of whom only three evaluable. No summary statistics are available given the limited data from the small number of evaluable patients and individual patient data are also not presented to protect the privacy of the individuals.</population>
