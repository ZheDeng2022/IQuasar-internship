  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-pharmacological interventions including distraction techniques (ie., games, ipads,&#xD;
      bubbles, stickers) are standard of care in reducing situation anxiety for children in the&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department. The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      mindfulness based virtual reality (mbVR) tool (Take-Pause) for pediatric patients age &gt; 12&#xD;
      years. The study team will be providing children with a virtual reality experience upon&#xD;
      arrival to the emergency department and measuring the effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      versus standard of care (Ipads, games). Subjective measurements will include questionnaires&#xD;
      and objective measurements will include vital signs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Emergency room visits can be a particularly stressful experience for children. It is&#xD;
      well-known that among pediatric patients, increased anxiety and stress levels can contribute&#xD;
      to less pain tolerance and higher pain scores. Increased levels of anxiety can also lead to&#xD;
      difficulty communicating needs and building a good patient-provider relationship.&#xD;
      Furthermore, higher situational anxiety may also lead to decreased patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      Though there are pharmacologic interventions to mitigate pain and anxiety, the side effect&#xD;
      profiles or route of administration sometimes outweigh the potential temporary benefits&#xD;
      medication may provide. Distraction techniques have long been established in literature to&#xD;
      help diminish pain in pediatric patients while essentially having no adverse profile. By&#xD;
      utilizing a simple distraction such as visual or musical stimuli, providers have been able to&#xD;
      decrease the use of anxiolytics or analgesics during pediatric care. Only a handful of&#xD;
      controlled studies have explored distraction techniques in the pediatric emergency room,&#xD;
      showing promising results in alleviating procedural pain/anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immersive virtual reality has been introduced recently as an alternative distraction&#xD;
      technique among hospitalized patients, providing a way to cope with the stressful hospital&#xD;
      environment. Several randomized control studies have found virtual reality to significantly&#xD;
      reduce pain in pediatric patients undergoing chronic or burn wound dressing changes. However,&#xD;
      no studies have been done in the emergency room exploring the efficacy of virtual reality as&#xD;
      a distraction technique, nor integrating mindfulness as part of the virtual reality&#xD;
      experience. Mindfulness has garnered interest over the years as another powerful, but simple&#xD;
      tool, in reducing emotional stress and increasing overall well-being of participants. An&#xD;
      organization which has integrated mindfulness into a virtual reality program for adolescents&#xD;
      is Take-Pause. The intervention will administer the Take-Pause immersive virtual reality&#xD;
      simulation as a distraction technique via virtual reality goggles, headset, and iphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, single-blinded randomized control trial conducted in an&#xD;
      pediatric emergency room at a single tertiary care hospital located in an urban region. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is to decrease situational anxiety level by at least 5 points on a State&#xD;
      Trait Anxiety Inventory scale when comparing mbVR to passive distraction technique. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will look at reduction of perceived pain when utilizing the Wong-Baker FACES scale&#xD;
      and respiratory rate or heart rate changes. Study population will consist of pediatric&#xD;
      patients aged 13 to 17 year old presenting to the emergency room, enrolled during a 12 month&#xD;
      period. Follow-up will be conducted at 5-min post-intervention. Exclusion criteria includes&#xD;
      patients who have received opioid or anxiolytic pharmacologic intervention at triage or 1&#xD;
      hour prior to ED arrival. Patients will be randomly assigned after triage to either the mbVR&#xD;
      or passive distraction intervention arm via a 1:1 patient allocation scheme utilizing block&#xD;
      randomization. Baseline short STAI survey, pain scale, and vitals will be obtained during&#xD;
      triage. The timer will begin once video starts and end when the video is complete. After 5&#xD;
      minutes, the patient will repeat the survey, scale, and have vitals taken. The treatment, or&#xD;
      mbVR intervention arm will be a Take-Pause virtual reality simulation lasting 5 minutes shown&#xD;
      through a virtual reality goggle, headset and iPhone. The control arm will consist of the&#xD;
      standard or passive distraction technique, lasting 5 minutes. Each intervention arm will&#xD;
      consist of 55 subjects for a total of 110 subjects.&#xD;
