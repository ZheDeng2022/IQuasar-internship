      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ADCT-602 in treating patients&#xD;
      with B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as ADCT-602, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ADCT-602 in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory B-cell (B)-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the recommended dose of ADCT-602 for Phase 2. III. Evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      (complete response [CR] with incomplete marrow recovery [CR/CRi] rate) of ADCT-602 in Phase&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the clinical activity of ADCT-602, based on duration of response (DOR), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ADCT-602. III. Evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of ADCT-602. IV. Characterize the effect of ADCT-602 exposure on the QT&#xD;
      interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain preliminary data on the correlation between the clinical activity and PK profile of&#xD;
      ADCT-602 with the baseline expression of CD22 and other cluster of differentiation (CD)&#xD;
      markers in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the impact of soluble CD22 (sCD22) on ADCT-602 PK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ADCT-602 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      21 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      CR/CRi receive ADCT-602 every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 1 year.&#xD;
