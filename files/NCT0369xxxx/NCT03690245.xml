  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before birth, the placenta (a structure with many blood vessels attached to the inside of&#xD;
      your womb) and the umbilical cord (the umbilical cord is attached to the placenta) are&#xD;
      sending oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood through the umbilical cord to the baby.&#xD;
      After a baby is born the cord is clamped and babies have to start breathing and support&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment when a baby with congenital heart disease is born they will have their cord&#xD;
      clamped immediately (this is called immediate cord clamping (ICC)). After ICC the clinical&#xD;
      team will start to help a baby transition by carefully monitoring their oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (give oxygen if needed), provide warmth, and dry and stimulate. Several animal studies have&#xD;
      shown that clamping the cord right after birth might causes the baby to miss the benefits of&#xD;
      receiving blood from the umbilical cord / placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed Cord Clamping (DCC) is when the baby stays attached to the cord for a longer time.&#xD;
      Studies show that DCC has many benefits especially for a newborn baby, such as higher iron&#xD;
      storage, less need for blood transfusions, and improved circulation. This can be done while&#xD;
      the baby is breathing on its own or while we help you baby breath (this is called&#xD;
      resuscitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine whether DCC while providing resuscitation in infants with CHD is&#xD;
      helpful compared to immediate cord clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the birth of your baby, a sealed envelope will be opened and your baby will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the DCC with resuscitation group or the ICC group. 40 babies will&#xD;
      be enrolled into this study, 20 in each group. In the DCC group, the umbilical cord will be&#xD;
      clamped after 120 seconds during which time your baby will receive the care he/she requires&#xD;
      by the NICU team. In the ICC group, the umbilical cord will be clamped immediately and he/she&#xD;
      will be brought over the resuscitation bed to be cared for by the same team.&#xD;

      Purpose: Do respiratory and cardiovascular function parameters differ in infants with&#xD;
      congenital left heart heart disease (CHD) who receive active resuscitative care during&#xD;
      Delayed Cord Clamping (DCC) compared to immediate cord clamping (ICC)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Infants with left heart CHD who receive active resuscitative care during DCC will&#xD;
      have improved heart rate in the delivery room (DR) compared to those who receive ICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Based on our literature review, this is the first study to assess the effect&#xD;
      of initiating resuscitation during DCC on cardiovascular function in newborn infants with&#xD;
      left heart CHD. We speculate that initiating resuscitation during DCC will lead to a smoother&#xD;
      transition with improving respiratory and cardiovascular stability in these infants. The&#xD;
      results of our study will than be used to organise a large-multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: infants with left heart CHD who receive active resuscitative care during DCC will&#xD;
      have improved heart rate in the delivery room (DR) compared to those who receive ICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All infants with left heart CHD born at Royal Alexandra Hospital are&#xD;
      eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Infants will be randomized to one of the following study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group: Infants will receive active resuscitative care according to the&#xD;
           Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) guidelines including warmth, dry, suctioning,&#xD;
           oxygen, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or PPV using iNSPiRE platform for&#xD;
           120 seconds during DCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: Infants will have immediate cord clamping as per clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: Randomization: The unique trial number will be block randomized and computer&#xD;
      generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Concealment: Sealed Envelope will be provided. The sealed envelopes will contain a&#xD;
      folded card box, which allocates the unique trial number for this infant and the label &quot;DCC&#xD;
      group&quot; or &quot;ICC group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: There will be no blinding, as it would not be feasible to conduct resuscitation&#xD;
      without the resuscitation team knowing the actual intervention that the subject will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group: The infant will be placed on iNSPiRE platform, the airway will be cleared&#xD;
      if necessary; the baby will be dried and stimulated, and pulse oximeter will be placed on the&#xD;
      right wrist. CPAP will be administered using T-piece resuscitator at 6 cmH2O, with FiO2 of&#xD;
      21%. PPV will be provided at an initial peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 24 cmH2O and rate&#xD;
      of 40-60 bpm in case of apnea, gasping breathing or heart rate &lt;100 bpm. Interventions will&#xD;
      be recorded at 10 seconds intervals; while vital signs will be recorded at 30 seconds&#xD;
      intervals. At 120 seconds after birth, the cord will be clamped and the platform will be&#xD;
      wheeled to the radiant warmer in the delivery room, the baby will be transferred on CPAP, and&#xD;
      resuscitation/transitional care will continue according to the institutional guidelines. If&#xD;
      immediate intubation or chest compressions are required despite initiating CPAP or PPV via&#xD;
      mask and T-piece resuscitator, the procedure will be interrupted, the cord will be clamped,&#xD;
      and the baby transferred to the radiant warmer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Infants randomized to the control arm will have immediate cord clamping as per&#xD;
      hospital guidelines. Once on the radiant warmer, airway will be cleared, and pulse oximeter&#xD;
      placed on the right wrist and routine resuscitation care as per hospital guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management in the delivery room on the radiant warmer for all study groups: The subsequent&#xD;
      management of the infant in the delivery room will follow the institutional guidelines. In&#xD;
      addition, we will use Philips NM3 Respiratory Function Monitor (RFM), placed on a special&#xD;
      trolley/platform to measure the delivered airway pressures, tidal volume (VT), and ECO2 using&#xD;
      a flow sensor placed between the face mask (or the endotracheal tube in case of intubated&#xD;
      infant) and the T-piece resuscitator. The pulse oximeter sensor will be connected to the RFM.&#xD;
      The RFM display screen will show only the SpO2, and other parameters will be concealed from&#xD;
      the resuscitation team. The RFM will be connected to a laptop to allow real time data&#xD;
      acquisition. A video camera mounted on the top of the radiant warmer will be used to record&#xD;
      the management and will stream to the same laptop. Axillary temperature will be measured once&#xD;
      the infant is transferred to the radiant warmer and at 10 minutes of age. Once the infant is&#xD;
      stable he/she will be transferred to the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management in the NICU: Infants will be managed according to the institutional guidelines.&#xD;
      Neonatal Echocardiography will be performed at 6 and 24 hours of age to assess cardiac&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancies complicated by fetal left heart CHD will be recruited through the Fetal &amp;&#xD;
      Neonatal Cardiology Program at the Royal Alexandra Hospital over a period of 24 months.&#xD;
      Approximately another three months will be required to collect hospital data on all infants&#xD;
      enrolled. Resuscitation data will be collected on a standard form (Neonatal Resuscitation&#xD;
      Record) that will form part of each infant's hospital record. Other medical data on each&#xD;
      infant will be collected on Case Report Forms and hemodynamic data will be generated in the&#xD;
      first 24 hours as part of the routine care of these infants on the David Schiff NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signals of airway flow, tidal volume, airway pressure, and exhaled CO2 will be recorded&#xD;
      at 200Hz using Spectra physiological recording program (a customized neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      physiology program). A breath-by-breath analysis will be performed manually for the duration&#xD;
      of each recording. Tidal volume, inflation time, gas flow and exhaled CO2 will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the population. We will use student t-test,&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables and Chi square test or Fisher Exact Test for&#xD;
      categorical variables to compare the groups as appropriate. Randomized infants will be&#xD;
      analyzed in their respective groups regardless of the actual intervention received following&#xD;
      the intension-to-treat concept. However, a priori subgroup comparison will be performed&#xD;
      between the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infants randomized to resuscitative care for 120 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Infants randomized to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: This is a feasibility trial and we estimate to recruit 40 infants (20 per group)&#xD;
      to assess feasibility of this approach.&#xD;
