  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following tooth extraction alveolar ridge will undergo dimensional changes and soft tissue&#xD;
      may collapse. These changes may complicate the subsequent restorative procedure especially in&#xD;
      the esthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was observed that socket-healing process may be divided into three sequential, and&#xD;
      frequently over-lapping phases: inflammatory, proliferative and modeling/remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants placed in fresh extraction sockets alone wasn't found to prevent the resorption of&#xD;
      the alveolar bone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alveolar socket preservation using primary flap closure technique utilizing free gingival&#xD;
      graft in conjunction with bone substitutes didn't produce the desired effect on ridge&#xD;
      preservation compared with bone substitutes alone. A clinical trial showed that achieving&#xD;
      primary closure didn't present additional beneficial effect on preserving ridge width,&#xD;
      however, the mucosa was significantly thicker and more coronally positioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also soft tissue graft has its limitations on covering graft material and socket preservation&#xD;
      due to the higher morbidity given that the soft tissue graft has to be harvested from a donor&#xD;
      site of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another options for socket seal are coronal advancement of buccal flap or rotating grafts&#xD;
      from tissue adjacent to cover the defect but they have limitations such as altering the&#xD;
      mucogingival line and creating a shallow vestibule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lekovic et al. investigated the use of a non-resorbable polytetrafluroethylene membrane but&#xD;
      it was found also to have its limitations as 30% of the membranes became exposed and as a&#xD;
      result loss of bone height and width occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also studies have found that using bone substitutes together with collagen membrane with&#xD;
      primary closure of the socket has shown clear effects on preserving alveolar ridge height as&#xD;
      well as ridge width, however, its limitation are flap dehiscence and subsequent membrane&#xD;
      exposure and the increased cost.&#xD;
