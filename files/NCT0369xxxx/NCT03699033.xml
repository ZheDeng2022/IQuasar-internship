  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of hypofractionated IMRT to 62.5 Gy in 25&#xD;
      fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction) with 4D PET/CT-based radiation treatment planning and concurrent&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in Stage IIIA or Stage IIIB NSCLC subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypofractionated IMRT allows escalation of the biological effective dose (BED) to the tumor&#xD;
      and reduces the radiation treatment duration to 5 weeks. Increasing the BED without&#xD;
      protracting the RT course may be a more effective means of dose escalation than simply&#xD;
      increasing the total dose but using only 2 Gy/fraction, as was tested in RTOG 0617.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators require the use of advanced treatment planning techniques, including 4D CT&#xD;
      simulation, volume delineation utilizing PET/CT to identify gross disease and IMRT to&#xD;
      minimize the total volume of normal tissue receiving a high dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As minimal published work has evaluated hypofractionated RT regimens for Stage III NSCLC with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy, investigators selected a moderately escalated dose/fraction of 2.5&#xD;
      Gy for evaluation in combination with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically proven diagnosis of Stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
             (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IIIA subjects who are considered eligible for resection following neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemoradiation are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No PET/CT evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An MRI of the brain with contrast excluding intracranial metastatic disease (or CT&#xD;
             with contrast if MRI is medically contraindicated). An MRI without contrast is only&#xD;
             permitted if the subject cannot have contrast for medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a pleural effusion is present, it must be tapped and confirmed to be cytologically&#xD;
             negative. If an effusion is deemed too small to safely tap, the subject will be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior thoracic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years at time of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-2 (Karnofsky performance scale ≥ 60).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL; ANC (absolute neutrophil count) &gt; 1500/µl; platelets &gt; 100,000 mcL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must sign study-specific informed consent form prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy and chemotherapy must start within 4 weeks of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of severe or uncontrolled psychiatric or systemic disease (e.g., unstable or&#xD;
             uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease) that would interfere&#xD;
             with study protocol as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active connective tissue disorders, such as active lupus or scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Acquired Immune Deficiency (HIV (+)/AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regiment to harm nursing infants. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use medically approved and adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
