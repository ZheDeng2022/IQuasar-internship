    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect that blood flow restriction training will&#xD;
      have on patients with concussion who demonstrate an intolerance to physical activity.&#xD;
      Progressive exercise training has been shown to effectively reduce the effects of concussion&#xD;
      and facilitate return to academic and athletic activities. In many cases, exercises&#xD;
      intolerance is present in these patients which hinders progression. In musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions, blood flow restriction training, when combined with low load exercise, has been&#xD;
      shown to produce similar gains as high load exercises. If a patient being treated for&#xD;
      concussion can tolerate low load exercise without concussive symptoms, then blood flow&#xD;
      restriction may increase exercise gains by facilitating autonomic responses similar to high&#xD;
      load training. This study will explore this hypothesis in patients between the ages of 14 and&#xD;
      30 who are referred for physical therapy intervention which is the standard of care at Duke&#xD;
      Sports Sciences Concussion Clinic. Blood flow restriction training is also used in multiple&#xD;
      patient populations at Duke Sports Physical Therapy without adverse events.&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized proof of concept trial comparing the efficacy of the novel&#xD;
      application of blood flow restriction to improve exercise tolerance in patients with&#xD;
      post-concussion syndrome. Blood flow restriction training is commonly used in combination&#xD;
      with low intensity/load exercise to facilitate exercise tolerance in those that would not&#xD;
      tolerate high intensity/load exercises. While this intervention has been clinically employed&#xD;
      in patients with concussion, research is needed to establish it's efficacy in a meaningful&#xD;
      and prospective way. Subjects in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
      One group will perform exercises with BFR and then without BFR. The other group will perform&#xD;
      the exercises without BFR first and then perform them with BFR. Each subject will undergo a&#xD;
      single physical therapy session in each condition. Subjects meeting study criteria will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to each group. Because concussion symptoms can change quickly over time,&#xD;
      it will be important to vary the timing of when the blood flow restriction is performed to&#xD;
      better understand if improvement is due to intervention or passage of time. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed via sealed envelope to ensure even distribution into both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to physical therapy for treatment of concussion symptoms will undergo a&#xD;
      physical therapy concussion evaluation that includes orthostatic measurements, cervical&#xD;
      screen, and vestibular-oculomotor screen. Patients will report a Global Function Rating and&#xD;
      complete a Post-concussion Symptom Score, Neck Disability Index, and Dizziness Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory at initial visit. Heart rate variability will also be assessed at initial visit.&#xD;
      The measurements and questionnaires collected at the initial evaluation are part of the&#xD;
      standard of care at this clinic. Subjects will be recruited after the initial visit and will&#xD;
      have already completed these measurements/questionnaires. It is also standard of care to&#xD;
      continue to administer these questionnaires as symptom status changes throughout the course&#xD;
      of treatment until discharge. At the subsequent visit, subjects will undergo cardiovascular&#xD;
      testing on a stationary bike to identify symptom provocation and exercise tolerance with&#xD;
      aerobic exercise. The above evaluative tools and interventions are standard of practice for&#xD;
      concussion patients being treated by physical therapy at the Duke Sports Concussion Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Procedure (BFR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood flow restriction (BFR) cuff is applied to dominant leg and limb occlusion pressure&#xD;
      (LOP) and personalized tourniquet pressure (PTP) at 80% is determined with the patient in&#xD;
      supine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an established BFR protocol of 4 sets of exercises with repetitions of 30-15-15-15, the&#xD;
      patient will perform the exercises of double leg squat and forward lunge under occlusion.&#xD;
      There will be a 30 second break between each set and 1 minute break between exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the physical therapist will move BFR cuff to opposite leg and reassess LOP/PTP 80%. The&#xD;
      patient will repeat squat and forward lunge exercises as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be discontinued if there is a greater than 3 point change in subjective&#xD;
      symptom report. If the patient reports leg pain/discomfort, the pressure will be decreased by&#xD;
      10%. If still unable to complete the exercise due to leg discomfort, the intervention will be&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate range during each set Maximum heart rate during the recovery period Rate of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (RPE) and symptom report will be obtained during each recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total time under occlusion upon completion of the round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Procedure (No BFR):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform the 4 sets of each exercise with repetitions of 30-15-15-15. There will&#xD;
      be a 30 second break between each set and 1 minute break between exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercises will include double leg squat, dominant leg forward lunge, repeat double leg&#xD;
      squat, and non-dominant leg forward lunge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate range during each set Maximum heart rate during the recovery period Rate of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (RPE) and symptom report will be obtained during each recovery period.&#xD;
