  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial on the use of total marrow irradiation (TMI) given&#xD;
      concurrently with fludarabine, a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat leukemia, as a&#xD;
      myeloablative therapy for patients undergoing Allo-HSCT. TMI is a targeted technique to&#xD;
      deliver radiation to the bone marrow while minimizing dose to other normal organs in the&#xD;
      body. In phase I of the clinical study, the dose of radiation to the bone marrow will be&#xD;
      incrementally increased to determine the highest tolerated TMI dose. In phase II, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the TMI-fludarabine conditioning regimen utilizing that dose of radiation&#xD;
      will be studied. Acute and long-term toxicity data as well as quality of life data will also&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Stopping criteria was met during the first dose level cohort in Phase l. The trial will not&#xD;
      continue into Phase II as originally planned.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy based total marrow irradiation (TMI) concurrent with&#xD;
      fludarabine as a myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (Allo-HSCT), as well as to determine the efficacy of the regimen in patients&#xD;
      with high-risk and relapsed or refractory leukemia and myelodysplasia. TMI, which allows for&#xD;
      conformal dosing of target bone marrow tissue while giving lower doses to organs at risk, is&#xD;
      considered by many to be a superior alternative to conventional total body irradiation (TBI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the MTD of TMI given concurrently with fludarabine (fixed at 150 mg/m2) as a&#xD;
      conditioning regimen for Allo-HSCT for patients with high risk (relapsed/refractory) acute&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and&#xD;
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-arm exploratory study to expand the cohort at the MTD level to estimate 1- year&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), with the objective of increasing the OS from the historical rate of&#xD;
      30% (null hypothesis ) to 50% (alternate hypothesis) with 80% power and a one-sided type I&#xD;
      error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the extramedullary toxicity and the incidence of complications, including&#xD;
           mucositis, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD), sinusoidal obstruction&#xD;
           syndrome (SOS), and pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the time to engraftment of neutrophils and platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe the disease response rate at day 30 after transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe the overall survival and disease-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Describe the cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine the correlation between plasma/serum markers and radiation induced acute and&#xD;
           long term toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Describe the quality of life metrics of participating subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stopping criteria was met during the first dose level cohort in Phase l. The trial&#xD;
                will not continue into Phase II as originally planned.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Standard &quot;3+3&quot; phase I design of dose escalation using 3 patients per dose level cohort with an expansion to 6 patients at the MTD will be used in Phase I. We will treat 3 patients at the initial dose level of TMI. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 of the 3 patients demonstrates DLT, an additional 3 patients are treated at that dose level. If only 1 of the 6 shows DLT, the next cohort of three patients is entered at the next dose level. If 2 or more of the 6 demonstrate DLT, the MTD is defined as the previous dose level. If no DLT is observed in the final dose level, the number of patients treated will be expanded to 6. In phase II, we will enroll additional patients at the defined MTD level.&#xD;
