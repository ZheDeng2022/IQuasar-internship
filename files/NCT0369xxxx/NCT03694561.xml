    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with no study related treatment of interventions. The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to investigate and document disease specific clinical symptoms in newborns,&#xD;
      infants and children with Pompe disease without cardiomyopathy identified in newborn&#xD;
      screening(NBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be baseline, months 6 and months 12 visits for infants and newborns (infants&#xD;
      study). For children of ages 24 months to 54 months, there will be baseline, year 1 and year&#xD;
      2 visits (children study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study and record disease specific clinical symptoms in newborns, infants and children&#xD;
           with Pompe disease without cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) in the first&#xD;
           year of life identified through newborn screening (NBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To devise an approach to characterize early musculoskeletal (muscles and joints)&#xD;
           involvement in subjects with the &quot;late-onset&quot; GAA variant identified by NBS including&#xD;
           ability to collect research information via virtual health platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine criteria to start preventative therapies including enzyme replacement&#xD;
           therapy (ERT) in patients with clinical features of Pompe disease identified via NBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To document parental coping and anxiety/emotional distress overtime using quality of&#xD;
           life questionnaires after a child is diagnosed with late onset Pompe disease via NBS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late-Onset Pompe Disease(LOPD) is an inherited disorder caused by lack of or defect in the&#xD;
      enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). GAA enzyme deficiency causes glycogen to build up and&#xD;
      damage cells throughout the body, especially in the heart and muscles. In LOPD, subtle and&#xD;
      overt disease-specific features may go unrecognized in childhood without vigilant clinical&#xD;
      examination and assessments with appropriate functional tests. In our clinical experience,&#xD;
      children with the &quot;late-onset&quot; GAA variant may present much earlier in life and adult&#xD;
      patients with LOPD consistently report a much earlier symptom onset and a significant&#xD;
      diagnostic delay. These patients have shown improvement after initiation of ERT but have&#xD;
      motor impairments adversely affecting their quality of life and growth from early childhood.&#xD;
      Therefore, earlier diagnosis and initiation of ERT is crucial in these patients. Instituting&#xD;
      ERT at an ideal time may prevent/reduce these irreversible musculoskeletal impairments and&#xD;
      lead to a better quality of life and less disease burden as these children age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team of Pompe disease experts will perform detailed clinical evaluations, physical&#xD;
      therapy evaluations, cardiac assessments, speech and swallow evaluations, biochemical tests,&#xD;
      sleep questionnaire, and hearing assessments on these patients. These assessments will allow&#xD;
      use to capture and describe the earlier clinical phenotype in these patients and provide&#xD;
      insights into the early signs and symptoms of LOPD.This study will provide and evidence-based&#xD;
      approach to clinical management of newborns with LOPD to primary care physicians and&#xD;
      geneticists, leading to improves patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 20 infants and children at Duke that has screened for LOPD.&#xD;
      This study involves minimal risk to the patient and offers a potential benefit of improved&#xD;
      disease management. For infants, the initial visit will be as soon as possible after a&#xD;
      confirmed LOPD diagnosis and follow up visits will be at 6 months and 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will continue to gather clinical information on patients and monitor clinical&#xD;
      status beyond assessment at three time points. For children of ages 24 months to 54 months,&#xD;
      there will be baseline, year 1 and year 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has four goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study and record disease specific clinical symptoms in newborns, infants and children&#xD;
           with Pompe disease without cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) in the first&#xD;
           year of life identified through newborn screening (NBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To devise an approach to characterize early musculoskeletal (muscles and joints)&#xD;
           involvement in subjects with the &quot;late-onset&quot; GAA variant identified by NBS including&#xD;
           ability to collect research information via virtual health platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine criteria to start preventative therapies including enzyme replacement&#xD;
           therapy (ERT) in patients with clinical features of Pompe disease identified via NBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To document parental coping and anxiety/emotional distress overtime using quality of&#xD;
           life questionnaires after a child is diagnosed with late onset Pompe disease via NBS&#xD;
