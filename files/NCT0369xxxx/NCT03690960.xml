    <textblock>
      The treatment for immature teeth with pulp necrosis can be carried out through apexification&#xD;
      or regenerative endodontics procedures including platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrin (PRF) and injectable PRF, these techniques used alone or in combination.&#xD;
      Revascularization therapy carries on more advantages than apexification, such as inducing&#xD;
      root-end development and reinforcement. However, apical repair will not happen in the&#xD;
      presence of inflamed and infected tissue.the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      antimicrobial effect of pre-synthesized novel antibiotic loaded electrospun nanofibers used&#xD;
      in patients with immature necrotic teeth.&#xD;

      Title: Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Effect of Pre-synthesized Novel Antibiotic Electrospun&#xD;
      Nanofibers as an Intracanal Delivery Strategy for Regenerative Endodontics - A Randomized&#xD;
      Clinical Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Regenerative endodontics technique outcome depends on microbial elimination because&#xD;
      apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. It is well established&#xD;
      that bacteria are essential for the development of pulpal and periapical pathosis.&#xD;
      Eradication or control of bacteria may provide optimal treatment outcome. However,&#xD;
      elimination of bacteria from infected root canal systems is challenging. Numerous measures&#xD;
      have been described to reduce the number of bacteria in the root canal system, including the&#xD;
      use of various instrumentation techniques, irrigation regimens and intra-canal medicaments.&#xD;
      There is no definitive evidence in the literature that all these measures result in a&#xD;
      bacteria-free root canal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore additional methods such as the use of intra-canal medicaments are required in order&#xD;
      to maximize disinfection of root canal system and kill as many bacteria as possible.&#xD;
      Antibiotics have been proposed as intracanal medicament but any single antibiotic is unlikely&#xD;
      effective to sterilize diverse flora in root canal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, triple antibiotic mixture (TAP) has been reported for successful disinfection of&#xD;
      infected root dentine. This mixture consist of ciprofloxacin (CIP), metronidazole (MET) and&#xD;
      minocycline (MINO) which consistently sterilize bacteria of infected dentine and infected&#xD;
      pulps . Specifically, MET is a bactericidal imidazole that is highly effective against&#xD;
      obligate anaerobic bacteria, CIP is a bactericidal broad-spectrum synthetic quinolone and&#xD;
      MINO is a bacteriostatic broad-spectrum tetracycline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as minocycline binds to dentin and causes tooth discoloration, it is recommended to&#xD;
      remove minocycline from TAP and use only MET and CIP, or to use modified TAPs containing&#xD;
      cefaclor or clindamycin (CLIN). CLIN is a bacteriostatic lincosamide known for its efficacy&#xD;
      against a broad spectrum of endodontic bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, an innovative strategy has been considered to develop a low-concentration,&#xD;
      yet antimicrobially effective and biocompatible polymer-based nanofibrous electrospun&#xD;
      scaffolds as a drug delivery system to promote intracanal biofilm eradication .&#xD;
      Electrospinning has been considered as a highly effective process to obtain extracellular&#xD;
      matrix (ECM) mimicking structures with adequate chemistry and three-dimensional porous&#xD;
      architectures Moreover, it has enabled the synthesis of bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds The&#xD;
      electrospinning technology has attracted great interest in recent decades, thanks to its&#xD;
      capability of easily and effectively processing a huge range of polymeric materials in form&#xD;
      of nanofibers. In recent years, the health concerns associated with the systemic side effects&#xD;
      of synthetic compounds used in medicine and the emergence of antibiotic resistance of&#xD;
      pathogens have driven electrospinning research towards the development of antibiotic loaded&#xD;
      nanofibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis To test the null hypothesis, which is in patients with necrotic immature teeth,&#xD;
      will the use of pre-synthesized clindamycin modified triple antibiotic electrospun nanofibers&#xD;
      have more profound antimicrobial effect than modified triple antibiotic paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective To compare the antimicrobial effect of pre-synthesized novel&#xD;
           antibiotic loaded nanofibers used in patients with immature necrotic teeth with modified&#xD;
           triple antibiotic paste.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective To evaluate the morphology of pre-synthesized antibiotic loaded&#xD;
           electrospun nanofibers.&#xD;
