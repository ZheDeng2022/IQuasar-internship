  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center stratified (on gender and donor), block randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel group trial with 12-months follow-up of 80 chronic fatigue&#xD;
      syndrome/encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) participants. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      treatment by preprocessed thawed donor fecal microbiota transplant or preprocessed thawed&#xD;
      autologous fecal microbiota transplant. Primary endpoint is the efficacy of FMT at three&#xD;
      months by the Fatigue Severity Scale. The investigators will use patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      for primary and secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies suggest that a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may be a key feature in&#xD;
      CFS/ME. We hypothesize that&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: CFS/ME is caused by a dysbiosis in the gut flora causing barrier leakage of bacterial&#xD;
      products, a low grade systemic immune activation and disturbances in the host energy&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Recovery of a normal gut flora by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) alleviates&#xD;
      symptoms and may even induce remission of CFS/ME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to determine if there is a true cause and effect relationship between a&#xD;
      dysbiotic gut flora and CFS/ME by testing if treatment of the observed dysbiosis by FMT also&#xD;
      can resolve CFS/ME symptoms. In this process, collection of blood, fecal, and urine samples&#xD;
      before and after FMT will open the possibility to explore the relationship between the gut&#xD;
      flora, immune response, host energy metabolism and CFS/ME using technologies of microbiomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics and immunological characterizations for a better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathobiology of CFS/ME.&#xD;

      CFS/ME participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners recruit participants from the local area, by posters at the doctors'&#xD;
      offices. In addition the study has a facebook site, named &quot;the COMEBACK study&quot;, where&#xD;
      interested CFS/ME subjects can submit their interest to be assessed for participation. After&#xD;
      a telephone screening of potential participants by the Canada Criteria and CFS/ME severity&#xD;
      rating, eligible subjects will be referred to department of physical medicine and&#xD;
      rehabilitation UNN Harstad (FYSMED) and re-assessed. During this screening process the&#xD;
      investigators will keep a track record of screening failures noting reason for failure.&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam and necessary workup including blood, fecal and urine&#xD;
      tests to exclude differential diagnosis according to the Norwegian National Guidelines for&#xD;
      Assessment of CFS/ME. Participants receive information about the study and give their written&#xD;
      consent. Subjects earlier diagnosed with CFS/ME at FYSMED will undertake the same&#xD;
      re-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the work up, participants will do the Fatigue Severity Scale, Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression scale, SF 36, Modified DePaul Questionnaire, the Rome IV criteria for irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome, and the &quot;Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status&quot;&#xD;
      test (RBANS). Heart rate variability is implemented as an additional measure when&#xD;
      approximately 40 out of 80 participants are assigned treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors are recruited informally from the local high schools. Donors are included and screened&#xD;
      according to the European Consensus Guidelines from 2017. The full screening will be&#xD;
      undertaken before the first feces donation and every 4th week. The inclusion and screening&#xD;
      will be performed at the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation UNN Harstad. The&#xD;
      investigators will keep a track record of screening failures noting reason for failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive FMT at the gastroenterology outpatient clinic at University Hospital of&#xD;
      North Norway Harstad, Norway. No antibiotics are given prior to the intervention. The&#xD;
      participants must do a bowel lavage using Sodiumpicosulphate/Magnesiumcitrate (Picoprep,&#xD;
      Ferring) before intervention. The treatment will be administered by enema. Active treatment&#xD;
      will be pre-processed frozen donor feces. Placebo will be the participant's own feces&#xD;
      processed and frozen during the study inclusion. After the intervention, the participants&#xD;
      have no restrictions on activity level and are asked to keep an unchanged diet without&#xD;
      introduction of any new food supplements or probiotics in the follow up period. To keep track&#xD;
      of change in diet investigators ask participants to do a food frequency questionnaire before&#xD;
      the FMT and at 3 and 12 months after the intervention. Use of antibiotics, food supplement&#xD;
      and use of medications will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will take place in blocks of four consecutive participants per day. A data&#xD;
      engineer at the Department of Clinical Research at the University Hospital of North Norway,&#xD;
      Tromsø (UNN,Tromsø) creates the allocation sequence using the REDCap software. The treatment&#xD;
      is randomized on donor and placebo in fixed blocks of 4 with 2 active (1 donor A and 1 donor&#xD;
      B) and 2 placebo. Block allocation will be stratified on gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratification on donor and gender will be performed by assigning full blocks of male and&#xD;
      female participants. In the two active slots in each block of four, one active slot will be&#xD;
      used for donor A and one for donor B. The stratification of gender reflects the higher&#xD;
      incidence of CFS/ME in women. Donor fecal microbiota transplants stored for more than two&#xD;
      years will be disposed and replaced with transplants from a new donor. If this happens, donor&#xD;
      fecal microbiota transplants from the new donor will be assigned in remaining slots from the&#xD;
      donor with the expired transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation is done in solitude in a closed room with no transparency, only containing a&#xD;
      freezer with the active transplants (tagged by donor batch ID) and the placebo transplants&#xD;
      (tagged by screening number). Before allocation of treatment, an investigator places the&#xD;
      FMT-placebos on a table in the room. The allocator can then enter the room as the researcher&#xD;
      placing all the placebos leaves the room. The allocator will access the randomization&#xD;
      sequence when entering participants screening number on the REDCap software using a computer&#xD;
      in the same room. The allocator will be the only person involved in the study that can access&#xD;
      the randomization program at the REDCap software. If a screening number is randomized to&#xD;
      active treatment, the allocator removes the tag from the placebo and places it on a donor FMT&#xD;
      treatment instead. All unused placebo transplants will be disposed immediately. When&#xD;
      finished, the allocator places the allocated treatment in a box in a designated freezer. The&#xD;
      allocator will build a key file matching the active treatment to the donor batch id by&#xD;
      updating a key file on paper and store it in a safe not accessible to any others. In addition&#xD;
      the allocator will write the corresponding patient screeningnumber on tags from the used&#xD;
      donor batch and keep them as backup in the same safe. This will allow for tracking of each&#xD;
      individual donor batch to a corresponding participant at the end of trial when all follow up&#xD;
      is complete.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion with treatment success in FSS score in donor versus placebo FMT group. Treatment success is defined as an improvement of more than 1.2 points on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a self-reported, 9-item fatigue scale. Participants rate all 9 items on a 7-point Likert scale (1-2-3-4-5-6-7) depending on how appropriate they felt the statement applied to them over the preceding week. The total score is calculated by adding up the answer from each item and divide by 9. Lower scores indicate better outcomes. Maximum score is 7.&#xD;
In an intention to treat analysis we will categorize participants as responders/non-responders, defining responders as decrease of more than 1,2 to the total baseline score in the FSS at 3 months post FMT by Chi Square. Baseline score will be the average of the two scores from the screening period. Missing values will be regarded as non responders</description>

    <time_frame>Change in SF36 score by repeated measures from baseline and until 3 and 12 months after treamtent</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline and until three months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>RBANS is a neuropsychological assessment that consists of ten subtests which give scores to five domains: Immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional ability, language, attention and delayed memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in donor versus placebo FMT group in anxiety and depression by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in HADS score by repeated measures from baseline and until 3 and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is an instrument with 14-items for detection of depression and anxiety in hospitalized patients. Scores range from 1-21 interpreted as: normal (0-7), mild (8-10), moderate (11-14), severe (15-21). Subscales for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) is also defined. We will explore the FMT effects on HADS by an independent sample T-test (or, if necessary, non-parametric Mann-Whitney) comparing change in global score. We will apply last value forward for missing values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in donor versus placebo FMT group in gastrointestinal related complaints by the sum score of selected items in the DePaul Questionnaire (DPQ) (29, 30, 46 and 47)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in DPQ score by repeated measures from baseline and until 6 and 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DPQ assesses key symptoms of ME/CFS such as fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints, post-exertional malaise, sleep, pain, neurological/cognitive impairments and autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune symptoms. At each item, participants have to rate the frequency and severity of the symptom on a scale from 0 to 4. We wil use the sum score from the questions that assess gastrointestinal complaints in the DPQ in this endpoint. This endpoint was implemented after 19 out of 80 participants had completed the three months follow up</description>
