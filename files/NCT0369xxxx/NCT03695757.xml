    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective pilot clinical study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunostimulatory effect of intramuscularly administrations of autologous total IgG&#xD;
      (autologous total IgG therapy) in healthy subjects and patients with advanced solid tumor&#xD;
      (non-small cell lung cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer,&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, biliary cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma etc.). In addition,&#xD;
      antitumor effect of intramuscularly administrations of autologous total IgG in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumor will be also evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After providing informed consent, study participants will be assessed for study eligibility&#xD;
      at the screening visit. At screening visit (week -4), venous blood (320~400 mL) will be&#xD;
      sampled using a double blood bag containing anticoagulant. Autologous plasma will be&#xD;
      separated from the venous blood by centrifugation. During the 4 weeks of screening period,&#xD;
      autologous total IgG (purity ≥97%) will be aseptically purified from the autologous plasma by&#xD;
      chromatography using Protein A. Participants will receive the 8 intramuscular injections of&#xD;
      autologous total IgG, twice a week for 4 weeks from baseline (week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the safety and immunostimulatory effect of intervention of&#xD;
      this study by analyzing side effects, serum concentrations of immunological parameters&#xD;
      (immunoglobulin, cytokine, etc.), and lymphocyte fraction by flow cytometry analysis of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Part A) Autologous total IgG therapy in healthy subjects] The duration of this clinical&#xD;
      study in healthy subjects is 16 weeks from the screening visit. A 4-week screening period&#xD;
      will be followed by a 4-week intervention period and an 8-week follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Part B) Autologous total IgG therapy in patients with advanced solid tumor] The duration of&#xD;
      this clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumor is 12 weeks from the screening&#xD;
      visit. A 4-week screening period will be followed by a 4-week intervention period and a&#xD;
      4-week follow-up period(1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients agree to participate in additional long-term repeated study interventions at&#xD;
      the end of 1st cycle of visit, patients will receive repeated study interventions in same the&#xD;
      schedule up to week 44 (maximum 4 cycles). At the end of each cycle, antitumor effect will be&#xD;
      evaluated by serum tumor marker concentrations, anatomical imaging, and Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in solid tumors (RECIST ver. 1.1).&#xD;
