  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial to establish methodological feasibility and&#xD;
      determine whether a web-based, continuing dental education intervention regarding opioid&#xD;
      prescribing risk mitigation strategies - consistent with ADA guidelines - produces&#xD;
      pre-to-post changes in knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills pertaining to the use of&#xD;
      risk mitigation strategies when prescribing opioids in dental practice. The current study&#xD;
      involves completion of a self-report pre-test (dentists), randomization to complete ROPEs or&#xD;
      attention control intervention, completion of a self-report post-test (immediately following&#xD;
      intervention/control completion), and completion of 1-month self-report follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <description>The Knowledge Change Questionnaire was developed specifically for this study and contains five items that assess dentists' knowledge regarding: (1) dentists' role in curbing prescription opioid misuse, initiation to abuse, and diversion; (2) recent released guideline recommendations for standard pain management in dental practices; and, (3) risk mitigation strategies, such as prescription opioid misuse screening and use of their state's PDMP. One point is awarded for each correct response to items on the questionnaire. The questionnaire scale ranges from 0 (no correct items, least knowledge) to 5 (all correct items, most knowledge).&#xD;
This outcome will assess mean differences between groups in their change (from pre-test to one-month follow-up) in knowledge regarding best practices in dental opioid prescribing.</description>

        <description>The Knowledge Change Questionnaire was developed specifically for this study and contains five items that assess dentists' knowledge regarding: (1) dentists' role in curbing prescription opioid misuse, initiation to abuse, and diversion; (2) recent released guideline recommendations for standard pain management in dental practices; and, (3) risk mitigation strategies, such as prescription opioid misuse screening and use of their state's PDMP. One point is awarded for each correct response to items on the questionnaire. The questionnaire scale ranges from 0 (no correct items, least knowledge) to 5 (all correct items, most knowledge).&#xD;
This outcome will assess mean differences between groups in their change (from pre-test to one-month follow-up) in knowledge regarding best practices in dental opioid prescribing.</description>

All key intervention content is delivered via video-based platform and includes downloadable practice aides and resources.</description>

          <title>Change at Post-test From Baseline in Knowledge Change Questionnaire Score</title>
          <description>The Knowledge Change Questionnaire was developed specifically for this study and contains five items that assess dentists' knowledge regarding: (1) dentists' role in curbing prescription opioid misuse, initiation to abuse, and diversion; (2) recent released guideline recommendations for standard pain management in dental practices; and, (3) risk mitigation strategies, such as prescription opioid misuse screening and use of their state's PDMP. One point is awarded for each correct response to items on the questionnaire. The questionnaire scale ranges from 0 (no correct items, least knowledge) to 5 (all correct items, most knowledge).&#xD;
This outcome will assess mean differences between groups in their change (from pre-test to post-test) in knowledge regarding best practices in dental opioid prescribing.</description>

      <desc>As this was deemed a minimal risk study by IRB of record, with the greatest risk to participants being loss of confidentiality. This study relied on non-systematic assessment, i.e., participant report of adverse or serious adverse events. No investigator initiated assessment of adverse events was conducted.</desc>
