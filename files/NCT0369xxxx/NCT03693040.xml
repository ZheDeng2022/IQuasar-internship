      This study uses an ingestion sensor and a wearable sensor (worn as a patch on the skin),&#xD;
      which are new Proteus Digital Health (PDH) technologies approved by the FDA, to collect&#xD;
      information about patients taking their Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) medication for HIV&#xD;
      prevention. The wearable sensor records information, which is uploaded wirelessly to a mobile&#xD;
      device and then to a secure computer. Together the sensors and the mobile device transmitting&#xD;
      the information to the study computer are called a digital health feedback system (DHFS),&#xD;
      which gives healthcare providers information about when patients have taken their PrEP&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the DHFS is easy to use and acceptable to&#xD;
      people taking PrEP; that patients will persist with its use; and that the system provides&#xD;
      valid, accurate measures of adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single arm open label intervention study over 12 weeks using the&#xD;
      DHFS with participants initiating or continuing HIV PrEP. The study intervention has an&#xD;
      initiation (Phase 1), persistence (Phase 2) and follow-up period up to 96 weeks. In phase 1&#xD;
      participants will use the DHFS with close follow-up incorporating visits with directly&#xD;
      observed ingestions. In Phase 2 the participants utilize the DHFS in their natural setting&#xD;
      with sporadic study visits until 12 weeks. Eligible HIV seronegative participants will&#xD;
      receive an ingestible sensor enabled oral antiretroviral (IS-ARV) of TDF/FTC (Truvada®). The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at the UCSD AVRC. Participants will be recruited from UCSD AVRC, UCSD&#xD;
      Owen Clinic, related or affiliated UCSD primary care programs or community primary care&#xD;
      clinics. Following the 12 week intervention participants will undergo HIV testing and&#xD;
      continuation on HIV PrEP and followed for up to 96 weeks. The primary outcome will be an&#xD;
      accurate measure of adherence i.e. the number of doses of selected IS-ARVs ingested, as&#xD;
      captured by the DHFS, over the number of doses prescribed, adjusted for positive detection&#xD;
      accuracy (PDA), defined as the percentage of detected sensors that have been administered&#xD;
      under direct observation.The investigators will also assess the acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      of longitudinal monitoring in real time of the ingestion rate utilizing the DHFS. In addition&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate the ability of the DHFS to identify participants whose&#xD;
      longitudinal medication taking and timing patterns in the first 12 weeks of ARV treatment&#xD;
      puts them at risk for HIV infection as far out as 96 weeks from start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Substudy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To obtain TDF/FTC serum levels data comparing co-encapsulated IS-Truvada formulation to&#xD;
      native Truvada® as supplemental information to dissolution studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 12 participants prescribed IS-Truvada®:(tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate/emtiritabine) for PrEP will be enrolled in a PK sub-study to provide supplementary&#xD;
      data to dissolution studies conducted by Gilead Sciences on the co-encapsulated IS-Truvada&#xD;
      formulation. On Day 14 of treatment, when drug concentrations are expected to be close to&#xD;
      steady state, sub-study participants will have a PK profile for Tenofovir and Emtricitabine&#xD;
      obtained over a single dosing interval (at time 0 (pre-dose Ctrough), 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24&#xD;
      hours). Participants will be seen at the AVRC in a fasting state prior to taking their dose&#xD;
      of IS-Truvada® and will remain fasting for 2 hours after the observed ingestion. The time and&#xD;
      date of the previous doses of IS-Truvada® will be recorded by and available from the DHFS&#xD;
      prior to initiating the PK procedures. The following day, Day 15, the participant will return&#xD;
      to the AVRC in a fasting state. The 24 hour plasma sample will be drawn. Participants will&#xD;
      then receive an observed dose of native Truvada. Participants will remain fasting for 2 hours&#xD;
      after the observed ingestion and will have plasma samples drawn at 2, and 4 hours after&#xD;
      ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed for tenofovir and emtricitabine drug concentration levels either&#xD;
      individually or in batches at the central specialized laboratory.&#xD;
