  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Physicians Committee is carrying out a research study to improve the investigator's&#xD;
      understanding and expand the literature to quantify the effect of foods on blood cholesterol.&#xD;
      This study will measure changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration, sometimes&#xD;
      called &quot;bad cholesterol,&quot; over 2 study periods of 4 weeks each, with 1 rest week in between.&#xD;
      Approximately 50 subjects will participate in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 9-week double-blind, crossover trial, participants will consume baked goods with either&#xD;
      2 egg yolks or an isocaloric egg-free product daily for 4 weeks. After a one-week washout&#xD;
      period, participants will cross to the other dietary intervention. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      not to make changes to their exercise patterns or diet, apart from consuming the provided&#xD;
      products, for the study period. Changes in LDL cholesterol concentrations will be the primary&#xD;
      dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study evaluations, known as health assessments, will be held at the Physicians Committee's&#xD;
      office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignment: After the study entry, will be assigned by chance, like the flip of a coin,&#xD;
      to one of two groups. The participant will have an equal chance of being assigned to either&#xD;
      group. Each group will be asked to consume baked goods daily. The two groups will consume the&#xD;
      same baked goods, but in a different order. The baked goods will be made from wheat flour&#xD;
      with a small amount of sugar, salt, yeast, and other ingredients that are common to baked&#xD;
      goods. There will be no animal-derived ingredients, except that some products will contain&#xD;
      egg. Each week, the participant will be given a week's worth of baked goods.&#xD;

    <description>In a randomized, 9-week crossover trial, we will test the effects of dietary cholesterol in individuals without baseline cholesterol intake through two 4-week dietary intervention periods, using baked goods containing egg yolks or egg-free baked goods. During the egg phase participants will consume two egg yolks a day for four weeks. Each week, participants will be given a week's worth of baked goods containing two egg yolks each.</description>
