  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC) is usually asymptomatic; nevertheless, there are studies&#xD;
      that show that up to two thirds of patients may present some type of extrahepatic&#xD;
      manifestation. The most frequent extrahepatic manifestation is type II mixed cryoglobulinemia&#xD;
      (MCG-II) and clinically the most common presentation is leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV)&#xD;
      with palpable purpura that affects the lower extremities. It is estimated that up to 80% of&#xD;
      MCG-II cases are due to CHC. Also, previous studies have demonstrated that CHC prevalence is&#xD;
      higher in patients with autoimmune diseases compared with general population. Therefore, if&#xD;
      vasculitis is an extrahepatic manifestation of CHC, then the prevalence of CHC infection in&#xD;
      this group of patients could be higher than the prevalence reported in general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to know the prevalence of CHC, determined by serological rapid test&#xD;
      for hepatitis C screening, then all positive cases will be confirmed by quantitative viral&#xD;
      load, in patients who consult primarily to a rheumatology department for &quot;vasculitis&quot; or&#xD;
      other potential hepatitis C extrahepatic manifestations (rheumatological conditions).&#xD;

      1. Introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The prevalence of Hepatitis C determined by serological test to detect antibodies&#xD;
           against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is around 1.4% in Mexico, being slightly higher in&#xD;
           the north (2.0%) than in the south (1.5%). ) and the entities of the center (1.1%) of&#xD;
           the country. However, there are high risk groups where the prevalence is much higher,&#xD;
           for example, among intravenous drug users such as heroin, it is estimated that&#xD;
           prevalence of hepatitis C is as high as 11.7%, with an interval ranging from 2.7 to&#xD;
           39.1% .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recently, the Global Prevalence study of HCV - Polaris Observatory at American&#xD;
           Association for de the Study of Liver (AASLD), has documented that the prevalence in&#xD;
           Mexico determined by viral load quantification (which is the most specific study) ranges&#xD;
           from 0.0 to 0.6%, being higher in the North, than in the Center and in the South of the&#xD;
           country.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although it is classically considered that chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC) is&#xD;
           usually asymptomatic, there are studies that show that up to two thirds of patients may&#xD;
           present some type of extrahepatic manifestation. The most frequent extrahepatic&#xD;
           manifestation is type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MCG-II) and clinically the most common&#xD;
           presentation is leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) with palpable purpura that affects the&#xD;
           lower extremities. It is estimated that up to 80% of MCG-II cases are due to CHC. The&#xD;
           prevalence of CHC infection has been reported in higher numbers in patients with LCV&#xD;
           than in the general population. A multinational study in 2009, found that the prevalence&#xD;
           of anti-HCV antibodies specifically in patients consulting for &quot;autoimmune diseases&quot; was&#xD;
           as high as 8.7%, compared to healthy subjects (general population) where it was 0.4%. In&#xD;
           this study, the diagnosis of CHC with determination of viral load or genotype was not&#xD;
           confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In another study, conducted in Brazil, which included 367 patients with rheumatological&#xD;
           diseases, the prevalence of CHC, confirmed with viral load determination, was 1.9%, also&#xD;
           higher than that reported in the open population in that country. The difference&#xD;
           remarkable in the prevalences reported by serological tests and by viral load,&#xD;
           particularly in patients with autoimmune diseases, can be explained because patients&#xD;
           with autoimmune diseases have autoantibodies that can generate cross reactions and&#xD;
           result in false positives, for this reason, in the presence of a positive result in&#xD;
           these tests, must always be confirmed with the gold standard that is the quantification&#xD;
           of viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Will the prevalence of hepatitis C determined by quantitative viral load be higher in&#xD;
           patients who consult as first-line for vasculitis, a possible extrahepatic manifestation&#xD;
           of HCV, compared to that reported in the general Mexican population?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Approach of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous studies in other countries show that the prevalence of HCV infection is higher&#xD;
           in patients with autoimmune clinical manifestations, specifically vasculitis, since this&#xD;
           may be extrahepatic manifestation of HCV, compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Mexico, the prevalence of HCV in the population of patients with &quot;vasculitis&quot; has&#xD;
           never been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since the timely detection of chronic HCV infection requires a high degree of suspicion&#xD;
           based on the patient's risk factors, and since their symptoms are totally nonspecific,&#xD;
           and knowing that vasculitis associated with MCG-II is the most extrahepatic&#xD;
           manifestation common of HCV, the investigators consider relevant to perform an HCV&#xD;
           screening in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Justification.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At present, HCV infection is curable with high effectiveness, achieving the sustained&#xD;
           viral response in more than 95% of cases with the new direct antiviral agents. Early&#xD;
           diagnosis depends on the patient having access to an effective treatment and that&#xD;
           achieving a virological cure achieves a favorable prognosis for function and life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If vasculitis is an extrahepatic manifestation of HCV, then the prevalence of chronic&#xD;
           HCV infection in this group of patients will be higher than the prevalence reported in&#xD;
           the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           General: To know the real prevalence of hepatitis C determined by quantitative viral&#xD;
           load in patients who consult for the first intention to a rheumatology department for&#xD;
           &quot;vasculitis and with a positive result in the serological HCV screening test&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific(1): To describe the clinical characteristics of hepatic and extrahepatic&#xD;
           manifestations of patients with &quot;vasculitis&quot; detected with Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific (2): To determine the real prevalence of hepatitis C determined by quantitative&#xD;
           viral load in patients who consult for other rheumatological conditions (non-vasculitis)&#xD;
           with a positive result in the serological HCV screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Material and methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Type and design of the study: Observational study, case series, descriptive and&#xD;
                analytical.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inclusion criteria: Patients who first attend to a Rheumatology department, to be&#xD;
                evaluated for diagnosis of &quot;vasculitis under study&quot; or &quot;vasculitis of origin to be&#xD;
                determined&quot; or &quot;rheumatological condition for study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Exclusion criteria: Patients who do not wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Elimination criteria: Patients who do not have a complete clinical file.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Population and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Population: All patients who first attend to a Rheumatology department, to be&#xD;
                evaluated for diagnosis of &quot;vasculitis under study&quot; or &quot;vasculitis of origin to be&#xD;
                determined&quot; or &quot;rheumatological condition for study&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Sample size: Assuming a prevalence of between 5 to 10%, in this specific&#xD;
                population, a total of 1000 patients need to be evaluated, to find between 50 to&#xD;
                100 patients with chronic HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Data collection and Procedures: The investigators will obtain the informed consent&#xD;
                from patients; demographic, clinical, biochemical data of the clinical file will be&#xD;
                collected. A quick test will be taken in the office for HCV detection, if it is&#xD;
                negative, it is recorded in the data collection form and the patient will be&#xD;
                discharged from this clinical study to continue the usual care in Rheumatology. If&#xD;
                this test is positive, the patient will be given a request for viral load and&#xD;
                genotype and an appointment will be made for follow-up of the case in the Liver&#xD;
                Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Relevance and expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study in Mexico to characterize a population that suffers from&#xD;
      vasculitis, the most common extrahepatic manifestation related to MCG-II in patients with&#xD;
      HCV, and other rheumatological conditions, as potential extrahepatic manifestations of CHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will allow to know the prevalence in this special group of patients, in addition&#xD;
      to the research purposes that fall within this prevalence study, patients will have access to&#xD;
      a detection and treatment program in a timely manner.&#xD;
