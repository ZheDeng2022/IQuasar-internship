  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to treat participants with the combination of CPI-613 (the study&#xD;
      drug) with FOLFIRINOX (the standard combination of drugs) to determine if it is safe and&#xD;
      effective for participants with localized and unresectable pancreatic cancer. This study is&#xD;
      specifically for participants who have a pancreatic cancer that is localized and not&#xD;
      considered resectable or removable by a surgeon, without additional treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm study of participants with locally advanced pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma evaluating combination CPI-613 with modified FOLFIRINOX, with the addition of&#xD;
      a dose escalation cohort to assess safety. All study participants will get the same study&#xD;
      intervention, which includes the best available treatment for locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, plus an experimental therapy. The standard therapy is called mFOLFIRINOX, which is a&#xD;
      combination of three chemotherapy drugs (Oxaliplatin, Irniotecan and 5-flurouracil) and one&#xD;
      additional vitamin derivative (Folinic acid). The experimental drug is CPI-613, which&#xD;
      inhibits energy production in cells, and early studies suggest that pancreatic cancer cells&#xD;
      may be especially sensitive. Pre-treatment, diagnostic biopsy tissue will be collected when&#xD;
      available, and clinical data will be evaluated to determine if the combination results in&#xD;
      improved overall survival compared to historical experience. Based on new data, the study&#xD;
      team will also attempt to identify a new maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 in a phase 1&#xD;
      open-label dose-regimen finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the Standard Dose Cohort are to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CPI-613, in combination with mFOLFIRINOX for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the Dose Escalation Cohort is to determine a new maximum-tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of CPI-613 when given in combination with mFOLFIRINOX.&#xD;

    <description>Novel drug and mitochondrial inhibitor, CPI-613 in conjunction with standard-of-care FOLFRINOX.&#xD;
Consists of a Standard Dose Cohort and Dose escalation cohort using a standard 3 + 3 design starting at 750 mg/m^2 given at a rate of 4 ml/min (&quot;dose level (DL) 2&quot;). Participants receiving a dose of 1000mg/m^2 will be treated over 2 hours. In the absence of any DLT, the next DL will begin enrollment. If 1 DLT occurs, the DL will be expanded by 3 participants. If &lt;33% of participants experience a DLT, the next DL will be opened and will proceed in similarly. Only 2 DLs are expected to be studied: 750 mg/m^2 and 1000 mg/m^2.&#xD;
Participants may be enrolled in this cohort after the accrual goal of the standard cohort is met but prior to the completion of treatment of all patients in the standard dose cohort&#xD;
Participants experiencing a DLT will be allowed to continue on the study at the standard DL of 500 mg or lower.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or breast feeding women, or women of child-bearing potential not using&#xD;
             reliable means of contraception are excluded from this study because the teratogenic&#xD;

             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with CPI-613, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are known to be HIV-positive and on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
