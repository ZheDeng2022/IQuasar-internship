  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether there are diurnal variations in magnesium and&#xD;
      other markers related to mineral metabolism in blood from patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) compared to healthy controls.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CKD is associated with a mortality rate 5-10 times higher than in the general population,&#xD;
      which is driven by a high rate of cardiovascular disease. Several cohort studies have&#xD;
      revealed an association between hypomagnesaemia and increased mortality in patients with CKD&#xD;
      as well as faster progression of CKD. Additionally, studies in cultured vascular smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells (VSMC) and in rodents with CKD have shown that Mg inhibits vascular&#xD;
      calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism behind the inhibitory effect of Mg on vascular calcification is&#xD;
      incompletely understood, but seems to be related to an inhibitory effect on the formation and&#xD;
      precipitation of hydroxyapatite and delayed formation of secondary calciprotein particles,&#xD;
      both of which have been shown to induce calcification of VSMC in vitro. Mg blocks the calcium&#xD;
      (Ca) influx across the cell membrane in the VSMC. Mg has some affinity for the Ca sensing&#xD;
      receptor, which has been shown to be involved in the calcification of VSMC, and might thus&#xD;
      inhibit vascular calcification in a manner similar to other calcimimetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, increasing serum Mg has been proposed as a possible treatment to prevent vascular&#xD;
      calcification in CKD. However, any diurnal variation in serum Mg and other markers of mineral&#xD;
      metabolism related to vascular calcification in CKD have not previously been described. This&#xD;
      is relevant as monitoring of treatment with Mg supplementation might potentially be&#xD;
      dangerous, if there are significant diurnal changes in serum Mg. Therefore, we wish to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective controlled clinical trial to investigate any diurnal changes in Mg&#xD;
      other markers of mineral metabolism in healthy controls, patients with predialysis CKD and&#xD;
      patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).&#xD;
