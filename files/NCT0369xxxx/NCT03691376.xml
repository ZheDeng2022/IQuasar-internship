      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      engineered T cells and how well they work with NY-ESO-1 TCR engineered hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cells (HSCs) after melphalan conditioning regimen in treating patients with ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent) or does not&#xD;
      respond to treatment (refractory). The melphalan conditioning chemotherapy makes room in the&#xD;
      patient's bone marrow for new blood cells and blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow.&#xD;
      Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR T cells and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is intended to&#xD;
      replace the immune system with new immune cells that have been redirected to attack and kill&#xD;
      the cancer cells and thereby improve immune system function against cancer. Giving NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      TCR engineered T cells and HSCs after melphalan may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) that have been&#xD;
      genetically modified ex vivo to express NY-ESO-1 TCR, following a myeloablative conditioning&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Assessment of toxicities using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and definition of a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. TCR engineered hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment. II. Functional assays for TCR&#xD;
      transgenic cells. III. Progression-free survival (PFS) (compare with the duration of the PFS&#xD;
      in the last treatment regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Durable tumor response in at least 30% of the patients defined as immune-related complete&#xD;
      response (irCR) or immune-related partial response (irPR) by immune-related Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Long-term persistence of TCR transgenic cells (regardless of cell origin) as evidenced by&#xD;
      &gt; 5% of CD3 lymphocytes being NY-ESO-1 specific by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)&#xD;
      tetramer assay at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Discrimination of TCR transgenic cells resulting from retrovirally-transduced mature&#xD;
      lymphocytes and lentivirally-transduced HSCs and their phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Long term monitoring for replication competent retrovirus and lentivirus. VIII. Analysis&#xD;
      of viral insertion sites in long term persisting NY-ESO-1 TCR clones: absence of a clonal&#xD;
      expansion of TCR transgenic cells with a particular transgene insertion site (defined as a&#xD;
      clone comprising &gt; 20% of all PBSC-derived gene-marked cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Gut microbiota pre and post treatment to evaluate the role of microbiota on the&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy of the proposed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T&#xD;
      lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -1. Patients then&#xD;
      receive autologous NY-ESO-1 CD4-TCR CD34+ HSC IV on day 0 and autologous NY-ESO-1-specific&#xD;
      CD8-positive T lymphocytes IV between days 7 and 21. Patients also receive aldesleukin&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days on the following day after the T cell&#xD;
      infusion (between days 8 and 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years,&#xD;
      then annually for up to 15 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cases of clinically active brain metastases (brain magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             [MRI] as clinically indicated). Prior evidence of brain metastasis successfully&#xD;

             long as they are deemed under control at the time of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to agents used in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Recent or current use of inhaled steroids and topical steroids are not&#xD;
                  exclusionary. If subjects are prescribed a brief course of oral corticosteroids,&#xD;
                  the use should be limited to less than 7 days. Use of steroids before apheresis&#xD;

                  blood cell function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV),&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) as defined below, due to the&#xD;
             immunosuppressive effects of chemo-conditioning used and the unknown risks associated&#xD;
             with viral replication&#xD;

                  performed at screening by a local laboratory with a Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
                  Improvement Act (CLIA) certification or its equivalent. Eligibility will be&#xD;
                  determined based on a negative screening value. The test is not required if&#xD;
                  documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days&#xD;
                  prior to screening is provided.&#xD;

             [MI] in the past 6 months, significant cardiac arrhythmia, stage III or IV congestive&#xD;
             heart failure [CHF]). Cardiac stress test will be done if clinically indicated. (The&#xD;
             specific test to be chosen at the discretion of the principal investigator [PI])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pulmonary function test abnormalities as evidenced by a forced&#xD;
             expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70% of predicted&#xD;
