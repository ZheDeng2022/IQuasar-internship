      A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with blinded outcome assessments will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of CBD in patients with Hand-OA and PsA during a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess the effect of CBD on visual analogue scale pain measurements at 12 weeks&#xD;
      compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and controls: Patients with Hand-OA or PsA and VASpain during the last 24hours of&#xD;
      30mm or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Changes in VAS pain during the last 24 hours from baseline to 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Measured with a 100mm VAS from the most symptomatic hand (Hand-OA) or joint (PsA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percentage of patients experiencing adverse events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A characterization of serious adverse events (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difference in VAS-pain at the 24-week follow-up visit between the intervention and&#xD;
           placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation between baseline quantitative sensory testing (QST) and treatment effect&#xD;
           after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Difference in QST change between the intervention and placebo group after 12 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation between baseline psychosocial parameters, patient reported outcomes (PROMs)&#xD;
           and treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Difference in changes of the psychosocial parameters and PROMs between the intervention&#xD;
           and control group after 12 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 10mg CBD tablets once daily for the first two weeks increasing to twice daily&#xD;
      for week 3 and 4 if adequate analgesic effect is not attained at week 5 then the dose can be&#xD;
      increased to 10mg thrice daily from week 5 and onward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicine and placebo will be delivered and produced by Glostrup pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination programme: All participants will receive a full medical interview and a physical&#xD;
      examination which includes auscultation, blood pressure, heart rate and saturation&#xD;
      measurements and BMI calculation. All participants will have blood drawn for later&#xD;
      examination for markers of inflammation and degeneration. All participants will go through&#xD;
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). QST covers a wide range of different examinations&#xD;
      techniques used to assess the functional status of the somatosensory system. In the present&#xD;
      study pressure algometry and cuff algometry will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain phenotyping: Participants will answer a series of questionnaires related to the pain&#xD;
      experience to assess: Anxiety and depression (the hospital anxiety and depression scale),&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing (the pain catastrophizing scale), pain description (The short form&#xD;
      McGill questionnaire and pain detect questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality&#xD;
      index) and a Widespread Pain Assessment questionnaire and the Symptom Severity Index. To&#xD;
      assess function and quality of life the Short form 36 and Health assessment questionnaire&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PsA: Will receive an examination for disease specific tests including: joint&#xD;
      tenderness and swelling using the EULAR66/68 regiment, dactylitis evaluation using Leeds&#xD;
      dactylitis index basic, skin involvement using the psoriasis area and severity index and nail&#xD;
      psoriasis via nail psoriasis severity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Hand-OA: Will receive the following disease specific examinations evaluation of&#xD;
      tender and swollen joints of the hands and wrists. Grip and pinch strength measurements using&#xD;
      a hand-held dynamometer and the functional index of hand-osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening visit, a baseline visit where the patient will undergo&#xD;
      randomization, a phone consultation after 4 weeks a blood and urin sample after 6 weeks. and&#xD;
      an end of trial visit at week 12. Patients will be invited to a follow-up visit at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked for adverse events at each visit and these are recorded in the eCRF.&#xD;
