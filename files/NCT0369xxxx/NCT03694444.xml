      A Phase 2a Clinical Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Complement 3 Inhibitor Analog,&#xD;
      AMY-101, in Adults with gingivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a 3-month randomized, double-blind, split-mouth study of adults with existing&#xD;
      chronic periodontal inflammation determined by the level of gingival index and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing. The primary endpoint of change in gingival index will be evaluated at 21, 28 and 90&#xD;
      days after initial treatment (baseline treatment). Subjects will also be followed at Day 3,&#xD;
      7, 14, 21, 28 and 90 for safety evaluations. Change in bleeding on probing plaque index,&#xD;
      pocket depth, clinical attachment level and GCF levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      complement factors will be assessed as secondary outcome measures. Composition of subgingival&#xD;
      biofilm will be assessed as an exploratory endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and sites will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment groups (AMY-101 or placebo) in split mouth design. After clinical&#xD;
      assessments and sample collection at baseline, both test and placebo treatments will be&#xD;
      administered to each of the interproximal papilla and will be repeated on Day 7 and 14.&#xD;
