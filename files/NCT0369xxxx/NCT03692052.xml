    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-010 is a multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of treatment with AG-348 in adult participants with&#xD;
      non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). This study includes a core period (up to 24&#xD;
      weeks) followed by an extension period (up to 10 years) for eligible participants. 20&#xD;
      participants with NTDT were enrolled. The initial dose of AG-348 was 50 milligrams (mg) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) with one potential dose-level increase to 100 mg BID at the Week 6 visit based on&#xD;
      the participant's safety and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease, whether or not related to the investigational product. A TEAE was defined as any AE with onset post study drug treatment. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is medically important. AESIs are predefined AEs that required close monitoring and prompt reporting to the sponsor. AESIs included protocol-specified transaminase increase.</description>

            <description>Participants with alpha or beta thalassemia received AG-348 50 mg BID, orally up to Week 6. Following Week 6, depending on the participants' safety and Hb concentrations, they could undergo one potential dose-level increase from 50 to 100 mg BID. After completion of the Core Period of 24 weeks, participants were eligible to continue to receive AG-348 in the Extension Period which is up to 10 years.</description>

        <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease, whether or not related to the investigational product. A TEAE was defined as any AE with onset post study drug treatment. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is medically important. AESIs are predefined AEs that required close monitoring and prompt reporting to the sponsor. AESIs included protocol-specified transaminase increase.</description>
