  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to use a theoretically grounded approach to culturally-tailor a&#xD;
      stigma intervention among just identified, pregnant HIV+ women in Botswana. This project will&#xD;
      use empirically tested stigma interventions that have shown efficacy for serious mental&#xD;
      illness and to adapt these to HIV. Additionally, a novel component of this intervention is&#xD;
      the utilization of peers (i.e., mothers with HIV), which has been shown to be an effective&#xD;
      stigma reduction agent for other conditions but has not yet been widely used with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to leverage this middle-income context to conduct a Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (RCT) with HIV+ women (n=100 intervention group, n=100 control group). The&#xD;
      investigators examine the stigma intervention for outcomes among mothers (including adherence&#xD;
      to Antiretroviral therapy [ART] and antenatal treatment), and conduct exploratory birth&#xD;
      outcomes among infants (e.g., birth weight, time of delivery) as well. Capacity building&#xD;
      activities to transfer stigma intervention knowledge will occur throughout the project to&#xD;
      enable investigators in Botswana to independently develop stigma interventions, thus serving&#xD;
      as a model for other African countries. Finally, this pilot intervention will provide&#xD;
      valuable data for future intervention trials to reduce stigma and improve ART adherence.&#xD;

      To be completed by University of Botswana Research team:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will sample from the Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) at&#xD;
      Princess Marina Hospital IDCC. Newly-diagnosed pregnant HIV+ women are referred to OB care at&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (MOH) antenatal clinics and receive HIV care at the IDCC for continued&#xD;
      ART. To account for expected drop out (~10%), ~220 participants will be recruited. All&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive MME (the HIV-stigma intervention) or TAU&#xD;
      (treatment as usual) from week 28-36 of their pregnancy. The investigators will initiate MME&#xD;
      in the antenatal period because the cultural practice of botsetsi (below) could impede&#xD;
      implementation post-partum. All participants will have PMTCT by initiation of ART before week&#xD;
      32. Adherence to ART, antenatal and PP care, and viral load testing will be tracked from week&#xD;
      28 of pregnancy to 16 weeks PP (~week 56 for full-term babies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures. To account for expected drop out (~10%), ~220 participants will be recruited,&#xD;
      resulting in MME and TAU groups of ~100 with complete data at week 56. For the MME&#xD;
      (intervention) arm, the investigators will enroll 9-10 women per group on a rolling basis to&#xD;
      comprise ~12 intervention groups total; ~1 MME group will be initiated per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention &amp; Assessment Procedures. One advantage of our study is that, whenever possible,&#xD;
      the investigators augment self-report measures with objective measures from medical records&#xD;
      (i.e., for infants, birth-weights, APGAR scores at birth; for antenatal treatment, an&#xD;
      Antenatal/delivery record tracking antenatal visits that is filled out by doctors; for ART,&#xD;
      CD4 count and Viral load data from the integrated patient management system). Fidelity&#xD;
      assessments for each session will be evaluated by Ho-Foster. Control Description: Control&#xD;
      condition participants will receive TAU, including using free ART and antenatal services as&#xD;
      they wish. Control condition participants are assessed on all 'Primary outcomes' at the same&#xD;
      time points as the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessment (Months 18-22): Mothers' Postpartum (PP) adherence (56 weeks) serves as&#xD;
      a key outcome. The investigators examine a set of exploratory, infant birth outcomes that may&#xD;
      result from improved antenatal care and ART adherence. The investigators use an &quot;Under 5&#xD;
      (years old) card&quot; that is filled out by a doctor to track infant's developmental outcomes&#xD;
      which is carried by the mother. Child outcomes include: APGAR score, preterm delivery,&#xD;
      mortality (at &lt;16 weeks), birthweight, vaccination record, and mother-to-child-transmission&#xD;
      of HIV (MTCT). The investigators will call each participant at 4 months' time and ask to meet&#xD;
      in person to review their &quot;Under 5 card&quot; to record infant outcomes at both: a) time of birth;&#xD;
      b) 16 weeks PP.&#xD;

    <description>MME integrates 3 components: 1) psychoeducation regarding causes, transmission, and treatment of HIV re how adherence to ART and antenatal care acts to promote health for HIV+ women and PMTCT82,83. We will emphasize ART adherence spanning into PP as a maternal duty to raise a healthy child; 2) challenging stereotypes of HIV+ women, such as promiscuity, that threaten core aspects of being a &quot;good woman&quot; and hinder treatment adherence; 3) coping skills for HIV-related discrimination, i.e., rejection or abandonment by male partners leading to discontinuing treatment adherence and impacts on raising children.</description>
