    <textblock>
      Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors.This&#xD;
      study is a single-arm, prospective, open label clinical study of pyrotinib plus capecitabine&#xD;
      as the Therapy of brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 30-50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In&#xD;
      the case of solitary brain metastases, surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are the preferred&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches.Chemotherapy is used after further progression of disease but it has&#xD;
      limited effectiveness. In HER2-positive tumours, trastuzumab therapy has been postulated to&#xD;
      be associated with an increased risk of development of brain metastases.Thus new therapeutic&#xD;
      options are urgently needed to improve patients'outcome. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We designed the study to explore the&#xD;
      possibility of pyrotinib plus capecitabine for brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. HER2-positive: In the pathological examination/rechecking of primary lesions or&#xD;
             metastatic lesions performed by the Research site's Pathology Laboratory, at least&#xD;
             once the tumor cells defined as 3+ staining by immunohistochemistry, or fluorescence&#xD;
             in situ hybridization [FISH] confirmed positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. MRI/enhanced CT confirmed brain metastasis. According to RECIST 1.1, there is at least&#xD;
             one measurable brain lesion, and the measurability of extracranial lesions is not&#xD;
             required&#xD;

             been treated with CNS radiotherapy, it should be more than two weeks since the end of&#xD;
             the last systemic treatment. Patients with new brain lesions after craniotomy are&#xD;
