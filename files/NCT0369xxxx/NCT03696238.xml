    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind, counterbalanced, placebo controlled independent groups design.&#xD;
      Prior to the visit, participants will be given a participant information sheet to inform of&#xD;
      the procedure and requirements and undergo initial screening via email or telephone to&#xD;
      ascertain suitability to participate. Stature, body mass, blood pressure and heart rate will&#xD;
      be assessed. Participants will then be familiarized with the performance tests (MVC, vertical&#xD;
      jump and sprint performance) and randomized to an investigational product group (2 groups:&#xD;
      Aronox vs placebo; 1:1 allocation). The first investigational dose will be administered in&#xD;
      the laboratory and participants will be given a 4-week supply of the investigational product&#xD;
      to take in the morning with breakfast. Participants will also be asked to keep a food and&#xD;
      activity diary for the 3 days preceding the baseline visit and for the duration of the&#xD;
      damaging-recovery protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this supplementation period (28 days), participants will be asked to return to the&#xD;
      lab in a fed (not less than 2 hours prior to the visit) and hydrated state. Participants will&#xD;
      also be asked to abstain from strenuous exercise and caffeine for 24 h prior to each lab&#xD;
      visit. Stature, body mass, blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed. This will be&#xD;
      followed by baseline assessment of muscle damage which will consist of visual analogue scales&#xD;
      to assess lower limb muscle soreness (DOMS); pain pressure threshold and baseline measures of&#xD;
      functional performance (maximal voluntary contraction, vertical jump performance and sprint&#xD;
      performance) and limb girth. Furthermore, a blood sample will be taken to analyze creatine&#xD;
      kinase (index of muscle damage). This will be followed by a strenuous bout of exercise&#xD;
      designed to cause muscle damage comprising of 100 drop jumps from a 0.6 m platform at a rate&#xD;
      of 1 jump every 10 seconds. A short rest will be provided after every 20 jumps. Each jump is&#xD;
      performed by the participant stepping from the platform and landing two-footed on the floor&#xD;
      and descending quickly to ~90° and 'explosively jumping upward with maximum effort. This&#xD;
      model for muscle damage has been used on numerous occasions in the literature and has been&#xD;
      used with great success in our own laboratory. Participants will then return to the lab at&#xD;
      24, 48 and 72 h post damaging protocol where muscle damage measures will be repeated to&#xD;
      assess the level of recovery between the groups.&#xD;

      Prior to the visit, participants will be given a participant information sheet to inform of&#xD;
      the procedure and requirements and undergo initial screening via email or telephone to&#xD;
      ascertain suitability to participate. If interested parties wish to participate, then they&#xD;
      will be invited for a familiarisation visit, where they will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be provided with an overview of the protocol and given the opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a health and physical activity questionnaire to ascertain study suitability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a training status questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of ability to swallow capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete an informed consent to participate in the study (assuming they meet the&#xD;
           criteria and are willing to participate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stature, body mass, blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed. Participants will then be&#xD;

      24, 48 and 72 h post damaging protocol where muscle damage measures will be repeated to&#xD;
      assess the level of recovery between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise protocol details Muscle damage will be induced using a drop jump protocol our&#xD;
      laboratory has used previously. It consists of 100 drop jumps performed 10 seconds apart with&#xD;
      a 2-minute rest period provided every 20 jumps. Each jump will be conducted from a 0.6 m high&#xD;
      box; upon landing, participants descend to a ~90º knee angle before performing a maximal&#xD;
      effort vertical jump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive muscle soreness will be reported on a 200 mm visual analogue scale and muscle&#xD;
      site-specific soreness will be assessed as pressure pain threshold (PPT) with a handheld&#xD;
      algometer (N2). Measurements were taken with participants lying supine; pressure was applied&#xD;
      continuously at a rate of ~10 N cm-2∙s-1 until a pressure of ~40 N cm-2∙s-1 is achieved on&#xD;
      the muscle belly; whereupon the participant will report muscle soreness on the aforementioned&#xD;
      visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb girth will be measured at the mid-thigh to examine limb swelling. This will be&#xD;
      determined by identifying the midpoint between the inguinal crease and the superior border of&#xD;
      the patella the right leg whilst the participant remained standing in anatomical zero. The&#xD;
      location will be marked with permanent marker to ensure consistency on subsequent days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A venous blood sample will then taken to examine creatine kinase (CK) concentrations to&#xD;
      provide evidence that muscle damage has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal isometric voluntary contractions (MIVCs) performed using a portable strain gauge (MIE&#xD;
      Medical Research Ltd., Leeds, UK), will be used to examine strength loss and recovery. The&#xD;
      peak value from 3 maximal contractions (separated by 60 seconds) will be used for analysis.&#xD;
      In addition, counter movement jumps (CMJ) will be examined with an optical system to measure&#xD;
      jump height in cm. With hands on their hips, participants will descend into a ~90° squat and&#xD;
      jump vertically with maximal effort. The average of 3 maximal jumps (separated by 30 seconds)&#xD;
      will be used for analysis. Participants will complete a single maximal effort 30 m sprint&#xD;
      where sprint time will be recorded. The sprint will be initiated from a line 30 cm behind the&#xD;
      start line in order to prevent false triggering of the timing gates (Brower, Utah, USA). In&#xD;
      addition to the aforementioned measures that will be repeated at 24, 48 and 72 h, a perceived&#xD;
      recovery questionnaire to assess more qualitative aspects of the intervention on recovery&#xD;
      from the damaging protocol will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation and dietary control Following group allocation, participants will be provided&#xD;
      with aronia (Aronox® ) or placebo (PLA) supplementation and instructed to consume 500mg of&#xD;
      the investigational product. The PLA will consist of 95% maltodextrin with 5% artificial dyes&#xD;
      (red lake and blue lake). The 500mg of Aronox is fortified with maltodextrin in order to&#xD;
      provide 200 mg of polyphenol in total. Aronia consumption has shown no safety issues when&#xD;
      used as an ingredient in dietary supplements or as a study drug in clinical trials by adults&#xD;
      at dose levels ranging from 150 to 300 mg of extract per day for 14 days up to 2 months&#xD;
      (Broncel et al., 2010; Naruszewicz et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed not to consume the supplement on the day of initial&#xD;
      assessment and consume the supplement after each laboratory visit as previous research&#xD;
      (Bitsch et al. 2004; Kurilich et al. 2005) has demonstrated that systemic anthocyanin&#xD;
      bioavailability increases to a peak between 1-2 hours post-ingestion. In addition, training&#xD;
      logs will be kept to examine differences in training volume between groups and also general&#xD;
      health log to record illness or consumption of any pharma during the supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be expressed as means ± SD, and statistical significance will be set at P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 prior to analyses. Differences in participant group characteristics, training history,&#xD;
      and dietary intake were analysed using Student t-tests. Nutritics dietary analysis software&#xD;
      (Nutritics LTD, Dublin, Ireland) will be used to analyse participant's food diaries.&#xD;
      Dependent variables (MIVC, CMJ, VAS, and all blood indices) will be analysed using a mixed&#xD;
      model ANOVA with 2 independent group levels (Aronex vs. PLA) and 4 repeated measures time&#xD;
      points (pre, 24,48,72 h). If the ANOVA indicates a significant interaction effect (drink ×&#xD;
      time), Fisher LSD post hoc analysis will be performed to locate the significant differences.&#xD;
      Homogeneity of variance will be checked with Mauchly's test of sphericity, and in the event&#xD;
      of a significant result, GreenhouseGeisser adjustments will be used. All data will be&#xD;
      analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 for Windows (Surrey, UK).&#xD;
