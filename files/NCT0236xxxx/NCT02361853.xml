  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggest that the proliferative, invasive, and immune tolerance&#xD;
      mechanisms that malignant tumors use to establish a nutrient supply and evade or edit the&#xD;
      host immune response are similar to those used by the developing placenta during normal&#xD;
      pregnancy. In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both&#xD;
      cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of&#xD;
      both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD11b+Gr1+ cells are a heterogeneous population of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) that&#xD;
      consist of immature myeloid cells (IMCs), and were first described as myeloid-derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells. In healthy individuals, IMCs that are generated in the bone marrow&#xD;
      differentiate into mature granulocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs). These cells&#xD;
      have been shown to play an essential role in mediating immune suppression in animal models of&#xD;
      human tumors. As a result of tumor-induced alterations in myelopoiesis, IMCs have been found&#xD;
      in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and the tumor tissue itself. An increased population of&#xD;
      IMCs was identified in patients with several tumor types. Accordingly, IMCs detected in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood of such patients bearing express the common myeloid marker CD33 but lack&#xD;
      markers of mature myeloid cells such as the MHC class II molecule HLADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMCs have been shown to actively promote tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the&#xD;
      cytokine environment, and through vascular remodeling by promoting angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated in our laboratory that IMCs infiltrate placentas of pregnant mice&#xD;
      and actively promote angiogenesis. These cells show striking similarity to IMCs that populate&#xD;
      malignant tumors. Accordingly, human placentas are also infiltrated by a significant&#xD;
      population of IMCs. Immunostaining of human placentas showed that IMCs comprise around 25% (&#xD;
      range 10-40%) of total placental CD45+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells and that this&#xD;
      population is located close to blood capillaries. The investigators also demonstrated that&#xD;
      immature DCs, cells originally described to regulate the adaptive immune response, also&#xD;
      promote angiogenesis in models of choroidal neovascularization, endometriosis and tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tho objective in this proposed study is to compare the abundance of IMC, DC, monocytes and&#xD;
      neutrophils counts in blood samples of normal pregnancies: 1. in women in term active labor.&#xD;
      2. In women not in labor. 3. In pre term labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our previous findings, the investigators hypothesize that IMC's, monocytes and&#xD;
      in active delivery (both term and pre term) will be lower than women without signs for labor.&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that DC's and neutrophils will be more abundant in active&#xD;
      delivery (in term and pre term) than women without signs for labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood count will be collected from pregnant women who agree to participate in the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be sent for the routine complete blood count in Hillel Yaffe hematologic lab&#xD;
      and also will be analyzed for IMC's and DC's population in our lab using fluorescent&#xD;
      immunostaining with specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMC's per total CD45 positive hematopoietic cells from the placental tissue will be analyzed&#xD;
      using fluorescent immunostaining with specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry . The&#xD;
      specific location of these cells in the placenta will be identified within the placental&#xD;
      tissue using Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of pro angiogenic genes will be&#xD;
      analyzed by RT PCR and Western blotting.&#xD;
