  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men who continue to have an elevated or rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) level after&#xD;
      their primary prostate cancer treatment are at increased risk for their cancer to progress.&#xD;
      The time it takes to progress is highly variable. One way to predict this progression is&#xD;
      based on the change in PSA levels over time. This is called the PSA doubling time (PSADT).&#xD;
      Researchers want to test a vaccine on men with Stage D0 prostate cancer. Stage D0 means the&#xD;
      PSA has become detectable again or has started to rise after primary treatment, but has not&#xD;
      spread to other organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test a vaccine s effectiveness on the rate of PSA increase using PSADT and tumor growth&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men with Stage D0 prostate cancer with a PSADT between 3 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests, scans, physical exam, and medical&#xD;
           history. Their prostate cancer will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo apheresis. Blood will be removed with a needle from one arm. A&#xD;
           machine will separate the white blood cells. The blood, minus the white cells, will be&#xD;
           returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 14 visits. At each visit, they will have a physical exam and&#xD;
           blood tests. They will discuss any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get injections of either the vaccine or placebo at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
           15, and 24. Both will be made from the participants own cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be selected randomly to receive either active vaccine or placebo. For&#xD;
           every two participants assigned to active vaccine, one participant will be assigned to&#xD;
           placebo vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get a Vaccine Report Card to to complete after receiving vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study lasts 96 weeks.&#xD;

      TARP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell receptor g alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is a 58 amino acid protein&#xD;
           expressed by both normal and malignant prostate cancer tissue; 95% of prostate cancer&#xD;
           specimens are positive for TARP expression. TARP is highly expressed in prostate cancers&#xD;
           of all Gleason types, in primary as well as metastatic disease, and in hormone sensitive&#xD;
           and castrate resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, TARP is an ideal tumor antigen target&#xD;
           for a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prospective, randomized pilot study of 1st generation TARP Peptide vaccination (NCI&#xD;
           09-C-0139) utilizing TARP WT 27-35 and EE29-37-9V peptides was conducted in HLA-A&#xD;
           0201positive men with stage D0 prostate cancer (PSA biochemical recurrence) and a PSA&#xD;
           doubling time (PSADT) of greater than or equal to 3 months and less than or equal to 15&#xD;
           months. TARP vaccination was found to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated, with&#xD;
           adverse events limited to injection site reactions less than or equal to Grade 2. TARP&#xD;
           vaccination was also associated with a decreased slope log PSA compared to&#xD;
           pre-vaccination baseline in 72% of subjects reaching 24 weeks and 74% reaching 48 weeks&#xD;
           (p=0.0012 and p=0.0004 for overall changes in slope log PSA, respectively); TARP&#xD;
           vaccination also resulted in a 50% decrease in calculated tumor growth rate constant:&#xD;
           pre-vaccine g = 0.0042/day, post-vaccine g = 0.0021/day (p=0.003); TARP-specific IFN-g&#xD;
           ELISPOT responses were detected in the majority of subjects but did not correlate with&#xD;
           decreases in slope log (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-Epitope (ME) TARP Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine platform includes the original two 9-mer HLA-A*0201 binding TARP peptide&#xD;
           epitopes (WT27-35 and EE29-37-9V) utilized in NCI 09-C-0139 as well as an additional&#xD;
           five 20-mer TARP peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids for a total of 7 peptides that&#xD;
           span the amino acid sequence of the entire TARP protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The advantage of this multi-epitope TARP peptide vaccine platform is that the&#xD;
           overlapping epitopes cover the entire TARP protein, resulting in potential for induction&#xD;
           of a multi-valent anti-TARP response. In addition, these longer synthetic peptides&#xD;
           include TARP-specific MHC class II CD4+ T cell helper epitopes that will allow&#xD;
           generation of better CD8+ T cell responses with improved functional avidity and&#xD;
           longevity as well as humoral anti-TARP antibody responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the difference in the slope log (PSA) for Weeks3-24 minus that formed for the 12&#xD;
      months prior to enrollment on study (referred to as slope324 pre-slope) as well as the slope&#xD;
      log (PSA) for weeks 3-48 versus the same pre-treatment slope log (PSA) (referred to as slope&#xD;
      348 preslope) in patients na(SqrRoot) ve to TARP vaccination receiving active, multi-epitope&#xD;
      TARP vaccination vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males greater than or equal to 18 years of age with histologically confirmed&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage D0 disease with documented biochemical progression documented by rising PSA and no&#xD;
           evidence of metastatic disease by physical examination, CT scan or bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSADT greater than or equal to 3 months and less than or equal to 15 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ----Patients must have greater than or equal to 3 PSA measurements over greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           --- The interval between PSA measurements must be greater than or equal to 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance Status: ECOG 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No other concurrent anticancer therapy or prior prostate cancer vaccines expressing&#xD;
           TARP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II, prospective, single-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study of 96 weeks&#xD;
           duration in men with Stage D0 prostate cancer. Men with a PSADT greater than or equal to&#xD;
           3 months and less than or equal to 15 months will be randomized 2:1 to receive ME TARP&#xD;
           autologous DC vaccination or a control eleutriated monocyte vaccine placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initial lead-in of 6 patientswill be enrolled to allow preliminary assessment of the&#xD;
           safety of the ME TARP vaccine platform through 12 weeks before enrollment of&#xD;
           prospectively randomized subjects blinded to treatment assignment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a total of 6 doses of vaccine (20 x10(6) viable cells/dose)&#xD;
           delivered intradermally at Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24. All patients will undergo a&#xD;
           15-18L apheresis at Week 0 and restaging at Weeks 48 and 96 to confirm maintenance of&#xD;
           Stage D0 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: N = 72 (6 lead-in patients for safety assessment, 2:1 randomization: TARP N =&#xD;
      44; placebo N =22).&#xD;
