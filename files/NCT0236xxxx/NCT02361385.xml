  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of the detection of early inflammatory arthritis is recognised as being&#xD;
      essential to the prevention of permanent joint damage. Furthermore, drug development in&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis is in increasing need of imaging that is able to sensitively and&#xD;
      accurately detect and quantify inflammation in a reproducible and objective manner. There is&#xD;
      an increasing body of evidence to support the role of PET-CT for these indications. The PET&#xD;
      tracer 11CPBR28 is specific to the translocator protein (TSPO) highly expressed on activated&#xD;
      macrophages. In this proof of principle study, the investigators aim to ascertain whether or&#xD;
      not the PET tracer 11CPBR28 is taken up in inflamed joints. The investigators also aim to&#xD;
      explore the significance of TSPO to inflammatory arthritis, through blood and joint lining&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

      The investigators aim to recruit a minimum of 12 patients with known, active rheumatoid or&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis in the feet and ankles. Patients will first undergo a screening&#xD;
      genotyping test; low affinity binders for PBR28 PET will be excluded from this pilot study.&#xD;
      Those patients meeting inclusion criteria, will then undergo a PET-CT localised to feet and&#xD;
      ankles that have been identified to be clinically inflamed (on examination and ultrasound at&#xD;
      the screening visit). After PET-CT, patients will undergo synovial biopsy of one joint&#xD;
      imaged. After 6 patients have undergone PET-CT, an interim analysis will be undertaken, to&#xD;
      optimise PET scan duration and to alter the group of joints being imaged with CT.&#xD;
