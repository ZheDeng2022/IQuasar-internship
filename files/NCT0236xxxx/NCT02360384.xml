    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome is common. Currently, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. There is&#xD;
      increasing evidence of the importance of the microbiota in the pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      disorder. However, it has been challenging to measure the &quot;activity&quot; of the microbiota in&#xD;
      vivo as much of the GI tract is inaccessible. Fermentation by the microbiota occurs in the&#xD;
      colon, a by product of which are short chain fatty acids. Measuring pH in the colon could&#xD;
      potentially act as a surrogate marker of fermentation. The investigators are undertaking a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial in patients with IBS measuring the pH in the digestive tract&#xD;
      using a wireless motility capsule at baseline and in response to dietary changes in patients&#xD;
      with diarrhoea predominant IBS and in response to linaclotide in those with constipation&#xD;
      predominant IBS to ascertain the effect of these interventions on the microbiota and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is an extremely common condition. Between 1.9 and 3.6 million&#xD;
      patients consult a healthcare professional for IBS each year in the UK (1). The total&#xD;
      population prevalence is much higher as most IBS sufferers are non-consulters due to the&#xD;
      perceived lack of effective treatments. IBS can be sub-classified based upon predominating&#xD;
      bowel habit, i.e. constipation predominant (IBS-C), alternating bowel habit (IBS-A) or&#xD;
      diarrhoea predominant (2). In recent years, several efficacious treatment approaches have&#xD;
      been applied to IBS including dietary interventions (low fibre and low fermentable&#xD;
      oligosaccharides, disacchaÂ¬rides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP)), probiotics (VSL#3)&#xD;
      and pharmacological agents (linaclotide) (3). Whilst each of these treatment approaches have&#xD;
      shown efficacy, it is clear that further refinement of the IBS diagnostic algorithm is&#xD;
      required to better target therapies in order to overcome the inherent heterogeneity within&#xD;
      the IBS population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bloating and distension are both common and vexatious symptoms in a proportion of IBS&#xD;
      patients. Bloating is largely regarded as a subjective sensation of abdominal swelling,&#xD;
      whereas distension refers to an observable increase in abdominal girth. Bloating is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in quality of life, is a cause for healthcare seeking and&#xD;
      represents a considerable challenge to manage effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anaerobic breakdown of carbohydrates and protein by bacteria, largely occurring within&#xD;
      the proximal colon, is through a process known as fermentation, the principal products of&#xD;
      which are short chain fatty acids (SCFA). One of the proposed mechanisms of bloating and&#xD;
      distension is colonic dysbiosis and subsequent mal-fermentation. This has been supported by&#xD;
      data which show that a large proportion of IBS patients improve symptomatically when&#xD;
      restricting their diet to an 'elemental' formula for 2-4 weeks thus reducing the amount of&#xD;
      fermentable material in the intestinal lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct in vivo measurement of SCFA concentrations in the human proximal colon is&#xD;
      technically difficult and invasive. Given that the degree of bacterial fermentation is&#xD;
      directly proportional to the concentration of SCFA, the measurement of segmental&#xD;
      intra-colonic pH is an inverse surrogate proxy of the degree of fermentation occurring within&#xD;
      that territory. We have recently shown that measurement of caecal pH using the wireless&#xD;
      motility capsule (WMC) in IBS and control patients is both technical feasible and able to&#xD;
      differentiate between the two populations (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study showed that caecal pH is significantly lower in IBS when compared to controls thus&#xD;
      supporting the concept that mal-fermentation is contributing to IBS symptomatology.&#xD;
      Importantly, we have also shown that caecal pH is correlated with inhibition of caecal&#xD;
      contractility which has led us to propose the idea that 'caecoparesis' maybe the long sought&#xD;
      after alteration in motor function which differentiates IBS patients from healthy&#xD;
      participants and explains why IBS preferentially experience pain in the right colon and upper&#xD;
      abdomen in response to balloon distension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate that caecal pH is a&#xD;
      sensitive and reliable biomarker of caecal fermentation in IBS and that normalisation of the&#xD;
      caecal pH environment will correlate with symptomatic improvement in IBS patients. We&#xD;
      hypothesise that normalisation of the caecal pH environment with either dietary intervention&#xD;
      or linaclotide will correlate with symptomatic improvement in IBS patients. To achieve this&#xD;
      we will recruit a cohort of Rome III defined IBS patients and sub-divide them into the&#xD;
      appropriate IBS type based on symptoms. We will then characterise their phenotype in terms of&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal physiology (WMC + lactulose hydrogen breath test) and psychological&#xD;
      profile. They will then be allocated to one of (2 or 3) treatment arms (control diet, low&#xD;
      FODMAP diet, control diet + linaclotide). Each treatment arm will last for 28 days after&#xD;
      which WMC will be repeated and symptoms assessed. Secondary aims will include characterising&#xD;
      motility and transit in IBS-sub groups, determining the effect of the interventions of&#xD;
      motility and transit, comparison of ileal and caecal pH profiles with hydrogen / methane&#xD;
      breath testing data and comparison of symptom change and physiological assessment outcomes.&#xD;
