  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 15 million Americans are morbidly obese, or more than 100 pounds overweight. Medical&#xD;
      treatments including drugs and behavior modification have proven ineffective in producing&#xD;
      significant and lasting weight loss in this group. While bariatric surgery is extremely&#xD;
      effective for most patients, it also carries risks for both short and long-term&#xD;
      complications. There are currently four different types of bariatric surgery available and&#xD;
      the risks and benefits of these procedures vary widely and are strongly affected by patient&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision making under these circumstances should reflect informed patient's values and&#xD;
      preferences regarding these trade-offs. Instead, the choice of bariatric procedure is more&#xD;
      often driven by the beliefs and experiences of the bariatric surgeon that a patient happens&#xD;
      to see. Variability in the type of surgery recommended to patients likely results from some&#xD;
      combination of surgeons' subjective opinions and personal experiences with regard to the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the treatment options and delegated decision making on the part of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this research proposal are to develop, implement, and evaluate an informed&#xD;
      decision support tool for treatment of morbid obesity. This project will be conducted within&#xD;
      the context of the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative (MBSC), which is a statewide&#xD;
      clinical registry and quality improvement program that has the participation of virtually&#xD;
      every bariatric surgeon and program in the state of Michigan. The MBSC registry now includes&#xD;
      externally audited clinical data for more than 80,000 consecutive bariatric surgery patients.&#xD;
      MBSC outcome measures include complications occurring within 30 days as well as weight loss,&#xD;
      comorbidity resolution, quality of life and satisfaction at 1, 2, and 3 years after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a web-based interactive decision support tool to incorporate tailored&#xD;
           information regarding risks and benefits of the treatment options (from regression-based&#xD;
           prediction models derived on the 35,000 patients already in the MBSC registry) with&#xD;
           information regarding other salient attributes of the treatment options (derived from&#xD;
           focus groups and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders including bariatric&#xD;
           surgery patients, bariatric program staff, and surgeons).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To perform a quasi-experimental study comparing the decision support tool with usual&#xD;
           care to determine its effects on patient decisions (treatment choice, knowledge,&#xD;
           treatment-preference concordance, and decisional conflict) and on patient outcomes&#xD;
           including weight loss, patient satisfaction, and improvements in quality of life after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is closely aligned with the goals of PCORI and will have direct impacts on&#xD;
      patients and caregivers by providing information that is required to improve healthcare&#xD;
      decision-making for this prevalent, damaging, and costly condition.&#xD;
