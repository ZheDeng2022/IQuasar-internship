      A previous study showed that in situ MTZ vaginal gel twice daily is more effective than the&#xD;
      conventional vaginal gel product in sustained cure of BV( 4 weeks after treatment) (80.0% in&#xD;
      the in-situ gel group as compared with 47.4 in the conventional gel group.The current study&#xD;
      aims to compare the efficacy of the use of once daily in situ MTZ vaginal gel (0.8%) versus&#xD;
      twice-daily conventional MTZ vaginal gel in treatment of BV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most frequently diagnosed infections in women&#xD;
      attending genitourinary clinics. As 50% of cases of BV are asymptomatic, the true prevalence&#xD;
      of this condition in the community is uncertain.Metronidazole (MTZ) is considered the drug of&#xD;
      choice for the treatment of BV. It can be given either orally or locally. Formulations for&#xD;
      the local administration of the drug include gels and suppositories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptance of suppositories is lower than the oral administration of the drug as they&#xD;
      might cause irritation and thus affecting the patient's compliance. Moreover, the mode of&#xD;
      administration of MTZ does not have a significant difference in the eradication of the&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the metronidazole gels and lactic acid gels, for local application, lactic acid gels&#xD;
      have been found to be more efficient and safer. The recurrence of BV is less common in&#xD;
      patients treated with lactic acid gel when compared with patients treated with metronidazole&#xD;
      gels. This may be attributed to the inhibition in the growth of the lactobacilli when MTZ is&#xD;
      used for the treatment and depends on the concentration of the lactobacilli .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravaginal deliveries of MTZ for the treatment of BV have shown that there was an&#xD;
      improvement in the clinical symptoms of the patients within 21-30 days of the starting of the&#xD;
      treatment. Unfortunately, the vagina was not recolonized with lactobacilli within the stated&#xD;
      period . The use of formulation consisting policarbophil-carbopol and lactic acid-chitosan&#xD;
      mucoadhesive vaginal gels has also been reported and both of them have been found to be safe&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cure rates following intravaginal treatment with MTZ account for 80-90% at the end of&#xD;
      treatment and one month after the end of therapy. However, three months after the end of&#xD;
      therapy the rate of relapses can overcome 30%. Persistence of an adherent bacterial biofilm,&#xD;
      containing mostly Gardenerlla vaginalis is the main reason for failure of BV treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suppressive treatment with MTZ gel has been investigated with variable results . Moreover,&#xD;
      long-term treatment with MTZ is not recommended because of the high incidence of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal adverse reactions, the risk of peripheral neuropathy, and Candida super&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the patients are known to tolerate gels better than suppositories or ointments, the&#xD;
      direct application of gels into the diseased sites of vagina might be difficult as well as&#xD;
      improper. Therefore, vaginal therapy would be significantly improved if an intravaginally&#xD;
      administered drug can retain at the site of administration for prolonged time .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in situ forming hydrogel is a stimuli sensitive hydrogel that exists as an aqueous&#xD;
      solution before administration. When exposed to external physical stimuli like heat, it&#xD;
      undergoes reversible volume-phase transition, then immediately turned into standing gels&#xD;
      after its contact with the mucosa .Recently, in situ gel drug delivery system has been&#xD;
      investigated as a more convenient dosage form of topical applications. It's easy to be&#xD;
      applied into the vagina with accurate dosing of liquid before turning to gel with even&#xD;
      spreading. It had been tried before and proved effectiveness, safety and tolerance .&#xD;

Treatment in this group was offered in the form of a bottle of an aqueous liquid (100 mL of a preparation composed of 0.8% MTZ, 20% pluronic F-127, 10% pluronic F-68, and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride). Women were asked to put 5 cc of the liquid into the vagina once daily for 5 days using a graded syringe and 10-cm long soft applicator.</description>
