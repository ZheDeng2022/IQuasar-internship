      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Brain activity changes with changes in body temperature. Brain activity can be studied with&#xD;
      a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Researchers want to cool the&#xD;
      brain through the scalp using a cooling cap. They want to see if cooling changes the brain&#xD;
      and body s response to TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at the effects of cooling on the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Right-handed adults age 18-50 who can abstain from caffeine and tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will be asked&#xD;
           about alcohol use, smoking, and substance abuse. They may take a pregnancy test. They&#xD;
           may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. For MRI, participants lie&#xD;
           on a table that slides in and out of a metal tube that takes pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 outpatient visits. The following procedures will occur at each&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear a cooling cap for up to 45 minutes. Cool water will flow through&#xD;
           the cap. It will feel like an ice pack in a towel. Their core temperature will be&#xD;
           monitored. Their temperature will also be measured under their tongue and on scalp,&#xD;
           stomach, forearm, and calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have TMS before and after wearing the cap. A brief electrical current&#xD;
           will pass through a wire coil held on their scalp. Electrodes that detect muscle&#xD;
           movement will be placed on their hand. They will also have repetitive TMS, which uses&#xD;
           repeated magnetic pulses. Their wrist will also receive a shock.&#xD;

      1. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dysregulation of synaptic transmission in certain brain areas may be responsible for&#xD;
           some neurological disorders. It was demonstrated that synaptic transmission may be&#xD;
           modulated through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and this may be a&#xD;
           component of the therapeutic effects of rTMS. However, rTMS utility is limited due to an&#xD;
           inability to focus the stimulation. Cooling was shown to reduce the neuronal activity in&#xD;
           targeted brain areas. The goal of this protocol is to examine the ability of cooling to&#xD;
           affect rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
           We intend to study 18 adult healthy volunteers on an outpatient basis. The accrual&#xD;
           ceiling requested is 23 subjects to allow for dropouts and screening failures. This&#xD;
           portion of the study has been completed and recruitment will not continue for the&#xD;
           cooling-related portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We intend to perform a sub-study to develop a new method of plasticity induction -&#xD;
           phase-triggered paired associative stimulation. This sub-study requires an additional&#xD;
           intended study population of 24 subjects completing the 3 study arms who may be a&#xD;
           sub-set of the initially requested 18 subjects from the main study. The additional&#xD;
           accrual ceiling is 40 subjects to allow for dropouts and screening failures. The total&#xD;
           ceiling for the entire protocol is 63.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis of the data collected during the main study demonstrates the control condition&#xD;
           of rPAS/sham cooling did not result in increased MEPs as expected. This null effect of&#xD;
           the control condition made it difficult to ascertain any effects due to the cooling&#xD;
           condition. Therefore, we propose a new sub-study investigating a better form of&#xD;
           plasticity induction using EEG phase-triggered TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the completed, cooling-related portion of the study, we propose using rapid-rate&#xD;
           paired associative stimulation (rPAS), modulated by applying cooling to the scalp, to&#xD;
           examine the effect of cooling on rTMS. Our hypothesis is that cooling the brain will&#xD;
           prevent the potentiation normally induced by rPAS. We will reduce brain temperature by&#xD;
           up to 1.5 degrees Celsius by applying a cooling helmet to the scalp and then test the&#xD;
           effect on potentiation by applying rPAS. One of our stopping criterion will be reduction&#xD;
           in measured temperature reduction by 2 degrees Celsius.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study consists of one experiment with18 subjects and accrual has been completed.&#xD;
           The experiment is divided into three session visits, each to be carried out at least 1&#xD;
           day apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The control potentiation in response to rPAS without cooling will be measured during&#xD;
           session visit 1 by using the TMS-evoked motor evoked potential (MEP). In session visit&#xD;
           2, after applying a commercially available liquid cooling helmet for 45 minutes to&#xD;
           reduce the temperature of the underlying cerebral cortex by up to 1.5 degrees Celsius,&#xD;
           we will then assess the response to rPAS. In session 3, the MEP will be measured after&#xD;
           applying the cooling helmet but with the rPAS procedure substituted with a sham rPAS.&#xD;
           Session visit 3 is necessary to determine if there are any changes to the MEP in&#xD;
           response to cooling alone. Thus, in the three session visits, we will evaluate cooling&#xD;
           alone, rPAS alone, and the two together.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed sub-study is to develop a method to improve the reliability of the primary&#xD;
           endpoint. The new method will utilize EEG phase-triggered paired associative&#xD;
           stimulation. Similarly to the rapid-rate paired associative stimulation (rPAS) used in&#xD;
           the main study, EEG phase-triggered paired associative stimulation also uses paired&#xD;
           median nerve stimulation with TMS to motor cortex. However, the stimuli are triggered&#xD;
           when the EEG is at a prespecified phase of the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sub-study to develop the optimal parameters of phase-triggered paired associative&#xD;
           stimulation will consist of 3 arms. Two active arms will trigger the paired median nerve&#xD;
           and motor cortex TMS according to the phase of the ongoing EEG. The first arm will&#xD;
           trigger the stimuli at the trough of the ongoing EEG (phase -90 if the EEG is modeled as&#xD;
           a sine wave). The second arm will trigger the stimul at the peak of the ongoing EEG&#xD;
           (phase +90). The third control arm will trigger the paired stimuli at a random delay&#xD;
           from the through of the ongoing EEG. This control arm serves to deliver paired stimuli&#xD;
           at a rate matched to the ongoing EEG, but stimulates at a random phase of each alpha&#xD;
           oscillation cycle. Our hypothesis is that stimulating at the through of the ongoing EEG&#xD;
           will result in increased plastic changes to the brain as measured through our TMS&#xD;
           outcome measures of single pulse MEPs, as compared to the control condition of random&#xD;
           phase stimulation. We also hypothesize that stimulating at the peak of the ongoing EEG&#xD;
           will result in a decrease in TMS outcome measures as compared to the control arm. This&#xD;
           will be a withinsubject design of 3 visits for each of the 12 sub-study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the amplitude of MEPs induced by single TMS pulses&#xD;
