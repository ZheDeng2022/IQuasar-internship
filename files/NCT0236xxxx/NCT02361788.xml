      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is the most common reason for admission in the neonatal period&#xD;
      (first month of life) worldwide and at SMRU. The skin of the newborn baby becomes jaundiced,&#xD;
      which is caused by a high level of bilirubin in the blood. In some neonates the level of&#xD;
      bilirubin increases to a level that can cause braindamage or even death. There are different&#xD;
      causes known that can lead to higher levels of bilirubin, for example G6PD deficiency and&#xD;
      prematurity. In case of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia the neonate needs to be treated with&#xD;
      phototherapy (blue light therapy). If there is prolonged jaundice (≥ 21 days), further&#xD;
      investigations needs to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the etiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in neonates with a gestational age&#xD;
      of ≥ 28 weeks from the refugee and migrant population, on the Thai-Myanmar border.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the risk factors for the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of prolonged neonatal jaundice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the neurodevelopmental outcome, at the age of 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the body composition, using air-displacement plethysmography, at birth, 1, 2&#xD;
           and 3 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of anaemia and illness episodes during the first year of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of helminthic infection at the age of one year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the knowledge level and misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia among the&#xD;
           mothers and SMRU health care staff&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will conduct an exhaustive prospective descriptive study, all eligible newborns&#xD;
      will be enrolled after obtaining the informed consent from their mothers. During pregnancy&#xD;
      and delivery we will collect clinical data about the mother. At birth we will take umbilical&#xD;
      cord blood (9 ml) to test for different causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In the first&#xD;
      week of life we plan 4 moments to measure the bilirubin and hematocrit level (0.05 ml),&#xD;
      weight and ask questions about feeding and other practices. Based on the bilirubin results we&#xD;
      will determine whether the neonate needs phototherapy. After the first week we weekly&#xD;
      follow-up will be conducted and in case of visible jaundice we will measure the bilirubin&#xD;
      level. If the neonate is still jaundiced after the age of 21 days we will further investigate&#xD;
      the cause. In the infant period, until the age of one year, we plan to have monthly follow-up&#xD;
      to assess the health and growth of the child and at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months we will do&#xD;
      a neurodevelopmental test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improved understanding of the pathological processes contributing to the development of&#xD;
      neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is needed in order to to identify neonates at risk and develop&#xD;
      improved management.&#xD;

      PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first antenatal care visit the mother will have a gestational dating ultrasound to&#xD;
      determine the accurate gestational age. During all antenatal care visits information about&#xD;
      the mother will be collected as part of standard obstetric care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood transfusion in history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chronic diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstetric history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Parity and gravida&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous neonatal deaths and reason of death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous preterm delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Previous child with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  Syphilis serology*&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  G6PD status&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hemoglobinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  ABO blood group&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Rhesus D blood group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for STD and HIV is routine practice at the SMRU clinics. Before the screening&#xD;
      permission from the mother is requested. Life-long antiretroviral triple therapy is available&#xD;
      in case of a positive HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the knowledge and beliefs on neonatal jaundice among the mothers we will perform a&#xD;
      short questionnaire. This questionnaire will help the study team to assess the level of&#xD;
      knowledge and the misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The study team will also ask the&#xD;
      subjects about the use of naphthalene containing moth balls and explain them the danger in&#xD;
      case the subject's baby will be G6PD deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES AT BIRTH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At birth the neonate will be excluded if the gestational age is &lt; 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed data about the delivery will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of maternal membrane rupture before delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mode of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of maternal fever in labour and use of antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of oxytocin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confirmed by ultrasound if presenting &lt; 24 weeks (CRL &lt; 14 weeks, HC 14-23+6) or,&#xD;
                in case of late ultrasound, determined with the Dubowitz gestational age assessment&#xD;
                (performed 6-72 hours after birth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apgar score and need for resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbilical cord blood will be obtained for laboratory investigations as below;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABO and Rhesus D blood group 0.1 ml., G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml., G6PD&#xD;
      spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml., G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml., Coomb's test (Direct&#xD;

&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birthweight, length and head circumference will be determined. The body composition will be&#xD;
      measured using air-displacement plethysmography (PeaPod) . A newborn physical examination&#xD;
      (including vital signs) will be performed within the first 24 hours, as part of normal&#xD;
      neonatal care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin colour (pale/cyanosed/jaundiced/normal),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  skin rash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  description of anterior fontanelle (raised/normal/depressed),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bruising on the body: location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  swelling on the head&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 diameters will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  swelling crossing the scalp sutures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  diagnose: caput succedaneum, cephalhematoma or subgaleal hemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;

      distress (chest indrawing/nasal flaring/head bobbing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal examination: abdominal mass, enlarged liver or spleen, genitalia, anus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological examination: muscle tone, moving of limbs, eye red reflex&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES DURING NEONATAL FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first week after birth there are four moments when the neonate will be assessed. This&#xD;
      will be 24 hours [range 22-26 hours], 48 hours [range 36-60 hours], 84 hours [range 70-96&#xD;
      hours] and on day 6 [range day 5-8]. After this week the mother will be asked to come back&#xD;
      for weekly follow-up until the age of one month. At one month of age the body composition&#xD;
      will be measured using PeaPod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mother will be asked questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First 24 hours after delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (in hours) of initiation of feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How is the baby being fed (exclusive breastmilk, supplementary or mixed feeding)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If supplementary feeding, what is the reason for this?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Does the baby suck well?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of drugs or herbal medicine by mother in first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of herbal preparations for neonate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age (in hours) at passage of first stool and urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of napthalene balls for storing of baby clothes&#xD;
&#xD;
      During every follow-up the mother the questions about feeding will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During every neonatal follow-up until the visit on day 6 [range day 5-8], a SBR and&#xD;
      haematocrit will be measured. The SBR result will be plotted, by age on a jaundice treatment&#xD;
      graph specific for the gestational age and the need for phototherapy or more intense&#xD;
      follow-up will be determined. During weekly follow-up after the age of 8 days, only a SBR and&#xD;
      hematocrit will be measured in case of visible jaundice. At the age of one month, a&#xD;
      hematocrit will be measured for anemia screening and the G6PD fluorescent test will be&#xD;
      repeated as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum bilirubin 0.05 ml. x 5, Haematocrit 0.05 ml. x 5, G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 0.205 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed at every visit and the&#xD;
      weight will be measured. Weightloss or -increase will be calculated and if there is ≥ 10%&#xD;
      weightloss, the neonate will be reviewed carefully for any underlying cause of this&#xD;
      weightloss and supplementary feeding (expressed breastmilk or powdermilk) will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES WHEN DELIVERY OUTSIDE SMRU&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of delivery in another clinic or at home, but the mother and neonate visit a SMRU&#xD;
      clinic within the first 48 hours after delivery, the neonate can still be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a neonate is born outside SMRU and does not visit the clinic within 48 hours after&#xD;
      delivery, but presents with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the first 8 days of life, this&#xD;
      neonate can be included in the study as well. Because no umbilical cord blood was taken, a&#xD;
      limited set of laboratory investigations will be performed, as described as below;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABO and Rhesus D bloodgroup 0.075 ml., G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml., G6PD&#xD;
      spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml., G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml., Serum bilirubin 0.05&#xD;
      ml., Haematocrit 0.05 ml., Genotyping 2 ml.,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total volume 2.23 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES DURING INFANT FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant follow-up will take place every month until the age of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit the mother will be asked about feeding practices and after the age of 6 months&#xD;
      about neurodevelopmental milestones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the problems of anaemia in this population (50% of the infants are reported to have a&#xD;
      haematocrit of &lt; 33% at the age of 6 months; personal communication Dr. Rose McGready)&#xD;
      haematocrit will be measured monthly, by finger prick, and anaemia will be treated if&#xD;
      necessary. At the age of one year a stool test for parasitology screening will be taken and&#xD;
      the infant will be treated if necessary. Finally at one year of age the infant will be&#xD;
      screened for hemoglobinopathy due to contradictory reports of the association between&#xD;
      neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemoglobinopathy as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haematocrit 0.05 ml. x11, Hemoglobin typing 3 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total volume 3.55 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed at every visit and the&#xD;
      weight will be measured. At the age of 2 and 3 month a body composition will be measured&#xD;
      using PeaPod. At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months the length and head circumference will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the age of 3, 6 months and 12 months the infant will be assessed with the Shoklo&#xD;
      Developmental Test 53 and the results compared to age specific norms developed for this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

        Over the course of a one year period, the mothers of neonates (estimated gestation ≥ 28&#xD;
        weeks) who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be asked to&#xD;
        participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on previous experience, assuming that most mothers will agree to participate in the&#xD;
        study and 15% of the included neonates will be lost before completion of the study, we will&#xD;
        include approximately 1887 neonates. With an estimated proportion of neonatal&#xD;
        hyperbilirubinemia of 18%, 340 of 1887 neonates will develop neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
        Other prospective studies had numbers of neonates with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia ranging&#xD;
        from 21 to 624.&#xD;
