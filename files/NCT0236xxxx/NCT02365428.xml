    <textblock>
      Fewer pregnant women achieve recommendations for physical activity (PA) (30 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate PA 5 days of the week) as compared to non-pregnant women (15.8% to 26.1%&#xD;
      respectively), and PA participation declines as pregnancy progresses. The benefits of PA&#xD;
      during pregnancy are abundant to both the mother (e.g., reduced weight gain, lower risk of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes) and the fetus (e.g., decreased fat mass, improved stress tolerance).&#xD;
      Pregnancy represents a significant time in a woman's life in which she may be motivated to&#xD;
      change her health behaviors due to concerns for the healthy development of the fetus and a&#xD;
      quick return to pre-pregnancy weight. Hence, pregnancy represents a critical time to support&#xD;
      women in PA participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous research, 94% of pregnant and postpartum women of varying socioeconomic&#xD;
      statuses reported using the Internet for pregnancy and PA information. Despite some women&#xD;
      increasing their PA participation as a result, most did not know if a website was reputable&#xD;
      or reliable (i.e. evidence-based). Studies have reported that most online health information&#xD;
      is unregulated and inaccurate. Further, women often receive inadequate PA information from&#xD;
      physicians who are constrained by time and lack of knowledge about PA. Therefore, directing&#xD;
      pregnant women to evidence-based websites via text messaging may provide a feasible approach&#xD;
      to improve PA participation. PA participation in pregnant women is an ongoing challenge that&#xD;
      warrants testing of innovative solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using mobile phone text&#xD;
      messaging to refer pregnant women to evidence-based websites for PA information to increase&#xD;
      PA levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase 1, the investigators will identify and test evidence-based websites and text&#xD;
      messages with our target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First the investigators will conduct interviews with pregnant women who meet physical&#xD;
      activity recommendations (n=15-20) (30 minutes of moderate intensity activity at least five&#xD;
      days per week) to ask them about what helps them to be active during their pregnancy. Using&#xD;
      the information gathered from these interviews and the literature the investigators will&#xD;
      develop text messages and 200-300 word mobile (i.e., cell phone, tablet computer) websites.&#xD;
      The mobile websites will include content from evidence-based websites, but will be adapted&#xD;
      for the mobile platform to enhance the user interface and readability of the websites. The&#xD;
      goal of the mobile websites is to allow women to access the websites by clicking on the link&#xD;
      in each text message. Once developed, the first draft of evidence-based websites and text&#xD;
      messages will be tested with interviews (pregnant women n=12, physician n=12, nurses/staff&#xD;
      n=12) prior to their use. All phase one participants will be recruited through word of mouth,&#xD;
      community nurse clinics and physician offices. Consultant Link will direct efforts to recruit&#xD;
      participants from community nurse clinics. Dr. Coonrod, Dr. Huls and Ms. Braescu will direct&#xD;
      efforts to recruit participants from physician offices. The purpose of the interviews are to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility (perceived acceptability and demand) and the appropriateness&#xD;
      (culturally and linguistically) of the material. A moderator and note-taker (student&#xD;
      researchers) trained by the PI (Huberty) and Co-I (Hekler) will conduct interviews. All&#xD;
      participants will receive $25 for their participation. The interviews will inform the second&#xD;
      draft of evidence-based websites and text messages, which will be used to implement the&#xD;
      intervention. An amendment that requests the approval of the text messages and websites will&#xD;
      be submitted after the completion of Phase 1 and prior to the commencement of Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addition to Phase 2 - The investigators will conduct a survey to determine the appropriate&#xD;
      dose (frequency and intensity) of physical activity text messages for Phase 2. The&#xD;
      investigators will use this information to determine how often during the pregnancy (e.g.,&#xD;
      daily, weekly) and when during the pregnancy (e.g., first, second, third trimester, or&#xD;
      throughout) that text messages with physical activity information are necessary to help women&#xD;
      participate in physical activity during their pregnancy. The survey is approximately 45&#xD;
      questions in length and takes about 5 minutes to complete. Pregnant women will be recruited&#xD;
      using word of mouth, fliers in places where pregnant women may be present (e.g., baby stores,&#xD;
      maternity stores, community nurse clinics and physician offices,), email list servs (e.g.&#xD;
      partnerships with Text 4 Baby and foundations related to pregnancy), and social media (e.g.,&#xD;
      Facebook, twitter). The investigators will recruit 200 women to complete the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2, the investigators will recruit women (n=75-100) to receive text messages&#xD;
      referring them to evidence-based websites for PA information. Flyers will be available in&#xD;
      physicians' clinics for posting and/or handout to women attending their first visit (8-16&#xD;
      weeks gestation). The PI will present the study information to physicians, nurses, and staff&#xD;
      at all physicians' sites; however, physicians, nurses, and staff will only participate in&#xD;
      passive recruitment methods via the study flyer. Participants will also be recruited&#xD;
      nationally using social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter) and word of mouth (i.e., emails).&#xD;
      Interested participants will contact the research team (contact information on the flyer) to&#xD;
      learn more about the study and complete the eligibility questionnaire. After completing the&#xD;
      eligibility questionnaire (see attached), participants will be contacted via email to set up&#xD;
      a time to complete an intake appointment. Intake appointments (to review and sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form, discuss the study in more detail) with participants will take place&#xD;
      over the phone. The participants' informed consent and baseline questionnaires must be&#xD;
      received before they will be eligible to begin the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to a control group (n=25) or one of two intervention groups&#xD;
      (n=50). The control group will receive three standard Text4Baby messages per week.&#xD;
      Intervention group 1 will receive two physical activity messages and one standard Text4Baby&#xD;
      message each week. Intervention group 2 will receive six physical activity messages and one&#xD;
      standard Text4Baby message per week. The physical activity text message will refer the&#xD;
      participant to an evidence-based (HON Code certified) website that includes PA information&#xD;
      relative to the time in their pregnancy. Text messages will be pulled from a list of 150&#xD;
      possible text messages. The text messages and websites will provide educational information&#xD;
      about PA and its health benefits, but women will not be given a prescribed PA program to&#xD;
      follow as a part of this study. Therefore, a doctor's note approving women's participation in&#xD;
      this study is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Phase 2 participants will be objectively measured for physical activity using the Fitbit&#xD;
      activity monitor. The device will be mailed to women after completing the intake appointment&#xD;
      and returning the informed consent and baseline questionnaires. The women will wear the&#xD;
      device for 24 hours daily and will be asked to sync their device to their computer in order&#xD;
      to send researchers their physical activity feedback. All Fitbit monitors will be identified&#xD;
      only by a participant code to maintain the confidentiality of data when participants send&#xD;
      their data via wireless internet and when researchers receive the data. Women will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete short satisfaction surveys about some of the text messages. Fifteen women&#xD;
      will receive the satisfaction surveys once per week, and 60 women will receive the surveys&#xD;
      twice per month. The satisfaction survey is included with this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, Phase 2 participants will be invited to participate in a voluntary&#xD;
      interview to further examine the feasibility of the intervention. Areas of focus will&#xD;
      include: acceptability (satisfaction, intention to use, perceived appropriateness), demand&#xD;
      (actual use, intention to use), and implementation (factors affecting ease or difficulty) of&#xD;
      using text messaging for referral to evidence-based websites for PA information. The&#xD;
      interview can be conducted in person or over the phone. Participants who complete the&#xD;
      intervention will be able to retain the FitBit device for their personal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the interview, participants will be invited to participate in Phase 3 of the study&#xD;
      (Part 2) (new consent form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 3 (Part 2), the information collected on the Fitbit physical activity monitor&#xD;
      and synced with the user ID will be recorded during the mother's first year post-partum (from&#xD;
      time of birth until the child's first birthday) just as it was during the pregnancy. The&#xD;
      investigators will also send a survey, via a Qualtrics link, to complete every three months&#xD;
      (4 times total) during this first year post-partum. The survey will ask questions related to&#xD;
      mental health (i.e., stress, anxiety), physical health (i.e., weight, physical activity&#xD;
      participation), and psychosocial characteristics (i.e., mood, support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Phase 3 (Part 2) participants will complete a new informed consent document in which they&#xD;
      are aware that the investigators will continue to monitor their physical activity (without&#xD;
      text messages) and will complete 4 surveys.&#xD;
