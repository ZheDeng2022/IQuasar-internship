  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three years since the Smoke Free Mumbai campaign and six years since the ban on smoking in&#xD;
      public places was implemented. It is necessary to review the situation at this point in time&#xD;
      so that corrective actions if necessary can be taken. Hence, this study is planned to&#xD;
      understand the perceptions and attitudes of commuters and bus employees (drivers, conductors&#xD;
      and ticket checkers) regarding the law, its implementation, reactions from the commuters,&#xD;
      violations observed, violations reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help evaluate the implementation of provision of prohibiting smoking in&#xD;
      public places and help understand how to increase the compliance. The results will inform&#xD;
      enforcement and public health agencies about where to target enforcement and public education&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;

      Sampling Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of Bus Depots, Public transport Buses with routes and Bus stops will be prepared&#xD;
      with the help of BEST undertaking. Category wise sample of 100 BEST buses, 100 bus stops and&#xD;
      all 26 bus depots will be selected through a simple random sampling method .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Times of day for Compliance Survey data collection. There is no best prac¬tice for the time&#xD;
      of day for observing compliance. One alternative is to visit venues at peak business hours to&#xD;
      assess compliance when the most number of people are affected. Alternatively, venues could be&#xD;
      visited at different times of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will collect data at three time sets viz: Morning 9.00- 11.00 am, Afternoon&#xD;
      2.00 -4.00 pm and Evening 5.00-7.00 pm to determine if compliance varies by time of day. The&#xD;
      data collection tool will record the time of day of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: Trained Medical Social Workers will administer the informed consent forms&#xD;
      to the study participants in the presence of a witness Questionnaire administration Validated&#xD;
      pre tested survey questionnaire will be administered to BEST employees and BEST commuters by&#xD;
      trained Field investigators to record personal details, self tobacco consumption, knowledge&#xD;
      about legislation for Smokefree Public places and perceived challenges in implementing the&#xD;
      same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation for Compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field investigators will be trained to observe violations and to record these on the designed&#xD;
      format, for noting the compliance and violations at randomly selected BEST buses, bus stops&#xD;
      and bus depots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Analysis of Observational Data will measure the following outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The overall rate of compliance for all loca¬tions (Public place) visited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The compliance rate for each category of location&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall Compliance on each criteria / parameter selected for recording compliance as per&#xD;
           protocol for all locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The compliance rate for each criteria / parameter selected for recording compliance for&#xD;
           each category of location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data entry will be done in the Department of Preventive Oncology, Tata&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital using SPSS version 18. High quality data collection will be ensured with&#xD;
      regular checks for data collection and data entry for completeness and consistency across&#xD;
      responses. Descriptive statistics will be used to record compliance, perceptions and&#xD;
      attitudes regarding implementation of smoke free BEST policy. Both descriptive and&#xD;
      inferential statistics will be generated for describing variables under the study objectives.&#xD;
      Interview data will be qualitative in nature and will be analyzed to determine themes from&#xD;
      respondents and to identify variations in responses to questions about smoke-free compliance&#xD;
      issues. Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify the factors determining&#xD;
      compliance to the law .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will increase awareness of the BEST employees regarding the law. Results of the&#xD;
      study will inform policymakers how well the law is being complied with and the link between&#xD;
      the levels of compliance found and resources needed to im¬prove or maintain compliance with&#xD;
      smoke-free public places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of the study will help enforcement agencies to take up result oriented measures and&#xD;
      also to create greater pressure for action for effective enforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will provide information to Managers of the locations visited about overall compli-ance&#xD;
      and can be used to design compliance checks that can be conducted at regular intervals and&#xD;
      encourage them to comply with the law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results can inform General public/ commuters about lev¬els of compliance with the law,&#xD;
      encourage the public to comply with the law, and call for ongoing or increased enforcement of&#xD;
      the law by the government.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper implementation of the law will help in reducing exposure to second hand smoke,&#xD;
      reducing the environmental impact of unsightly litter such as cigarette butts and packets and&#xD;
      providing supportive environments for non-smokers and for those attempting to quit smoking.&#xD;
      Creating smoke-free outdoor areas, such as public transport stops and stations, can support&#xD;
      those who have quit and make smoking less visible to children and young people.&#xD;
