    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentral clinical trial to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Recombinant Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Receptor Ⅱ IgG Fc fusion protein&#xD;
      injection (Yisaipu®) in the treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis(SpA). The primary&#xD;
      purpose is to assess the different situations in maintaining treatment programme in SpA&#xD;
      patients with controlled inflammation by Yisaipu®. And the second purpose is to assess the&#xD;
      eficacy and safety of Yisaipu® in axial SpAs. The trial will include 150 patients with stable&#xD;
      NSAIDs therapy, and at the first stage they will receive 24-week full-dose of Yisaipu®. Then&#xD;
      at the second stage the patients who achieve low disease activity (LDA, ASDAS&lt;2.1) at 24th&#xD;
      week will be randomizedly divided into three group: full-dose of Yisaipu® group, half-dose of&#xD;
      Yisaipu® group and placebo group. And the blind stage will last for 48 weeks. Patients who&#xD;
      complete the 72-week therapy or achieve disease-flare criteria during the blind stage would&#xD;
      finish the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled trial enrolled adult patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed&#xD;
      with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis at 3 centres in China. Patients had to fulfil&#xD;
      ASAS axial spondyloarthritis criteria but could not fulfil the modified New York radiologic&#xD;
      criterion for ankylosing spondylitis,and had to have objective evidence of active&#xD;
      inflammation or chronic structral change，such as bone erosion or fat metaplasia in the&#xD;
      sacroiliac joints on MRI at screening. Active disease activity was defined as a disease&#xD;
      activity score in ASDAS-CRP ≥2.1,or Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      [BASDAI] ≥4 on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, and an inadequate response to more than one&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 weeks at least, intolerance to NSAIDs,&#xD;
      or contraindication for NSAIDs. No change in NSAIDs dose was required from 2 weeks before&#xD;
      screening to the end of the study. Dose stability or discontinuation was required for 4 weeks&#xD;
      before baseline for concomitant DMARDs or corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent at a dose&#xD;
      of less than 10 mg/day). Chinese herbal medicine, physical therapy, or live (attenuated)&#xD;
      vaccine, or intravenous immunoglobulin IgG, was required for discontinuation and wash period&#xD;
      for at least 4 weeks. Patients were excluded if they had previously taken or were taking&#xD;
      biologic treatment, any biologic Dmards such as IL-6 or CD-20 inhibitors. Patients with&#xD;
      latent tuberculosis infection were included only when local guidelines were followed for&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment and if treatment was initiated before Yisaipu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by an&#xD;
      institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. The study was&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and the ethical principles of Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized envelope was used to enrol all patients at the baseline visit and to randomly&#xD;
      assign qualifying patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either blinded Yisaipu 50 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneously every week or 25 mg subcutaneously every week or matching placebo at week 24.&#xD;
      All study personnel, including the sponsor (with the exception of the Sanshengguojian drug&#xD;
      supply management team), investigator, and study site personnel, and the patient remained&#xD;
      blinded to treatment throughout the double-blinded period from week 24 through week 72 of the&#xD;
      study. Investigational products were provided to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial open-label period, enrolled patients were given subcutaneous injections of 50&#xD;
      mg Yisaipu every week for 36 weeks. Participants were given the dose of NSAIDs they had been&#xD;
      receiving at screening; a dose decrease or discontinuation was allowed when the patients were&#xD;
      intolerance to NSAIDs, or contraindication for NSAIDs. Patients who achieved clinical&#xD;
      remission, defined as achieving ASDAS inactive or moderate disease (ASDAS score &lt;2.1) at&#xD;
      weeks 24, were randomly assigned to receive either blinded 50mg Yisaipu (continuation arm),&#xD;
      25mg Yisaipu(reduction arm) or matching placebo (withdrawal arm) for 48 weeks during the&#xD;
      double-blind period, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double-blind period, patients who experienced a flare (defined as an increase in&#xD;
      BASDAI ≥2 points compare to the BASDAI score when randomization) were allocate to termination&#xD;
      of this trial.&#xD;
