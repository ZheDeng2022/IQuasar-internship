      The present study is a multicentric randomized phase III trial designed to assess whether&#xD;
      overall survival and quality of life are improved in patients with asymptomatic colon cancer&#xD;
      and unresectable SLM treated with resection of the PT followed by chemotherapy versus&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of diagnosis, 20-25% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present synchronous&#xD;
      liver metastases (SLM) and in the majority of patients (80-90%) liver metastases are&#xD;
      unsuitable for curative surgical treatment. Whether either primary tumour (PT) resection&#xD;
      followed by chemotherapy or immediate chemotherapy without PT resection is the best&#xD;
      therapeutic option in patients with asymptomatic colon cancer and unresectable SLM is still&#xD;
      controversial. No randomised trial has been conducted to answer this question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, surgeons have advocated resection of the PT to avoid potential complications of&#xD;
      the intact PT (bleeding, obstruction, perforation). However, during the past decade, several&#xD;
      highly active systemic agents have become available for treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      CRC. These agents have increased the median survival duration of patients with unresectable&#xD;
      metastatic disease from 9 to 12 months with 5FU alone, to 30-35 months with the addition of&#xD;
      modern cytotoxic and targeted agents. Modern agents have also demonstrated increased activity&#xD;
      on the PT as well, and have been associated with low rates of PT-related complications during&#xD;
      treatment in initially asymptomatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the strategy on survival has never been assessed properly. All published&#xD;
      studies are of non-randomized design, single center, and retrospective in most of them.&#xD;
      Moreover, few data on the use of systemic therapy are presented in these studies, which makes&#xD;
      it difficult to assess the relative contribution of resection on outcome. In addition,&#xD;
      patients with extensive disease or poor performance status were more likely to be offered&#xD;
      chemotherapy rather than surgery thus introducing a bias at the ousted. Despite these&#xD;
      limitations, PT resection at initial management of these metastatic CRC patients with&#xD;
      unresectable SLM was related to prolonged survival on multivariate analysis in the majority&#xD;
      of these series. The improvement in survival following PT resection may be attributed to the&#xD;
      potential role of the PT to provide an angiogenic prosperous environment for metastatic&#xD;
      tumour growth in the liver parenchyma adjacent to the SLM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a multicenter randomized phase III trial designed to assess whether&#xD;
      overall survival and quality of life are improved in patients with asymptomatic unresectable&#xD;
      metastatic colon cancer treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients (ECOG 0-1 performance status) with asymptomatic colon cancer (&gt;15cm from the anal&#xD;
      margin) and unresectable liver only metastatic disease on initial abdominal CT/MRI scan will&#xD;
      be randomized to either colectomy followed by chemotherapy, or chemotherapy without resection&#xD;
      of the PT. Systemic chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy will be let to the&#xD;
      investigators' discretion according to standard local practices. The primary endpoint of the&#xD;
      study is overall survival for &gt;2 years. The secondary endpoints are: quality of life (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29), treatment safety (postoperative morbidity, complications related to the&#xD;
      unresected PT, chemotherapy toxicity), progression-free survival and time to metastatic&#xD;
      progression, radiological response to chemotherapy (RECIST v1.1 criteria), and the curative&#xD;
      (R0) resection rate of metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 15% amelioration of overall survival at 2 years is expected in colectomy group (HR=0.65,&#xD;
      with a rise from 40% to 55%). Using a two sided α level of 5%, 180 events are required to&#xD;
      detect this difference with a power of 80% (β=0.20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the expected accrual of 15 patients per month during 19 months, a minimum&#xD;
      follow-up of 28 months and a 5% rate of lost to follow-up, 278 patients will be included. The&#xD;
      final analysis of all endpoints will be conducted 28 months after the last inclusion. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study will be approximately 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A translational study will be conducted to evaluate the serum altered DNA patented test&#xD;
      (AP-HP, 31 January 2008 under n°08/00543) we developed for colon cancer diagnosis, as a&#xD;
      prognostic marker and a treatment response tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radiological study will be conducted to identify the angiogenesis changes within or around&#xD;
      liver metastases after resection of the PT. In addition to the morphological sequences&#xD;
      allowing the use of RECIST1.1, DCE and DWI sequences will be performed in order to calculate&#xD;
      the ADC value of the lesion as well as the Ktrans, Kep, PS that describe cellularity and&#xD;
      perfusion of the lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional ultrasound examination using SWE to study the stiffness of the liver metastases&#xD;
      will be proposed at the end of the MRI examination.&#xD;
