      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) harbors a high risk for brain metastases. Prophylactic whole&#xD;
      brain radiotherapy (PCI)) is the standard treatment for these patients after completing&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy to the chest, with a 5% survival advantage. Recent data suggest minimal&#xD;
      risk for hippocampal involvement in these patients. There is no published data thus far&#xD;
      testing the effect of hippocampal sparing during WBRT on the patient's neuro-cognitive&#xD;
      function, QOL, and survival.., The goals of the proposed study are to assess prospectively&#xD;
      the neurocognitive changes in patients with LD SCLC who are candidates for PCI before, and&#xD;
      periodically after PCI&#xD;

      Background and rational Prophylactic cranial irradiation Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an&#xD;
      aggressive type of lung cancer, with high sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy but&#xD;
      with high incidence of local and distant recurrences. The brain is a common site of&#xD;
      metastases from SCLC with a risk of up to 70% for brain involvement [1]. Prophylactic cranial&#xD;
      irradiation (PCI) is the standard treatment for patients with limited disease (LD) SCLC after&#xD;
      completing chemo-radiotherapy to the chest. The treatment includes whole brain radiotherapy&#xD;
      (WBRT), reduces the incidence of brain metastases and improves overall survival (OS) by 5%&#xD;
      [1]. The down side of WBRT is that the central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) and its related toxicity may be associated with irreversible cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy and neuro-cognitive function It has been demonstrated that there are two main&#xD;
      regions of human containing multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs): the subgranular zone (SGZ)&#xD;
      within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and the subventricular zone (SVZ) on the lateral&#xD;
      aspect of the lateral ventricles [3,4,5,6,7,8]. These NSCs are capable of replacing adult&#xD;
      neuron loss caused by various forms of harm (e.g. local ischemia, brain trauma, and radiation&#xD;
      exposure and neurodegenerative diseases). However, they are extremely sensitive to X-rays,&#xD;
      and thus reduction of NSCs may play an important role in radiation-induced neurocognitive&#xD;
      impairment [6,7,8]. Neurocognitive function (NCF) has a major impact on QOL and has been&#xD;
      actively studied in brain tumor patients treated with radiotherapy. Many studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the neurocognitive outcome of patients treated with radiation for brain metastases&#xD;
      and primary brain tumors [9,10,11,12,13,14]. Radiation primarily causes coagulation necrosis&#xD;
      of the white matter tracts and cerebral vasculature by axonal demyelination and damage to&#xD;
      vascular endothelial cells. Radiation has been shown to negatively affect various&#xD;
      neuropsychological domains. WBRT has been shown to have greater neuropsychological impairment&#xD;
      than focused radiation treatment [14]. Correlation, between radiation dosage to the bilateral&#xD;
      hippocampi and impairment of NCF, was found in adult patients with benign or low-grade brain&#xD;
      tumors treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ongoing clinical trial of the radiation oncology group (RTOG) is testing the applicability&#xD;
      of hippocampal sparing and its impact on neurocognitive changes in cancer patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro-cognitive function testing Even though many studies have evaluated NCF in relation to&#xD;
      radiation, there is no consensus regarding standardization of tests selection, time points&#xD;
      for evaluation and correlations with biomarkers. Many studies use the Folstein Mini-Mental&#xD;
      State Examination (MMSE) to assess neurocognitive function [15,16]. The MMSE is not a&#xD;
      sensitive tool for detecting cognitive impairment and does not measure the cognitive&#xD;
      functions affected by radiation. The NeuroTrax system is described elsewhere [17]. In brief,&#xD;
      Mindstreams consists of custom software that resides on the local testing computer and serves&#xD;
      as a platform for interactive cognitive tests that produce accuracy and reaction time&#xD;
      (millisecond time-scale) data. In case of conducting several trails for a single patient,&#xD;
      Mindstreams uses a different version of the tests in each trial, in order to avoid a learning&#xD;
      bias. Tests are available in multiple languages, and equivalence among English and Hebrew&#xD;
      versions has been shown [17]. After tests are run on the local computer, data are&#xD;
      automatically uploaded to a central server, where calculation of outcome parameters from raw&#xD;
      single-trial data and report generation occurs. All responses are made with the mouse or with&#xD;
      the number pad on the keyboard. Participants are familiarized with these input devices at the&#xD;
      beginning of the battery, and practice sessions prior to the individual tests instruct them&#xD;
      regarding the particular responses required for each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hippocampal sparing during PCI Recent data suggest minimal risk for hippocampal involvement&#xD;
      in patients with SCLC and brain metastases suggesting that reduced radiation dose to these&#xD;
      areas during PCI would not significantly compromise the control in the brain [18]. There is&#xD;
      no published data thus far testing the effect of hippocampal sparing during PCI on the&#xD;
      patient's neuro-cognitive function, QOL, and survival. Volumetric arc radiotherapy (VMAT) and&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) use advanced radiation planning software with&#xD;
      computerized algorithms of inverse planning to allow differential radiation dose distribution&#xD;
      within the same radiation field. A preliminary dosimetric work in the radiation oncology unit&#xD;
      at Sheba medical center has proved the feasibility of generating WBRT plans using these&#xD;
      techniques while reducing the dose to the hippocampi. The investigators compared 3&#xD;
      radiotherapy plans (standard 2 lateral field plan, IMRT plan and a VMAT plan) aiming to give&#xD;
      30Gy to the brain, with 40Gy integrated boost to evident brain metastases (using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging - MRI scan) and reduced dose to the hippocampi (&lt;10Gy) according to RTOG&#xD;
      0933 protocol. IMRT achieved better results in general then the VMAT plans, especially in&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases located closer to the hippocampi. The work has been presented&#xD;
      in the EANS European Association of Neuro-Surgeonsmeeting last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum biomarkers for CNS damage Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 are two serum tumor&#xD;
      markers that may be used as a potential screening tool for brain injury caused by radiation&#xD;
      [19-27]. NSE is a glycolytic enzyme found in the CNS, expressed by neural and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      cells. Elevated levels of NSE have been found in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. A&#xD;
      multi-center retrospective study involving 231 NSCLC patients demonstrated that high serum&#xD;
      levels of NSE indicated shorter survival and was a specific marker of metastases. It is&#xD;
      thought that the rise in NSE in brain metastasis patients reflects the extent of neuronal&#xD;
      damage, as seen following a cerebral stroke. S100 protein is a nervous-system-specific&#xD;
      cytoplasmic protein found in astrocytes and released into the serum when the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB) is breached. Brain metastases were shown to be associated with elevated levels&#xD;
      of S100 in several malignancies. Serum S-100B has also been demonstrated to be useful in&#xD;
      determining brain damage related to stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging biomarkers for CNS damage Although brain radiotherapy induces white matter changes&#xD;
      which can be depicted in standard MRI scans, no correlation was found between these changes&#xD;
      and cognitive impairment. BBB disruption is an early, readily recognizable pathophysiological&#xD;
      event occurring after radiation injury. It is detectable in vivo/in vitro by MRI and other&#xD;
      imaging modalities, and appears to precede white matter necrosis. Micro-vascular leakage&#xD;
      (MVL), calculated from perfusion MRI, is more sensitive than conventional contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      MRI to subtle BBB opening, reflecting abnormal permeability of immature vessels. Treatment&#xD;
      response assessment maps (TRAM) is a novel methodology, based on T1-MRI acquired up to 90 min&#xD;
      after contrast injection, which allows depiction of subtle BBB disruption [28]. The resulting&#xD;
      calculated maps, depict BBB functioning of the full brain, with high spatial resolution and&#xD;
      high sensitivity to subtle BBB abnormalities. Results in &gt;200 patients with primary and&#xD;
      metastatic brain tumors demonstrate the high sensitivity for subtle BBB disruption and the&#xD;
      ability of the investigators maps to depict and differentiate various BBB disruption patterns&#xD;
      within the tumor and the irradiated area.&#xD;
