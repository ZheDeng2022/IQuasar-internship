    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, two-part study. Part A only will be&#xD;
      described in this record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will begin a 14-day&#xD;
      baseline observation period followed by a 14-day treatment period. Subjects will be required&#xD;
      to attend six study visits. A follow-up phone call will take place four weeks after last&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will enroll three groups of 10 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - subjects on inducer AEDs (and not on inhibitor AEDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - subjects on inhibitor AEDs (and not on inducer AEDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 - subjects on AEDs that are neither inducers nor inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the three groups subjects will be randomized to receive, in a 4:1 ratio, GWP42006&#xD;
      400 mg twice daily or matching placebo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for GWP42006 and&#xD;
      metabolites will be collected on the first and last day of treatment. Samples will also be&#xD;
      collected 24h and 72h after the last day of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to record a daily diary with information about their seizures,&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) and concomitant AED administration.&#xD;

             progressive neurologic abnormality.&#xD;

          -  Subject has taken St John's Wort in the last two weeks and/or is unwilling to abstain&#xD;
             throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has consumed grapefruit or grapefruit juice three days prior to randomization&#xD;
