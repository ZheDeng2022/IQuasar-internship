    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem, which is characterized by reduced cardiac&#xD;
      function leading to pulmonary congestion. Most episodes of acute HF requiring unplanned&#xD;
      hospitalization are due to pulmonary congestion. There is an urgent clinical need for&#xD;
      quantitative, reproducible, minimally invasive, and noninvasive methods to assess thoracic&#xD;
      fluid status. The potential value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (DCE-MRI) to this end has been suggested and demonstrated in-vitro. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare intra-thoracic fluid volume assessed by DCE- MRI using bolus&#xD;
      kinetic parameters of the indicator dilution theory and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: This study evaluates the correlation between change in BIS and change in&#xD;
      bolus kinetic parameters in response to a fluid challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: The sensitivity of the bolus kinetic parameters to fluid challenges and&#xD;
      the normal range DCE-MRI bolus kinetic parameters is evaluated in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective nonrandomized pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The subjects will receive an intra-venous injection of gadolinium, a MRI&#xD;
      contrast agent. External pressure will be applied by means of a leg-compression device in&#xD;
      order to induce a rapid increase of the preload by blood auto-transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: Pulmonary transit time (PTT), skewness of the indicator dilution curve&#xD;
      which is a measure of trans-pulmonary dilution, intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV), changes in&#xD;
      bolus kinetic parameters, and thoracic impedance in response to fluid challenges. The&#xD;
      correlation between changes in bolus kinetic parameters and thoracic impedance in response to&#xD;
      fluid challenges.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HF is a major health problem that affects 6.5 million people in Europe and 200.000 in the&#xD;
      Netherlands. HF is characterized by frequent and often costly hospitalizations. Most&#xD;
      hospitalizations for acute heart failure are due to pulmonary congestion rather than low&#xD;
      cardiac output syndrome. Congestion is one of the clinical targets for current therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. Therefore, the assessment of fluid status is crucial for diagnosis, management,&#xD;
      stratification and follow-up of HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing HF diagnostic tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congestion is usually assessed by clinical signs such as dyspnea, oedema, rales, and jugular&#xD;
      venous distension. Semi-quantitative scores have been developed, which may be used to&#xD;
      follow-up response to HF therapy. However, these scores offer limited added clinical value&#xD;
      because of the lack of an acceptable reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indicator dilution theory and bolus kinetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of congestion is possible by kinetic analysis of a bolus of a suitable indicator.&#xD;
      Circulation tests based on this principle are well-known techniques to diagnose cardiac&#xD;
      failure. Lower cardiac output (CO) and large lung blood volumes result in prolongation of&#xD;
      circulation times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the indicator dilution theory, bolus kinetic analysis can provide absolute volume&#xD;
      measurement. The volume between injection and detection site or between different detection&#xD;
      sites can be obtained by multiplying the difference in mean transit time of the indicator&#xD;
      between the two sites and the flow rate of the dilution system. Furthermore, in case the&#xD;
      indicator leaks from a membrane during the dilution process, kinetic parameters such as&#xD;
      skewness of the indicator dilution curve may indicate the status of the membrane. The method&#xD;
      was in principle applied by radionuclide angiography. Main limitations were the burden for&#xD;
      the patient due to the use of radioactive tracers and the limitation of the method to the&#xD;
      vessels, as it was not applicable for a large blood pool such as the heart ventricles. Other&#xD;
      indicators such as dyes or cold saline require central vessel catheterization, an invasive&#xD;
      procedure that results in severe additional risks for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-MRI allows minimally invasive measurement of indicator dilution curves, with the&#xD;
      advantage of simultaneous sampling in the different heart chambers. DCE-MRI has been proposed&#xD;
      and validated in-vitro for volume measurement. It is a minimally invasive procedure that may&#xD;
      advantage from automated post-processing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small dose of gadolinium (Gd-CA) is used to ensure the linearity between the obtained MRI&#xD;
      signal and the concentration of Gd-CA, for the indicator dilution theory. This bolus is much&#xD;
      smaller than normally used for standard MRI protocols, this minimizes the risk for Gd-CA&#xD;
      associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to similar approaches in magnetic resonance angiography, DCE-MRI provides single&#xD;
      heart beat resolution. Short post-processing time is required to derive physiological&#xD;
      parameters since automated image processing and fitting routines are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies focus only on left ventricle (LV) enhancement curve. This neglects right&#xD;
      ventricle (RV) enhancement curve dilution system and therefore the hemodynamic status of the&#xD;
      injection site to RV circulatory tree. Most studies only focus on the interpeak distance. A&#xD;
      model-based curve fitting approach leads to more accurate results, not limited to the imaging&#xD;
      sampling rate; which may lead to further estimation of additional parameters, possibly&#xD;
      related to the lung circulation and its extravasation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary transit time (PTT) measured by DCE-MRI has been shown to be a good measure of&#xD;
      preload and the LV filling pressure. The PTT was prolonged and correlated with alternative&#xD;
      indirect congestion measures. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) currently can be assessed by&#xD;
      chest X-ray, invasive thermodilution, or ultrasound comets. DCE-MRI based bolus kinetic&#xD;
      offers a potential method for quantification of EVLW since due to their molecular weight,&#xD;
      Gd-CAs are known to extravasate from the pulmonary circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impedance-based measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach to quantify thoracic fluids relies on transthoracic impedance&#xD;
      measurements. These measurements can be performed non-invasive and continuous, which makes&#xD;
      this a potential interesting monitoring tool for clinical practice to follow the trend of&#xD;
      fluid redistribution towards pulmonary congestion. Previous evidences have shown that a&#xD;
      decrease in thoracic impedance anticipates the need for hospitalization in HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio-impedance spectroscopy (BIS) is multi-frequency spectroscopy impedance measurement&#xD;
      technique. All impedance-based measurements are limited to changes in volume and therefore&#xD;
      need individual calibration to produce accurate absolute volumes. Moreover, several patient&#xD;
      related characteristics, such as adiposity, height, and lung characteristics can also alter&#xD;
      impedance-derived parameters. Therefore, because of the resultant high inter and&#xD;
      intra-subject variability, only relative changes over time are significant. Impedance has&#xD;
      been shown to be sensitive to fluid displacement in response to postural manoeuvres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCE-MRI and BIS provide complementary information. A monitoring strategy based on MRI at&#xD;
      baseline and consecutive follow-up with BIS would satisfy the requirements for a clinically&#xD;
      useful measurement technique that allows to reliably monitor the transition towards&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary congestion even before clinical signs are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to investigate whether changes in intrathoracic volumes&#xD;
      can reliably be quantified by DCE-MRI and BIS measurements. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that such change in thoracic fluid distribution induced by fluid challenges can be detected&#xD;
      in a minimally invasive way by DCE-MRI and by BIS, with agreement between the results of the&#xD;
      two measurement techniques.&#xD;
