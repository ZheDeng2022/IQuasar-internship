    <textblock>
      There is enough scientific evidence of the benefits detection of frailty in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure, which is an important prognostic factor. The usefulness of screening frailty&#xD;
      as flattering tool making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in patients with heart failure&#xD;
      and now emerges in various recent studies. However, it is not found in the literature any&#xD;
      study on the potential effectiveness of a comprehensive intervention on the fragility that&#xD;
      includes the physical section (endurance, strength, flexibility and balance), nutritional,&#xD;
      hormonal (supplementation deficit D vitamin) and pharmacological (adjusted to clinical&#xD;
      guidelines according to requirements) in patients with heart failure after hospitalization&#xD;
      for cardiac decompensation, to improve survival and reduce cardiac decompensation and&#xD;
      hospital admissions resulting in a better quality of life for these patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators designed the following study.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS Comprehensive intervention fragility in patients older than 70 years after&#xD;
      hospitalization for cardiac decompensation improves survival and quality of life of these&#xD;
      patients and reduces decompensation and hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Check if a comprehensive program of frail elderly patients diagnosed with heart failure&#xD;
      improves survival in patients with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improving the quality of life and functional parameters of patients with fragility and&#xD;
           heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Check if a comprehensive program on the fragility reduces the number of emergency room&#xD;
           visits, outpatient specialties involved and hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a randomized intervention study with control group, unpaired,&#xD;
      for a period of up of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be included in a program specifically developed for this study&#xD;
      based on the multidimensional continuous care of patients with heart failure and frailty&#xD;
      diagnosis or prefrailty. A joint interdisciplinary nursing intervention including a physical&#xD;
      part (endurance, strength, flexibility and balance), nutrition (enteral nutritional advice&#xD;
      plus supplements should specify), cognitive (detection and treatment of depression and&#xD;
      delirium in medical consultation) will take, hormonal (Vitamin D supplementation if required&#xD;
      to adjust as guides) (Annex 1), occupational and clinical guidelines pharmacological adjusted&#xD;
      according to requirements (Annex 1), pre-frail older than 70 years fragile patients over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months follow-up after admission for decompensated heart failure, either as&#xD;
      primary or secondary diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be included in a program of quarterly monitoring receiving nutritional&#xD;
      support (nutritional advice plus enteral supplementation should specify), cognitive&#xD;
      (detection and treatment of depression and delirium in medical consultation), hormonal&#xD;
      (supplementation of vitamin D if required with adjustment for guides) (Annex 1) and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment of heart failure and comorbidities adjusted according to recent&#xD;
      clinical guidelines requirements (Annex 1) in over 70 pre-frail and frail patients over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months follow-up after entering for decompensated heart failure, either as&#xD;
      primary or secondary diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the initial recruiting visit will take place during hospitalization, attending&#xD;
      for inclusion to its pre decompensation leading to admission baseline, using the &quot;CSHA&#xD;
      Clinical Frailty Scale&quot; and including patients presenting a score of 4, 5 or 6 in the same&#xD;
      (vulnerable, moderate brittleness and fragility light).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample The University Hospital of Ribera serves a population of 263,006 inhabitants according&#xD;
      to the National Statistics Institute in 2011, of which 13.5% are over 70 years old. Of these,&#xD;
      a prevalence of about 15% fragility of prefrailty 34 and 48.8% of 8-17% is estimated&#xD;
      cardiaca43 failure. It is estimated that 54% of patients over 70 with heart failure are&#xD;
      frail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Has increased accuracy of 5%, maintaining a level of confidence of the study in&#xD;
      95%, with an estimated 12 months 5% of the sample and a ratio of estimated loss of 10%&#xD;
      mortality in size is obtained sample of 476 individuals in total, divided into two groups:&#xD;
      238 in the intervention group and 238 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of patients was performed continuously until the required sample size for the&#xD;
      study, thus ending it after completing one year of follow the last individual recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE Visit 0. Both groups. During the first 72 hours of hospitalization. Delivery of the&#xD;
      patient information leaflet and informed (Annex 3) in the event that consent to be included&#xD;

           possible administrative needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The test variables and scales established for this study (Appendix 2) in the present&#xD;
           moment and discharge were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: 3 months after the visit 1, with a timeframe of three days to adjust for&#xD;
           possible administrative needs.&#xD;
&#xD;

           possible administrative needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables of this study were collected in an Excel table, version 2003 and statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using the SPSS Windows version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables were described as percentages and continuous variables using the mean&#xD;
      value, the standard deviation and confidence interval of 95%. In the bivariate analysis&#xD;
      technique Student's t-Fisher to compare means and Pearson Chi-square and linear tendency&#xD;
      Mantel-Haenszel for comparison of proportions and the Pearson correlation was used for&#xD;
      quantitative variables. Take as the threshold for statistical significance p less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A survival study was performed. The survival will be estimated by the statistical technique&#xD;
      of Kaplan-Meier and to determine differences in survival between groups Mantel-Haenszel test&#xD;
      was used. Variables associated with mortality at 6 months, using a model of Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazards will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties and limitations of the study Being a population-based study of over 70 years,&#xD;
      the main difficulty recruiting, in addition to performing a comprehensive intervention that&#xD;
      includes a portion of physical activity, the investigators have to exclude patients unfit for&#xD;
      its baseline for those years . Another difficulty is the need to find nursing staff trained&#xD;
      to supervise exercises at home and understanding and significance of rating scales and test&#xD;
      for proper completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study are that data from the population sample may not apply to other&#xD;
      Spanish populations. Another limitation is that only patients with fragility will include&#xD;
      established and not prefrágiles, which also could benefit from the program. Failure to have a&#xD;
      system of structured communication with primary care physicians and service &quot;ad hoc&quot;&#xD;
      emergency for this study, may decrease its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Considerations Given the significant number of comorbidities of our patients and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management that entails, will require numerous clinical guidelines for the&#xD;
      proper functioning of the study, which is called in this ANNEX text 1 and Annex 2, will be&#xD;
      provided to the ethics committee on digital media (USB) towards facilitating its valuation.&#xD;
      With regard to informed consent and patient information sheet, be provided in paper and&#xD;
      digital format (USB).&#xD;
