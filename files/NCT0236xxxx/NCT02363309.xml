      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of abnormal liver tests. It is&#xD;
      closely linked to health problems like obesity and diabetes. Researchers want to use a breath&#xD;
      test to measure the metabolism of fatty acids and learn more about the causes of disease.&#xD;
      They will compare the results between people who do and do not have NAFLD. They will also&#xD;
      repeat the test in people with NAFLD after treatment to see improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To measure the metabolism of fatty acids and compare them between people who do and do not&#xD;
      have NAFLD, and people with NAFLD before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People age 21 and older with NAFLD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-NAFLD metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and fasting blood&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fast overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will sit in a comfortable chair. They will relax for 15 minutes. Then a&#xD;
           narrow plastic tube will be put under their nostrils. It will be connected to a breath&#xD;
           test device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will drink palmitate or acetate in a heated liquid meal (Ensure). Palmitate&#xD;
           is a fatty acid and acetate is a small molecule that is a building block for fatty&#xD;
           acids. Both palmitate and acetate are natural compounds that are in our body and our&#xD;
           food.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will sit for 6 hours. They can read, watch television, work on a computer,&#xD;
           or other relaxed activity. The air they breathe out from their nose will be collected&#xD;
           and analyzed. They may take a bathroom break after 3 hours. They may drink water after 3&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get a meal after the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have another visit at least 1 week later. They will repeat the test&#xD;
           with the other compound (acetate of palmitate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may be asked to repeat a test to study the result of a change like weight&#xD;
           loss or medicine. Thus, participation can last from 1 week to several years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD is the most common cause for liver enzyme abnormalities in the western world. It is&#xD;
      estimated to affect approximately 30% of the US population and is closely associated with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and&#xD;
      abnormal function of the adipose tissue is thought to be a major feature of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and NAFLD. Whether fatty acid oxidation is also dysregulated in patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD is unclear. In this study we aim to measure total-body fatty acid oxidation of an oral&#xD;
      fat load using the BreathID breath test device and a meal containing 13C-labeled palmitate.&#xD;
      Results will be compared between patients with NAFLD, healthy controls and patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome but not NAFLD, as well as within NAFLD patients before and after&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
