      Accumulating evidence suggest that the proliferative, invasive, and immune tolerance&#xD;
      mechanisms that malignant tumors use to establish a nutrient supply and evade or edit the&#xD;
      host immune response are similar to those used by the developing placenta during normal&#xD;
      pregnancy. In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both&#xD;
      cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of&#xD;
      both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD11b+Gr1+ cells are a heterogeneous population of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC) that&#xD;
      consist of immature myeloid cells (IMCs), and were first described as myeloid-derived&#xD;
      suppressor cells. In healthy individuals, IMCs that are generated in the bone marrow&#xD;
      differentiate into mature granulocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells (DCs). These cells&#xD;
      have been shown to play an essential role in mediating immune suppression in animal models of&#xD;
      human tumors. As a result of tumor-induced alterations in myelopoiesis, IMCs have been found&#xD;
      in peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and the tumor tissue itself. An increased population of&#xD;
      IMCs was identified in patients with several tumor types. Accordingly, IMCs detected in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood of such patients bearing express the common myeloid marker CD33 but lack&#xD;
      markers of mature myeloid cells such as the MHC class II molecule HLADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMCs have been shown to actively promote tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the&#xD;
      cytokine environment, and through vascular remodeling by promoting angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated in our laboratory that IMCs infiltrate placentas of pregnant mice&#xD;
      and actively promote angiogenesis. These cells show striking similarity to IMCs that populate&#xD;
      malignant tumors. Accordingly, human placentas are also infiltrated by a significant&#xD;
      population of IMCs. Immunostaining of human placentas showed that IMCs comprise around 25% (&#xD;
      range 10-40%) of total placental CD45+ bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells and that this&#xD;
      population is located close to blood capillaries. We also demonstrated that immature DCs,&#xD;
      cells originally described to regulate the adaptive immune response, also promote&#xD;
      angiogenesis in models of choroidal neovascularization, endometriosis and tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study on patient's blood samples of pregnant women who came to&#xD;
      delivery in our department during 1.1.2014-31.12.2014, to compare the abundance of monocytes&#xD;
      and neutrophils in: 1. Term active labor. 2. Elective cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our previous findings, we hypothesize that monocytes in active delivery will be&#xD;
      lower than in women without signs for labor. We also hypothesize that neutrophils will be&#xD;
      more abundant in active delivery than in women without signs for labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to screen anonymous electronic data of women who delivered in our departement during&#xD;
      2014 according to the following eligible criteria, stratified into 2 categories: 1. Women who&#xD;
      were admitted in active labor. 2. Women who were admitted for elective Cesarean Section&#xD;
      without signs of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the abundance of monocytes and neutrophils in blood counts that were taken on&#xD;
      admission day between the two populations.&#xD;
