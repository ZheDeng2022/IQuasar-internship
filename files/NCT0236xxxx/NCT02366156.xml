      This study will evaluate the effects of encapsulated botanical extracts, previously shown to&#xD;
      inhibit the enzyme diacylglycerol-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT-1) in vitro, on fasting and&#xD;
      postprandial lipid metabolism during an oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) in apparently healthy,&#xD;
      overweight and obese adult men and women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medications currently approved for the treatment of obesity act primarily to promote a state&#xD;
      of energy balance - by either suppressing appetite or interfering with lipid absorption in&#xD;
      the small intestine. Similarly, it may be possible to reduce or inhibit the synthesis of&#xD;
      triglycerides (TG) from dietary fat by targeting the activity of&#xD;
      diacylglycerol-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT-1) in the enterocytes of the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DGAT-1 catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of TG and is most abundantly expressed in&#xD;
      the small intestine and adipose tissue. DGAT-1 in enterocytes is critical for assembly of TG&#xD;
      from fatty acids derived from food intake. Ingested dietary fat is cleaved to&#xD;
      monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids by lipases in the gut lumen and these are next taken up&#xD;
      by the enterocytes, where they are re-esterified to TG in the postprandial period. TG is&#xD;
      eventually released into circulation, primarily transported by chylomicrons. Thus, DGAT-1&#xD;
      plays a critical role in the absorption of dietary fat and inhibition of DGAT-1 has been&#xD;
      shown to delay and decrease re-esterification of dietary fats into circulating TG. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that this effect may lead to decreased deposition of excess dietary fat as&#xD;
      adipose tissue, perhaps due to increased fatty acid oxidation in the enterocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential physiological benefits of DGAT-1 inhibition lead to the development of the&#xD;
      potent, selective DGAT-1 inhibitor, AZD7687. Human clinical trials of AZD7687 demonstrated&#xD;
      attenuation of postprandial TG excursions, consistent with inhibition of gut DGAT-1. However,&#xD;
      this compound has limited, if any, therapeutic potential due to profound gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) side effects, particularly diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping which were deemed&#xD;
      intolerable. Moreover, no consistent dose-related treatment effects on body weight, glucose&#xD;
      or lipid metabolism were found in the small trials which were deemed to be non-representative&#xD;
      of the target therapeutic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cell-free and cellular in vitro models have been used to identify botanical extracts&#xD;
      that have potential to inhibit DGAT-1. In a follow-up 7-d parallel arm proof-of-mechanism&#xD;
      human clinical trial, each of four lead ingredients (2 g/d) were evaluated for the ability to&#xD;
      inhibit the intestinal release of dietary fat into circulation following a high-fat meal&#xD;
      challenge using post-prandial TG response as a surrogate marker. Of the four lead botanical&#xD;
      ingredients, whole grape extract (WGE) reduced fasting and postprandial TG levels (total area&#xD;
      under the curve from 0 to 6 h) by ~ 7% to 8% following a high-fat meal challenge. This&#xD;
      demonstration of efficacy, albeit modest, was sufficient to warrant continued exploration.&#xD;
      Importantly, only a few subjects reported very mild GI side effects, primarily bloating, in&#xD;
      this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations of WGE with other botanical extracts possessing biological activity against&#xD;
      supportive secondary mechanisms that might strengthen the overall inhibition of dietary fat&#xD;
      release into circulation and fat deposition were then explored. To examine potential&#xD;
      synergistic interactions, WGE was combined with other ingredients known to act on&#xD;
      complementary biological pathways that converge into a single efficacy outcome; in this case,&#xD;
      cellular TG levels. Ingredients that had effects on both glucose and fatty acid metabolism&#xD;
      that could ultimately synergize with the DGAT-1 pathway were chosen. The complementary&#xD;
      pathway targets chosen for these experiments were Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated&#xD;
      Receptor-gamma Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-Î±) and Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1c&#xD;
      (SREBP1c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cellular DGAT-1 model, grape seed extract (GSE) resulted in a significant inhibition&#xD;
      of DGAT-1 activity when combined with WGE. The combination index (CI), a quantitative measure&#xD;
      of synergy, indicated a strong synergistic effect (CI = 0.61). Synergy occurred at a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio of WGE to GSE, and at ratios that induced no effect on DGAT-1 activity when either was&#xD;
      used alone. The synergy data, together with the proof of mechanism clinical data, forms the&#xD;
      basis for conducting the presently proposed clinical trial at a WGE level below that used in&#xD;
      the previous study.&#xD;
