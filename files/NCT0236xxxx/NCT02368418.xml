      China Rural Health Initiative (CRHI), a large-scale, factorial, cluster-randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial was conducted in 120 villages selected from 5 Northern Provinces of rural&#xD;
      China between 2010 and 2012. Two interventions were evaluated through CRHI. One is the&#xD;
      standard disease management program of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      delivered by Primary Care Providers (village doctors). Another one is a community-based Salt&#xD;
      Reduction program delivered by community health educators. CRHI study interventions had ended&#xD;
      for two years now and provide a good opportunity for us to understand whether its effects&#xD;
      could be prolonged to a longer term. This study wants to evaluate the effects of CRHI&#xD;
      interventions at 2 years after the end of CRHI (from Sep 2014 to Feb 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this follow-up survey, the baseline cohort of 5050 and post-intervention cohort of 4887&#xD;
      CRHI participants who were randomly selected from the 120 villages from 5 northern provinces&#xD;
      of rural China will be recruited for the follow up study from Sep 2014 to Feb 2015. A&#xD;
      questionnaire derived from CRHI baseline and post-intervention surveys will be used to&#xD;
      collect data on disease history, medication use, care seeking patterns, lifestyle factors and&#xD;
      so on. Weight, height, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured in the standard ways.&#xD;

      &quot;1.&quot;Background and Significance Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one global&#xD;
      cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year, a number that is expected to&#xD;
      grow to 23.6 million by 2030. 80% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.&#xD;
      These deaths were usually at younger ages compared to higher income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVD is the leading cause of death in China, responsible for approximately 3.5 million (41%)&#xD;
      deaths in 2012. Reflecting the major contribution of cerebrovascular disease to the vascular&#xD;
      disease burden in China, high blood pressure is the leading modifiable risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and its importance is greatest in rural and northern regions where&#xD;
      high blood pressure,salt consumption and the incidence of stroke are all very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the background above, China Rural Health Initiative, a large-scale, factorial,&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 120 villages selected from 5 Northern&#xD;
      Provinces (Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Ningxia) of rural China between 2010 and&#xD;
      2012. CRHI aimed to develop, implement and evaluate effective, low-cost, and sustainable&#xD;
      interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention and management suitable for widespread&#xD;
      implementation in rural China. Two interventions were evaluated through CRHI. One is the&#xD;
      standard disease management program of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      delivered by Primary Care Providers (village doctors) ('PCP' hereafter). Another one is a&#xD;
      community-based Salt Reduction program delivered by community health educators ('SRS'&#xD;
      hereafter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified randomization was used to assign the villages into 4 groups: PCP only, SRS only,&#xD;
      both PCP and SRS, and usual care (neither PCP nor SRS). For the entire study, there were 60&#xD;
      villages with 'PCP' and 60 villages with 'no PCP' (with or without SRS) and 60 villages with&#xD;
      'SRS' and 60 villages with 'no SRS' (with or without PCP). For the PCP intervention, the&#xD;
      period of intervention was 2 years; and for the SRS, approximately 1.5 years. And both&#xD;
      interventions ended in November, 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk individuals were defined as those meeting any one of the following criteria,&#xD;
      regardless of current medication use:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician-diagnosed history of coronary heart disease or stroke;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older age (50 years or older for men; 60 years or older for women - &quot;50+/60+&quot; hereafter)&#xD;
           and having history of diabetes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older age (50+/60+) and measured SBPâ‰¥160 mmHg A baseline and a post-intervention random&#xD;
           sample surveys (2 independent samples) of older adults (50+/60+), 4800 each, were&#xD;
           conducted in all of the 120 villages before and after the interventions for up to 10 and&#xD;
           12 weeks respectively. In each village at each survey, the survey collected data from 40&#xD;
           consenting age-eligible adults, half men and half women. As a matter of fact, 5050 and&#xD;
           4887 older adults had participated in the baseline and post-intervention surveys&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main results of CRHI showed that the SRS intervention significantly reduced sodium intake&#xD;
      in intervention compared with control villages, and PCP intervention program significantly&#xD;
      improved clinical care of the high risk patients in terms of the use of primary care,&#xD;
      provision of lifestyle advice, use of antihypertensive treatment and use of aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that life style and behavior interventions could have longer term&#xD;
      effect after the end of the study that was designed to evaluate the interventions. For&#xD;
      example, the Daqing study in China showed that intervention effects existed up to 14 years&#xD;
      after the active intervention. The follow up of Trial of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) I and&#xD;
      II study participants, 10-15 years after the sodium reduction intervention trials, found that&#xD;
      the risk of a cardiovascular event was 25% lower among those in the intervention group&#xD;
      (relative risk 0.75, P=0.04), adjusted for trial, clinic, age, race, and sex. CRHI study&#xD;
      interventions, SRS and PCP, had ended for two years now and provide a good opportunity for us&#xD;
      to understand whether its effects could be prolonged to a longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;2.&quot;Aims To evaluate the effects of CRHI interventions, both SRS and PCP, in 2 years after&#xD;
      the end of CRHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;3.&quot;Study Design This is a cohort follow-up survey. The baseline cohort of 5050 and&#xD;
      post-intervention cohort of 4887 CRHI participants who were randomly selected from the 120&#xD;
      villages from 5 northern provinces (Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Ningxia) of rural&#xD;
      China will be recruited for the follow up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for those who died after the CRHI baseline or post-intervention surveys, all CRHI&#xD;
      survey participants should be contacted and informed consent should be obtained. The reasons&#xD;
      for not in contact or not in response should be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire derived from CRHI baseline and post-intervention surveys will be used to&#xD;
      collect data on disease history, medication use, care seeking patterns, lifestyle factors and&#xD;
      so on. Weight, height, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured in the standard ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;train the trainers&quot; model is used to train the survey interviewers. Only the&#xD;
      interviewers who have passed the tests can participate in the field investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field investigation will be carried out from September 2014 to February 2015 in 5&#xD;
      Northern Provinces above. After confirming the identity and obtaining the informed consents&#xD;
      from participants, interviewers will begin to collect information. The standard operating&#xD;
      procedures will be developed and followed during the whole process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcomes will be mean systolic blood pressure level among all&#xD;
      participants and those at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (among all participants and high-risk patients) include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals regularly visiting the village clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals receiving lifestyle advice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals treated with a blood pressure lowering agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals treated with aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals having knowledge on salt reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals using low sodium salt&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals adopting healthy behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of individuals developing CVD event&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;4.&quot;Quality control Intensive discussions on protocol and standard operating procedures were&#xD;
      made during the design phase of the study. And only the interviewers who have passed the&#xD;
      tests can participant in the field investigation. Moreover, all instruments including&#xD;
      sphygmomanometers and weight scales will be purchased and calibrated centrally. In the&#xD;
      investigation field, all interviewers will apply the standard questionnaire and follow the&#xD;
      standard operating procedure. Double entry will be used for data entry and all analysis will&#xD;
      be validated by an independent data analyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;5.&quot;Ethics review and human subject protection The project will be reviewed by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Peking University Health Science Center in Beijing, China. Written consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from all participants in the research. All participants will be free to quit&#xD;
      from the study at any time with no explanation required. The risk of participating in the&#xD;
      study is minimal.&#xD;
