  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35 years and is a major public&#xD;
      health concern. Fortunately, the natural history of this malignancy can be beneficially&#xD;
      improved through cytological screening. However, the success of screening programmes depends&#xD;
      on their ability to attract the &quot;at risk&quot; population, as well as the analytical sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of the screening test. In the UK, screening consistently falls short of the&#xD;
      80% national target and recent evidence shows uptake is decreasing, in part due to the&#xD;
      introduction of HPV vaccination programmes. In the under 30s London population, average&#xD;
      coverage only reached 50% in 2013. Given this information, the cervical screening programme&#xD;
      is under increasing pressure to improve uptake, and need an evidence based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to improve the uptake of cervical screening using SMS messaging through a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial. The trail will evaluate both the prevalent and incident rounds of screening&#xD;
      and within the intervention group, analyse how the content of text reminders influences their&#xD;
      effectiveness. Specifically we will evaluate a) neutral b) messenger c) social norms d)&#xD;
      framed gain/loss reminders. Unlike our previous trial, this SMS reminder will encourage the&#xD;
      booking of an appointment which has never been tested, rather than simply reminding women to&#xD;
      attend. All women being invited for cervical screening, registered at participating GPs&#xD;
      within Hillingdon will be eligible to participate. Women will also be provided with a 2 week&#xD;
      window during which they can opt out of the research. Given the sample sizes we predict the&#xD;
      trial will take 9 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Hillingdon specifically, where this randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be set, the&#xD;
      uptake of the prevalent population of women (24-29 years as a proxy), was only 35% in 2012,&#xD;
      whilst the incident population (30-64years as a proxy) was slightly higher at 51% (HSCIC2,&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy which healthcare has previously employed to improve uptake of both screening and&#xD;
      routine appointments is the use of SMS or &quot;text message&quot; reminders. Standard reminders have&#xD;
      often been used in healthcare and act as &quot;primers&quot;, prompting people to make healthier&#xD;
      choices (Blumenthal-Barby &amp; Burroughs, 2012). They also serve to reduce the practical&#xD;
      barriers preventing women from attending i.e. failure to book or remember the time/location&#xD;
      of the appointment. Previous research investigating the effectiveness of appointment&#xD;
      reminders demonstrated that both telephone and postal reminders, although at times effective,&#xD;
      were often impractical, unsustainable, and/or unaffordable (Gurol-Urganci et al, 2013, Perron&#xD;
      et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMS interventions have been effective at improving medication adherence, disease management&#xD;
      and smoking cessation (Krishna et al, 2013; Abroms et al, 2014). They have also proven&#xD;
      effective at reducing &quot;Do Not Attends&quot; (DNAs) within healthcare, estimated to cost the NHS&#xD;
      Â£600 million per year in wasted time and resources (Dr Foster Research, 2009). SMS reminders&#xD;
      were also found to be very successful at increasing the attendance of breast screening&#xD;
      appointments, increasing the uptake by 17% compared to usual care (Kerrison et al, 2013). As&#xD;
      well as improving attendance, SMS reminders have also proved effective at reducing costs,&#xD;
      increasing the efficiency of clinics, enabling more effective booking, reducing mismatches&#xD;
      between demand and capacity, and generally helping to increase productivity within&#xD;
      healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMS interventions have many benefits over alternative mediums. Firstly an SMS is cheap,&#xD;
      roughly 3p per text whilst a letter can cost 10 times that. SMS is also capable of reaching&#xD;
      the recipient wherever they are whilst letters can only be delivered to recipients last known&#xD;
      address. This is particularly important, as people are more likely to retain their mobile&#xD;
      numbers nowadays even if they change address, especially in London where the population is&#xD;
      notoriously mobile. Mobile phone use is also ubiquitous in the UK, with a recent report&#xD;
      estimating that over 99% of adults in London owned a mobile phone in 2013 (Ofcom, 2013).&#xD;
      Another advantage of SMS is that there is evidence that people increasingly use electronic&#xD;
      day planners and therefore a message direct to a person's phone encourages people to promptly&#xD;
      record appointments and even allowing them to set alarms creating their own reminder. SMS&#xD;
      interventions would therefore be as wide reaching as a postal intervention (if not more so)&#xD;
      at a fraction of the cost and with greater accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previous evidence provides a sound rationale that SMS interventions have great&#xD;
      potential for cervical screening, there is still a considerable amount of information&#xD;
      required in order to introduce this intervention as standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research also aims to evaluate whether minor differences in wording affect women's&#xD;
      response to these messages. This idea stems from &quot;Nudge&quot; theory, a form of Libertarian&#xD;
      Paternalism or &quot;Asymmetric Paternalism&quot; (Thaler and Sunstein, 2003). This concept is derived&#xD;
      from a mix of cognitive psychology and behavioural science which is based on the principal&#xD;
      that humans, due to a lack of information, experience, cognitive ability and self-control,&#xD;
      often fail to act in a way that promotes their own welfare (Sunstein and Thaler, 2003).&#xD;
      Libertarian paternalisms therefore encourages individuals to act in their, and/or societies,&#xD;
      best interests whilst maintaining freedom of choice (Aggarwal et al 2014). Although the use&#xD;
      of &quot;nudge&quot; has been viewed as controversial within healthcare by some, this study has&#xD;
      justified its use by avoiding any form of coercion, and making it clear that this text is&#xD;
      simply a reminder of the normal invitation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is mounting evidence demonstrating that even small changes in the content and framing&#xD;
      heavily influences people decisions (Haynes et al, 2013; Hallsworth et al, 2014). Whether the&#xD;
      positive effects of small wording changes or &quot;nudging&quot; is reflected in women's attitudes&#xD;
      towards cervical screening programs has yet to be evaluated. This information will be crucial&#xD;
      in order to maximise efficiency of this intervention and knowledge gained could be applied to&#xD;
      similar interventions in healthcare making them more cost effective. We also hope to evaluate&#xD;
      whether people with different levels of deprivation respond differently to the different&#xD;
      messages. This is hugely important, as tailoring the message to the population is crucial to&#xD;
      improving the efficiency of the intervention and to reduce health inequalities within London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of this evidence we have chosen seven different text message options, all of which&#xD;
      have according to research great potential to improve the uptake of screening. These include&#xD;
      a control of no text message, a neutral reminder and five reminders with behavioural messages&#xD;
      to prompt uptake. The intervention arms according to research have great potential to improve&#xD;
      the uptake of screening. It is well established that reducing the effort required to perform&#xD;
      an action increases the likelihood of follow-through (Leventhal et al, 1965).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All text messages begin with the test message, followed by a standard reminder message that&#xD;
      is constant across the messages and the participants GP practice phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen messages are no text message, a neutral message; a messenger; two social norms; a&#xD;
      gain frame and a loss frame highlighting the benefits of cervical screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutral Reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neutral message will not &quot;nudge&quot; but simply remind the woman to book a cervical screening&#xD;
      appointment, acting as a direct reminder of the letter invitation sent out as normal&#xD;
      practice. It will act as a control for the other types of message.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Messenger Reminder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some evidence suggests that people respond better to invitations from their personal practice&#xD;
      rather than a centralised NHS organisation (Segan et al, 1998; Arbyn et al, 2010). This is&#xD;
      especially true of young women, immigrants, urban residents and those with low socioeconomic&#xD;
      status, which are key demographics we hope to improve uptake in through this intervention&#xD;
      (Bosgraaf et al, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;GP NAME&gt;: Your cervical smear test is due. To book please call &lt;xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Norms Messages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social norms messages focus on the principal that people have a tendency to overestimate the&#xD;
      extent to which their peers perform acts, causing themselves or others harm. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests educating people about the actual degree to which people perform these acts can&#xD;
      alter behaviour (Perkins et al, 2002). This theory, combined with the fact that people are&#xD;
      strongly influenced by comparison to what others do will hopefully prompt women to take up&#xD;
      the offer of cervical screening. We have also chosen to use a local statistics as&#xD;
      personalised messages have a greater influence as they increase the relevance of the message&#xD;
      to the women (Institute for government: Cabinet Office, 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Social Norms (local, proportion) reminder:&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot;Last year in Hillingdon 7 out of 10 women took part in cervical screening. Your&#xD;
           cervical smear test is due. To book please call &lt;xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Social Norms (local, total number) reminder:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Last year 12000 women in Hillingdon took part in cervical screening. Your cervical smear&#xD;
      test is due. To book please call &lt;xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gain and Loss Frame Messages&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role gain and loss frame messengers to encourage uptake of good health behaviour is not&#xD;
      entirely clear. Some evidence points to humans having &quot;have a stronger aversion to losses&#xD;
      than we do affinity to gains&quot; therefore highlighting losses may have a greater impact&#xD;
      (Blumenthal-Barby &amp; Burroughs, 2012). On the other hand a meta-analysis found that gain frame&#xD;
      was more likely to be effective in changing prevention behaviour. (Gallagher, 2001). To&#xD;
      evaluate this further a gain and loss frame message were included above. Statistics included&#xD;
      in these messages were taken from (Peto, 2004) and correlate to widely used statistics on&#xD;
      cancerscreening.nhs.uk to maintain consistency with other information women might be seeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gain frame&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot;Cervical cancer screening saves 4500 lives in England every year. Your cervical smear&#xD;
           test is due. To book please call &lt;xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Loss frame&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Failing to attend cervical screening could lead to 4500 avoidable deaths in England each&#xD;
      year. Your cervical smear test is due. To book please call &lt;xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL ETHICAL ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main ethical issue is that in order to analyse the data, the researcher will need to&#xD;
      access minimal amounts of patient data. The researcher will specifically need to access a&#xD;
      list of women in Hillingdon who are sent an invitation to cervical screening on a weekly&#xD;
      basis, if they are registered with a consenting GP. All participating GPs (which to date&#xD;
      include over 85% of those approached for the trial) have consented to share relevant data&#xD;
      with the research team and are happy with the safeguards put in place to protect&#xD;
      confidentiality. These include NHS secure emails, password protection on all patient data,&#xD;
      anonymisation of data (identifiable by NHS number only) and strict adherence to all NHS&#xD;
      information governance regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this list, each participant will be identified by their NHS number, and this will be the&#xD;
      only unique identifier. The researcher will also need information about their age (not date&#xD;
      of birth), participants &quot;attended/not attended status&quot; at the end of the 18 week follow up&#xD;
      period and the GP practice code, to ensure we only include women registered with consenting&#xD;
      GPs. We would also like to access the second half of participants' postcode to allow for a&#xD;
      basic deprivation analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before accessing this information we will offer women the option to opt out of the research&#xD;
      and therefore not share this data or receive a text message reminder. This will be achieved&#xD;
      by the cervical screening (call-recall) team adding an insert on behalf of the GP, into the&#xD;
      screening invitation letter to all eligible women. This insert will provide informed consent&#xD;
      slip and contact details of the researcher if women would like further information. They will&#xD;
      have 2 weeks to respond and be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an extension of this research, the trial will also investigate how variations in the&#xD;
      wording of the text messages affect uptake. This wording has been carefully selected with the&#xD;
      guidance of the NHS Cervical Screening Program (NHSCSP) as well as Public Health England&#xD;
      psychology experts and any data within the text messages is up to date and sourced from the&#xD;
      NHSCS.&#xD;
