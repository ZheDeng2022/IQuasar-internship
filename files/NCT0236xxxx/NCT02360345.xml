  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-centre dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial of ONX-0801.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate two schedules of ONX-0801 concurrently: once weekly and alternate&#xD;
      week dosing, of repeated 28-day treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two stages: the dose escalation phase, in which the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose will be determined; and the expansion phase, in which up to 30 patients will be&#xD;
      treated at the recommended phase II dose and schedule to further support the design of&#xD;
      subsequent trials of ONX-0801.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the dose escalation phase, patients will be enrolled alternately to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a q1wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days&#xD;
           1, 8, 15 and 22 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 1 mg/m2&#xD;
           for the first cohort; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a q2wk schedule in which ONX-0801 will be administered over a 1-hour IV infusion on Days&#xD;
           1 and 15 of repeated 28-day treatment cycles; the starting dose will be 2 mg/m2 for the&#xD;
           first cohort;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3 patients will receive ONX-0801 at escalating doses on each schedule until a Dose&#xD;
      Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) occur and an Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined for each&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule has been established, additional&#xD;
      patients may be recruited in a dose expansion phase to a maximum total of 30 patients to&#xD;
      further characterize safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics. This subgroup of patients&#xD;
      will be limited to those expected to have high rates of over expression of α-FR, such as&#xD;
      patients with ovarian or endometrial, cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 66 patients with solid tumours will be entered into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation: Approximately 18 patients in each schedule in the dose escalation phase. The&#xD;
      final number for the dose escalation phase will depend on the number of dose escalations&#xD;
      required to reach DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion: Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase, and this&#xD;
      cohort will be enriched with patients with tumour types expected to have high rates of over&#xD;
      expression of α-folate receptor, including ovarian and endometrial cancer. A minimum of 20&#xD;
      patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will be enrolled.&#xD;

             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception&#xD;
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or&#xD;
