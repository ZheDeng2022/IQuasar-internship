  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with moderate-to-severe Dry Eye by symptoms will be screened including history,&#xD;
      ophthalmic examination to include the status of their ocular structure and function and&#xD;
      evaluation of tear production. Blood will be blood drawn for complete blood count and&#xD;
      chemistry panel. They will also have a urinalysis and pregnancy test in women of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a two week &quot;run-in&quot; period in which they use artificial tears. If their&#xD;
      Dry Eye signs and symptoms do not improve significantly, they will be enrolled and will&#xD;
      receive study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation includes assessment of the structure and function of the eyes including&#xD;
      retina examination and corrected visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two treatment arms, ST266 or &quot;artificial tears&quot; eye drops. The randomization scheme is 1:1&#xD;
      ST266:artificial tears. Subjects will self-administer their eye drops four times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen in the office of the ophthalmologist/optometrist at baseline (week&#xD;
      zero), one week, three weeks, six weeks and ten weeks. Eye examination will be done at each&#xD;
      visit. The baseline eye tests and lab work will be repeated after the treatment phase of the&#xD;
      study at the end of week six. Following 6 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for 4 additional weeks.&#xD;

      Subjects with moderate-to-severe Dry Eye judged by symptoms will be screened following&#xD;
      signing of informed consent. Screening will involve history and physical examination&#xD;
      including ophthalmic examination with dilated fundus exam to assess the status of their&#xD;
      ocular structure and function, and evaluation of tear production and damage caused by&#xD;
      clinically significant Dry Eye. Blood will be blood drawn for complete blood count, chemistry&#xD;
      panel including serum glucose, blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function&#xD;
      studies including total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase&#xD;
      (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), albumin, and total protein. They will also have a&#xD;
      urinalysis. Pregnancy test will be performed in women of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a two week &quot;run-in&quot; period in which they use artificial tears. Those&#xD;
      subjects in whom corneal staining is 2 or more (on a scale of 0-4), Dry Eye symptom score on&#xD;
      the OSDI is 25-75 after two weeks of using artificial tears four times per day, and&#xD;
      laboratory test results within the accepted ranges will be enrolled and will receive study&#xD;
      drug, Those subjects in whom dry eye symptoms improve sufficiently (OSDI drops below 25)&#xD;
      and/or corneal staining is reduced from 2 or more to less than 2, or have laboratory test&#xD;
      results outside the accepted ranges will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation includes assessment of the structure and function of the eyes including&#xD;
      conjunctival and corneal tissues. Corrected visual acuity will be measured at every visit.&#xD;
      Patient comfort will be assessed after administration of the study drug and at every visit. A&#xD;
      retina examination will be performed before and after the treatment period. Slit lamp exam&#xD;
      including the cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, eye lids and lashes will be&#xD;
      performed at every visit. Special testing will include fluorescein staining of the cornea,&#xD;
      lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva, endothelial cell analysis, Schirmer tear&#xD;
      production, and intraocular pressure measured on all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two treatment arms, ST266 or &quot;artificial tears&quot; eye drops. ST266 and artificial tears eye&#xD;
      drops will be supplied by Stemnion, and both personnel and subjects will be trained in its&#xD;
      use. The treatment will be prepared in a coded container such that the subject and physician&#xD;
      are masked as to the treatment. One treatment arm will receive ST266 eye drops in both eyes&#xD;
      and the other treatment arm will receive artificial tears eye drops in both eyes. Treatment&#xD;
      arms will be assigned by random. The randomization scheme is 1:1 ST266:artificial tears.&#xD;
      Subjects will self-administer their eye drops four times each day. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      keep a study diary of when they place the study medication in their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen in the office of the ophthalmologist/optometrist at baseline (week&#xD;
      zero), one week, three weeks, six weeks and ten weeks. Eye examination will be done at each&#xD;
      visit. Each subject will complete a patient questionnaire on their symptoms of Dry Eye. The&#xD;
      baseline eye tests and lab work will be repeated after the treatment phase of the study at&#xD;
      the end of week six. Following 6 weeks of treatment, the subjects will be followed for 4&#xD;
      additional weeks.&#xD;
