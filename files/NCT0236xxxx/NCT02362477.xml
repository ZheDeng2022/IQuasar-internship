  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate objective of this project is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a&#xD;
      telemental health modality (video-teleconferencing) for providing an evidence-based group&#xD;
      intervention to female rural veterans, Reservists, National Guardsmen, and civilians&#xD;
      suffering with PTSD. This study is an expansion, seeking to add a treatment arm of women, to&#xD;
      an already CDMRP-funded study that completed in July 2014 treating male combat veterans with&#xD;
      military-related PTSD. The long-term objective of this project is to disseminate an&#xD;
      empirically sound TMH PTSD protocol for male and female veterans, Reserve and Guard that will&#xD;
      extend the use of CPT to remote rural sites. It is hypothesized that using VTC, will be as&#xD;
      effective as the in-person mode of service delivery for providing CPT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This expansion is a 4-year RCT, plus a 1 year no-cost extension, which provides a direct&#xD;
      comparison of the VTC and in-person modalities using rigorous methodology and a sophisticated&#xD;
      analysis of treatment equivalency in clinical and process outcome domains. Outcome domains&#xD;
      include clinical and process outcomes. Approximately 154 female veterans, Reservists,&#xD;
      National Guardsmen, or civilians with PTSD have been recruited from multiple VA clinical&#xD;
      sites and community health centers (for N=110 completers). Consistent with the male combat&#xD;
      veterans CPT study, prospective participants received a comprehensive assessment battery at&#xD;
      baseline to determine eligibility. The exclusion criteria selected are consistent with large&#xD;
      PTSD randomized clinical trials as well as research using the CPT protocol with military&#xD;
      populations with PTSD. The treatment is delivered up to twice a week for up to 12 weeks by a&#xD;
      doctoral level psychologist. Quality control procedures have been incorporated into the&#xD;
      study's design to ensure integrity, fidelity and standard administration of the CPT&#xD;
      intervention across both conditions. It is expected that the results from this project can be&#xD;
      applied to other VA and military locations, where similar specialized PTSD clinical services&#xD;
      are needed but unavailable due to geographic barriers.&#xD;
