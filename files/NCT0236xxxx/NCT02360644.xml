      This study investigates the effect of vitamin D deficiency on drug metabolism and transport&#xD;
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that vitamin D concentrations independently affect metabolism and&#xD;
      transport function in CKD patients. An over-arching goal of this proposal is to make drug&#xD;
      therapies safer and more effective to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      patients with CKD.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of vitamin D deficiency and repletion on xenobiotic&#xD;
      clearance in vivo. The study will mechanistically evaluate the function of major pathways of&#xD;
      metabolism and transport by prospectively studying clearance phenotypes utilizing &quot;probe&quot;&#xD;
      drugs commonly used for this purpose in CKD patients and healthy volunteers under vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient and replete states. Bupropion, midazolam, olmesartan, fexofenadine, in addition to&#xD;
      an endogenous probe (N-methylnicotinamide), will be used to phenotype major phase I drug&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes [cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5)], and&#xD;
      transporters [multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and&#xD;
      multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1/2K (MATE1/2K)], respectively. Hypothesis: The in vivo&#xD;
      function of individual pathways of xenobiotic metabolism and transport are affected by&#xD;
      vitamin D status (and CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine the effect of CKD on the in vivo function of individual CYPs&#xD;
      responsible for vitamin D metabolism and the pharmacokinetics of cholecalciferol (vitamin&#xD;
      D3). The research will prospectively measure the activity of CYP450s responsible for&#xD;
      cholecalciferol metabolism, and simultaneously evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      cholecalciferol after single- and multiple-dose administration to CKD patients (stages 1-5)&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers. Hypothesis: CKD alters the activity of individual CYPs responsible&#xD;
      for vitamin D metabolism, leading to modified clearance of cholecalciferol.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of Arm 1 is to determine the effect of vitamin D deficiency and repletion on xenobiotic clearance in vivo. The study will evaluate the in vivo function of targeted metabolism and transport pathways in 40 CKD and 18 healthy volunteer subjects (controls) under the influence of a vitamin D depleted state and repeated under a vitamin D replete state with cholecalciferol.&#xD;
The function of two major phase I drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP3A), and three transporters [P-gp, MRP2, and MATE1/2K] will be assessed by administering oral bupropion, midazolam, olmesartan, and fexofenadine.</description>
