  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept study aims to assess in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis if&#xD;
      polymeric microparticles reach the pilosebaceous follicles of inflamed skin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments of inflammatory skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis or atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis are primarily topical. They have the advantage of allowing the administration of&#xD;
      active substances directly to the skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However local treatments may have drawbacks (complex application, local and/or systemic side&#xD;
      effects...) and cause poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of drug carriers is viewed as one of the most promising strategies to target and&#xD;
      control the release of active substances to various skin sites. Polymeric microparticles have&#xD;
      shown to have a better stability and a more sustained release pattern than other types of&#xD;
      drug vehicles such as liposomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results obtained in our preclinical experiments, this proof of concept study&#xD;
      aims to assess, in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, if biodegradable polymeric&#xD;
      microparticles reach the pilosebaceous follicles of inflamed skin which would in turn serve&#xD;
      as a reservoir of active substance.&#xD;
