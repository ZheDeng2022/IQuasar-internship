  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled pilot trial to investigate the feasibility of a&#xD;
      driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy compared to the ARDS Clinical&#xD;
      Network strategy (conventional strategy) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury. Driving&#xD;
      pressure is the difference between plateau pressure and PEEP. Evidence from observational&#xD;
      studies suggests that elevated driving pressure is the main independent determinant of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury, however clinical trials are needed to establish whether&#xD;
      targeting low driving pressures can improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, ART2pilot is a multicenter randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to assess the feasibility of a driving pressure limited mechanical ventilation strategy&#xD;
      compared to the ARDS Clinical Network strategy (conventional strategy) in patients with ARDS.&#xD;
      Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of ARDS&#xD;
      of less than 72 hours duration. We will exclude patients with less than 18 years old;&#xD;
      contraindication to hypercapnia such as intracranial hypertension or recent acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome; patients in which a high probability of death within 24 hours is anticipated and&#xD;
      patients under exclusive palliative care. Eligible patients will be randomized to the driving&#xD;
      pressure limited ventilation strategy or ARDSNet strategy. The primary outcome is driving&#xD;
      pressure between days 1 and 3.&#xD;

    <description>We will use volume controlled ventilation or pressure support in the weaning phase. We will adjust tidal volume between 3 and 8 mL/Kg of predicted body weight in order to achieve a driving pressure of 13 cmH2O. The respiratory rate will be titrated to achieve a pH between 7.30 and 7.45 (maximum respiratory rate is 50 breathings per minute). We will not limit plateau pressure in this arm.</description>
