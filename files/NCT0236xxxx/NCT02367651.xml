  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib monotherapy is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency, and other regulatory authorities worldwide for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced renal cell carcinoma and patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who&#xD;
      received prior chemotherapy. Based on the improved progression-free survival and sustained&#xD;
      responses observed in a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that pazopanib may have a role in a maintenance setting for STS in maintaining&#xD;
      the initial response to chemotherapy and delaying the need for further treatment at relapse&#xD;
      and its associated toxicity and impact on health-related quality-of-life. This Phase 2,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate maintenance therapy with&#xD;
      pazopanib versus placebo in subjects with advanced or metastatic STS who have not progressed&#xD;
      after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Approximately 188&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with pazopanib 800&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) daily or placebo. Study completion will be the point at which 70% of&#xD;
      randomized subjects have died. Once a subject has objective evidence of disease progression,&#xD;
      the subject will be managed as per standard practice by their physician. Subjects will&#xD;
      continue to be followed for second progression, health related quality of life, survival&#xD;
      until study completion, withdrawal of consent, or early termination of the study.&#xD;
