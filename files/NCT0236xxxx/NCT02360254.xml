      Rationale. Degludec is a longer-acting insulin analog compared to glargine and detemir. In a&#xD;
      fraction of type 1 diabetic patients, insulin glargine and insulin detemir may not achieve&#xD;
      24h coverage, reflected by raising pre-dinner glucose levels when they are administered at&#xD;
      bedtime. As up-titration of bedtime long acting insulin increases risk of nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, this clinical problem can be addressed by an additional injection of in the&#xD;
      morning. These type 1 diabetic patients may benefit from shifting from twice daily insulin&#xD;
      glargine/detemir to once daily insulin degludec, which shows an extended activity over 24h,&#xD;
      up to 48h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To evaluate the effects of shifting from twice daily insulin glargine or detemir&#xD;
      to once daily insulin degludec on HbA1c and glucose profiles in type 1 diabetic patients&#xD;
      during a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Observational analytic prospective study. Protocol. Type 1 diabetic patients on&#xD;
      twice daily insulin glargine or detemir (because of pre-dinner hyperglycemia due to supposed&#xD;
      glargine/detemir coverage &lt;24h) will be identified and enrolled. During a run-in period of 1&#xD;
      week, the investigators will collect data on HbA1c values as IFCC/DCCT-aligned and on glucose&#xD;
      profiles using glucose meters. Patients will undergo a 7-14 day continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      before and eventually during (additional 7-14 days) the shift from twice to once daily basal&#xD;
      insulin. Patients will be re-assessed 12 weeks after initiation of insulin degludec with&#xD;
      determination of HbA1c and 7-14 day continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;

      Scientific background In type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin therapy is a pivotal requirement,&#xD;
      in order to achieve and maintain a satisfactory glycaemic control, as well as for the&#xD;
      survival of the patient. Attaining a good glycaemic profile also allows limiting the impact&#xD;
      of acute and chronic complications. Indeed, it is demonstrated that the maintenance of HbA1c&#xD;
      levels as close as possible to 7% (53 mmol/mol), or even lower, can help in preventing or&#xD;
      delaying the development of chronic complications. According to International Diabetes&#xD;
      Federation (IDF) statements, the HbA1c target for young people with type 1 diabetes should be&#xD;
      6.5% in order to ensure a longer life free from complications. Pursuing this HbA1c goal&#xD;
      should possibly be achieved without excess incidence of hypoglycaemia, which can compromise a&#xD;
      patient's autonomic reactivity and represents a barrier to good glycaemic control. For this&#xD;
      reason, patterns of insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes are intended to reproduce as close as&#xD;
      possible the physiological endogenous insulin secretion, both in tonic (baseline) and phasic&#xD;
      (prandial) states. This objective is typically achieved through the basal-bolus scheme, by&#xD;
      subcutaneous administration of rapid-acting insulin analogue at the 3 main meals, and 1 or&#xD;
      more injections of long-acting insulin that supplies inter-prandial and nocturnal&#xD;
      insulinization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally the long-acting insulin should ensure a duration of 24 hours and be administered once&#xD;
      a day. Long acting insulin analogues glargine and detemir are being used in type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
      Clinical experience suggests that in a certain percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes,&#xD;
      when administered at bedtime (h22.00), both glargine and detemir have a duration of less than&#xD;
      24 hours, which is manifested by an increase in blood glucose during the late afternoon&#xD;
      (h17.00-20.00) resulting in pre-dinner hyperglycaemia, a phenomenon that plays regularly on&#xD;
      different days or may be inconsistent owing to day-by-day variations in absorption. This&#xD;
      issue in the clinical management of type 1 diabetes, also known as &quot;sunset phenomenon&quot;, does&#xD;
      not have a unique solution and still represents an &quot;unmet clinical need&quot;. Possible approaches&#xD;
      to address the sunset phenomenon include: (1) the control of capillary BG at h16.00-17:00&#xD;
      with eventual administration of an extra shots of rapid-acting insulin to correct the&#xD;
      tendency to hyperglycaemia; (2) the use of a second long-acting insulin injection (usually at&#xD;
      breakfast or lunch) in addition to that of the evening; (3) the replacement of the ultra-fast&#xD;
      insulin at lunch with a pre-mixed insulin containing a mix of rapid-acting and&#xD;
      protamine-bound intermediate-acting insulin; and (4) the transition to insulin pump therapy&#xD;
      (CSII).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all these approaches have limitations: (1) patients may not be able to control daily&#xD;
      capillary BG in the afternoon, and are anyhow still subject to an additional injection; (2)&#xD;
      the two doses of long-acting insulin can overlap, exposing the patient to an increased risk&#xD;
      of hypoglycaemia at other times during the day, being the patient nevertheless subject to an&#xD;
      additional injection; (3) using pre-mixed insulin, the variations of the ultra-fast insulin&#xD;
      dose according to pre-lunch BG and carbohydrate intake also involves proportional changes in&#xD;
      intermediate insulin fraction, entailing the risk of hyper- or hypoglycaemia; and (4) insulin&#xD;
      pump therapy is costly, requires long therapeutic education and special efforts by the&#xD;
      patient, and is not suitable for all patients with type 1 diabetes. The choice of one of&#xD;
      these approaches is carried out at the discretion of physicians, in order to be&#xD;
      individualized for specific patient's needs. It is therefore reasonable that the search for&#xD;
      other strategies to address the sunset phenomenon should be pursued, in a way which could be&#xD;
      more effective, safe and convenient for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our Centre, one common solution to the sunset phenomenon issue for patients not eligible&#xD;
      for the insulin pump therapy is a twice-daily administration of long-acting insulin analogue&#xD;
      glargine or detemir. Indeed, the use premixed insulin does not fit well with the flexibility&#xD;
      required for the therapy of type 1 diabetes, whilst an extemporaneous bolus administration is&#xD;
      often inconstant, making identification of this phenotype of patients more difficult. The use&#xD;
      of twice-daily administration of long-acting insulin is currently estimated in 20-25% of&#xD;
      patients, while the use of premixed only represents 5-10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin Degludec is a new generation ultra-long acting insulin analogue which has been&#xD;
      developed by Novo Nordisk A/S and recently marketed with the trade name of TresibaÂ®. It has&#xD;
      been approved by the Regulatory European Agency (EMA) for subcutaneous use in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and is currently available in some European countries, including Italy,&#xD;
      England, Germany, and Switzerland (EMA/689592/2012; EMEA/H/C/002498).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular modifications in insulin degludec monomer include the addition of a hexadecanoyl&#xD;
      chain of fatty-diacid to Lysine-29 in B-chain (B29), and the deletion of Threonine at B30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degludec is a basal insulin that forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection,&#xD;
      resulting in a depot from which insulin degludec is continuously and slowly absorbed into the&#xD;
      circulation leading to a flat and stable glucose-lowering-effect of degludec (see figure 1).&#xD;
      During a period of 24 hours with once-daily treatment, the glucose-lowering effect of&#xD;
      degludec, in contrast to insulin glargine, was evenly distributed between the first and&#xD;
      second 12 hours. Thus, the duration of action of degludec is beyond 42 hours within the&#xD;
      therapeutic dose range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase 3 clinical trials involving patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin degludec showed&#xD;
      similar glycaemic control in terms of HbA1c, but with a significant reduction in&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia rates, especially at night, compared to glargine. This can also be explained by&#xD;
      the lower day-to-day within-subject variability rate of insulin degludec respect to glargine.&#xD;
      Given the longer duration of action of degludec, the timing of administration can be more&#xD;
      flexible than glargine and detemir. As a result, it has been reported that the quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with type 1 diabetes can significantly improve with insulin degludec use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) allows a nonstop BG level monitoring over 24&#xD;
      hours for up to 7 days. This tool can help patients to better understand how their food&#xD;
      intake, physical activity and medications affect blood sugar levels, often giving them the&#xD;
      possibility to better manage diabetes. Many CGMS devices have alarms that indicate when BG&#xD;
      levels are going to be above or below a predetermined level. Devices are also equipped with a&#xD;
      small glucose sensor inserted subcutaneously in the abdomen, which detects interstitial&#xD;
      glucose levels every 5 minutes and sends a wireless signal to a terminal that can be easily&#xD;
      applied to the belt or held in the pocket. When used in blind mode, CGMS recordings are only&#xD;
      accessible to the diabetologist, but not to the patient, thereby allowing doctors to early&#xD;
      detect problems in glycaemic trends (both hypo- or hyperglycaemic) 7 days of patient's normal&#xD;
      daily life. It has been demonstrated that CGMS is capable of detecting hyper- or&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic trends normally unidentifiable by the traditional SMBG provided by a&#xD;
      glucometer. These systems are thus a valuable scientific and clinical support to define in&#xD;
      greater detail 24-h glycaemic profiles, and represent the gold-standard for the evaluation of&#xD;
      basal insulin efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Purpose The present study aims to evaluate whether switching from an insulin&#xD;
      regimen with twice-daily administration of long-acting insulin glargine / detemir (in&#xD;
      combination with ultra-fast acting insulin analogue at main meals) to insulin degludec&#xD;
      administration once-a-day can improve 24-h glucose profiles (from CGM) and glycaemic control&#xD;
      (HbA1c and FBG) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus which are in suboptimal glycaemic&#xD;
      control (baseline HbA1c &gt;6.5%). Since the present research protocol was inspired by a&#xD;
      clinical problem without a conclusive solution (unmet clinical need), that is the sunset&#xD;
      phenomenon, it was not considered appropriate to provide a control group by randomization to&#xD;
      insulin degludec vs. continuation of the previous insulin regimen. This protocol represents&#xD;
      therefore an observational prospective study. A pseudo-control group will be created by&#xD;
      including those patients who are not willing to shift from twice daily glargine/detemir to&#xD;
      once daily degludec, and by the same patients of the &quot;degludec group&quot; observed in the 3&#xD;
      months before changing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plausibility and clinical relevance Results of phase 3 clinical trials investigating insulin&#xD;
      degludec in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus have shown that a treatment&#xD;
      regimen characterized by the use of once-daily insulin degludec vs. once-daily glargine, in&#xD;
      association with the same rapid-acting inulin analogue at meals, results in a similar&#xD;
      glycaemic control in HbA1c, with significantly lower frequency of hypoglycaemia in degludec&#xD;
      arms. Patients with the sunset phenomenon, taken as representative sample of our Centre, show&#xD;
      HbA1c average levels of approximately 8-8.5% despite therapy with twice daily administration&#xD;
      of glargine or detemir. Therefore, it can be expected that the transition to a regimen with&#xD;
      once-daily ultra-long acting insulin degludec could improve glycaemic control, as well as&#xD;
      24-h profiles, without increase in hypo rates. This question is of particular clinical&#xD;
      relevance, because will be addressed in the context of everyday clinical practice and not in&#xD;
      a randomized-controlled trial. To date, there is scarcity of CGMS derived data on the&#xD;
      efficacy of insulin Degludec. Therefore, the present study has the potential to better&#xD;
      clarify the benefits of this new basal insulin.&#xD;
