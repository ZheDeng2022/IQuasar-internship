      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new approach to increase HIV testing among young&#xD;
      adult Black, Hispanic, and white men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). In this randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial, participants will be assigned to one of three HIV testing groups: (1) rapid&#xD;
      HIV self-testing group (OraQuick® In-home HIV Test), (2) conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV&#xD;
      testing group (Home Access Express), and (3) community/medical-based HIV testing group. Upon&#xD;
      completion of testing, participants will receive a questionnaire to evaluate their HIV&#xD;
      testing experience, and also inquire about recommendations for future testing. Study&#xD;
      participants will also have the option to refer other study eligible males to the study via&#xD;
      email.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adult (18-24-year-old) Black, Hispanic, and white men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) have&#xD;
      among the highest incidences of new HIV infections in the US yet have low HIV testing rates.&#xD;
      Access, cost, time, and concerns about confidentiality are some of the barriers that limit&#xD;
      these men from being tested at traditional medical/community-based testing sites. A new US&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration-approved rapid HIV self-test (OraQuick® In-home HIV Test) might&#xD;
      encourage and facilitate HIV testing because of its widespread access, convenience, ease of&#xD;
      usage, oral fluid collection system, privacy, and rapid provision of test results. Despite&#xD;
      these advantages, the investigators do not know if the new rapid HIV self-test will be&#xD;
      preferred over medical/community-based or conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV testing, and if it&#xD;
      will serve as a means of improving HIV testing use among young adult MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine if testing uptake is higher in a rapid HIV&#xD;
      self-testing group than in a conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV testing group and a&#xD;
      community/medical-based testing referral group; (2) determine if time to initiation of HIV&#xD;
      testing is shorter in the rapid HIV self-testing group, as compared to the other two&#xD;
      participant groups; (3) determine if participants are more willing to contact and refer other&#xD;
      young adult MSM to this study to use a rapid HIV self-test vs. a conventional &quot;home-based&quot;&#xD;
      HIV test, or vs. a community/medical-based HIV test; (4) determine if those referred for&#xD;
      rapid HIV self-testing are more likely to enroll in the study, have a higher uptake of&#xD;
      testing, and have a shorter time to initiate HIV testing than those referred for conventional&#xD;
      &quot;home-based&quot; HIV test, or a community/medical-based HIV test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is comprised of three stages, the first of which is closed. In Stage I of this&#xD;
      study, the investigators surveyed a large sample of MSM social-networking website users and&#xD;
      assessed their acceptance, facilitators/barriers to use, utilization, preferences, and&#xD;
      opinions regarding the new rapid HIV self-test, as compared to conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV&#xD;
      testing or medical or community-based HIV testing. Of the participants enrolled in Stage I,&#xD;
      150 Black, 150 Hispanic, and 150 white MSM will be invited to participant in Stage II of this&#xD;
      study. In this randomized, controlled trial, participants will be assigned to one of three&#xD;
      HIV testing groups: (1) rapid HIV self-testing group (OraQuick® In-home HIV Test), (2)&#xD;
      conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV testing group (Home Access Express), and (3)&#xD;
      community/medical-based HIV testing group. Participants assigned to the rapid and&#xD;
      conventional HIV testing groups will receive an internet-based coupon to order a free HIV&#xD;
      testing kit from a specified pharmacy's website that will be delivered to the address of&#xD;
      their choosing. The rapid HIV self-test kit and the conventional &quot;home-based&quot; HIV test kit&#xD;
      contain all materials and instructions needed to conduct an HIV test. Participants assigned&#xD;
      to the community/medical-based HIV testing group will receive a link to a CDC website&#xD;
      (https://gettested.cdc.gov) that allows them to search for HIV testing locations of their&#xD;
      choice. Participants in all three groups will receive an email explaining that the&#xD;
      investigators are measuring uptake and time to testing among study participants. They will&#xD;
      also be informed that the investigators will contact them after they have been tested to ask&#xD;
      for their opinions regarding their testing experience. At the end of Stage II, participants&#xD;
      will have the opportunity to refer other young adult MSM to the study via email. Referral&#xD;
      participants will encompass Stage III of the study. Stage III participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to the same testing group as the individual who referred them. Confidentiality will be&#xD;
      maintained throughout all three stages of this study.&#xD;

    <description>The participant will utilize materials and directions contained within the Home Access Express HIV-1 Test System to properly perform a conventional home-based HIV test. The participant is required to gather a blood sample by lancing his finger. Blood samples are collected by placing drops of blood on a packaged specimen card. The participant will then mail his blood sample to the Home Access laboratory using a self-addressed, pre-paid shipping envelope. The Home Access laboratory will process the blood sample, and the participant is required to call the facility to learn his HIV test result.</description>
