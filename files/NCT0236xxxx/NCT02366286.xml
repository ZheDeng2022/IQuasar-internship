  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States&#xD;
      (US) is relatively low. However, immigrant populations in the US from Asia and sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa have substantially higher prevalence than the general population and are consequently&#xD;
      at a significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed, the age-adjusted incidence&#xD;
      rates for HCC in the US have tripled from 1975 to 2005. As the population demographics have&#xD;
      changed, the 2000 US census estimated the number of Somalis in Minnesota at 25,000 but&#xD;
      current estimates put the number at around 50,000 due to primary refugee arrivals as well as&#xD;
      secondary immigration from other states. There is no available data for Somali immigrants in&#xD;
      the US on HBV and HCV prevalence, HBV and HCV genotypes/subgenotypes, and genetic and&#xD;
      immunologic risk factors predisposing Somalis to HBV and HCV and the subsequent development&#xD;
      of HCC. Therefore. this study will fill these gaps in the Somali population to understand the&#xD;
      relative importance of HBV and HCV infections in causation of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides Somalis, Minnesota is also home to large other African immigrant communities.&#xD;
      According to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), in 2013, the highest rates of chronic&#xD;
      HBV cases where reported among Asian or Pacific Islanders (3,638 cases per 100,000 persons)&#xD;
      followed by Black or African Americans (2,078 cases per 100,000 persons). Additionally,&#xD;
      Minnesota receives a large number of new refugee's resettlement. It is important to improve&#xD;
      the identification of chronic HBV and HCV infections among Somali refugees and immigrants in&#xD;
      Minnesota through well-designed community-wide screening efforts. Since we know that African&#xD;
      immigration to Minnesota is the third highest in the US, this unique population might be a&#xD;
      contributing factor to the increased burden of hepatitis and liver cancer complications in&#xD;
      the state of Minnesota. Findings from HBV and HCV screening among Somalis suggest that other&#xD;
      immigrant African populations from high viral hepatitis endemic regions, such Ethiopia,&#xD;
      Liberia, and Kenya, are also at substantial risk of HBV, HCV and HCC. Unfortunately, very&#xD;
      little research has been conducted in the US on the burden of hepatitis and liver cancer in&#xD;
      African Immigrants from areas of high endemicity of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Therefore,&#xD;
      the goal of is to identify HBV and HCV and the role viral genetics and immune response among&#xD;
      African immigrant communities from Kenya, Liberia, and Ethiopia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: We will determine whether exposures to HBV and HCV infections in African&#xD;
      (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and Ethiopians) and Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese,&#xD;
      Laotian, and Cambodian) are associated with a single HBV/HCV genotype or few specific&#xD;
      subtypes. In the following Sub-Aims we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  confirm the viral status of study subjects using serological and DNA tests including&#xD;
           HBsAg, HBcAb, anti-HCV, HBV DNA and HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform nucleic acid testing to identify the HBV and HCV genotypes/sub-genotypes for&#xD;
           each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine the presence of either common or unique HBV and HCV viral mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: We will determine whether African (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and&#xD;
      Ethiopians) and Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian) exposed to HBV or&#xD;
      HCV have unique TLR or Treg immune signatures as compared to control subjects free from both&#xD;
      HBV and HCV infections. In the following Sub-Aims we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure the expression levels of toll-like receptors (in monocytes) of the host innate&#xD;
           immune response to assess whether the expression of TLR differs between those exposed to&#xD;
           HBV vs HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure the circulating Tregs of the host adaptive immune response to determine whether&#xD;
           the abundance of Treg differs between those exposed to HBV vs HCV Specific Aim 3: To&#xD;
           determine whether genetic variation of IL28B (assessed by single nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphisms, rs12979860 and others) is associated with HCV treatment outcome in&#xD;
           Somalis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will perform SNP analysis of IL28B in lymphocyte DNA in 60 HCV cases, 60 HBV and HCV&#xD;
           cases and 60 healthy controls (this group and additional 60 HBV cases alone will provide&#xD;
           baseline SNP frequencies in the Somali population), all the 240 subjects of the study&#xD;
           will be tested for this SNP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will measure treatment outcome using virological response by comparing pre-treatment&#xD;
           viral load and post-treatment viral load in HCV case&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To recruit a cohort of African (Somalis, Kenyans, Liberians, and Ethiopians) and&#xD;
      Southeast Asian (Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian)immigrants for screening for&#xD;
      chronic HBV infection and education on prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. We will&#xD;
      specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish a community-based program to recruit African and Southeast Asian individuals&#xD;
           in Minnesota for screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish partnerships with African and Southeast Asian community organizations and&#xD;
           physicians to enhance screening and education about prevention and treatment of&#xD;
           hepatitis B, hepatitis C and its sequelae, including HCC.&#xD;
