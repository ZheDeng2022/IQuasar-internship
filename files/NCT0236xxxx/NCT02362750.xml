      The Evaluating Cancer Survivorship Care Models project is an innovative 3-year study that is&#xD;
      collecting data to help understand how to best deliver follow-up care to cancer survivors.&#xD;
      Cancer is a complex disease requiring complex treatments that can cause lasting impacts after&#xD;
      treatment ends. Some patients face physical, psychosocial, spiritual and/or practical&#xD;
      challenges as they adjust to life after cancer. Fortunately, health care providers have begun&#xD;
      to focus on the consequences of cancer and its treatment and are more actively working with&#xD;
      cancer survivors to manage post-treatment needs and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Led by the George Washington University and funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research&#xD;
      Institute, this project brings together representatives from the Commission on Cancer, the&#xD;
      Cancer Support Community, LIVESTRONG and the American Cancer Society as well as cancer&#xD;
      survivors and healthcare professionals to better understand how different strategies or&#xD;
      models of care impact outcomes that are most important to cancer survivors. The project will&#xD;
      focus on survivors of breast, prostate and colorectal cancers and will be relevant for&#xD;
      understanding the needs and preferences of survivors of other cancers as well. The emphasis&#xD;
      is on patient-centered outcomes, which are outcomes that are most significant to patients,&#xD;
      such as patient satisfaction and quality of life.&#xD;

      Evaluating Cancer Survivorship Care Models Study Overview and Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer is a complex disease requiring complex treatments that can cause lasting impacts after&#xD;
      treatment ends. Some patients face lasting physical, psychosocial, spiritual and/or practical&#xD;
      challenges as they adjust to life after cancer. Fortunately, health care clinicians have&#xD;
      begun to focus on the consequences of cancer and its treatment and are more actively working&#xD;
      with cancer survivors to manage post-treatment needs and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluating Cancer Survivorship Care Models project is a groundbreaking 3-year comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness research (CER) study that examines how to best deliver follow-up care to cancer&#xD;
      survivors. This project is led by the George Washington University and funded by the&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. A key component of the project is the use of a&#xD;
      stakeholder Advisory Board chaired by a cancer survivor who serves as a senior advisor to the&#xD;
      research team. The Advisory Board includes survivors, survivor advocates, clinicians, health&#xD;
      care professionals and advisors from stakeholders across myriad facets of cancer care,&#xD;
      including the Cancer Support Community, LIVESTRONG, the Commission on Cancer, and the&#xD;
      American Cancer Society. These organizations are critical to the success of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is innovative in its focus on patient-centered outcomes. The first phase of the&#xD;
      project employed a mixed methods approach including a secondary analysis of existing data&#xD;
      from 4 national surveys, focus groups with cancer survivors, an environmental scan of&#xD;
      existing survivorship programs and a national survey of cancer survivors to develop an&#xD;
      outcomes tool and a prospective observational CER study. Based on results from the first&#xD;
      phase, the study team at the George Washington University (GW) developed a&#xD;
      patient-prioritized index to identify services and components of care that patients equate&#xD;
      with high quality survivorship care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three models of survivorship care at Commission on Cancer-accredited institutions were&#xD;
      identified through the environmental scan. In the CER phase of the study, each survivorship&#xD;
      care model will serve as a comparator for the other two models. Patients in the CER study&#xD;
      population will be adults who have been diagnosed with non-metastatic breast, prostate or&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and completed active treatment. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      at three points in the project: at baseline (immediately prior to and immediately following a&#xD;
      post-treatment survivorship visit), 3 months post-visit and 6 months post-visit.&#xD;
      Multivariable analyses including repeated measures and mixed-effect regression modeling will&#xD;
      be used to control for systematic differences across the groups, which would further increase&#xD;
      the validity of our results. Using the newly-developed index, the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      study will measure the quality of programs according to what patients have identified as most&#xD;
      important to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have launched the CER phase of the study and are enrolling high-performing&#xD;
      survivorship programs. Our pool of invited participants consists of Commission on&#xD;
      Cancer-accredited sites with clinical survivorship care programs that meet the following&#xD;
      eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide services to survivors of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have demonstrated a high performance level on incorporating elements of survivorship&#xD;
           care into clinical care delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  See at least 60 new survivors yearly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Includes the most common characteristics related to delivery of survivorship care&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the CER study, data will be gathered from survivorship program administrators,&#xD;
      patients and survivorship care clinicians. Survivorship program administrators will complete&#xD;
      an interview and survey to examine how survivorship programs are organized and identify key&#xD;
      characteristics of programs to determine which factors are most influential in delivering&#xD;
      high quality post-treatment survivorship care. Patients will complete surveys measuring&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes: health-related quality of life; self-efficacy; satisfaction;&#xD;
      health care utilization and a newly developed measure of quality of survivorship care as&#xD;
      prioritized by patients. Clinicians will complete surveys on the services offered during&#xD;
      participating patients' initial post-treatment survivorship visit. Together, this data will&#xD;
      allow the GW study team to understand successful strategies for transforming the care&#xD;
      delivery system to be more responsive to patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third and final phase, this project will generate critical data for a variety of&#xD;
      decision-makers related to care for post-treatment cancer survivors and will result in&#xD;
      evidence-based guidance for how to organize and deliver post-treatment care. The GW study&#xD;
      team seeks to provide recommendations on survivorship care delivery best practices; develop&#xD;
      tools for improving survivorship programs and care delivery from both clinician and patient&#xD;
      perspectives; and to widely disseminate findings to a variety of stakeholders, including&#xD;
      survivors and their families, clinicians, survivorship care program leaders, payers,&#xD;
      policymakers and others.&#xD;

        Phase 1 of our study focused on developing instruments to conduct comparative effectiveness&#xD;
        research. The investigators analyzed three large national studies of cancer survivors;&#xD;
        conducted focus groups across the country with adult survivors of breast, prostate or&#xD;
        colorectal cancer; surveyed Commission on Cancer accredited institutions regarding&#xD;
        provision of survivorship care and surveyed a nationally representative sample of adult&#xD;
        cancer survivors. In phase II, the investigators will conduct surveys with survivorship&#xD;
        program leaders at eligible Commission on Cancer accredited institutions; adult survivors&#xD;
        of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer; and the survivorship program clinicians providing&#xD;
        their care.&#xD;
