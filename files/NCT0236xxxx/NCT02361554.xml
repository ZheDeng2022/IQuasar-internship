  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of&#xD;
      the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in subjects with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      schizophrenia. There is a subset of patients with schizophrenia who continue to have&#xD;
      persistent psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations and delusions) despite multiple&#xD;
      adequate medication trials with antipsychotic medications including clozapine. There are&#xD;
      currently no available treatments for such patients who generally have poor function and are&#xD;
      chronically disabled, unable to work, live independently or have meaningful social&#xD;
      relationships. Neuroimaging studies in patients with schizophrenia have revealed information&#xD;
      about pathological neural circuits that could be suitable targets using deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation. Although not yet tested in patients with schizophrenia, DBS is in early phase&#xD;
      clinical trials in other psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will investigate the use of DBS in treatment-resistant schizophrenia&#xD;
      subjects who have exhausted all other therapeutic alternatives but continue to have&#xD;
      persistent disabling psychotic symptoms. Of note, DBS is not FDA approved for use in patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. The method will be similar to that used in subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      stimulation in patients with Parkinson's Disease. However, the electrode will be advanced&#xD;
      slightly inferior into the SNr, a major outflow nucleus of the basal ganglia, with the&#xD;
      intention of causing local inhibition of SNr outflow resulting in disinhibition of the&#xD;
      mediodorsal nucleus (MDN) of the thalamus. Hypofunction of the MDN has been implicated in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia in post-mortem as well as multiple structural and functional&#xD;
      imaging studies. Evidence suggests that dysfunction of the MD is implicated in both positive&#xD;
      and cognitive symptoms (such as working memory impairment) in schizophrenia. Frequent&#xD;
      monitoring and clinical assessment with psychiatric scales will be used to monitor treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females who are at least 22 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a diagnosis of schizophrenia as determined by a review of medical records,&#xD;
             discussion with referring psychiatrist as well as the Structured Clinical Interview&#xD;
             for DSM-IV (SCID-IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject determined to be treatment-resistant for at least one year prior to the&#xD;
             Screening Visit as demonstrated by clinical evidence (determined by review of medical&#xD;
             records and discussion with referring psychiatrist) of persistent auditory&#xD;
             hallucinations and/or delusions that have not responded to treatment with three&#xD;
             adequate regimens of antipsychotic medication including one failed trial of clozapine&#xD;
             as defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adequate trials of two different antipsychotic drugs (not including clozapine)&#xD;

                  mg/day of chlorpromazine within the previous 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A trial of clozapine of at least12 weeks at a dose of at least 400 mg (or a&#xD;
                  clozapine level of at least 350 ng/mL). Subjects who were unable to tolerate&#xD;

             confound the results of the study, or pose risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
