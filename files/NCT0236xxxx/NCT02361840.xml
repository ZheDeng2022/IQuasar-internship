      Shock is one of the five leading causes of income and mortality in emergencies. It generates&#xD;
      a decrease in the availability of oxygen to the tissues, resulting in ischemia, pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement and tissue reperfusion syndrome. This pathologies can trigger Syndrome of Acute&#xD;
      Respiratory Distress (ARDS) and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponin I (TI) has been reported as early marker for ischemia and mortality other than&#xD;
      coronary syndromes in critical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. Set the increase of TI as a predictor of ARDS in children with shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis. Increase serum in children with shock predicts the onset of ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. Prospective cohort type test diagnostic. Displays institutional. Sampling&#xD;
      non-probability, consecutive inclusion. Calculation of the sample size: interval of&#xD;
      confidence (IC) 95%, power - 80%; ratio non-exposed: exposed 2:1; n = 62.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: informed consent signed by the parent; children admitted to pediatric&#xD;
      emergency (PEU) 1 month to 14 years with shock requiring mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: intake of toxic (TI value increment per will), ≥3 concentrated&#xD;
      erythrocyte transfusion or plasma prior to entering PEU.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION The purpose of the present study is to establish a Troponin I (TI) in peripheral&#xD;
      blood as a prognostic indicator in the emergence of the syndrome of acute respiratory&#xD;
      difficulty (ARDS) in children with shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that both shock and ARDS are life-threatening disease and one can trigger&#xD;
      another (shock first then ARDS or ARDS then shock). Both involve abnormalities in blood flow&#xD;
      (perfusion) tissues that leads to cellular stress, reduction of oxygen suplly (hypoxia),&#xD;
      nutrients, consenquently generating an increase in tissue´s metabolic demands. This set of&#xD;
      events is called ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shock is a dynamic clinical syndrome of acute and complex circulatory dysfunction, caused&#xD;
      by severe illness or trauma. To perpetuate itself generates multiple organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      death. Regardless of its cause, it is conceptualized as a state of acute oxygen deficiency&#xD;
      that prevents cell sustainability. The shock is one of the five leading causes of admission&#xD;
      to emergency Pediatrics unit (EPU) of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara &quot;Fray Antonio&#xD;
      Alcalde&quot; (HCFAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock is the second cause of mortality in patients in the EPU. ARDS is an acute and diffuse,&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammatory lesion characterized by increased pulmonary vascular permeability,&#xD;
      weight and the decrease ventilation on the lung tissue. The specific clinical elements are&#xD;
      hypoxemia and bilateral radiographic opacities associated with increases in the mixture of&#xD;
      venous blood, physiological dead space and reduction of the pulmonary compliance. Diffuse&#xD;
      alveolar damage is the morphological element that is in the acute phase (e.g. swelling,&#xD;
      inflammation, hyaline membrane or bleeding). It has a mortality rate of 30-50% in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TI is a protein that is determined in blood only under pathological conditions; mainly&#xD;
      increases when there is myocardial ischemia. It was used in the first instance to diagnose&#xD;
      acute coronary syndromes as ischemia, coronary angina pectoris and acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been documented increase of TI in patients in critical condition without coronary&#xD;
      disease, mainly in individuals with sepsis, septic shock, hypovolemic shock and children with&#xD;
      respiratory failure by respiratory syncytial virus; in addition, has interpreted as a&#xD;
      prognostic marker for mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TI seems to anticipate the clinical signs of events persistent with hypoxia that may lead to&#xD;
      ischemia. The elevation of serum levels of TI indicate myocardial damage, but they do not&#xD;
      explain the underlying mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of ARDS shock generates a troubling circumstance. However, not all children&#xD;
      presentig shock develop ARDS; so it is necessary to predict ARDS or diagnose it in its&#xD;
      earliest stage; This will impact on the implementation of strategies to avoid the severe form&#xD;
      of the disease. With this foundation the investigators propose to use TI as a prognostic&#xD;
      indicator of ARDS in children with shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate our hypothesis we conduct a study of dynamic and prospective cohort, type&#xD;
      diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exposed cohort is represented by children with shock that took TI increased during&#xD;
      follow-up; of these patients was analyzed ARDS (event) who presented with TI high&#xD;
      (exhibition) and those who develop ARDS with normal TI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine a sample peripheral blood in the first 24 hours, taken from infants who presented&#xD;
      shock without ARDS joining EPU sign consent of the parents who accepted the participation of&#xD;
      children in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative results of the sample are obtained by ELISA test sandwich with&#xD;
      immunofluorescence, carried out in the Emergency Robotic laboratory of Robotics of the HCFAA.&#xD;
      The investigators will monitor patients daily for 7 days; the data obtained will be&#xD;
      documented on the blog for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators determine as exposure to the increase of TI with a serum value equal or&#xD;
      greater than 0. 05ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe the development of ARDS event . The diagnosis of ARDS will be&#xD;
      established in those children who met the criteria specified in the definition of Berlin for&#xD;
      ARDS in 2012, within seven days after the onset shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis plan will consist in each case and as a whole, establish initial&#xD;
      comparability of groups, will estimate the magnitude of the effect through partnership and&#xD;
      finally, the investigators will make adjustments to the potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will begin with descriptive statistics and will apply the Shapiro (for&#xD;
      being a small sample) test to determine the normality of the distribution of the variables&#xD;
      that define the type of statistical analysis to follow (parametric or free distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Chi2 allows the comparison of proportions and risks for qualitative variables. Will use&#xD;
      R Pearson or Spearman Rho tests to establish correlations between quantitative variables.&#xD;
      Test Student's T or Mann-Whitney (according to the found data distribution) U will be used&#xD;
      for the comparison of independent medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will consider significant value of p &lt; 0.05.The estimate of the magnitude&#xD;
      of the effect was carried out through determination of relative risk (RR) and absolute risk&#xD;
      reduction (ARR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical research studies are represented by cross-sectional studies, cases and&#xD;
      controls, cohort and clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TI diagnostic test, we will calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
      negative predictive value, probability indexes and elaborate COR (Receiver Operating&#xD;
      Characteristic) curve for optimum cutting of TI (quantitative variable expressed in ng/ml) to&#xD;
      determine the approach of sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUESTION OF RESEARCH Does the increase in Troponin I serum in children with shock in&#xD;
      Emergency Room can predict ARDS? General Objective. Establish increase TI value as a&#xD;
      predictor of ARDS in children with shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives. 1. To determine the incidence of children with shock that develops ARDS.&#xD;
      2. Establish correlation of TI with ARDS by Kirby oxygenation index. 3. To determine the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of TI in ARDS in children with shock. 4. Establish the serum&#xD;
      prognostic value of TI for ARDS in children with shock The sample size Calculated sample size&#xD;
      for study of prospective cohort with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, 80% power. Exposed&#xD;
      non-exposed 2:1 relation. Probability of occurring event in the cohort exposed 72% and 32% in&#xD;
      the unexposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators obtained 41 patients for unexposed cohort and 21 exposed are required to&#xD;
      observe differences. Total number of 62 patients (n=62).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated through the Epi Info version 7 of the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Population was taken from the room of Emergency Pediatric Unit (EPU) of the&#xD;
      Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde (HCFAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent signed by the parent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children admitted to EPU of the HCFAA of 1 month old to 14 years old showing shock with&#xD;
           less than 24 hour evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Intake of toxic tricyclic antidepressants, cocaine and methamphetamines 2. Transfusion&#xD;
      three or more concentrated erythrocyte / plasma before entering EPU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Pregnant girls 4. Children with a previous diagnosis of uremic kidney injury. Criteria of&#xD;
      elimination&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Parents or legal guardians of patients requesting to leave the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does not have gas analysis with lactate at the time of final categorization as shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The investigators included children with shock, categorized by instrument of&#xD;
      Pediatric assessment consisting of General assessment, primary, secondary and tertiary&#xD;
      assessment triangle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors who performed the final categorization of patients are pediatrician or pediatric&#xD;
      residents certified under the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart&#xD;
      Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians were trained to one hour in pediatric evaluation and management of the instrument&#xD;
      prior their participation. For this purpose, the instrument was the admission of Hospital&#xD;
      Triage sheet. The possibilities of categorization initial pathophysiological according to the&#xD;
      triangle of General evaluation are as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stable (three parts of the normal triangle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Disfunction of Central Nervous System or metabolic (abnormal appearance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Shortness of breath (abnormal breathing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Respiratory failure (abnormal breathing with abnormal color or appearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Shock (abnormal color)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiorespiratory failure / imminent death (three parts of abnormal triangle) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after categorization was a primary evaluation;was performed corresponding of a&#xD;
      placement of monitor and measurement of vital signs, as well as evaluating and giving an&#xD;
      A-B-C-D-E type treatment: air-permeable (A), control and management of the breath (B),&#xD;
      circulation (C), identification of neurological Deficit (D) and (E) exhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the laboratory studies requested in the tertiary evaluation, held gases in arterial&#xD;
      blood lactate measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the children meet the inclusion criteria, they entered the cohort study. One mililiter of&#xD;
      blood sample from the first 24 hours of the onset of shock was collected in a special tube&#xD;
      containing anticoagulant and specially marked with a purple lid by its manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples were taken to the emergency laboratory of the HCFAA within 10 minutes of&#xD;
      obtaining them, they were processed using ELISA test sandwich by immunofluorescence using the&#xD;
      reagent Enzyme Immunoassay for the Quantitative Determination of Cardiac-Specific Troponin-I&#xD;
      in Human Serum (cTnI) ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were reported by the laboratory within 30 minutes after delivery, reported as&#xD;
      cardiac Triage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of TI is expressed as it is within range when the value is less than 0. 05ng/ml&#xD;
      and high or out of range when the value is equal to or greater than 0. 05ng/ml. Once obtained&#xD;
      the results, were added to the document in the protocol's log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke ECG and Echocardiogram was performed to all patients, conducted by an MD.,&#xD;
      Pediatrician Certified Cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were followed for 7 days from the entry to the cohort. The investigators have&#xD;
      described as exposure for this cohort, TI ≥0. 05ng/ml increase and consider the development&#xD;
      of ARDS, according to the definition of 2012 Berlin, even the latter constituted a measuring&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no conflict of interest. Equipment and reagent for the determination of TI were&#xD;
      obtained through public tender by the officer of Administrative Hospital Subdirector of&#xD;
      HCFAA.&#xD;
