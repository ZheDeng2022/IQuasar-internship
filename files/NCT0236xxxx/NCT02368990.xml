      The aim of the study is to collect real world information on patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed after first line treatment&#xD;
      with an approved Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitor (TKI), who are known to be T790M positive and have&#xD;
      been prescribed second line platinum-based chemotherapy (Pemetrexed + Cisplatin&#xD;
      /Carboplatin).&#xD;

      The study is an observational prospective cohort study that plans to enroll approximately 200&#xD;
      patients worldwide. There are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations known to be&#xD;
      associated with EGFR-targeted TKI sensitivity ( Ex19Del, L858R, L861Q, and G719X). Further&#xD;
      tests on biopsied tissue or cytology at progression after treatment with an approved EGFR&#xD;
      targeted TKI are used to determine positivity to T790M mutation. Primary objectives of the&#xD;
      study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate disease progression (as assessed and defined by physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate time on treatment by line of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe time to subsequent therapies (or death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe healthcare resource utilization patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To capture patient reported symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality of life&#xD;
           (HRQoL) data using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of&#xD;
           Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ-C30) and European Organisation for&#xD;
           Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 items&#xD;
           (EORTC QLQ-LC13)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the use of pemetrexed + cisplatin/carboplatin as the 2nd line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe treatment patterns for 3rd line treatment and beyond&#xD;
