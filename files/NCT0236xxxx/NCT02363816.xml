    <textblock>
      Weight gain, hypertension, high cholesterol and sugar abnormalities in childhood are strongly&#xD;
      linked and predict the risk of further complications and early death in adulthood. The newer&#xD;
      antipsychotics, called the second generation antipsychotics are commonly used to treat mood&#xD;
      disorders in adult and pediatric populations. Their use has substantially increased (up to&#xD;
      5-fold) in the past 15 years in children due to their approved use by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration and higher acceptance in the general medical community. However, second&#xD;
      generation antipsychotics are known to have very damaging side effects that cause children to&#xD;
      gain substantial amounts of weight, have high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high sugar&#xD;
      levels. Despite the known risks their use is still needed and may be contributing to the high&#xD;
      rates of obesity-related diseases in childhood and ultimately shorter life-spans in&#xD;
      adulthood. How second generation antipsychotics cause these side effects is still not well&#xD;
      known. Preliminary evidence has identified a novel pathway that may be associated with second&#xD;
      generation antipsychotic side effects. This pathway has not been studied, is involved in&#xD;
      vitamin A metabolism and is called the beta-carotene pathway. Beta-carotene is an important&#xD;
      part of our diet because it acts as an anti-oxidant (fights harmful oxidative stress in the&#xD;
      body) and it produces the active form of vitamin A which is essential for several processes&#xD;
      in our body. The investigator's work has identified a backup in this pathway which the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize is due to genetic variation of the enzymes found within this&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that genetic variation in the beta-carotene pathway is&#xD;
      responsible for the side effects associated with second generation antipsychotics. The&#xD;
      investigators want to complete a cross-sectional, pilot study in the pediatric population&#xD;
      that will be used for future prospective, extramural applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose two aims for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine how second generation antipsychotics change beta-carotene metabolism. For&#xD;
      this aim, the investigators hypothesize that high beta-carotene:retinoic acid ratios will be&#xD;
      due to genetic varition in the beta-carotene pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Define the relationship between beta-carotene metabolism, oxidative stress and second&#xD;
      generation antipsychotic induced insulin resistance. For this aim the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that low beta-carotene levels will be associated with high oxidative stress&#xD;
      levels and insulin resistance.&#xD;
