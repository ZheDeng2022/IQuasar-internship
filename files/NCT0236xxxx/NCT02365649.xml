    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Endoscopic Remission at Week 12/16</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 16. (At Baseline, subjects were allocated by randomization 1:1 to have their end of induction colonoscopy done at either Week 12 or Week 16; this endpoint combines the two time points.)</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic remission was determined using Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD).&#xD;
SES-CD subscores assess the following: presence and size of ulcers in 5 visualized bowel segments; extent of ulcerated surface in 5 visualized bowel segments; extent of affected surface in 5 visualized bowel segments; presence and type of narrowings in 5 visualized bowel segments. Subscores range from 0 to 15, and are summed for a total SES-CD score ranging from 0 to 56; higher scores indicate greater severity of mucosal inflammation. Endoscopic remission: SES-CD ≤ 4 and at least 2-point reduction versus Baseline and no subscore &gt; 1 in any individual variable. Modified intention to Treat (mITT) Population: all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug in the Induction Period. Non-responder imputation.</description>

    <description>Clinical remission: average daily stool frequency ≤ 1.5 and not worse than Baseline AND average daily abdominal pain ≤ 1.0 and not worse than Baseline. The very soft/liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain scores at a visit were the average of the daily values reported during the 7 usable days preceding the scheduled assessment visit. Abdominal Pain was rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). mITT Population: all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug in the Induction Period.&#xD;

    <description>CDAI is used to quantify the signs and symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. The score includes the frequency of stools, abdominal pain and general well-being as well as the presence of complications, use of antidiarrheals, presence of abdominal mass, hematocrit and weight. CDAI generally ranges from 0 to 600 where higher scores indicate more severe disease. A score below 150 indicates remission.&#xD;
