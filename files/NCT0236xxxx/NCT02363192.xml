  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK, approximately one in every 40 have severe&#xD;
      asthma that needs the maximum available treatments advised in national asthma guidelines&#xD;
      (known as the 'British Thoracic Society / Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network British&#xD;
      Guideline on the Management of Asthma'). Despite this, asthma is still inadequately&#xD;
      controlled in about half of these patients and they are classed as having 'difficult asthma'.&#xD;
      There maybe potential for improvement of the care and health of these patients through better&#xD;
      use of medicines and greater input from pharmacists, but more research is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to measure the effects over six months of coordinated information and&#xD;
      advice about medicines from hospital and community pharmacists on asthma control in patients&#xD;
      with difficult asthma. The patients in the study (52 in total) will be recruited from adult&#xD;
      patients attending a specialist difficult asthma clinic in a hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly chosen to have either an appointment with the specialist pharmacist&#xD;
      (intervention group), or usual medical care (control group). Usual care will involve seeing&#xD;
      the Consultant or Specialist Registrar (doctor) in the clinic. Patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive i) assessment and education on asthma, and review of their inhaler&#xD;
      technique, from a hospital Advanced Clinical Pharmacist and ii) will also be referred for a&#xD;
      medicines use review from their usual community pharmacist (chemist), to take place 1-2&#xD;
      months after their hospital clinic appointment. The Advanced Clinical Pharmacist will be&#xD;
      working closely with the Consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be measured using methods that have been developed by experts in asthma and&#xD;
      tested in previous research. Asthma control will be measured using Juniper's Asthma Control&#xD;
      Questionnaire. Other measurements will cover quality of life, use of medication, use of&#xD;
      healthcare resources, and inhaler technique.&#xD;
