    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in subjects&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory B-Cell NHL or relapsed and refractory CLL (Part 1 only) and&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory DLBCL (Part 2 and Part 3). Part 3 evaluates the efficacy of MT-3724.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part Phase 2 study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724&#xD;
      [Completed]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 in&#xD;
      the MTD Expansion Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: (Phase 2 MTD Expansion Cohort) Determine the efficacy of MT-3724 as monotherapy in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL based on the overall response rate (ORR) by the&#xD;
      revised Lugano Classification for Lymphoma adjusted according to LYRIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 100 patients will be enrolled in Part 3. Treatment will continue&#xD;
      for up to six 21 days cycles. If the subject exhibits SD, CR or PR after the end of Cycle 6&#xD;
      and the investigator determines that the benefit-risk ratio is favorable, then the treatment&#xD;
      with MT-3724 may be continued after discussion with the sponsor.&#xD;
