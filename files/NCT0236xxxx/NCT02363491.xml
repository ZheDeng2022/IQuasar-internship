  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dose-confirming part of this study, comprising at least 10 patients is designed as a&#xD;
      single center, prospective, single arm, open label in patients who have failed or are&#xD;
      unresponsive to Azacitidine (AZA) or Decitabine (they may also have additionally failed an&#xD;
      Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) followed by a dose expansion part with at least 44&#xD;
      patients; the objective of the whole study being to assess the safety, efficacy,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously infused multiple doses of OPN-305 in&#xD;
      low and intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (second and third line Lower risk MDS).&#xD;
