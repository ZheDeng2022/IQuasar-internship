    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory Phase I study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the OXIRI&#xD;
      regimen [oxaliplatin (O), xeloda (X) and irinotecan (I)] and to evaluate for preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy, in patients with advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that 2 of 3 weekly doses of oxaliplatin and genotype&#xD;
      directed-dosing of irinotecan in combination with chronomodulated capecitabine (xeloda)&#xD;
      administered continuously will be more tolerable than the FOLFIRINOX regimen (folinic acid,&#xD;
      fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) while maintaining anti-tumour activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study comprises a dose escalation phase using 3+3 design to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the OXIRI regimen and an expansion phase to further&#xD;
      evaluate the MTD and to determine early signs of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive a novel chemotherapeutic regimen (OXIRI regimen) with xeloda&#xD;
      being administered in a chronomodulated fashion and the dose of irinotecan being guided by&#xD;
      the UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 genotype status of the patient.&#xD;
