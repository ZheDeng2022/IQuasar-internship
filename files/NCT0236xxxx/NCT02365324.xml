      The proposed integrated project will evaluate the effects of an evidence-based extension&#xD;
      education program, Family Fitness Program (FFP) grounded in Stages of Change Learning Theory&#xD;
      and guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), with and without a peer-education mode of&#xD;
      delivery on balancing calories to manage body weight (BW), reducing certain foods and food&#xD;
      components, increasing selected foods and nutrients, building healthy eating patterns [i.e.,&#xD;
      fundamental principles of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs), 2010] and SCT&#xD;
      variables. Briefly, the 12-week program will target early adolescent children, ages 11-14&#xD;
      years, test a peer-education approach to behavioral change and will be delivered as an&#xD;
      after-school program in local middle schools in support of childhood obesity prevention. Data&#xD;
      will be collected at baseline (preintervention), after the 12-week program&#xD;
      (post-intervention) and 6 months after completion of the program (maintenance).&#xD;

      The 12-week intervention, either Family Fitness Program, FFP (adult-led control group) or&#xD;
      Peer-education Family Fitness Program, PE-FFP (peer-led experimental group) will be delivered&#xD;
      four times in each of the three schools participating in the study from May, 2015 to May 2017&#xD;
      as an after-school program to early adolescent children, ages 11-14 years, to partially meet&#xD;
      the stated objectives in research. The proposed integrated project will follow a&#xD;
      group-randomized controlled trial design. The intervention will be offered as an after-school&#xD;
      programs in each of 3 schools (Urbana Middle School, Franklin Middle School and Mahomet&#xD;
      Seymour-Junior High School). Programs will be conducted on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesday, and&#xD;
      Thursdays for 12 weeks. After children are enrolled in the program, weekday by school will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the adult-led FFP (control group) or to the peer-led PE-FFP&#xD;
      (experimental group). This process will allow children the convenience of participating in&#xD;
      the program on the day that is most compatible with their schedules, offer the control and&#xD;
      experimental conditions at each of 2 schools and maintain randomization to treatment. Thus,&#xD;
      each school will have 1 control group and 1 experimental group each time the program is&#xD;
      conducted. Group randomization will occur during the fall-winter 2016 term and spring-summer&#xD;
      2017 term again. Data will be collected at baseline (pre-intervention), after the 12-week FFP&#xD;
      or PE-FFP (post-intervention) and 6 months after completion of the program (maintenance). The&#xD;
      FFP addresses all major elements of the Dietary guidelines for Americans (DGAs), 2010. Each&#xD;
      weekly lesson will include: 1) 20-30 minutes of moderate physical activity; 2) nutrition&#xD;
      activities; 3) discussions; 4) self-reflections; 5) goal setting activities for healthier&#xD;
      eating and physical activity; 6) food and beverage tasting experiences; and 7) parent-child&#xD;
      reflections. Lesson details are provided below. Incentive items will be distributed&#xD;
      throughout the 12-week intervention. Adult educators will lead FFP lessons, while&#xD;
      peer-educators will lead PE-FFP lessons. Study personnel will be present at each lesson,&#xD;
      along with Illinois-Trans-disciplinary Obesity Prevention Program (I-TOPP) trainees to&#xD;
      monitor each session and to conduct extension measures.&#xD;
