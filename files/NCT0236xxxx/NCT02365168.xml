      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some children and adolescents with fish allergy can tolerate eating some species of fish&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine to which degree fish allergic children and&#xD;
      adolescents can tolerate some species of fish and find the minimal eliciting allergen dose to&#xD;
      which only 10% of participants get allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are 40 patients recruited from children and adolescents outpatient clinics at&#xD;
      the University Hospital of North Norway with a history of fish allergy and sensibilisation of&#xD;
      one or more fish species with either positive specific IgE in serum or skin prick test.&#xD;
      Patients with sensibilisation to one or more fish species that never have eaten fish are also&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants undergo a clinical examination including lung function test with&#xD;
           spirometry before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants are tested for allergic sensibilisation with measure of specific IgE&#xD;
           against common food and inhalation allergens in addition to 10 different fish species.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants are challenged with cod, salmon, mackerel and placebo, disguised in a&#xD;
           chocolate mousse. The challenges are performed in randomized order with Double Blind&#xD;
           Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) on 4 different challenge days with minimum 6&#xD;
           weeks in between each challenge day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant with allergy to pollen will not be challenged during pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test food is developed especially to this study in cooperation with The National&#xD;
           Institute of Food Research in Norway and The University of Manchester. The National&#xD;
           Institute of Food Research in Norway have produced a dried powder of cod, salmon and&#xD;
           mackerel. The &quot;Molecular Allergology group at Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, the&#xD;
           University of Manchester, have produced test kits based on chocolate mousse containing&#xD;
           low and high doses of the fish powders. The National Institute of Food Research have&#xD;
           measured protein content and microbiology in the fish powders. The Molecular Allergology&#xD;
           group have provided quality measurements of the final product and tested the disguise in&#xD;
           a sensoric test panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with no allergic reaction to one or more of the blinded challenges undergo&#xD;
           open food challenge with larger doses of cooked fish than used in the DBPCFC, after the&#xD;
           randomization has been broken.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fish have an important role in human food providing a valuable source of highly assimilated&#xD;
      proteins and consumption of fish is increasing all over the world. Fish allergy is one of the&#xD;
      most common food allergies together with milk, egg, nuts, peanuts, fruits, wheat, soy and&#xD;
      seafood. It is more common in coastal countries and countries with traditions in fish&#xD;
      industry and where fish plays an important role in food traditions. This is the situation in&#xD;
      Northern Norway where fishing and fish industry have been the most important way to make a&#xD;
      living and fish an important part of the food. Allergy to fish is particularly common in&#xD;
      children and young adults. The symptoms related to fish allergy vary from mild symptoms to&#xD;
      anaphylaxis. Most patients with fish allergy avoid all species of fish and health care&#xD;
      workers often advice them to do so. The major allergen in fish is a muscle parvalbumin&#xD;
      resistant to heat, chemical denaturation and proteolytic enzymes. Due to homology in the&#xD;
      amino acid sequence in parvalbumins in different fish species, cross-reactivity exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, clinical experience, studies on sensibilisation, and some open food challenge&#xD;
      studies indicates that some patients with fish allergy can tolerate some species of fish. The&#xD;
      main purpose of this study is to find to which degree fish allergic children and adolescents&#xD;
      can tolerate some species of fish, using DBPCFC as the gold standard in diagnosis of food&#xD;
      allergy, and thereby avoid unnecessary food restrictions in their diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food industry often label their products with &quot;main contain allergen&quot; because they lack&#xD;
      information about threshold doses for allergic reactions. Unnecessary labeling of food&#xD;
      results in less variation in the diet for food allergic patients. Another purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to find the Minimal Eliciting Dose to which 10% of the participants get allergic&#xD;
      reaction, and thereby contribute to a more precise labeling of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBPCFC is the gold standard in the diagnosis of food allergy. To disguise the taste and smell&#xD;
      from fish in a standardized test food with good taste and texture is difficult. It is&#xD;
      especially difficult with children, who are less likely to eat food with bad taste and where&#xD;
      the volume of test food they can manage is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cooperation with The National Institute of Food Research in Norway we have produced dried&#xD;
      fish powders from cod, salmon and mackerel. Frozen filets have been cooked, dried and made&#xD;
      into powders. The powders have been checked for microbiologic content and protein content.&#xD;
      The procedure involves removing as much fat as possible. The powders are stored in a freezer&#xD;
      with a temperature of -20Â°C. The volume is decreased with about 80% compared with cooked&#xD;
      fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cooperation with Professor Clare Mills in the Molecular Allergology group, Manchester&#xD;
      Institute of Biotechnology, The University of Manchester, the fish powders is put into a&#xD;
      chocolate dessert based on a recipe used in a EuroPrevall study on food allergy. The&#xD;
      production of chocolate desserts is performed at the University of Manchester together with&#xD;
      quality check regarding allergen content, content of parvalbumin, microbiology and speciation&#xD;
      of the fish. The disguise of taste and smell are tested in a sensoric test panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 5-20 yr, with a history of fish allergy and sensibilisation to fish who had&#xD;
      visited one of the outpatient clinics for children and adolescents at the university hospital&#xD;
      of Northern Norway, are invited to participate. Patients with sensibilisation to fish that&#xD;
      never have eaten fish are also invited. In addition, patients registered with sensibilisation&#xD;
      against cod at the allergology lab, University Hospital of Northern Norway since 2008 , that&#xD;
      not already had been picked up from an outpatient clinic is invited to participate. The&#xD;
      laboratory is the only allergology laboratory in the region the participants are recruited&#xD;
      from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination before inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that give their consent to participate undergo clinical examination, including&#xD;
      spirometry, before inclusion to ensure eligibility. The clinical examination contains&#xD;
      measurements of weight and height, heart and lung auscultation, examination of skin,&#xD;
      conjunctiva, nose and oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special attention is given to uncontrolled asthma and eczema and to ensure optimized&#xD;
      treatment before inclusion. Pollen allergic patients will not undergo food challenges during&#xD;
      pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all participants, specific IgE in serum against the following allergens are measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fx5 (Egg, milk, cod, wheat, soy, peanut)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inhalation panel 6 (Birch, timothy, mugwort, alternaria, cladosporium)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inhalation panel 7(Cat, horse, dog, house dust mite, rabbit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gad c1, f426 (Parvalbumin from cod)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cyp c1, f355 (Parvalbumin from carp)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Salmon, f41&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Mackerel, f206&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Halibut, f303&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pollock, f413&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Haddock, f42&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Herring, f205&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Plaice,4254&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Tuna, f40&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Shrimp,f24&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. f351 (recombinant shrimp tropomyosin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents answer a questionnaire for research in allergy. The questionnaire is translated to&#xD;
      Norwegian and an electronic survey is used. The parents answer the questionnaire during the&#xD;
      first challenge day. The questionnaire is extended with questions regarding fish allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge with cod, salmon, mackerel and placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo DBPCFC with cod, salmon, mackerel and placebo in randomized order,&#xD;
      disguised in a chocolate dessert on 4 separate challenge days with minimum 6 weeks between&#xD;
      each challenge day. Participants that have experienced anaphylaxis, verified and treated in&#xD;
      hospital , are not challenged with the species that have given anaphylaxis. Symptoms are&#xD;
      recorded on a clinical manifestations record sheet based on a protocol from the University&#xD;
      Hospital of South Manchester with grading of the symptoms and defined stop criteria. The&#xD;
      protein doses are based on the experience of a EuroPrevall study with DBPCFC with cod:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3Âµg, 600Âµg, 12mg, 120mg and1g for DBPCFC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open challenges with cod and/or salmon and mackerel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that have no allergic reactions after DBPCFC with either cod, salmon and&#xD;
      mackerel, undergo open challenge(s) with 2 g, 6 g and 12 g of protein , served as cooked&#xD;
      fish, with the species that gave negative DBPCFC. The open challenges are done on separate&#xD;
      days after the randomization code has been broken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceasing of medication before DBPCFC and open challenges:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic corticosteroid therapy are ceased at least one week before challenges. Antihistamine&#xD;
      treatment are ceased at least 72 hours before the challenges. Short acting Î²-2 agonists are&#xD;
      ceased at least 6 hours before the challenges and Long acting Î²-2 agonists at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before the challenges. Participants are allowed to continue inhalant corticosteroids and&#xD;
      leukotriene receptor antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postponing of DBPCFC and open challenges:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenges are postponed if the participants have ongoing infections, ongoing allergic&#xD;
      reactions, uncontrolled eczema or uncontrolled asthma. Participants with pollen allergy are&#xD;
      not challenged during pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and treatment of allergic reactions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All fish challenges are performed at the research unit at the University Hospital of North&#xD;
      Norway in the period of September 2014 - February 2015. Two participants are challenged each&#xD;
      challenge day and all participants are observed by one blinded research nurse. Unblinded&#xD;
      staff prepare the test meals every morning. One blinded doctor examines the participants&#xD;
      before, during and after the challenges and decides whether challenges are positive or&#xD;
      negative. The challenges are stopped if participants develop objective signs of allergic&#xD;
      reactions. Stop criteria are predefined. Participants are observed in the hospital at least&#xD;
      two hours after the challenges have been stopped. Allergic and anaphylactic reactions are&#xD;
      treated according to European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology position paper&#xD;
      of Anaphylaxis. Participants are contacted by blinded research nurse by phone next day to&#xD;
      record late reactions after discharge.&#xD;
