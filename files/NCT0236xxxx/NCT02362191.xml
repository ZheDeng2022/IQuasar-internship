      Purpose: Using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we will study whether&#xD;
      tACS induces changes in prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies in women with premenstrual&#xD;
      dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and whether tACS effects on alpha oscillations varies by menstrual&#xD;
      cycle phase. An exploratory objective is to assess whether there are any changes in symptom&#xD;
      severity during the menstrual cycle phase in which tACS is delivered relative to their&#xD;
      baseline symptom levels (determined in a diagnostic feeder study, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Women between ages 18-52 with a diagnosis of PMDD confirmed by participation in&#xD;
      a PMDD diagnostic study (IRB# 05-3000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): After a re-screening and consent appointment, eligible participants&#xD;
      will alert the study staff when they begin menstruating. Participants will have their first&#xD;
      session in either the follicular phase or luteal phase (determined by ovulation testing) of&#xD;
      their menstrual cycle and the second session in the other cycle phase. The order of phase at&#xD;
      first testing will be counterbalanced across participants. Each session will consist of 40&#xD;
      minutes of tACS with by an EEG recording before and after stimulation. Patients' symptoms&#xD;
      will be assessed at the end of each session and with the daily mood ratings collected&#xD;
      throughout the menstrual cycle that coincides with tACS sessions (approximately 26 - 32&#xD;
      days).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) describes the cyclic appearance of affective symptoms&#xD;
      and resultant impairment during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The objective of the&#xD;
      experiment is to determine if transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation (tACS)&#xD;
      will alter prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies in women with PMDD, disruption of which&#xD;
      has been implicated in other mood disorders. A secondary objective is to determine if&#xD;
      menstrual cycle phase will influence the effects of tACS on alpha oscillations. Demonstration&#xD;
      of 'target engagement' (alterations in left prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies with&#xD;
      tACS) is a necessary first step before moving forward with subsequent research that would&#xD;
      test whether tACS is a potential treatment for this disorder - promising research in other&#xD;
      mood disorders suggests that it may be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of PMDD is unknown, the morbidity substantial, and the identified treatments&#xD;
      limited in their effectiveness, since 40% of PMDD women are non-responders to SSRIs and many&#xD;
      additional women are intolerant of antidepressant induced side effects. PMDD is prevalent&#xD;
      (6-8% of women of reproductive age), attended by substantial morbidity, and hence a&#xD;
      significant public health problem. Indeed, by World Health Calculations, PMDD is associated&#xD;
      with 4.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years in the US alone. The rationale for testing&#xD;
      whether tACS differentially alters target engagement in the follicular versus luteal phases&#xD;
      of the menstrual cycle is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential Effects on Cortical Activity: The rationale for testing whether tACS&#xD;
      differentially alters target engagement in the follicular versus luteal phases of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle is as follows: 1) Role of Hormones: While there is little evidence for&#xD;
      ovarian dysfunction in PMDD a role for the reproductive hormones is clearly implicated, since&#xD;
      our own work and that of others has shown that suppression of ovarian function results in a&#xD;
      complete remission of symptoms in a majority of women with PMDD, while adding back gonadal&#xD;
      hormones results in the return of symptoms in women with PMDD, with no symptoms seen in&#xD;
      controls. Both estradiol and progesterone appear capable of precipitating mood&#xD;
      destabilization in this paradigm. Recently completed studies from our group further&#xD;
      demonstrate that continuous administration of hormones for longer than one-month results in a&#xD;
      sustained symptom remission subsequent to the initial precipitated episode. Thus, dysphoric&#xD;
      mood states in PMDD appear to be induced by normal changes in gonadal hormones rather than by&#xD;
      exposure to elevated hormone levels (i.e., women with PMDD are differentially sensitive to&#xD;
      the mood dysregulatory effects of reproductive steroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is substantial literature demonstrating the effects of reproductive steroids&#xD;
      and, by extension, the menstrual cycle on cortical activity, the usually described effects&#xD;
      are disturbed in women with PMDD. Examples include the following: 1) in normal women,&#xD;
      activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex is diminished during the luteal phase and the&#xD;
      affective valence of the stimulus to which it responds is reversed (i.e., it responds only to&#xD;
      negative stimuli rather than to positive stimuli, as occurs during the follicular phase).&#xD;
      These changes are absent in women with PMDD. 2) in normal women during the luteal phase,&#xD;
      there is an increase in cortical inhibition - a presumed effect of the GABA receptor&#xD;
      activating effects of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone. This effect is absent in&#xD;
      women with PMDD. Both animal and human data further suggest the role of a disturbed cortical&#xD;
      response to progesterone-derived neurosteroids in PMDD. Thus, sudden changes in the levels of&#xD;
      allopregnanolone (as occurs at the start of the luteal phase with increasing levels of&#xD;
      progesterone) result in subcortical excitability and irritability in rodents, while&#xD;
      elimination of changes in progesterone-derived neurosteroids (with neurosteroid synthesis&#xD;
      inhibition) successfully prevents the emergence of the dysphoric state in PMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential Network Activation: Psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation of&#xD;
      affective state -depression and PMDD - are increasingly recognized as are &quot;network disorders&quot;&#xD;
      in which aberrant electric signaling in large-scale neuronal networks mediates the clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. Recent studies have documented impaired balance in activation between left and&#xD;
      right prefrontal cortex in patients with PMDD. In particular, similar to major depressive&#xD;
      disorder, the balance between alpha oscillation power in the left and the right hemisphere is&#xD;
      shifted towards the left in patients with PMDD. The presence of alpha oscillations&#xD;
      corresponds to a relative decrease in neuronal activity (inverse relationship). Therefore,&#xD;
      such a left-shifted alpha asymmetry is indicative of hypoactivation of the left hemisphere -&#xD;
      a common finding in imaging studies of patients with MDD. Since this asymmetry is exacerbated&#xD;
      during the luteal but not the follicular phase (corresponding to the time course of symptom&#xD;
      presentation in PMDD, we hypothesize that successful normalization of alpha oscillations in&#xD;
      women with PMDD would be a plausible approach to symptom remediation. This network level&#xD;
      intervention can be accomplished with brain stimulation by application of weak electric&#xD;
      currents, a non-invasive approach to modulating intrinsic cortical network dynamics. The&#xD;
      advantage of this approach is twofold: it is non-pharmacologic and thus avoids the otherwise&#xD;
      attendant side effects; and it will provide systems level insights into the pathophysiology&#xD;
      underlying mood state dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain stimulation by constant electric currents applied to the scalp (tDCs) modulates&#xD;
      neuronal excitability in humans. Transcranial current stimulation with sine-wave stimulation&#xD;
      waveforms (transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS) likely enhances cortical&#xD;
      oscillations in a frequency specific manner. The mechanisms of weak electric fields generated&#xD;
      by tDCS and tACS previously have been demonstrated to interact with cortical network activity&#xD;
      by altering the temporal activity structure of electric signaling in cortex. In this study,&#xD;
      we will assess whether tACS will decrease left frontal alpha power (8-12 Hz) and whether the&#xD;
      extent of the decrease varies by menstrual cycle phase. An exploratory objective will be to&#xD;
      examine the severity of the PMDD symptoms collected daily during the stimulation cycle and&#xD;
      compare that severity with baseline symptoms ratings collected during the PMDD diagnostic&#xD;
      study from which these participants will be recruited. The rationale for this stimulation is&#xD;
      the known deficits in the overall structure of cortical activity in this frequency band in&#xD;
      patients with mood disorders and the previously demonstrate clinical benefits of tDCS in the&#xD;
      treatment of mood disorders. In this study, we will use more targeted stimulation waveforms&#xD;
      by employing bilateral tACS instead of tDCS. We hypothesize that this choice of a more&#xD;
      sophisticated waveform that directly enhances synchronization between the two hemispheres may&#xD;
      be more effective in engaging the target. tDCS modulates overall activity levels of the&#xD;
      targeted cortical area in a non-specific manner. Here, however, we propose to evaluate a more&#xD;
      specific stimulation modality, tACS, (10 Hz stimulation frequency) that has been shown to&#xD;
      selectively enhance cortical alpha rhythms. Since the selected patient population reportedly&#xD;
      exhibits specific deficits in the alpha frequency band, our stimulation approach will provide&#xD;
      a more targeted and therefore possibly a more effective manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol History: This protocol was originally designed to test the therapeutic efficacy of&#xD;
      tACS in PMDD in a double blind, randomized, sham controlled, cross-over study of 5 tACS&#xD;
      sessions. We were unable to recruit subjects, largely consequent to the many daily treatment&#xD;
      sessions required. We subsequently changed the primary focus of the study to that of&#xD;
      determining whether a single session of tACS engaged left prefrontal cortical alpha&#xD;
      oscillations and, by reducing them, reduced alpha asymmetry. We further asked whether this&#xD;
      effect was menstrual cycle phase-dependent.&#xD;
