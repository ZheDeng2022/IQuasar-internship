    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to investigate the effect of a more in-depth education plan for&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either the standard&#xD;
      education plan during their breast cancer treatment or they will receive in-depth education&#xD;
      about their breast cancer treatment. In order to see what kind of effect the different&#xD;
      education plans have, patients will fill out three identical questionnaires during the course&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective study of women receiving adjuvant radiation therapy for&#xD;
      management of breast cancer at the University of California Davis. All patients will be&#xD;
      staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Seventh edition. Primary disease&#xD;
      treatment information including surgical approach and utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a validated quality of life assessment (FACIT-TS-PS) completed at&#xD;
      three time points during their radiation therapy process. The patients will be randomized at&#xD;
      the time of completion of radiation plan approval by the treating radiation oncologist in a&#xD;
      one to one fashion to either proceed with standard education or more extensive plan review.&#xD;
      The radiation oncology quality assurance (QA) process will be blinded to the randomization of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
