      The primary objective is to determine if a difference exists in functional outcomes, as&#xD;
      measured by the Constant score, when comparing nonoperative management and locking plate&#xD;
      surgical fixation of low-energy displaced proximal humerus fractures in the elderly&#xD;
      population over a 2-year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of&#xD;
      the ASES score, the SF-36 quality of life score, complication rates, re-operation rates,&#xD;
      radiographic time to union, radiographic malunion, hardware position and evidence of&#xD;
      avascular necrosis or posttraumatic osteoarthritis .&#xD;

      The design of this study is two-fold. The main study will be a prospective, single blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized to either (1) non-operative&#xD;
      treatment or (2) locking plate open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second component of this study will be a prospective, cohort study. This option will be&#xD;
      presented to patients who do not want to enroll in the RCT because they prefer one treatment&#xD;
      option over the other, and do not wish to be randomized to a treatment. Patients who choose&#xD;
      either non-operative treatment or ORIF for their proximal humerus fracture will be followed&#xD;
      for 2 years post injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Does a difference exist in the functional outcome between non-operative&#xD;
      management and locking plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced two-part, three-part,&#xD;
      and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population based on the Constant&#xD;
      functional outcome score over a 2-year follow-up period? Objective 2: Does a difference exist&#xD;
      between non-operative management and locking plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced&#xD;
      two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population&#xD;
      based on the ASES functional outcome score, the short form Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity score, the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for the elderly, and the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QoL) functional outcome score over a 2-year follow-up period? What is the&#xD;
      incidence of complications of non-operative management and locking plate surgical fixation of&#xD;
      low-energy displaced two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the&#xD;
      elderly population based on infection, nerve injury, intra-articular screw penetration and&#xD;
      bleeding (hematoma), reoperation rate, or hospital readmission over a 2-year follow-up&#xD;
      period? Objective 3: Does a difference exist between non-operative management and locking&#xD;
      plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal&#xD;
      humerus fractures in the elderly population based on radiographic outcomes including&#xD;
      non-union, malunion, and joint arthrosis? Objective 4: Does the degree of initial&#xD;
      displacement or angulation of the fracture fragments correlate with final functional outcome&#xD;
      measures? Objective 5: Does the quality of the surgical reduction correlate with final&#xD;
      functional outcome measures?&#xD;

    <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points.The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain is measured using 4 likert levels (15 points maximum), where a higher score indicates a better outcome; activities of daily living are measured using a likert scale, where a higher number indicates better outcomes (20 points maximum); mobility is measured by an assessor, and rated using a likert scale where a higher score indicates better outcomes (40 points maximum); finally, strength is measured by an assessor where 1 point is given per 0.5kg of force (maximum 25 points), a higher score indicates better outcomes. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Form-36</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is an outcome measure used to determine quality of life. This measure has 8 scaled scores, each question has equal weight and is then translated onto a scale graded from 0-100. A higher number indicates a better outcome.</description>
