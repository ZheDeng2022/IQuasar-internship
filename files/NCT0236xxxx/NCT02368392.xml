      4 General objective To describe incidence of &quot;in-hospital&quot; deaths, outcomes after attempted&#xD;
      cardiac arrest resuscitation and availability of resuscitation equipment in Sri Lankan state&#xD;
      Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the incidence of in-hospital deaths in state sector Hospitals in Sri Lanka.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the availability of resources for cardiac arrest management in these&#xD;
           settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the incidence of attempted resuscitation after cardiac arrests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immediate outcomes after attempted resuscitation for cardiac arrests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the ICU, Hospital and 30 day post discharge outcomes of these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the health related quality of patients who survived to 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
           5 Methodology 5.1 Study one 5.1.1 Study design One week cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Study setting In all state sector Hospitals with (Base Hospitals and above)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Administrative process Once ethical review process has been completed, The Hospital&#xD;
      Directors/Medical Superintendent (and through them the Hospital Consultants) will be&#xD;
      officially informed of the study by the office of the Deputy Director General (Education,&#xD;
      Training and Research) (DDG ET&amp;R) at the Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Officers will be nominated for the study through the same office. A small financial&#xD;
      incentive will be provided for these Doctors during this study period (as below). The&#xD;
      investigators will also seek permission from the Steering committee of National Intensive&#xD;
      Care Surveillance to obtain ICU admission, outcome and follow-up data for IHCA patients from&#xD;
      the NICS database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4 Study population All patients who died in-hospital or those on whom CPR was attempted&#xD;
      within the time period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4.1 Exclusions criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dead on arrival at Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonate (less than 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.5 Study sample Entire population&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.6 Study period One week period in July/August 2014&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.7 Sample size One week period will be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.8 Sampling method Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.9 Data collection tools During the study period, nominated and pre-trained medical&#xD;
      officers from each Hospital will complete a questionnaire using an online form on a daily&#xD;
      basis. The data collector will interview each Ward Sister, House Officer or senior nurse&#xD;
      twice (around 7 am and 7 pm) daily. Non- ward areas such as operating theatres, emergency&#xD;
      rooms will also be covered. This process will be piloted in five hospitals prior to the study&#xD;
      to fine tune the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.9.1 Data validation Death register in the ward/mortuary or in the Matron's office will be&#xD;
      used to validate the data collected on Hospital deaths and any discrepancies resolved. Random&#xD;
      validation of the data collected at Hospital level will be done centrally on a daily basis&#xD;
      during the one-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU admission reasons will also be collected from all ICUs during this period to detect ICU&#xD;
      admissions due to in-hospital cardiac arrests, which can also be used as a method of&#xD;
      validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.10 Study variables The following will be collected daily during the one week period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of in-ward deaths&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of attempted resuscitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of successful resuscitations and their subsequent locations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number admitted to ICU (name and BHT number) following resuscitation and location of the&#xD;
           ICUs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total number of in-ward patients at midnight, daily, during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition at the beginning of the study period the facilities available for&#xD;
           resuscitation will be collected at ward/theatre against a standard resuscitation council&#xD;
           equipment checklist. The staff participation in previous resuscitation training will be&#xD;
           gathered anonymously at the same time. This information will only be collected once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Study two 5.2.1 Study design Longitudinal study&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.2 Study setting All Intensive Care Units to which the patients successfully resuscitated&#xD;
      have been admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.3 Study period From the beginning of the study period of study 1 above, and until 30 days&#xD;
      after ICU discharge for the last patient admitted to an ICU after successful resuscitation,&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 90 days from the start of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.4 Sample size All patients admitted to an ICU after successful resuscitation from study 1&#xD;
      above, will be included. We are unable to estimate a sample size for this study as the number&#xD;
      of patients admitted after cardiac arrests over this period is not known. The purpose of this&#xD;
      part of the study is to actually know what number of patients are admitted to ICU after&#xD;
      resuscitation and what their outcomes are. No causative association is proposed as an product&#xD;
      of this part of the study.We have selected a one-week recruitment period as this is a&#xD;
      national study and we feel this is a feasible duration for us.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.5 Sampling method All patients who had successful resuscitation and were admitted to ICU&#xD;
      in study 1, will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.6 Data collection tools The data will be gathered, after appropriate permission has been&#xD;
      sought, as above, from the National Intensive Care Surveillance (NICS) database. No new data&#xD;
      will need to be gathered from these ICUs. If the ICU is not part of the NICS network, we will&#xD;
      follow up these resuscitated patients in these non-NICS ICUs. Health related Quality of&#xD;
      Life,neurological and disability status of these patients will be reviewed using SF-12,&#xD;
      EQ-5Dand MRS from those who survived to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.7 Study variables The following data will be collected for each eligible patient using&#xD;
      the National Intensive Care Surveillance database where the ICU is part of the network.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes at ICU discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes at Hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes at 30 day post discharge In the non-NICS ICUs we will determine ICU outcomes by&#xD;
           contacting the ICUs at least once a week. We will also determine hospital and 30 days&#xD;
           outcome by obtaining a contact telephone number of the patient or the next of kin. This&#xD;
           is similar to the methodology we currently employ for patients admitted to NICS ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related Quality of Life, neurological and disability status of patients who&#xD;
           survived at 6 months and up to 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
           Sciences 18 and Stata 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrete variables are expressed as counts (percentage) and continuous variables as means (Â±&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD) and median (inter quartile range (IQR)). For description of&#xD;
      variables standard descriptive statistics will be used. For comparison of continuous&#xD;
      variables t test will be used while chi square will be used to compare discrete variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to describe the prevalence of selected&#xD;
      factors as antecedents or contributory features of cardiac arrests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 Ethics 7.1 Consent: Permission will be taken from the relevant Authorities of the Ministry&#xD;
      of Health and Hospitals as described in detail above. Personal identifier data of patients&#xD;
      will not be collected except for Name, BHT number, address and telephone number of those&#xD;
      successfully resuscitated. The investigators and data collectors will not come in direct&#xD;
      contact with the patients except when determining 30 day outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Risks to the patient: There are no obvious risks to patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Benefits: Potential benefits are many at individual patient level, Hospital level and&#xD;
      national level. The study will enable quantification of the burden of recognized cardiac&#xD;
      arrests, their outcomes and possible antecedent/contributory factors to enable the&#xD;
      formulation of concrete strategies to improve care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Confidentiality: Data extraction sheet will be completed only by the nominated medical&#xD;
      officers or by the proposed expert committee. Data will be stored in a computer and only the&#xD;
      authorized personal will have access to this information and the information will be password&#xD;
      protected and backed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5 Dissemination of information: The findings will be disseminated in the form of abstracts&#xD;
      submitted for scientific session, journal articles and presentations. They may be used for&#xD;
      local or national guideline preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.6 Beneficiaries: There are three main categories of beneficiaries. The Ministry of Health&#xD;
      benefits from information by knowing the ground situation and being able to plan and direct&#xD;
      the donors where improvement are needed both in resources as well as capacity building. The&#xD;
      staff benefits by being able to identify areas of improvement in the services given for IHCA&#xD;
      and resuscitation and thus has the opportunity to improve the skills on resuscitation. Thus&#xD;
      data can be used to develop services and the human resources in improving IHCA management and&#xD;
      patient out come.&#xD;
