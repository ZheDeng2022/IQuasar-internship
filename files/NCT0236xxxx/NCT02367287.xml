  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the diet of the US population meets or exceeds recommended intake levels of most&#xD;
      essential nutrients, the quality of the diet consumed by many Americans is sub-optimal due to&#xD;
      excessive intake of added sugars, solid fats, refined grains, and sodium. The foundations and&#xD;
      outcomes of healthy vs. unhealthy eating habits and activity levels are complex and involve&#xD;
      interactions between the environment and innate physiologic/genetic background. For instance,&#xD;
      emerging research implicates chronic and acute stress responses and perturbations in the&#xD;
      Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis in triggering obesity-promoting metabolic changes and&#xD;
      poor food choices. In addition, the development of many chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma and autoimmune disease, results from an&#xD;
      overactive immune response to host tissue or environmental antigens (e.g. inhaled allergens).&#xD;
      A greater understanding is needed of the distribution of key environment-physiology&#xD;
      interactions that drive overconsumption, create positive energy balance, and put health at&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Western Human Nutrition&#xD;
      Research Center are conducting a cross-sectional &quot;metabolic phenotyping&quot; study of healthy&#xD;
      people in the general population. Observational measurements include the interactions of&#xD;
      habitual diet with the metabolic response to food intake, production of key hormones, the&#xD;
      conversion of food into energy: the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates,&#xD;
      characteristics of the immune system, stress response, gut microbiota (bacteria in the&#xD;
      intestinal tract), and cardiovascular health. Most outcomes will be measured in response to a&#xD;
      mixed macronutrient/high fat challenge meal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many inflammatory responses can be modulated by specific dietary components. For example, in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, macrophages and T-cells react with oxidized LDL (an endogenous&#xD;
      modified antigen) to produce arterial plaque and subsequent blockage of coronary arteries.&#xD;
      High intake of saturated fats (or simple sugars that drive synthesis of saturated fatty&#xD;
      acids) may promote this inflammation by affecting macrophages and T-cells. Conversely,&#xD;
      increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids may decrease inflammation by suppression of&#xD;
      macrophage and T-cell pro-inflammatory activity. Long-term sub-clinical inflammation caused&#xD;
      by intestinal bacteria has been linked to the development of Irritable Bowel Disease and&#xD;
      related disorders. Low intake of fruits, vegetables, or whole grains or high intake of&#xD;
      saturated fats may promote sub-clinical gut inflammation by promoting dysbiosis of the gut&#xD;
      microbiota. Allergic asthma develops in predisposed individuals as a result of an overactive&#xD;
      allergic-type immune response to inhaled environmental allergens. Dietary factors such as&#xD;
      vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids may diminish pro-inflammatory responses to environmental&#xD;
      allergens by promoting the development of T-regulatory cells and other anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual variability in chronic disease risk is well recognized. For example, why does&#xD;
      excess adiposity lead to disease in some individuals and not others? The nature of the fat&#xD;
      tissue rather than the abundance, may impact cross-talk with other metabolically-relevant&#xD;
      tissues and affect disease risk. It is important to characterize healthy vs. unhealthy&#xD;
      phenotypes across various tissues and to understand how micro- and macro-nutrients interact&#xD;
      with molecular and metabolic pathways to support a healthy body weight. This study brings&#xD;
      together scientists with expertise in nutritional sciences, immunology, analytical chemistry,&#xD;
      physiology, neuroendocrinology, and behavior to understand how diet impacts metabolism and&#xD;
      disease risk through the interplay and coordination of signals and metabolites arising from&#xD;
      multiple organ systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to characterize the phenotypic profile of participants according to&#xD;
      their immunologic, physiologic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic responses to a dietary&#xD;
      challenge and a physical fitness challenge by addressing the specific aims listed below. The&#xD;
      cross-sectional study is organized into two study visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) separated by&#xD;
      approximately two weeks of at-home specimen and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if diet quality is independently associated with systemic immune&#xD;
      activation, inflammation, or oxidative stress differentiated by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. pro-inflammatory T-helper cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells) and related cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells and related cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and markers of gut inflammation (e.g. neopterin and&#xD;
           myeloperoxidase)&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. and to evaluate the association between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, gut&#xD;
           inflammation, and systemic immune activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. plasma metabolomic response to a mixed macronutrient challenge meal (includes diet&#xD;
           quality and physical activity as independent variables)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. endothelial (dys)function and vascular reactivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a high fat/sugar challenge meal induces differential effects&#xD;
      over time (0-6h postprandial) according to habitual diet characteristics, physical activity&#xD;
      levels, stress levels, age, sex, or BMI on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. postprandial monocyte activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. plasma lipid metabolomic responses including non-esterified fatty acids, phospholipids,&#xD;
           triacylglycerols, red blood cell fatty acids, endocannabinoids, bile acids, eicosanoids&#xD;
           and related oxylipins, ceramides, sphingoid bases, and acylcarnitines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. plasma amino acid metabolomics&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. glucose metabolism and metabolic flexibility (i.e. the ability to switch from glucose to&#xD;
           lipid oxidation as energy sources)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. changes in endocrinology and self-report of hunger and satiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. postprandial free cortisol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the mechanisms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. postprandial monocyte activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. suppression of challenge-meal induced monocyte activation by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)&#xD;
           (in an ex vivo experiment using a subset of samples)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To evaluate the associations between eating behavior, physical activity,&#xD;
      and/or anthropometry and the outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. endocrinology of hunger and satiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. plasma metabolomic responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. vulnerability and resistance to stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. endothelial (dys)function and vascular reactivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. prediction of insulin sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: To determine how genetic variants affect nutrient metabolism, cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology, and immune function and improve understanding of how dietary factors affect these&#xD;
      metabolic, cardiovascular and immune phenotypes.&#xD;
