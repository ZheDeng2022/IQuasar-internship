  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed intubation and ventilation in obstetrics remains one of the most common causes of&#xD;
      death directly related to anesthesia. The reported incidence of failed intubation in&#xD;
      obstetrics is 1:300, which is significantly higher than that in the non-obstetric population.&#xD;
      A clinical screening test with high sensitivity and specificity for prediction of difficult&#xD;
      airway may help reduce morbidity and mortality from general anesthesia. Few studies have&#xD;
      identified increased neck circumference as the best single predictor of problematic&#xD;
      intubation. However the cutoff point of this test for identifying patients at high risk of&#xD;
      difficult intubation is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal cutoff point, which validates prediction of&#xD;
      difficult ventilation and/or intubation for obstetric patients. Preoperative airway&#xD;
      assessment will be done including neck circumference. Intraoperative difficult ventilation&#xD;
      and/or intubation will be recorded. Optimal cutoff point of neck circumference will be&#xD;
      calculated by Receiver Operating characteristics (ROC) curve.&#xD;

      In this prospective study, patients will be assessed by the anaesthetist preoperatively and&#xD;
      asked about their medical history including detailed history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&#xD;
      and snoring. Physical examination including weight,height &amp;BMI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximum mouth opening measured as interincisor gap (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sternomental distance measured as the straight distance between the upper border of&#xD;
           manubrium sterni and the bony point of the mentum with the head in full extension and&#xD;
           the mouth is closed (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hyomental distance measured from just above the hyoid bone to the tip to the&#xD;
           anterior-most part of the mentum in both neutral position and with maximum head&#xD;
           extension (cm). Hence, hyomental distance ratio (HMDR) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Thyromental distance measured as the distance from the thyroid notch to the inner margin&#xD;
           of the mental prominence when the head is fully extended (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Extended Mallampati Score (EMS) in sitting position with full extension of&#xD;
           craniocervical junction with phonation (class I: Entire Uvula is clearly visible; class&#xD;
           II: Upper half of the uvula is visible; class III: soft and hard palate clearly visible;&#xD;
           and class IV: Only hard palate is visible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neck Circumference at the level of the thyroid cartilage (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Condition of the teeth (Protrusion, loose, missing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Mandibular protrusion test to detect temporomandibular joint mobility measured as&#xD;
           ability to move the lower teeth in front of the upper teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation will be considered difficult if the Intubation Difficulty Scale ( IDS) is equal or&#xD;
      more than 5 .&#xD;
