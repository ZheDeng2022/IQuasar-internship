    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, open label, randomized, cross-over study in patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia comparing the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in patients with&#xD;
      greater than or equal to one variant allele in the SLCO1B1 gene (-11187 and/or c.521) to&#xD;
      patients with the wild-type/wild-type genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies goal is to establish the role of genetic variation and development in key&#xD;
      transporters on the dose-exposure relationship of two commonly used statin drugs in children.&#xD;
      This study is the first step in a series of investigations aimed to determining the&#xD;
      mechanisms behind variations in physiologic response, clinical efficacy and significant&#xD;
      adverse effect risk that surround the statin drugs in children and adolescents.&#xD;

      Trial Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin 10mg tablet (ages 8-21 years); oral dosing Atorvastatin 10mg tablet (ages 8-21&#xD;
      years); oral dosing Commercial supplies of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin that are FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in pediatric dyslipidemia will be used. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin from&#xD;
      the same source and lot will be used for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses designated above are chosen according to previous pediatric data13,14, and are&#xD;
      consistent with current labeling for rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in children greater than&#xD;
      10 years of age. The rosuvastatin and atorvastatin doses will be off label for participants&#xD;
      8-10 years of age, but consistent with current practice. Data from this study are not&#xD;
      intended to be used to change the drug labeling, and thus a new IND is not required. Although&#xD;
      fixed doses within a pre-specified age range will be used, dose data will be analyzed&#xD;
      corrected for weight (mg/kg) based on the patient's weight at time of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects with a LDL &gt;130mg/dl (95% percentile) meet current clinical criteria&#xD;
      for statin therapy. The risks associated with participation in this single-dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study are expected to be minimal given the known adverse event profile for&#xD;
      the study articles and also, the limited exposure. The most common mild adverse effects of&#xD;
      statins are headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, dyspepsia,&#xD;
      diarrhea, constipation). However, in children these adverse effects occur with the same&#xD;
      frequency as placebo7,10,25. Rare adverse effects include elevation of hepatic transaminases&#xD;
      and myopathy, but these are generally observed with chronic treatment. Furthermore, no cases&#xD;
      of hepatic failure with statins have been reported to date10. There is also a small risk&#xD;
      associated with placement of the intravenous (IV) catheter that will be used to draw serial&#xD;
      blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis and screening/safety labs. Finally, there is the&#xD;
      risk of loss of confidentiality for the participating subjects. Methods to protect PHI and&#xD;
      data handling are specifically outlined in the CMH CPR protocol Sections 4 &amp; 5 (CMH IRB#&#xD;
      12040220). All of the above risks associated with this non-therapeutic clinical trial are&#xD;
      minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit to participating subjects, although there may be benefit for&#xD;
      children in the future, as it is expected that the information to be gained from the study&#xD;
      can be generalized to the larger population of pediatric patients who may require statin&#xD;
      treatment. The purpose of the study is to determine how genetic variation impacts&#xD;
      rosuvastatin and atorvastatin plasma concentrations following recommended doses of the drug&#xD;
      in a patient population that has not previously been studied. Thus, with this knowledge,&#xD;
      future protocols could subsequently be developed to effectively &quot;personalize&quot; dosing for&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with the aforementioned SNPs who are taking rosuvastatin and atorvastatin,&#xD;
      thereby improving efficacy and safety for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center, open-label, randomized, crossover pilot study in patients with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia comparing the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in patients with&#xD;
      greater than or equal to one variant allele in the SLCO1B1 gene (-11187 and/or c.521) to&#xD;
      patients with the wild-type/wild-type genotype. The results of genetic testing will not be&#xD;
      disclosed to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CMH Cardiology Pharmacogenomics Repository (CPR) (CMH IRB# 12040220) database will be&#xD;
      accessed to determine subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study population&#xD;
      from the aforementioned IRB proposal has already agreed to be contacted for future studies.&#xD;
      Once the target population and an equal set of age, sex-, race- and Tanner Stage-matched&#xD;
      controls are identified, the patients will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a target population and an equal set of age-, sex- and Tanner Stage-matched controls are&#xD;
      identified from the CPR, prospective participants will be informed about the study. Initial&#xD;
      contact will occur by way of a prepared telephone script (Appendix 2&amp;3). Those that agree to&#xD;
      participate will be scheduled for a visit to the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (PCRU) for&#xD;
      a screening visit. At this visit, the study will be explained to the patient/patient's&#xD;
      family, permission/assent/consent (Appendix 4&amp;5) will be obtained, a physical examination&#xD;
      (including Tanner staging), and screening laboratory testing will be performed. Participants&#xD;
      for whom permission/assent/consent has been obtained and inclusion criteria are met, will be&#xD;
      scheduled to come back to the PCRU for the first study drug day. If the participant is&#xD;
      currently on a statin, they will not be scheduled to come back for at least 6 days for Study&#xD;
      Drug Day #1 (washout period). This visit will need to be conducted following a minimum of 6&#xD;
      days and up to 14 days for these participants. If the participant is not currently on a&#xD;
      statin then they can be scheduled anytime after their screening visit is complete. The visit&#xD;
      will consist of a physical examination, lab tests, placement of an indwelling venous cannula&#xD;
      for serial blood draws as outlined below and administration of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. The total amount of blood drawn (screening labs and PK samples)&#xD;
      for the trial will be 60.6 ml, which is well within the guidelines placed at CMH ORI for&#xD;
      children &gt; 25 kg. This study will require an overnight stay in the PCRU in order to obtain&#xD;
      all necessary plasma levels. Following a minimum of 6 days and up to 14 days after the study&#xD;
      day #1 (washout period), the participating subject will be brought back to the PCRU for&#xD;
      another single dose pharmacokinetic study involving the second drug with the same procedure&#xD;
      and sampling scheme as conducted in study day #1.&#xD;
