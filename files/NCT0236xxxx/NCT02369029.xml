  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study where BAY1238097 is given to humans. Impact of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate if patients with advanced cancer show clinical benefit under the treatment with&#xD;
      BET(Bromodomain and extraterminal domain family ) inhibitor.Patients with solid tumors (all&#xD;
      comers) and lymphoma will receive the study drug treatment in an escalation scheme (no&#xD;
      placebo group) to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      BAY1238097. the relative bioavailability of Liquid Service Formulation and tablets will be&#xD;
      determined&#xD;
&#xD;
      After MTD is defined, patients with solid tumors (all comer, hepato cellular carcinoma, lung&#xD;
      cancer, NUT(nuclear protein in testis)-midline carcinoma), melanoma and lymphoma will be&#xD;
      enrolled A separate escalation scheme will be applied to patients with leucemias, and at the&#xD;
      maximal tolerated dose, patients with AML amd multiple myeloma will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study will also assess the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic parameters&#xD;
      of BAY1238097 and tumor response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAY1238097 will be given twice weekly as oral application. Treatment will be stopped if the&#xD;
      tumor continues to grow, if side effects occur, wich the patient cannot tolerate or if the&#xD;
      patient decides to withdraw from the treatment.&#xD;
