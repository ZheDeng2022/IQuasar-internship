      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and deliverability of the CRE8&#xD;
      sirolimus-eluting stent and the RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with de novo coronary artery lesions.&#xD;

      This study consists of a randomized controlled cohort and a long stent observational cohort.&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferior, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The control device (RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent) used in this trial&#xD;
      was provided by Medtronic. RESOLUTE zotarolimus-eluting stent has been already approved by&#xD;
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) in 2009 and become commercially available in&#xD;
      Chinese market. 400 patients enrolled in this trial will be randomly assigned to CRE8 group&#xD;
      (n=200) and RESOLUTE group (n=200) in a 1:1 ratio. The long stent observational trial plans&#xD;
      to enroll 30 consecutive patients. Patients in the observational cohort will receive the long&#xD;
      CRE8 stent with length 38mm.All 430 patients will be required to receive clinical follow-up&#xD;
      at 1 month, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and annually up to 5 years after the procedure, and&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up at 9 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint is in-stent LLL&#xD;
      at 9 months after the procedure, and the secondary endpoints are device success rate,&#xD;
      device-oriented cardiovascular composite endpoint, patient-oriented cardiovascular composite&#xD;
      endpoint and stent thrombosis.&#xD;
