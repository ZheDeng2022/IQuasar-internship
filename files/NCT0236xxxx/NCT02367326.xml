  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) groups together Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC). Its prevalence is high representing approximately 0.4% of the population. The peak&#xD;
      incidence for these diseases ranges between 2 and 30 years of age with a second peak for CD&#xD;
      recently reported at 60. These diseases develop over time into complications requiring in 2/3&#xD;
      of cases surgical resection procedures in CD and colectomy in over 20% of cases. Cohort data&#xD;
      has recently shown that the early use of azathioprine from the first year would decrease the&#xD;
      need for surgery. Aside from biologics, azathioprine is the most widely used&#xD;
      immunosuppressant in IBD management. Its metabolism is highly variable in the overall&#xD;
      population since over 10% of patients are slow metabolizers and 15% fast metabolizers. This&#xD;
      explains partly treatment failures and side effects with thiopurines. A lot of research has&#xD;
      shown that metabolite measurement of azathioprine (6-TGN end methylated derivatives) could be&#xD;
      used clinically even if these results remain controversial. In fact, their positive&#xD;
      predicative value (PPV) in clinical response does not exceed 60%. This costly testing cannot&#xD;
      be done everywhere, is not reimbursed by national health services, and may not be used in&#xD;
      some countries. It is, however, key in order optimize these drugs at a time when only two&#xD;
      anti-TNFs are possible in the event of failure on thiopurines. Older studies have shown that&#xD;
      MCV and lymphonenia could be markers for thiopurine impregnation. Recently, an American study&#xD;
      provided a mathematic formula enabling to achieve over 80% PPV for the clinical response on&#xD;
      AZA but this calculation needs to be confirmed and it is, moreover, patented (costly).&#xD;

      We suggest developing a predictive score for clinical thiopurines in IBD based on routine lab&#xD;
      data obtained when monitoring patients on thiopurines. This initial work will enable to&#xD;
      identify clinical and/or lab factors in order to develop a score based on an international,&#xD;
      multicenter, cross-section study. Two hundred patients with treatment failure on thiopurines&#xD;
      will be included and at least as many in clinical remission on thiopurines. A subsequent&#xD;
      longitudinal study, over all recruiting centers will enable to validate the score. Finally, a&#xD;
      prospective study will assess the clinical impact of the optimization of this score in&#xD;
      patients sustaining a treatment failure on thiopurines. This score - if confirmed - will&#xD;
      subsequently be at no additional cost in the management of patients on thiopurines.&#xD;
