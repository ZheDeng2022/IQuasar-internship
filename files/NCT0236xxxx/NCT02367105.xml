    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in Veterans is greater than in the general population, and even&#xD;
      more so among users of the VA Health Care System. In addition, the population of obese older&#xD;
      Veterans is rapidly increasing as more baby boomers become senior citizens. In older&#xD;
      Veterans, obesity exacerbates the age- related decline in physical function and causes&#xD;
      frailty which predisposes to admission to a VA chronic care facility. However, the optimal&#xD;
      clinical approach to obesity in older adults is controversial because of the concern that&#xD;
      weight loss therapy could be harmful by aggravating the age-related loss of muscle mass and&#xD;
      bone mass. In fact, the MOVE (Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any&#xD;
      guidelines for eligible Veterans if they are 70 or older. It is possible that the addition of&#xD;
      testosterone replacement to lifestyle therapy will preserve muscle mass and bone mass and&#xD;
      reverse frailty in obese older Veterans and thus prevent their loss of independence and&#xD;
      decrease demand for VA health care services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is not only highly prevalent among Americans, but even more so among Veterans using&#xD;
      VA medical facilities. Failure to assist Veterans in managing weight and sedentary lifestyle&#xD;
      affects current treatment and increases future demand for VA health care services. Decreased&#xD;
      muscle mass with aging and the need to carry extra mass due to obesity make it particularly&#xD;
      difficult for obese older Veterans to function independently and results in frailty leading&#xD;
      to increased nursing home admissions and increased morbidity and mortality. Data from&#xD;
      preliminary studies showed that lifestyle therapy resulting in weight loss in this&#xD;
      understudied population improves physical function and ameliorates frailty. However, this&#xD;
      improvement in physical function is modest at best and most obese older adults remain&#xD;
      physically frail. More importantly, there are concerns that lifestyle therapy may exacerbate&#xD;
      underlying sarcopenia and osteopenia from weight loss- induced loss of lean body mass and&#xD;
      bone mineral density (BMD). As a result, most geriatricians are reluctant to recommend&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy that includes weight loss in obese frail elderly patients although the&#xD;
      combination of weight loss and exercise is recommended as part of standard care for obese&#xD;
      patients in general. Thus, it is not surprising that among Veterans, the MOVE (Managing&#xD;
      Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any guidelines for eligible Veterans if they&#xD;
      are 70 or older. In addition to overeating and lack of exercise, age-related decline in&#xD;
      anabolic hormone (i.e. testosterone) may contribute to sarcopenia and osteopenia, which in&#xD;
      turn is exacerbated by obesity. Indeed, preliminary studies discovered that obese older men&#xD;
      had markedly low levels of serum testosterone at baseline which remained low throughout the&#xD;
      duration of lifestyle therapy. Because testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to&#xD;
      increase muscle mass and BMD, it is therefore likely that concomitant testosterone&#xD;
      replacement during lifestyle therapy in obese older adults would preserve lean body mass and&#xD;
      BMD, and reverse frailty. Accordingly, the optimal management to the problem of sarcopenic&#xD;
      obesity and frailty might require a comprehensive approach of a combination of lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention and the correction of anabolic hormone deficiency. Therefore, the primary goal&#xD;
      of this proposal is to conduct a randomized, comparative efficacy, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (for testosterone) trial of the effects of 1) lifestyle therapy (1%&#xD;
      diet-induced weight loss and exercise training) + testosterone replacement therapy versus 2)&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement (testosterone placebo) in obese (BMI e 30&#xD;
      kg/m2) older (age e 65 yrs) male Veterans. The investigators hypothesize that 1) lifestyle&#xD;
      therapy + testosterone replacement will cause a greater improvement in physical function than&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy without concomitant testosterone replacement; 2) lifestyle therapy +&#xD;
      testosterone replacement will cause a greater preservation of fat-free mass and thigh muscle&#xD;
      volume than lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement, 3) lifestyle therapy +&#xD;
      testosterone replacement will cause a greater preservation in BMD and bone quality than&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement, and 4) lifestyle therapy + testosterone&#xD;
      replacement will cause a greater reduction in intramuscular proinflammatory cytokines than&#xD;
      lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement. The overarching hypothesis across aims is&#xD;
      that a multifactorial intervention by means of lifestyle therapy plus testosterone&#xD;
      replacement will be the most effective approach for reversing sarcopenic obesity and frailty&#xD;
      in obese older male adults, as mediated by their additive effects in suppressing chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, and stimulating muscle and bone anabolism. Obesity in older adults, including&#xD;
      many aging Veterans, is a major public health problem. In fact, the public health success&#xD;
      that has occurred in recent years could be in danger if lifestyles of older adults are&#xD;
      neglected. The novel health outcomes and mechanistic-based data generated from this proposed&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) will have important ramifications for the standard of care&#xD;
      for this rapidly increasing segment of the aging Veteran population.&#xD;

        <title>Change in the Physical Performance Test</title>
        <description>The primary functional outcome is the modified physical performance test, which includes seven standardized tasks (walking 50 ft, putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg tests) plus two additional tasks (climbing up and down four flights of stairs and performing a 360-degree turn). The score for each task ranges form 0 to 4; a perfect score is 36. Higher scores indicate better physical function.</description>
