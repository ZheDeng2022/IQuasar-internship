      The proposed study seeks to compare usual care and two different interventions for caregivers&#xD;
      (CGs) of Veterans with dementia that are brief and administered by telephone. In the first&#xD;
      intervention, care management (i.e., assistance from a nurse or social worker who works with&#xD;
      the CG and Veteran's primary care providers), support, psychoeducation, and skills training&#xD;
      are tailored to each individual CG and delivered on an individual basis. In the second&#xD;
      intervention, care management is tailored and delivered to each individual CG, but support,&#xD;
      psychoeducation, and skills training are delivered (also by phone) in a group format. This&#xD;
      study will allow us to examine the added benefit of participating in a CG group that provides&#xD;
      mutual peer support and feedback. The investigators also will evaluate the extent to which&#xD;
      spousal vs. adult child CGs respond differently to the two interventions. Findings will help&#xD;
      refine patient/CG-centered care management and support programs designed to facilitate access&#xD;
      to services and improve the quality of life of Veterans with dementia and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Existing interventions for informal caregivers (CGs) of care recipients (CRs)&#xD;
      with dementia vary on multiple dimensions (e.g., content, administration time, mode of&#xD;
      delivery), and findings indicate that these programs are effective in improving CG and CR&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators' team has developed and evaluated two CG programs that are unique&#xD;
      in that they are relatively brief (i.e., 3 months) and rely solely on telephone&#xD;
      administration. The original program, the Telehealth Education Program (TEP), provides CG&#xD;
      support, psychoeducation, and skills training in a group format. The second program adapted&#xD;
      the original TEP to be delivered to individual CGs and includes collaborative care management&#xD;
      services. Key components of this CR/CG-centered program include direct collaboration among&#xD;
      teams of care managers, primary care providers (PCPs), and CGs. The decision to develop an&#xD;
      individually-tailored, collaborative care program was partly in response to the success of&#xD;
      collaborative care models with other patient populations and the fact that the majority of&#xD;
      individuals with dementia receive their healthcare from their PCPs. Nonetheless, an&#xD;
      individually-delivered program lacks the benefits derived from the mutual peer support and&#xD;
      feedback provided by group-based interventions. What remains to be determined, therefore, is&#xD;
      whether modifying the individually-delivered care management program to deliver TEP in a&#xD;
      group format is more effective than the individually-delivered program alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of the project include: a) testing the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of 2 delivery models (individual TEP + individual care management vs. group TEP + individual&#xD;
      care management) of a telephone-based, collaborative dementia care intervention for CGs, and&#xD;
      b) exploring whether the individual or individual + group intervention is more&#xD;
      effective/acceptable among spousal vs. adult children CGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To meet these objectives, the investigators will use a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      control group, repeated measures (i.e., baseline, 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up) design.&#xD;
      Participants will include 405 CGs (spouses and children 18 years of age and older) of&#xD;
      Veterans diagnosed with dementia and receiving routine clinical care at two VA sites. CGs&#xD;
      will be recruited for participation if they live with and/or provide 4+ hours of care/day.&#xD;
      CGs will be randomly assigned to usual care, the individual intervention, or the individual +&#xD;
      group intervention. The main objectives of both interventions are to facilitate resource&#xD;
      connection and provide education, psychosocial support, and care management for individuals&#xD;
      caring for Veterans with dementia, thereby improving access to and use of non-institutional&#xD;
      services, rates of guideline adherent care, and CG/CR outcomes. In both interventions, CGs&#xD;
      will receive education, continuous support, skills training, and monitoring of Veterans'&#xD;
      medication adherence, symptoms, and service needs. CGs will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      assessment battery of standardized measures of CR- and CG-characteristics. Veterans' clinical&#xD;
      medical records (including cost data) also will be evaluated for screening and clinical data&#xD;
      collection purposes. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be the primary method used&#xD;
      to analyze the nested, longitudinal data.&#xD;
