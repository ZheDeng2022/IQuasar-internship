  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Pediatric Bipolar Registry (PBR) is to provide a comprehensive assessment&#xD;
      regarding the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder to children and&#xD;
      adolescents with any current mood state and/or children/adolescents who are offspring of a&#xD;
      parent with bipolar disorder (BD) type I or II and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data collected will be utilized to perform a retrospective chart review to include measure&#xD;
      outcomes and de-identified demographic information detailed in the attached case report&#xD;
      forms. In each case where a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II, or bipolar&#xD;
      disorder NOS is determined, the child/adolescent will be added to the PBR and provided with&#xD;
      information about local providers that are qualified to treat their diagnosis. Each subject&#xD;
      can elect to be notified about future research studies s/he may qualify for. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators will provide ongoing newsletters with useful information that addresses the&#xD;
      latest research underway in the field with the families. If requested, the investigators will&#xD;
      provide a written report to their current provider detailing our evaluation. The potential&#xD;
      for a breach in confidentiality always exists; however, information that is obtained will be&#xD;
      stored in password a protected database and locked file drawers in locked offices; data will&#xD;
      have identifying information sheered from it to prevent loss of confidentiality, and all&#xD;
      staff must sign confidentiality certificates. If child abuse is detected, the research team&#xD;
      is obligated to follow mandatory state reporting laws. To the investigators' knowledge, there&#xD;
      is no registry for Pediatric Bipolar Disorder in the city of Houston or the state of Texas&#xD;
      that provides the comprehensive evaluation that we are proposing for these children and&#xD;
      adolescents and their families. Therefore, this will be a novel service within this division&#xD;
      that will provide research to families and potential clients for providers managing these&#xD;
      families across the State of Texas.&#xD;
