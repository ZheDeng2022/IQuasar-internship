    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if 4-weeks ingestion of LycoRed (code&#xD;
      40051) product containing a mixture of tomato extract with carotenoids and phytochemicals by&#xD;
      endurance runners attenuates inflammation, muscle damage and soreness, and oxidative stress&#xD;
      during 24 hours recovery from a 2-h running bout.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized-crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, with N=20 endurance&#xD;
           runners. (May start with up to 26 subjects to ensure that 20 subjects complete all study&#xD;
           requirements). Subjects will ingest the supplement for 4 weeks prior to running 2 hours&#xD;
           at high intensity, washout for 2 weeks, crossover and ingest the supplement for 4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to running 2 hours at high intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 arms: LycoRed (code 40051) product and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the 3-day period prior to each running session, subjects will taper exercise&#xD;
           training and ingest a moderate-carbohydrate diet using a food list restricting high fat&#xD;
           foods and visible fats. Subjects will record all food and beverage intake during the&#xD;
           3-day period, with macro- and micro-nutrient intake assessed using the Food Processor&#xD;
           dietary analysis software system (ESHA Research, Salem, OR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise protocol: Subjects (overnight fasted) will run on laboratory treadmills at 70%&#xD;
           VO2max (~marathon race pace) for 1.5 hours followed by 30 minutes of downhill running&#xD;
           (10%) at the same intensity. The downhill running portion will induce delayed onset of&#xD;
           muscle soreness (DOMS). The run sessions will occur at 7:00-9:00 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected pre- and post-4 weeks supplementation, and immediately&#xD;
           post-, 1-h post-, and 24-h post-exercise. DOMS will be measured using a 10-point Likert&#xD;
           scale at each blood sampling time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERFORMANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female endurance runners in the Kannapolis/Charlotte, NC metropolitan area will&#xD;
           be recruited through mass advertising and direct email messages. Runners will also be&#xD;
           recruited during the Expo event the day before the Charlotte Marathon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study duration is 10 weeks, with 6 visits to the ASU-NCRC Human Performance Lab, two&#xD;
           exercise sessions, and 10 blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: 0-week, pre-study, baseline testing and orientation, early morning; provide&#xD;
           blood sample (overnight fasted). Subjects will sign the consent form, fill in the&#xD;
           ACSM/AHA screening questionnaire, and complete a training history questionnaire.&#xD;
           Subjects will be tested for VO2max (treadmill graded exercise test with metabolic&#xD;
           measurement), and body composition (BodPod). Subjects will be given instructions for&#xD;
           taking the supplements, and initiate supplementation (4-weeks) (with capsules contained&#xD;
           in supplement trays to improve compliance). Subjects will be asked to maintain their&#xD;
           normal training schedules, and will record weekly training distances in a log.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: 4-weeks, ~7:00 am, overnight fasted; provide blood pre- and post-running for 2&#xD;
           h (70% VO2max), and 1-h post run.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: ~7:00 am, overnight fasted, 24-h post-run: provide blood sample. Start 2-week&#xD;
           washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4: 6-weeks, provide blood sample (~7:00 am, overnight fasted), crossover to&#xD;
           opposite study arm, and start 4-week supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5: 10-weeks, (~7:00 am, overnight fasted), provide blood pre- and post-running for&#xD;
           2 h (70% VO2max), and 1-h post run.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6: 24-h post-run (~7:00 am, overnight fasted), provide final blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LycoRed (code 40051) product with mixture of selected carotenoids and phytochemicals in&#xD;
           medium chain triglycerides (MCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: Each softgel will be identical looking, containing the vehicle of MCT oil with&#xD;
           all active ingredients removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One serving (1 capsule) of the supplement will be consumed daily during the morning&#xD;
           meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
