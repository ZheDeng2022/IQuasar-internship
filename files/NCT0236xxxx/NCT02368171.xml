      Research design: This is a controled prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed and untreated OSA with total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;5/h,&#xD;
      and control (AHI&lt;5/h) will be recruited from the Long Beach VA sleep center. Controls are&#xD;
      subjects without OSA or other sleep disorders and no sign of pulmonary hypertension based on&#xD;
      echo. The investigators also measure pulmonary artery pressure by 2D Echo and exclude patient&#xD;
      with any sign of left heart dysfunction. PH will be defined as RVSP &gt; 35 mmHg or mean PA&#xD;
      pressure&gt;25 mmHg. The investigators will recruit subjects with and without PH and OSA in&#xD;
      three separate groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. group one : OSA+ PH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. group two: normal individual with no OSA and no PH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. group three: OSA with no PH Pulmonary function test will be done to exclude patients&#xD;
           with underlying lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria is: Age &gt;20, AHI &gt;5, AHI &lt;5 (as control), RVSP &gt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA&#xD;
      pressure&gt;25 mmHg, RVSP &lt; 35 mmHg OR Mean PA pressure &lt; 25 mmHg (as control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they had known peripheral vascular disease, liver disease,&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia, inflammatory disease, active infection, or if they were pregnant, on&#xD;
      therapy for OSA, on chronic steroid treatment, or younger than 20 years of age, patients with&#xD;
      left heart failure (systolic or diastolic), patients are on PH medications including&#xD;
      sildenafil, active smokers, COPD and asthma, active infection or inflammatory disease and&#xD;
      collagen vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal polysomnography will be performed and scored according to the American Academy of&#xD;
      Sleep Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled Carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured with a calibrated fuel cell type&#xD;
      electrochemical device with sensor sensitivity of 1 ppm. The mean of three reproducible&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded and corrected for ambient CO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) will be measured. At each testing session, at least three&#xD;
      flow-regulated FENO measurements will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will repeat 2D Echo and measurements of above factors after 3 months of&#xD;
      CPAP treatment. The investigators also check patient's compliance with the treatment by&#xD;
      downloading data off of their CPAP device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be informed of the experimental procedures, which is approved by the Human&#xD;
      Investigation Committee of the VA-Long Beach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that HO pathway causing perturbation of pulmonary endothelial&#xD;
      function by inhibition of nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA is associated with PH, but exact mechanism is not well known. In the past, I have shown&#xD;
      that increased endogenous CO in the setting of elevated NO concentration is associated with&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction in patient with OSA. Therefore, the investigators sought to&#xD;
      investigate the roles of HO and NO pathways in patients with OSA associated with PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It addresses a fundamental gap in our understanding of how OSA results in increase the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure and if substantiated, will provide the basis for the design and&#xD;
      testing of new approaches to prevention and treatment of OSA.&#xD;
