      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects Brown adipose tissue&#xD;
      (BAT) function in humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by thyroid&#xD;
      hormone supplementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism is a frequent endocrine disorder, the prevalence of subclinical disease being&#xD;
      4.3% and of overt disease being 0.3%. Patients suffering from hypothyroidism frequently&#xD;
      complain of increased cold sensitivity and involuntary weight gain, indicating changes in&#xD;
      energy expenditure and response to cold challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has regained attention as an energy expending tissue.&#xD;
      While it was previously thought to be of no or negligible relevance in human adults, recent&#xD;
      studies clearly demonstrated the presence and metabolic activity of BAT in human adults. Upon&#xD;
      activation of BAT by the sympathetic nervous system intracellular lipid stores are rapidly&#xD;
      depleted. The generated free fatty acids fuel beta-oxidation and the respiratory chain within&#xD;
      the mitochondria and activate at the same time uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This protein acts&#xD;
      as a protonophore, allowing the flux of protons along the electrochemical gradient into the&#xD;
      inner mitochondrial matrix instead of transferring their energy to adenosine triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP)-synthase. The short circuiting of the oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria&#xD;
      leads to highly active cellular respiration and generation of heat. Basic research highlights&#xD;
      the importance of thyroid hormone in the development and function of BAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently been shown that hyperthyroidism exerts activating effects on BAT in adult&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study whether hypothyroidism negatively affects BAT function in&#xD;
      humans and whether BAT function can be restored to normal by thyroid hormone supplementation.&#xD;
