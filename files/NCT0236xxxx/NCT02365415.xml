      This is a research study to assess whether an oral medication can benefit some patients being&#xD;
      treated for peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS), which is narrowing of the blood vessels that&#xD;
      send blood to the lungs (pulmonary arteries).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the investigators treat PPS by dilating the&#xD;
      narrowed segments of pulmonary arteries using balloon catheters. Sometimes the investigators&#xD;
      also place stents which are mesh tubes that help keep the narrowed vessel open. Some stents&#xD;
      suffer from in-growth of tissue into the stents which causes recurrent obstructions inside&#xD;
      the stent (i.e. making the opening inside the mesh tube narrow again), so called in-stent&#xD;
      stenosis (ISS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use a medication that is approved for use in children (for a&#xD;
      different purpose) to decrease the amount of cell ingrowth inside the stents (i.e. decrease&#xD;
      the problematic in-stent stenosis). The medication is called rapamycin, also known as&#xD;
      sirolimus (trade name Rapamune). It has antiproliferative properties which means that it&#xD;
      slows down cell division which the investigators believe cause the recurrent narrowing inside&#xD;
      stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapamycin is a medicine that can be taken by mouth as a liquid or pill or via a feeding tube.&#xD;
      There will still be a need for interventions in the catheterization laboratory but the&#xD;
      investigators hope that by taking this medicine some children would need fewer&#xD;
      catheterizations in the future. Our early experiences with a few patients who have been&#xD;
      treated with rapamycin due to in-stent stenosis in the pulmonary arteries suggest that it may&#xD;
      be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients and families who are interested in possibly trying this new approach&#xD;
      will be randomized to sirolimus or no sirolimus. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      developement of ISS over time between these groups, in a hope to learn whether oral sirolimus&#xD;
      reduces ISS development.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a research study to assess whether an oral medication can benefit some patients being&#xD;
      treated for peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS). PPS, which can be associated with several&#xD;
      different congenital heart diseases, is narrowing of the blood vessels that send blood to the&#xD;
      lungs (pulmonary arteries) to pick up oxygen before returning the blood to the heart and the&#xD;
      rest of the body. The right ventricle (RV) is the pumping chamber that pumps blood into the&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries and the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPS can result in high RV pressure, reduced blood flow to one lung, or uneven blood flow&#xD;
      within either lung. If left untreated these abnormalities place affected children at risk for&#xD;
      abnormal RV function and failure of this pumping chamber which may be seen as decreased&#xD;
      ability to do exercise, heart rhythm problems, fainting, or even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the investigators treat PPS by dilating the&#xD;
      narrowed segments of pulmonary arteries using balloon catheters. Sometimes the investigators&#xD;
      also place stents which are mesh tubes that help keep the narrowed vessel open. Some stents&#xD;
      suffer from in-growth of tissue into the stents which causes recurrent obstructions inside&#xD;
      the stent (i.e. making the opening inside the mesh tube narrow again), so called in-stent&#xD;
      stenosis (ISS). This effectively causes recurrent PPS and recurrence of the associated risks&#xD;
      listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use a medication that is approved for use in children (for a&#xD;
      different purpose) to decrease the amount of cell ingrowth inside the stents (i.e. decrease&#xD;
      the problematic in-stent stenosis). The medication is called rapamycin, also known as&#xD;
      sirolimus (trade name Rapamune), and has been used safely for many years in children and&#xD;
      adults after organ transplantation to prevent rejection of the new organ. It has&#xD;
      antiproliferative properties which means that it slows down cell division which the&#xD;
      investigators believe cause the recurrent narrowing inside stents. By slowing down the cell&#xD;
      division the investigators believe that the stents will stay open instead of becoming&#xD;
      narrowed inside again. This medicine is found in many types of stents placed in adults with&#xD;
      narrowed arteries around the heart (so called drug-eluding stents) and appear to help keep&#xD;
      these blood vessels open after heart attacks (or to prevent heart attacks). Such stents are&#xD;
      currently not available for pulmonary arteries; therefore the investigators give the medicine&#xD;
      by mouth instead (which has also been used in adults with stents in narrowed arteries around&#xD;
      the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapamycin is a medicine that can be taken by mouth as a liquid or pill or via a feeding tube.&#xD;
      There will still be a need for interventions in the catheterization laboratory but the&#xD;
      investigators hope that by taking this medicine some children would need fewer&#xD;
      catheterizations in the future. The investigators believe it may help lessen the risk of&#xD;
      recurrent in-stent stenosis and the associated problems listed above. Our early experiences&#xD;
      with a few patients at BCH who have been treated with rapamycin due to in-stent stenosis in&#xD;
      the pulmonary arteries suggest that it may be helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients and families who are interested in possibly trying this new approach&#xD;
      will be randomized to sirolimus or no sirolimus. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      developement of ISS over time between these groups, in a hope to learn whether oral sirolimus&#xD;
      reduces ISS development.&#xD;
