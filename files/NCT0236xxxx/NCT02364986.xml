  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two standard and a few second line treatments for RRMS. Since the disease cannot be&#xD;
      cured by these existing treatments and all treatment options have significant limitations,&#xD;
      there is the need to develop new treatment strategies to improve therapy of patients with&#xD;
      RRMS. We developed a RIG-I ligand as a new therapeutic strategy for patients with MS. The&#xD;
      RIG-I ligand functions partially via induction of Interferon beta (IFN-b), but has advantages&#xD;
      over therapy with recombinant IFN-b. Identification of suitable biomarkers to monitor&#xD;
      treatment with RIG-I ligand and to guide the dose steps would help to increase the safety of&#xD;
      the volunteers in the early clinical trials with RIG-I ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESI study is designed to analyse immune readouts and potential biomarkers such as type I&#xD;
      IFN levels, type I IFN dependent immune activation and miRNA expression following Rebif or&#xD;
      Avonex (Interferon beta 1a) application. Rebif is applied s.c. at a dose of 44 µg three times&#xD;
      a week (on day 1,3,5 and 8), and Avonex i.m. at a dose of 30µg once a week (on day 1 and 8),&#xD;
      as they are routinely used in RRMS-therapy. The immune readouts are assessed on day 1, 3, 5&#xD;
      and 8 immediately before application of Rebif/Avonex and on day 1 and 8 at 1 / 6 / 12 /24 hrs&#xD;
      after Rebif/Avonex application by analysing blood samples. Since studies of the RIG-I ligand&#xD;
      will start in healthy volunteers and will be continued in MS patients we need data from both&#xD;
      populations since they could show significant differences in response to IFN-b. Thus, the&#xD;
      RESI study includes healthy volunteers, RRMS-patients already under Rebif/Avonex treatment,&#xD;
      and RRMS-patients who have to yet started a therapy with Rebif/Avonex.&#xD;

      Study subjects receive either Rebif or Avonex. Rebif is applied s.c. at a dose of 44 µg on&#xD;
      day 1, day 3, day 5 and day 8, Avonex i.m. at a dose of 30µg on day 1 and 8. Blood samples&#xD;
      are taken before application and on day 1 and 8 at 1 / 6 / 12 /24 hrs after Rebif/Avonex&#xD;
      application to analyse the occuring immune response. The total duration of the trial for the&#xD;
      individual subject are 9 days. An MRI ist performed before the first application of IMP and&#xD;
      at the end of the study to investigate the correlation of Rebif/Avonex application and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
