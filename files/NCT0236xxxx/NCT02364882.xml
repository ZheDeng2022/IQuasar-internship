    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, open-label, within-subject dose-escalation study evaluating&#xD;
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of SST-6006 in healthy postmenopausal women. Three dose&#xD;
      levels of SST-6006 and a placebo regimen will be evaluated: 1 g (0 mg of sildenafil), 1 g (50&#xD;
      mg of sildenafil), 2 g (100 mg of sildenafil), and 4 g (200 mg of sildenafil). Doses will be&#xD;
      administered sequentially and will be separated by a 14-16 day washout period. All 3 dose&#xD;
      levels and the placebo will be applied both externally and internally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Subject eligibility will be determined through Screening evaluations. Screening evaluations&#xD;
      will include a review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, medical and Ob-Gyn history; full&#xD;
      physical and gynecological examinations (including vulvar-vaginal examination); Pap smear;&#xD;
      vital signs (supine); orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate; laboratory assessments&#xD;
      (chemistry, hematology, prothrombin time, FSH and urinalysis); concomitant medication use;&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG); serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) antibodies, sexually transmitted infection (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia), Herpes&#xD;
      (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies; and urine drug screen. The&#xD;
      Screening visit will occur up to 28 days before Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each dose level, safety from the first 2 subjects dosed will be evaluated prior to dosing&#xD;
      the remainder of subjects at that dose level. If results indicate safety issues (defined as a&#xD;
      known occurrence of an event of orthostatic hypotension (up to 8 hours post dose) and/or any&#xD;
      score above 0 using the 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale in the first 2 subjects, an&#xD;
      additional 2 subjects will be dosed and safety data evaluated. If no additional safety&#xD;
      problems are found, the remaining subjects will be dosed at that level. If safety issues are&#xD;
      found in the second 2 subjects dosed, no further dosing will occur and the prior dose level&#xD;
      will be considered the maximum tolerated dose. In addition, any subject who experiences&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension at any point in the study or has a vulvar-vaginal irritation score&#xD;
      above a 0 using the 4 point Vulvar-vaginal Irritation Scale at any dosing level will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and not proceed to the next level. An additional review of the&#xD;
      safety data upon completion of dosing at each level will be done to determine if dose&#xD;
      escalation is warranted. Safety decisions will be made by the Principal Investigator (PI) and&#xD;
      the Medical Monitor based on their clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first day of dosing will be considered Day 1. Subjects will be housed in the clinic for&#xD;
      the duration of each Treatment Period to allow for collection of the PK samples up to 32&#xD;
      hours post-dose and the completion of all discharge procedures.&#xD;

             any of the following: weak, moderate, and strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and&#xD;
             CYP2C9 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4: ketoconazole, clarithromycin, verapamil, diltiazem, St.&#xD;
             John's Wort / CYP2C9: fluconazole, oxandrolone, fluvastatin, and metronidazole). Any&#xD;
             prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, or herbal products taken recently or&#xD;
             currently being taken will be screened by study personnel prior to study enrollment to&#xD;
             confirm such drugs do not inhibit or induce the 2 enzymes listed above. If the subject&#xD;
             takes any prescription or OTC drugs at the direction of a health care provider that&#xD;
             are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, that provider should be consulted&#xD;
             before medications are stopped for the purposes of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has positive findings from the urine drug screen (e.g., amphetamines,&#xD;
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and opiates).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has positive serologic findings for sexually transmitted infection (syphilis,&#xD;
             gonorrhea, chlamydia), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has had an active genital herpes infection (blisters or vesicles) at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has participated in any clinical research study evaluating another&#xD;
             investigational drug or therapy within 30 days before Day 1 (or 6 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational agent, whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has any abnormal findings on vulvar-vaginal examination performed during the&#xD;
             physical and gynecological exams at Screening (e.g., genital skin breaks, irritation,&#xD;
             dermatoses, or lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject is using any intravaginal or vulvar therapies, aside from study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subject has used any topical (e.g. vaginal) hormone replacement therapy in the past&#xD;
             three months&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subject has genital piercings or plans to get genital piercings during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Subject has a vaginal infection including bacterial vaginosis (see Section 11.1.5) or&#xD;
             a yeast infection. The diagnosis of yeast infections should be made by the PI based on&#xD;
             the physical and gynecological exams; the objective is to exclude women that are&#xD;
             symptomatic. If the woman is not complaining of symptoms but the PI observes&#xD;
             discharge, than the vaginal wet mount test should also be performed to confirm a&#xD;
             diagnosis of yeast infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Subject has hypersensitivity to any ingredients in the study medication or placebo&#xD;
             (see Tables 6 and 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria checked prior to dosing for each dosing session:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has consumed grapefruit, grapefruit-containing products, Seville oranges, or&#xD;
             products containing Seville oranges (e.g., orange marmalade) within 3 days before&#xD;
             dosing in each Treatment Period. If so they should be rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has had an acute disease state (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea)&#xD;
             within 7 days before Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has any abnormal findings on vulvar-vaginal examination (e.g., genital skin&#xD;
             breaks, irritation, dermatoses or lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must continue to not have clinical evidence of a sexually transmitted disease&#xD;
             or a vaginal infection and must be asymptomatic of yeast and bacterial vaginosis (BV).&#xD;
             If a subject presents with a sexually transmitted disease, vaginal, yeast or a BV&#xD;
             infection during the study period, and the PI decides that treatment is required, the&#xD;
             subject will be excluded for further participation in the study except if the subject&#xD;
             has a yeast or BV infection which could be treated with Monistat one day topical&#xD;
             treatment followed by a minimum of a two day washout for a yeast infection or 2 day&#xD;
             oral tinidazole (i.e., Tindamax) for a BV infection. Treatment Period visits can be&#xD;
             rescheduled to allow for treatment of yeast and BV infection.&#xD;
