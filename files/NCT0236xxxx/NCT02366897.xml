    <textblock>
      The project is aimed at addressing the fundamental issue in antipsychotic therapeutics -the&#xD;
      balance between mental state benefits and neurological risks.The latter cannot be&#xD;
      overestimated and clinical skills in themselves are inadequately sensitive to refine&#xD;
      practice. With all current and &quot;pipeline&quot; antipsychotics based on central dopamine blockade,&#xD;
      there is little prospect that therapeutics can be improved by advances in pharmacology alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project uses, for the first time, technology that is not only simple, real-life and&#xD;
      user-friendly but &quot;modern&quot; and socially held in high regards. The proposal depends on&#xD;
      patients receiving antipsychotic medication where clinically indicated. At all times,&#xD;
      subjects will receive clinically-indicated therapy. The major ethical issue will relate to&#xD;
      the issue of informed consent in those suffering from major psychiatric disorder. This is a&#xD;
      routine consideration in psychiatric practice and the investigators will seek guidance on&#xD;
      this from the Consultant Psychiatrist responsible for potential participants and would not&#xD;
      proceed with initial approaches in cases of doubt or absence of capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot/feasibility study with no intention to utilise the data for commercialisation&#xD;
      of the device or to expand the CE (Conformité Européenne) marking.&#xD;

      The proposed methodology is based on use of a computer tablet and modified pen. While these&#xD;
      instrumental elements are common-place and widely accepted in modern life, they are not so in&#xD;
      the context of formal clinical assessment of motor function in psychiatric patients. They are&#xD;
      also novel to clinicians. The first stage will involve recruitment of 20 patients i) under&#xD;
      the age of 50 (to reduce the likelihood of idiopathic Parkinson's disease): ii) of mixed,&#xD;
      balanced genders: iii) right-handed: iv) basic writing competence: v) English as first&#xD;
      language: vi) suffering from an acute psychotic episode. These subjects will have been on&#xD;
      stable doses of antipsychotic medication of any sort for at least 2 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      seated in a comfortable writing position at a table and presented with a graphic tablet and a&#xD;
      modified digitizer pen with a wired connection to an operator computer. The assessor will sit&#xD;
      slightly behind and to one side out of the subject's view. To familiarise subjects with the&#xD;
      technique, they will be asked to a) draw repetitive overlaid circles b) write their name and&#xD;
      address, at a speed comfortable to them. They will then be asked to produce the 8 character&#xD;
      'el' text sequence ('elelelel') 10 times and to write a short, standard sentence : &quot;Today is&#xD;
      a nice day for the time of year&quot;. The examiner will then say to the subject the nursery&#xD;
      rhyme, 'Mary had a little lamb...etc&quot; and ask the subject to write it spontaneously from&#xD;
      memory. Finally, they will be asked to copy a standard short paragraph from a written page.&#xD;
      On conclusion, they will be asked to complete a brief 10cm line, Likert scale of&#xD;
      satisfaction, assessing the test situation as 'easy/difficult:&#xD;
      'pleasurable/non-pleasurable':'acceptable/non-acceptable'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREDICTION : participants will find the procedures easy, pleasurable and acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 groups of 10 patients, complying with criteria i)-vi) above, but who have not been exposed&#xD;
      to antipsychotic medication for at least 3 months (oral formulations) or 6 months (depot&#xD;
      formulations) but in whom antipsychotic medication is now indicated. Groups will comprise&#xD;
      consecutive consenting patients prescribed one of two commonly utilised antipsychotics : the&#xD;
      high potency, risperidone, and the low potency, quetiapine. Dosages will be determined&#xD;
      clinically by the responsible medical officers who will be asked to maintain a standard&#xD;
      pattern of escalations : twice weekly and within the first 2 weeks of exposure (but not dose&#xD;
      restricted). They will also be asked to avoid additional medications for drug-induced&#xD;
      parkinsonism though these may be used on an as required 'rescue' basis. Other medications can&#xD;
      be utilised as clinical need determines. Following informed consent, and prior to initiation&#xD;
      of treatment, subjects will undertake baseline clinical assessments comprising : a&#xD;
      standardised assessment of mental state (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale - PANSS); a&#xD;
      standard clinical evaluation of extrapyramidal neurological status (the Extrapyramidal&#xD;
      Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS); a standard questionnaire of subjective state (the Subjective&#xD;
      Well-Being on Neuroleptics Scale - SWNS - designed to pick up later potential medication&#xD;
      effects). They will then complete the instrumental component as above. Assessments will be&#xD;
      completed twice weekly during the escalation phase (2 weeks) and weekly thereafter (up to 4&#xD;
      weeks) on the day before increases are implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREDICTION : instrumental methods will prove highly sensitive to the development of&#xD;
      extrapyramidal side-effects and significantly more so than the standard clinical examination:&#xD;
      AND : extrapyramidal effects will significantly precede the onset of antipsychotic efficacy&#xD;
