  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II study will assess the impact of pre-conditioning on migration and&#xD;
      survival among newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients who have undergone definitive&#xD;
      resection and completed standard temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment, as well as the&#xD;
      impact of tetanus pre-conditioning and basiliximab together on survival. After completing&#xD;
      standard of care radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ, patients will be randomized to 1 of 3&#xD;
      treatment arms: 1). receive cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific dendritic cell (DC) vaccines with&#xD;
      unpulsed (not loaded) DC pre-coinditioning prior to the 4th vaccine; 2). receive CMV-specific&#xD;
      DC vaccines with Tetanus-Diphtheria Toxoid (Td) pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine;&#xD;
      3). receive basiliximab infusions prior to the 1st and 2nd DC vaccines along with Td&#xD;
      pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine. A permuted block randomization algorithm using a&#xD;
      1:1:1 allocation ratio will be used to assign patients to a treatment arm. Randomization will&#xD;
      be stratified by CMV status (positive, negative), with the assignment to arms I and II being&#xD;
      double-blinded. Effective March 2017, randomization to Group III has been terminated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 100 patients with resected, newly-diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      Grade IV GBM will be enrolled in this study with the expectation that approximately 79&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to subsequent treatment after completion of radiation treatment&#xD;
      with concurrent temozolomide. Effective March 2017, randomization to Group III has been&#xD;
      terminated. All consented patients will undergo a leukapheresis after resection for harvest&#xD;
      of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs) for generation of DCs. Patients will then receive&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (RT) and concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m^2/d.&#xD;
      Patients should start RT within approximately 6 weeks of surgery. Patients who experience&#xD;
      progressive disease during radiation, are dependent on steroid supplements above physiologic&#xD;
      levels at time of first vaccination, are unable to tolerate TMZ, or whose DCs or PBLs fail to&#xD;
      meet release criteria will be withdrawn from the study and replaced and will not undergo&#xD;
      repeat leukapheresis. For patients whose initial leukapheresis yields less than 3 vaccines,&#xD;
      repeat leukapheresis may be obtained a minimum of 2 weeks from the previous leukapheresis&#xD;
      (and may be repeated as needed) if pre-pheresis blood work is within the Apheresis Center's&#xD;
      parameters and as long as this does not cause a significant delay in treatment for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After RT and concurrent TMZ, patients will then be randomized and begin the initial cycle of&#xD;
      TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 150-200mg/m^2/d for 5 days at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating oncologist 4 (± 2) weeks after completing RT. The study cycle of TMZ comprises a&#xD;
      targeted dose of 150-200mg/m^2/d for 5 days every 5 (± 1) weeks. All patients will receive up&#xD;
      to a total of 10 DC vaccines given bilaterally at the groin site unless progression occurs.&#xD;
      DC vaccines will be given intradermally (i.d.) and divided equally to both inguinal regions.&#xD;
      DC vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2.&#xD;
      Patients will then be vaccinated in conjunction with subsequent TMZ cycles every 5 (± 1)&#xD;
      weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT at the discretion of the treating oncologist.&#xD;
      DCs will be given on day 21 ± 2 days of each TMZ cycle. DC vaccinations will continue during&#xD;
      TMZ cycles up to a total of 10 unless progression occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first DC vaccination, all patients will receive immunization with 0.5 mL of Td&#xD;
      intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen.&#xD;
      Those assigned to Group III will receive basiliximab 20 mg infusions 1 week before the 1st&#xD;
      and 1 week before the 2nd vaccine. At the time of the fourth DC vaccine, patients will&#xD;
      receive pre-conditioning per the assigned group (Group I-unpulsed DCs i.d.; Group II- Td&#xD;
      i.d.; Group III-Td i.d.). A single dose of Td toxoid (1 flocculation unit, in 0.3 milliliters&#xD;
      (mLs) of saline for a total volume of 0.4 mLs) or 0.4 mLs of 1 x 10^6 autologous unpulsed DCs&#xD;
      in saline will be administered to a single side of the groin, and 0.4 mLs of saline&#xD;
      administered to the contralateral side 12-24 hours prior to the fourth DC vaccine, which is&#xD;
      always given bilaterally at the groin site. Patients in Groups I and II will then receive&#xD;
      111In-labeled DCs to compare the effects of different skin preparations on DC migration&#xD;
      followed by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography and Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT)&#xD;
      imaging immediately and at 1 and 2 days after injection. Group III will not undergo migration&#xD;
      studies. Groups I and II will be double blinded. Group III will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific&#xD;
      assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and further DC&#xD;
      generations 4 (± 2) weeks after vaccine #3. Patients will be imaged bimonthly without&#xD;
      receiving any other prescribed anti-tumor therapy. Patients will undergo an additional&#xD;
      leukapheresis for generation of DCs if needed to continue vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo&#xD;
      stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be&#xD;
      obtained separately. However, if tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor&#xD;
      progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and pp65 antigen&#xD;
      escape at the tumor site.&#xD;
