      Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an acute viral zoonotic disease. Neurologic manifestations of&#xD;
      the disease range from subtle changes in behavior to serious problems, including blindness,&#xD;
      ataxia, weakness, and movement disorders. The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) occurs&#xD;
      primarily in Southeast Asian. It is spread by culicine mosquitoes, most often Culex&#xD;
      tritaeniorhynchus. Its incubation period is 5 to 15 days.In China, JE epidemic peak season is&#xD;
      from June to August and it mainly occurred in children. JE has ranked in top ten infectious&#xD;
      diseases according to either incidence or mortality. JE vaccines are used to protect the&#xD;
      population especially young children and infants from encephalitis diseases. Live attenuated&#xD;
      JE vaccines are now widely used. They are directly produced from attenuated virus which may&#xD;
      increase the possibility of virulence reversion. Many developed countries are using purified&#xD;
      model inactivated JE vaccine. Therefore, it is an inevitable trend in China to develop a new&#xD;
      generation of safer and more effective inactivated vaccine to prevent and control epidemic&#xD;
      encephalitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In order to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of Vero cell-derived inactivated Japanese&#xD;
      Encephalitis vaccine produced by Shandong Hengye Biotech Co., Ltd. a single-centre phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial is planned to conduct in healthy infants aged 6-11 months in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two immunization programs. 600 healthy infants aged 6-11 months will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an experimental vaccine or a positive control vaccine at&#xD;
      day 0,7. Another 300 healthy infants aged 6-11 months will be recruited to receive an&#xD;
      experimental vaccine at day 0,28. All of them will be received a third dose as booster&#xD;
      vaccination 12 months later.&#xD;
