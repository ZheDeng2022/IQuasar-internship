      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Gigaxonin gene lets the body make a protein chemical called Gigaxonin. Nerves need&#xD;
      Gigaxonin to work properly. Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN) causes a shortage of functional&#xD;
      Gigaxonin. Nerves stop working normally in people with GAN. This causes problems with walking&#xD;
      and sometimes with eating, breathing, and many other activities. GAN has no cure. Over time,&#xD;
      GAN can shorten a person s life. Researchers want to see if a gene transfer treatment may&#xD;
      help people with GAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if a gene transfer is safe and shows potential to help people with GAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People age 5 and older with GAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 2 months participants must live full-time within 100 miles of the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened by phone and in person. They will take many tests. Some&#xD;
           are listed below. Their medical records will be reviewed. Their caregivers may be&#xD;
           contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a total of about 30 visits, weekly, monthly, and then yearly over&#xD;
           15 years. They will include many of the tests below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and nervous system exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve, lung, heart, and eye tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scans, nerve biopsies, and spinal taps. Participants will be sedated for some tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech, memory, muscle, and mobility tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy (small sample removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take many medicines. Some require intravenous lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get the gene transfer through an injection by spinal tap into their&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid, which flows around the brain and spinal cord. The genes are packed&#xD;
           in a modified virus that carries the genes to cells in their body. Participants safety&#xD;
           is not guaranteed.&#xD;

      This is a non-randomized, phase I, escalating single dose study to assess the safety of the&#xD;
      gene transfer vector scAAV9/JeT-GAN through intrathecal delivery to the brain and spinal cord&#xD;
      of patients with Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN, OMIM No.256850). The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety of the vector following intrathecal delivery in 10-12 GAN&#xD;
      patients who are five years of age or older and have mutations which result in positive&#xD;
      cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) status. This terminology is used in other&#xD;
      genetic disorders with residual protein expression that would allow for immunotolerance,&#xD;
      amenable to enzyme or gene replacement such as in Pompe disease. Mutations which could result&#xD;
      in CRIM-positive status include missense mutations, in-frame deletions or duplications or&#xD;
      hypomorphic mutations (such as regulatory domain mutations which are leaky such as incomplete&#xD;
      splice site mutations). This protocol was amended to include a single GAN patient, 5 years or&#xD;
      older CRIM negative patient ('null mutation patient'). Secondary objectives of this study are&#xD;
      1) to assess motor and sensory disease symptoms pre- and post-treatment, 2) to examine&#xD;
      neuropathology in peripheral nerve biopsies in response to treatment, 3) to examine&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to conduct CSF studies to assess response to treatment, and 4)&#xD;
      to assess vector shedding following vector administration. The first eligible CRIM positive&#xD;
      patient will have a genetic diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy, will be seven years of age&#xD;
      or older, and will have a forced vital capacity of greater than or equal to 50 percent&#xD;
      predicted value on pulmonary function testing. This study will be the first-in-human trial of&#xD;
      intrathecal delivery of scAAV9/JeT-GAN. The primary endpoint will be safety, based upon&#xD;
      adverse events and standard laboratory safety evaluations. Secondary endpoints will include&#xD;
      clinical and physiological assessment of motor and sensory function, possible rescue of&#xD;
      disease pathology in peripheral nerves, examination of CSF in response to treatment, and&#xD;
      assessment of vector shedding following administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAN is a chronic neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease pathologically characterized&#xD;
      by enlarged axons with disordered microtubules and intermediate filaments. The disease&#xD;
      pathology is due to loss-of-function mutations in the GAN gene, which encodes the protein&#xD;
      gigaxonin. Gigaxonin plays a major role in the maintenance of orderly and functional&#xD;
      intermediate filament (IF) architecture, which is critical for axonal function. Onset of&#xD;
      symptoms, usually at 3-4 years of age, generally manifests with a slightly awkward gait&#xD;
      (sensory ataxia). In the peripheral nervous system the disease progressively affects&#xD;
      predominantly sensory and motor nerves. By the end of the 2nd decade of life, patients&#xD;
      typically are wheelchair dependent with limited use of the arms and little to no use of their&#xD;
      legs. During the 2nd decade a tracheostomy or other means of ventilation, as well as a&#xD;
      feeding tube, are often necessary. Death normally occurs in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life.&#xD;
      There are no statistics on the incidence of the disease, but it is considered extremely rare&#xD;
      and there are no effective treatments for the disease. Intrathecal delivery of a gene&#xD;
      transfer vector carrying a normal copy of the GAN Gene to the spinal cord and brain offers a&#xD;
      potentially effective treatment for GAN.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to participate in this study, the subject must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 5 years or older; however, the first patient will be no younger than 7 years of&#xD;
             age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Genetic diagnosis of GAN: Identified mutation(s) on both copies of the GAN gene. If&#xD;
             the mutations found are not previously reported, then predictive software tools will&#xD;
             be utilized in order to determine the degree of certainty that the mutation is&#xD;
             predicted to be pathogenic (disease causing). This will also be evaluated in the&#xD;
             context of the clinical and pathological phenotype (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Onset of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with GAN, including at least abnormal&#xD;
             gait, as well as physical examination findings including at least abnormal gait,&#xD;
             abnormal sensation (proprioceptive and/ or vibration sensation and/or positive&#xD;
             Romberg), and some quantifiable weakness on manual muscle testing examination (score&#xD;
             of &lt; 5/5 strength of at least one tested muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Men capable of fathering a child must agree to use barrier contraception (combination&#xD;
             of a condom and spermicide) or limit activity to post-menopausal, surgically&#xD;
             sterilized, or contraception-practicing partners, for 6 months after administration of&#xD;
             investigational product. Women and girls of childbearing potential (and parents/&#xD;
             guardians for minors &lt; 18) must agree to have urine human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             testing performed to rule out the possibility of pregnancy at each visit. Those women&#xD;
             who are sexually active must also agree to use barrier contraception as well or limit&#xD;
             activity to surgically sterilized or contraception-practicing partners for 3-6 months&#xD;
             after the administration of the investigational product. This limitation is set&#xD;
             because of the unknown risk associated with the administration of this vector genome&#xD;
             to offspring. There is no known risk of sexual transmission of the vector.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing and able to give informed consent if &gt;17 years of age and assent if &gt;7 years&#xD;
             of age. For patients ages 7-17, parents or legal guardians must also consent to the&#xD;
             child s participation in the study. Adults who lack capacity to consent but who have&#xD;
             an appropriate surrogate may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness to undergo a nerve biopsy at baseline and at 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Agree to reside within 100 miles of the study site for at least 2 months following&#xD;
             treatment (may include housing on NIH campus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION/DEFERRAL CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to participate in this study, a patient MUST NOT have the following&#xD;
        characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Forced vital capacity less than or equal to 50% of predicted value&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. History of brain or spinal cord disease that would interfere with the LP procedures,&#xD;
             CSF circulation, or safety assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted CNS catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any prior participation in a study in which a gene therapy vector or stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation was administered to avoid any ambiguity in the safety assessment&#xD;
             resulting from lingering effects from a previous treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Immunizations of any kind in the month prior to the study to avoid lingering immune&#xD;
             effects that could be confusing in the safety assessment of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Current use of medication (e.g., levothyroxine, vitamin A supplementation, oral&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Evidence of cardiomyopathy on history, exam, or additional testing (echocardiogram or&#xD;
             electrocardiogram) or other cardiac disease that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would deem the subject unsafe to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of diabetes or clinically significant abnormality of glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
             fasting blood sugar&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Positive purified protein derivative testing for tuberculosis&#xD;
