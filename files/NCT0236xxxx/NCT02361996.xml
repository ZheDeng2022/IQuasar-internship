  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a common understanding that patients with coronary heart disease are suffering, among&#xD;
      others, from reduced myocardial perfusion. In order to increase (normalize) the reduced&#xD;
      perfusion, when a conventional approach failed, coronary bypass surgery, coronary vessel&#xD;
      dilatation or stenting are performed. The similar situation with reduced myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      may be found in patients with stenosis of the aortic valve, where aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      may increase myocardial perfusion by left-ventricular remodelling. However, there is&#xD;
      presently no method established to measure myocardial perfusion quantitatively and&#xD;
      noninvasively before and after a therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of pre- and post-therapeutic myocardial perfusion, quantitatively measured in&#xD;
      ml/100g/min would strengthen the indication for specific therapeutic approach and enable an&#xD;
      objective control of effectiveness of the applied therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a measureable difference in quantitative myocardial perfusion values before (lower)&#xD;
      and after (higher) interventional or surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to measure myocardial perfusion by advanced CT technology (e.g. iCT&#xD;
      256 Brilliance ) quantitatively in ml/100g/min in three groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before and after coronary bypass surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Before and after coronary vessel dilatation/stenting&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Before and after aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will not assign specific interventions to the subjects of these three&#xD;
      groups. Therefore, the research is strictly observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study to measure quantitatively myocardial perfusion in the above mentioned three&#xD;
      groups of patients with simultaneous control and registration of all essential, physiological&#xD;
      determinants of myocardial perfusion immediately prior to each CT study. The CT myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion measurements will be performed directly after the indication for intervention or&#xD;
      surgery and on the last day before discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the collected data (determinants) inclusively the CT-studies will be anonymised and&#xD;
      archived on a local server. The investigators of the University of Medical Computed Sciences&#xD;
      and Technology, Innsbruck / Austria will perform the evaluation of the myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      measurements and all statistical analysis independently of the CT-studies performing&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reliability of the hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On phantom studies simulating myocardial perfusion measurements and in animal studies we&#xD;
      could confirm that using advanced CT technology (as e.g. &quot;iCT 256 Brilliance&quot;) it is possible&#xD;
      to measure myocardial perfusion in absolute values - in ml/100g/min. These myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion measurements did not differ from those received by EBCT (Electron Beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography). Based on these experimental results and based on the quantitative measurements&#xD;
      of myocardial perfusion in 1500 patients studied by EBCT at the Medical University of Graz&#xD;
      the hypothesis may be done that using the above mentioned iCT 256 technology, it should be&#xD;
      possible to measure myocardial perfusion quantitatively in a daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed according to the international regulations (ISO 14144:212-01) and&#xD;
      in agreement with the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot;. After oral and written explanation of the&#xD;
      planned study and by signing the study agreement by patient and by responsible physician,&#xD;
      patients participation is voluntary. The patients participating can leave the study any time&#xD;
      without negative sequels for him or her. There is no financial restitution for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about (very rare) possible allergoid-toxic reactions during and&#xD;
      after intravenous contrast agent application. For possible emergency well trained medical&#xD;
      staff and equipment is present. About renal insufficiency: renal failure (creatinin clearance&#xD;
      &lt;60ml/min [GFR (Glomerulo Filtration Rate)will be calculated according the&#xD;
      Cockroft-Gault-Formula, GFR {ml/min}=((40-age)*weight{kg}*0,85{only for women}]/serum&#xD;
      creatinin [mg/dl]*72) above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applied X-ray dose (CT) may and will be reduced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      reduction of KV (kilovoltage) from 120 to 100 or 80 in dependance of patients weight,&#xD;
      reduction of MA (milliamper)by using iterative image reconstruction allgorithm (iDOSE). These&#xD;
      technical approaches represent the best possibility to reduce X-ray dose for the patient. As&#xD;
      the coronary heart disease with stenotic lesions above 50% is a disease mainly of an elderly&#xD;
      men (in female mostly after menopause and in male after 50 years of age) the risk for X-Ray&#xD;
      dose related genetic defects is very low. The expected applied X-Ray doses by the above&#xD;
      mentioned approach will be very low and therefore the risk of X-Ray induced malignancy may be&#xD;
      regarded as very low too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study to measure quantitatively myocardial perfusion in the above mentioned three&#xD;
      groups of patients with simultaneous control and registration of all essential, physiological&#xD;
      determinants of myocardial perfusion immediately before the CT study. The CT myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion measurements will be performed directly after the indication for intervention or&#xD;
      surgery and on the last day before discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the collected data (determinants) including the CT-studies will be anonymised and&#xD;
      archived on a local server. These anonymised data may be approached only by members of Graz&#xD;
      University of Technology, Institute of Health Care Engineering who will perform the&#xD;
      evaluation of the myocardial perfusion measurements and the statistical analysis&#xD;
      independently of the CT-studies performing physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In supine position on CT table the blood pressure and the heart rate will be measured&#xD;
           and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In all patients a standard native cardiac CT for evaluation of coronary calcification by&#xD;
           Agatston score will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In all patients myocardial perfusion will be measured in inspiration and contrast agent&#xD;
           application where by the amount of contrast agent and the applied dose is related to&#xD;
           patient weights as shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient Perfusion 210mg Iodine/ml Expected dose weight [kg] / [kV/mAs] / [ml] / per&#xD;
           shoot [mSv](milli Sievert)&#xD;
&#xD;
           &lt;60 80/80 40 0.21/ 60-70 80/100 50 0.25/ 70-90 80/120 60 0.30/ 90-100 100/90 70 0.40/&#xD;
           &gt;100 100/100 80 0.43&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Standard cardiac CT will be performed to evaluate coronary arteries and left ventricular&#xD;
           volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. In supine position on CT table the blood pressure and the heart rate will be measured&#xD;
           and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the myocardial perfusion succeeds in all slices with visible left&#xD;
      ventricular myocardium using a modification of the formula described by K.Miles and model&#xD;
      based approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the left ventricular volumes succeeds by use of the vendors software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All personal and measured data will be anonymised, tested, analysed and evaluated in Graz&#xD;
      University of Technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numerical values will be expressed as mean +/- SD (min, max, 95% CI). p-values of 0.05&#xD;
      will be regarded statistically significant. Paired test and or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests&#xD;
      will be used. X² analyses will be used to compare categoric variables. Additionally&#xD;
      correlation analyses (Pearson, Spearman) will be performed and method of classification (pre-&#xD;
      vs. postoperative) will be applied. All calculation will be done by SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago,&#xD;
      Il, USA) or by Matlab statistic toolbox or R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neccessary number of studied patients is based on the results of 64 patients studied&#xD;
      before and after aortic valve replacement in whom the myocardial perfusion was measured&#xD;
      before and four months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative: Mean=74 (SD=21) ml/100g/min Post 4 Months: Mean=78 (SD=20) ml/100g/min.&#xD;
      Difference= +4ml/100g/min. With 0.5 supposed correlation of the measured values the standard&#xD;
      deviation of the differences may be estimated as 20ml/100g/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By alpha=0.05, 1-beta=0.80, n=209 patients is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the pre- and post surgery evaluation, statistical models explaining the&#xD;
      influence of collected data on the quantitaitve myocardial perfusion will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a drop-out quote of 10% may be expected it is neccessary to study in each group of&#xD;
      patients 230 patients. This means total 690 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be registered in database and tested for plausibility.&#xD;
