      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug Roflumilast (Daliresp) is used to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      this drug decreased the blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin (Januvia) is&#xD;
      a medication presently used to treat diabetes. Researchers think that both of these drugs may&#xD;
      decrease blood sugar by causing an increase in the hormone GLP-1.This hormone is secreted in&#xD;
      the small intestines and stomach and is also known as an incretin. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      how these drugs affect blood sugar, insulin, and other hormones in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of Roflumilast (Daliresp) and Sitagliptin (Januvia) on blood sugar&#xD;
           and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand GLP-1 and other gut hormones. This may lead to new treatments for&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers age 21 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This study will require one screening visit and four study visits, scheduled about 3-weeks&#xD;
      apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit requires participants to arrive after fasting for 10 hours and have the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, physical exam, height, weight, blood pressure measurements and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Participants will drink an orange-flavored&#xD;
           drink containing 75 grams of sugar (300 calories). A blood sample will be taken prior to&#xD;
           drinking the beverage and 2-hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about risk for depression or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits 1to 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will arrive the evening prior and blood work will be done to confirm&#xD;
           eligibility. They will not eat or drink anything except water starting at 8:00 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 6:30 a.m. the following day, an I.V. (small plastic tube) will be placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein and used to take 20 blood samples over a period of about 11 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive one of the following study medication/placebo groupings in&#xD;
           random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg pill; and 1 placebo pill&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sitaglipitin (Januvia) 100 mg pill; and 1 placebo pill&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg pill; and Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg pill&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. 2 placebo pills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One hour later, they will have a 10-hour mixed meal test (MMT). They will be asked to&#xD;
           drink a nutritional shake (Ensure Plus). Blood samples will be taken over the next 10&#xD;
           hours to measure blood sugar, insulin and other hormones. At the end of the test, they&#xD;
           will be given a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about side effects and symptoms. They will receive a&#xD;
           follow-up phone call within 10 days.&#xD;

      Objectives and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to investigate whether phosphodiesterases are involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from L cells in humans. We hypothesize that: (1)&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) inhibitor (roflumilast) enhance GLP-1 secretion from L cells;&#xD;
      (2) PDE4D inhibitor (roflumilast) and DPP4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) have synergistic effect on&#xD;
      increasing the amount of circulating active GLP-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy adults, age 21-55, will be recruited for this study. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Each subject will serve as his/her own&#xD;
      control and each person will have four different study visits spaced about 3 weeks apart.&#xD;
      During each visit, they will receive one of the following medications (oral route) in random&#xD;
      order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg + Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg + Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Roflumilast (Daliresp) 500 mcg + Sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10-hr mixed-meal test will be administered 1 hour after the medications and frequent&#xD;
      blood-samplings will be done over 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary clinical data have shown that phosphodiesterase inhibitors improved glycemic&#xD;
      control in type 2 diabetes, and pre-clinical animal data have shown that phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      inhibitors enhanced GLP-1 secretion from L cells. The application of novel, pre-clinical&#xD;
      findings to an understanding of human biology and pathobiology is of fundamental and critical&#xD;
      importance. This study will give us a better understanding of the regulators of GLP-1&#xD;
      secretion in humans, and this new understanding may lead to new treatments for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
