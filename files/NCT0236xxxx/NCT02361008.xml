      The purpose of this study is to investigate the security and validity of transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography(TEE)-guided perventricular device closure(TPDC) through minithoracotomy in&#xD;
      treatment of infundibular ventricular septal defect(IVSD) with asymmetric occluder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular septal defect(VSD) , which accounted for about 20% of all congenital heart&#xD;
      defects (CHDs) , is among the most common congenital heart malformations，among which&#xD;
      infundibular ventricular septal defects(IVSD) is the least common type(18%）.Multiple names&#xD;
      for IVSD are in use. They can also be labeled conal VSD, subpulmonary VSD, subarterial VSD,&#xD;
      doubly committed VSD, intracristal VSD，or supracristal VSD. These multiple denominations are&#xD;
      not attached to specifically different anatomic subtypes.At present, the main methods to&#xD;
      treat the specific anatomic condition contain conventional surgical repair(SR) and&#xD;
      transcatheter interventional closure. The former need extracorporeal circulation，thus the&#xD;
      side effects of extracorporeal circulation are inevitable，such as on the central nervous&#xD;
      system, respiratory system, urinary system, etc. Although the latter has the characteristics&#xD;
      of minimally invasive, patients should be exposed in X-ray withstanding potential risk of&#xD;
      radiation. On the other hand，there are limits with age for patients who underwent&#xD;
      transcatheter closure because of small vessel size. Fully developed blood vessels are to&#xD;
      reach a certain diameter, but children need be up to 3 years old or so. In addition,the&#xD;
      aortic valve was easily injured by wire and atrioventricular block was reported.Since the&#xD;
      surrounding structure is complicated and the defect is too high, device closure of an IVSD is&#xD;
      difficult to succeed in transcatheter approach. Traditional repair via cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass(CBP) is widely used to treat this kind of diseases. Past decade，with the development&#xD;
      of technology and society，TEE-guided surgical occlusion through minithoracotomy was used to&#xD;
      treat CHDs in an increasing number of popularity，avoiding the inherent risks of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass and radiation,etc. But it is rarely reported to treat IVSD by&#xD;
      minimally invasive perventricular device closure without CBP.&#xD;
