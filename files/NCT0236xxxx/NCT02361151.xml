  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high rates of childhood obesity in the US demand innovative and cost-effective weight&#xD;
      gain prevention tools; mobile applications (apps) represent one such solution. Using a&#xD;
      randomized design, the mFIT study tests the effectiveness of using commercially available&#xD;
      apps and a physical activity (PA) monitoring device (Tech, n=50 parent-child dyads) compared&#xD;
      to the apps and PA device plus a mobile website and theory-based family intervention that&#xD;
      encourages increased parent-child communication about PA and healthy eating as well as family&#xD;
      behavior change (Tech+, n=50 parent-child dyads).&#xD;

      Objectives and Significance. Finding scalable and engaging ways to disseminate obesity&#xD;
      treatment and prevention for children has been challenging. Mobile applications (apps) are an&#xD;
      engaging way to involve children in health behavior changes, capitalizing on the portability&#xD;
      and affordability of delivering health information via mobile devices and the opportunity to&#xD;
      use gaming to make health information entertaining. Previous research by our team, including&#xD;
      a systematic review of commercially available mobile apps for family weight loss, physical&#xD;
      activity, and healthy eating as well as a pilot test of commercially available apps and&#xD;
      physical activity monitoring devices with parent-child dyads, revealed significant gaps in&#xD;
      the available mobile tools. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of using&#xD;
      commercially available apps and a physical activity monitoring device (Tech) compared to the&#xD;
      apps and physical activity device plus a mobile website and theory-based family intervention&#xD;
      that encourages increased parent-child communication about physical activity and healthy&#xD;
      eating and family behavior change (Tech+). The two programs will be administered remotely via&#xD;
      email, mobile apps, and a mobile website to parent-child dyads (child 9-12 years old), using&#xD;
      over a 3-month intervention period. Parent-child dyads will be randomized to the two&#xD;
      behavioral interventions: Tech (50 dyads) or Tech+ (50 dyads). Our proposed research has two&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of an evidence-based mobile intervention with enhanced&#xD;
      parent/child communication (Tech+) versus commercially available products (physical activity&#xD;
      and healthy eating apps, physical activity device) alone (Tech) for improvements in physical&#xD;
      activity and healthy eating in parents and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the impacts of evidence-based family intervention on parent-child relationship&#xD;
      quality and communication about physical activity and healthy eating.&#xD;
