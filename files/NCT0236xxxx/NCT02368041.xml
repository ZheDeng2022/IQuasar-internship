    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized study.The study staff will use the InSpectraTM tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (StO2) monitor manufactured by Hutchinson Technology to measure baseline&#xD;
      StO2 levels after applying the noninvasive probe to the thenar eminence. After a stable&#xD;
      reading is obtained, a blood pressure cuff will be inflated 40 mmHg above the obtained&#xD;
      systolic pressure and the rate of desaturation (Rdes; % × sec-1) will be recorded. After 3&#xD;
      minutes or once the StO2 level comes to zero (whichever is earlier), the cuff pressure will&#xD;
      be released and the rate of reperfusion (Rres; % × sec-1) will be measured. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that heart failure in children causes a baseline lower thenar tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (StO2), a faster rate of desaturation (Rdes) and a prolonged rate of reperfusion&#xD;
      (Rres). The investigators also hypothesize that these changes will correlate with the&#xD;
      severity of heart failure. The results of this study will provide groundwork for studies&#xD;
      looking at correlation of therapy modification based on the combination thenar StO2 and&#xD;
      clinical presentation.&#xD;

      Heart failure patients seen in the Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent on the day of their evaluation. The&#xD;
      primary pediatric cardiologist following the patient will evaluate the need for regular&#xD;
      investigations like blood work, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. The study staff will&#xD;
      use the InSpectraTM tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) monitor manufactured by Hutchinson&#xD;
      Technology to measure the baseline StO2 level after applying the noninvasive probe to the&#xD;
      thenar eminence. After a stable reading is obtained a blood pressure cuff will be inflated 40&#xD;
      mmHg above the obtained systolic pressure and the rate of desaturation (Rdes; % × sec-1) will&#xD;
      be recorded. After 3 minutes or once the StO2 level comes to zero (whichever is earlier), the&#xD;
      cuff pressure will be released and the rate of reperfusion (Rres; % × sec-1) will be&#xD;
      measured. Similar measurements will be obtained from an otherwise healthy cohort of children&#xD;
      who present to the Pediatric Cardiology Congenital Heart Center for evaluation of a heart&#xD;
      murmur or chest pain. The patient's treating physician and care providers will be blinded to&#xD;
      the study test results. All clinical care will be at the discretion of the patient's treating&#xD;
      physicians. Only StO2 levels will be obtained using the non-invasive probe placed on the&#xD;
      thenar eminence for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
