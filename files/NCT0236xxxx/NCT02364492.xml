      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) can be obtained&#xD;
      following 2 administrations of the MAG-Tn3 + AS15 cancer vaccine when administered at doses&#xD;
      of 30 µg, 100 µg or 300 µg IM every three weeks.&#xD;

      This study is a three dose level open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study Phase I of&#xD;
      the safety of the vaccine candidate MAG-Tn3 + AS15 administered to patients with HER2&#xD;
      negative, high-risk localized breast cancer in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 30 patients will be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 or 6 patients in the 1st dose level (30 µg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 or 12 patients in the 2nd dose level (100 µg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 or 12 patients in the 3rd dose level (300 µg) The clinical study phase I is composed&#xD;
           of a vaccination period of about 4 months (16 weeks) and a follow-up period of 36 months&#xD;
           (3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive one of the three escalating doses of MAG-Tn3 in combination with a&#xD;
      fixed dose of AS15 adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will receive 6 vaccine injections, administered by intramuscular injection with a&#xD;
      3-weeks interval between injections. Each patient will be followed 36 months after the last&#xD;
      injection. The follow-up period is composed of a short-term follow-up period of 6 months and&#xD;
      a long-term follow-up period of 30 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 visits will be required for each patient. Clinical data and blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected for analysis for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study data will be recorded for each patient on source documentation and then&#xD;
      entered on electronic CRFs (eCRFs) using a proprietary Electronic Data Capture (EDC) Clinical&#xD;
      Data Base Software System. The eCRF data are to be entered by site personnel trained in EDC&#xD;
      data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of patient records, the&#xD;
      accuracy of entries on the e-CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study drug is being stored,&#xD;
      dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institut Pasteur or designated CRO will conduct data management. Data entered into EDC will&#xD;
      be housed in a central database. Changes will be tracked to provide an audit trail.&#xD;
      Interactive data checks will be carried out as applicable during the data entry process.&#xD;
      Additional data checks are programmed to identify errors in the SAS datasets. Applicable&#xD;
      queries based on the SAS datasets will be added to EDC for resolution by data management&#xD;
      personnel. At the conclusion of the study, when all data have been entered and source&#xD;
      document verified, with no outstanding queries remaining, the Investigator of each site will&#xD;
      be required to electronically sign each patient's casebook to confirm that the data for each&#xD;
      patient are complete and accurate and consistent with the patient's source documents. The&#xD;
      data will then be locked to prevent further editing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference&#xD;
      List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical&#xD;
      history/current medical conditions and adverse events terminology will be coded using the&#xD;
      Medical dictionary for regulatory activities.The newest version of the dictionary at data&#xD;
      base lock will be used.&#xD;
