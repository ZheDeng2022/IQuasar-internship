  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to evaluate an innovative approach to obesity. This study&#xD;
      will determine if behavioral treatment can be improved by 1) implementing a primary focus on&#xD;
      PA following initial weight loss treatment, and 2) using a novel, acceptance-based approach&#xD;
      to the promotion of PA.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adults who engage in lifestyle modification find it difficult to maintain a high level&#xD;
      of PA over the long-term, and most also find that weight regain is inevitable. The current&#xD;
      portfolio of available interventions does not adequately address these challenges. This&#xD;
      project is designed to test the effectiveness of an intervention that is specifically&#xD;
      designed to enhance the ability to maintain, in the long-term, a level of PA high enough to&#xD;
      achieve long-term weight loss maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, 300 obese adults will be recruited from the community and provided with 6&#xD;
      months of group-based, standard behavioral treatment for induction of weight loss (Phase I).&#xD;
      A 6-month Phase I was chosen so that all participants will have sufficient time to accomplish&#xD;
      initial weight loss before Phase II begins, allowing Phase II to truly be a test of weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance. In Phase II, participants will receive one of three interventions, to be&#xD;
      delivered for an additional 12 months: 1) behavioral treatment, with the standard emphasis on&#xD;
      maintaining changes in diet and PA (BT), 2) behavioral treatment, with a primary emphasis on&#xD;
      using these skills to maintain PA (BT-PA), or 3) acceptance-based behavioral treatment, with&#xD;
      a primary emphasis on using these skills to maintain PA (ABT-PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6 months, 18 months (end of treatment), 24 months&#xD;
      (6-month follow-up), and 36 months (18-month follow-up).&#xD;

    <measure>Exploratory Moderator: Emotional Overeating</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ). The EOQ is a six-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess the frequency of emotional overeating (Masheb &amp; Grilo, 2006). Participants rate their frequency of eating an &quot;unusually large amount&quot; over the prior 28 days in response to anxiety, sadness, loneliness, tiredness, anger, and happiness on a 7-point Likert scale: 0 = no days, 1 =1-5 days, 2 = 6-12 days, 3 = 13-15 days, 4 = 16-22 days, 5 = 23-27 days, and 6 = every day. Responses to the six items are averaged for a total score, with higher scores indicating more frequent emotional overeating. The EOQ has previously shown high internal consistency (alpha = 0.85) with test-retest reliability among individuals with Binge Eating Disorder (Masheb &amp; Grilo, 2006).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Moderator: Disinhibited Eating.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 18-item Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Cappelleri, Bushmakin, Gerber, Leidy, Sexton, Lowe, et al., 2009) was used to assess disinhibited eating behavior. The questionnaire consists of statements about food and participants rate the extent to which those statements apply to them on a 4-point Likert scale (definitely true, mostly true, mostly false, definitely false). The questionnaire has a well-validated three-factor structure (Cronbach's Î± of 0.78-0.94), which includes a domain measuring disinhibited eating behavior (Cappelleri, Bushmakin, Gerber, Leidy, Sexton, Lowe, et al., 2009). This subscale consists of 9 items, such as: &quot;Sometimes when I start eating, I just can't seem to stop.&quot; Higher scores indicate higher levels of disinhibited eating.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Moderator: Hedonic Hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hedonic Hunger. The Power of Food Scale (PFS) is a 15-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the tendency to eat for pleasure (rather than physiological hunger) based on cues from the environment (Lowe et al., 2009). Items measure participants' appetite-related thoughts, feelings, and motivations for highly palatable foods and consists of three subscales based on food proximity: (1) Food available in the environment but not physically present, (2) Food physically present but not yet tasted, and (3) Food tasted but not yet consumed. Examples of these items include, &quot;If I see or smell a food I like, I get a powerful urge to have some&quot; and &quot;Just before I taste a favorite food, I feel intense anticipation.&quot; Participants rated each of these statements on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores are an average of the 15 responses, with higher scores indicating greater hedonic hunger.</description>

    <measure>Exploratory Moderator: Appetitive Response to Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Appetitive Response to Exercise. Participants were asked to report which of the following described their experience in the past month: There is no relationship between my level of exercise and my appetite; Exercise helps me control my appetite - I am less hungry when I am exercising regularly; Exercise increases my appetite - I am more hungry when I am exercising regularly; Not applicable because not exercising. This single-item measure was constructed by the research team, as no pre-existing measure of this construct was identified.</description>

        <title>Exploratory Moderator: Emotional Overeating</title>
        <description>Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ). The EOQ is a six-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess the frequency of emotional overeating (Masheb &amp; Grilo, 2006). Participants rate their frequency of eating an &quot;unusually large amount&quot; over the prior 28 days in response to anxiety, sadness, loneliness, tiredness, anger, and happiness on a 7-point Likert scale: 0 = no days, 1 =1-5 days, 2 = 6-12 days, 3 = 13-15 days, 4 = 16-22 days, 5 = 23-27 days, and 6 = every day. Responses to the six items are averaged for a total score, with higher scores indicating more frequent emotional overeating. The EOQ has previously shown high internal consistency (alpha = 0.85) with test-retest reliability among individuals with Binge Eating Disorder (Masheb &amp; Grilo, 2006).</description>

        <title>Exploratory Moderator: Disinhibited Eating.</title>
        <description>The 18-item Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Cappelleri, Bushmakin, Gerber, Leidy, Sexton, Lowe, et al., 2009) was used to assess disinhibited eating behavior. The questionnaire consists of statements about food and participants rate the extent to which those statements apply to them on a 4-point Likert scale (definitely true, mostly true, mostly false, definitely false). The questionnaire has a well-validated three-factor structure (Cronbach's Î± of 0.78-0.94), which includes a domain measuring disinhibited eating behavior (Cappelleri, Bushmakin, Gerber, Leidy, Sexton, Lowe, et al., 2009). This subscale consists of 9 items, such as: &quot;Sometimes when I start eating, I just can't seem to stop.&quot; Higher scores indicate higher levels of disinhibited eating.</description>

        <title>Exploratory Moderator: Hedonic Hunger</title>
        <description>Hedonic Hunger. The Power of Food Scale (PFS) is a 15-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the tendency to eat for pleasure (rather than physiological hunger) based on cues from the environment (Lowe et al., 2009). Items measure participants' appetite-related thoughts, feelings, and motivations for highly palatable foods and consists of three subscales based on food proximity: (1) Food available in the environment but not physically present, (2) Food physically present but not yet tasted, and (3) Food tasted but not yet consumed. Examples of these items include, &quot;If I see or smell a food I like, I get a powerful urge to have some&quot; and &quot;Just before I taste a favorite food, I feel intense anticipation.&quot; Participants rated each of these statements on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores are an average of the 15 responses, with higher scores indicating greater hedonic hunger.</description>

        <description>Perceived Appetitive Response to Exercise. Participants were asked to report which of the following described their experience in the past month: There is no relationship between my level of exercise and my appetite; Exercise helps me control my appetite - I am less hungry when I am exercising regularly; Exercise increases my appetite - I am more hungry when I am exercising regularly; Not applicable because not exercising. This single-item measure was constructed by the research team, as no pre-existing measure of this construct was identified.</description>
