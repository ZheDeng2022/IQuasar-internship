    <textblock>
      Anticipating an increased use of statins in children and adolescents, it is imperative that&#xD;
      we understand the genetic and developmental characteristics affecting the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of statins in childhood and adolescence. Simply extrapolating pediatric&#xD;
      dosing guidelines from adult dose-exposure-response relationships fails to recognize the&#xD;
      potential impact of growth and development in pediatric patients, which may have important&#xD;
      clinical implications for drug efficacy or toxicity. Current evidence indicates that genetic&#xD;
      variation in the SLCO1B1 transporter is important for statin disposition and toxicity in&#xD;
      adults. The ontogeny of SLCO1B1 during human growth and development has not been well&#xD;
      characterized, and limited pediatric data indicate that the genotype-phenotype relationship&#xD;
      in children is the opposite of that observed in adults. Therefore, investigating the relative&#xD;
      roles of SLCO1B1 ontogeny and genetic variation in statin disposition and response is key to&#xD;
      determining the age at which the statin dose-exposure-response relationship mimics adults,&#xD;
      and has important implications for other medications transported by the SLCO1B1 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the first step in this process, our specific aims for the current investigation are 1) to&#xD;
      determine the effect of genetic variation of SLCO1B1 on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin&#xD;
      and simvastatin by comparing Cmax, AUC and elimination between children and adolescents with&#xD;
      2 functional SLCO1B1 alleles and those with one or more variant alleles, and 2) to determine&#xD;
      if the magnitude of the genetic effect on pravastatin pharmacokinetics (defined as Cmax, AUC&#xD;
      and elimination) is equivalent to the effect on simvastatin pharmacokinetics. As a secondary&#xD;
      aim, Cmax and AUC of pravastatin and simvastatin will be compared between children and&#xD;
      adolescents for each genotype group. These results will be utilized to determine the sample&#xD;
      size necessary to adequately power future studies characterizing the role of ontogeny on&#xD;
      statin disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this proposed investigation is to establish the role of genetic&#xD;
      variation in key transporters on the dose-exposure relationship of two commonly used statin&#xD;
      drugs in children. This study is the first step in a series of investigations aimed at&#xD;
      determining the mechanisms behind variations in physiologic response, clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      significant adverse effect risk that surround the statin drugs in children and adolescents.&#xD;

      The ultimate goal of this proposed investigation is to establish the role of genetic&#xD;
      variation and development in key transporters on the dose-exposure relationship of two&#xD;
      commonly used statin drugs in children. This study is the first step in a series of&#xD;
      investigations aimed at determining the mechanisms behind variations in physiologic response,&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and significant adverse effect risk that surround the statin drugs in&#xD;
      children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Trial Design 1.1. Investigational Agents Pravastatin 20 mg tablet (ages 8-13 years), 40 mg&#xD;
      tablet (&gt;14 years) Simvastatin 10 mg tablet (ages 8-17), 20mg (&gt;17 years) Commercial supplies&#xD;
      of pravastatin and simvastatin that are FDA approved for use in pediatric dyslipidemia will&#xD;
      be used. Pravastatin and simvastatin from the same source and lot will be used for all&#xD;
      subjects. The doses designated above are chosen according to previous adult and pediatric&#xD;
      data 26, 28-32, 41 and are consistent with current labeling for pravastatin and simvastatin.&#xD;
      Although fixed doses within a pre-specified age range will be used, dose data will be&#xD;
      analyzed corrected for weight (mg/kg) based on the patient's weight at time of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Risk/Benefits All subjects with a LDL &gt;130mg/dl (95% percentile) will be eligible for&#xD;
      this study, consistent with current clinical criteria for statin therapy. The risks&#xD;
      associated with participation in this single-dose pharmacokinetic study are expected to be&#xD;
      minimal given the known adverse event profile for the study articles and also, the limited&#xD;
      exposure. The most common mild adverse effects of statins are headache, myalgia, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation). However, in&#xD;
      children these adverse effects occur with the same frequency as placebo 14, 15, 18. Rare&#xD;
      adverse effects include elevation of hepatic transaminases and myopathy, but these are&#xD;
      generally observed with chronic treatment. Furthermore, no cases of hepatic failure with&#xD;
      statins have been reported to date 52. There is also a small risk associated with placement&#xD;
      of the intravenous (IV) catheter that will be used to draw serial blood samples for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis and screening/safety labs. Finally, there is the risk of loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality for the participating subjects. Methods to protect PHI and data handling are&#xD;
      specifically outlined in the CMH CPR protocol Sections 4 &amp; 5 (CMH IRB# 12040220). All of the&#xD;
      above risks associated with this non-therapeutic clinical trial are minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit to participating subjects, although there may be benefit for&#xD;
      children in the future as it is expected that the information to be gained from the study can&#xD;
      be generalized to the larger population of pediatric patients who may require statin&#xD;
      treatment. The purpose of the study is to determine how genetic variation impacts pravastatin&#xD;
      and simvastatin plasma concentrations following recommended doses of the drug in a patient&#xD;
      population that has not previously been studied. Thus, with this knowledge, future protocols&#xD;
      could subsequently be developed to effectively &quot;personalize&quot; dosing for pediatric subjects&#xD;
      with the aforementioned SNPs who are taking pravastatin or simvastatin, thereby improving&#xD;
      efficacy and safety for the individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Study Design/Type This will be a single center, open label, randomized, cross-over study&#xD;
      in patients with dyslipidemia comparing the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and simvastatin,&#xD;
      in patients with greater than or equal to one variant allele in the SLCO1B1 gene (-11187&#xD;
      and/or c.521) to patients with the wild-type/wild-type genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Population Sample The CMH Cardiology Pharmacogenomics Repository (CPR) (CMH IRB#&#xD;
      12040220) database will be accessed to determine subjects meeting inclusion criteria. Once&#xD;
      the target population and an equal set of age-, sex- and Tanner Stage-matched controls are&#xD;
      identified, the patients will be invited to participate in a single center, open label,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over, pharmacokinetic study of pravastatin and simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5. Subject Recruitment Once a target population and an equal set of age- and sex-matched&#xD;
      controls are identified from the CPR, prospective participants will be informed about the&#xD;
      study. Initial contact will occur by way of a prepared telephone script. Those that agree to&#xD;
      participate will be scheduled for a visit to the CMH Clinical Research Unit for a screening&#xD;
      visit. At this visit, the study will be explained to the patient/patient's family,&#xD;
      permission/assent/consent will be obtained, a physical examination (including Tanner&#xD;
      staging), and screening laboratory testing will be performed. Participants for whom&#xD;
      permission/assent/consent has been obtained and inclusion criteria are met, will be scheduled&#xD;
      to come back to the CMH Clinical Research Unit within 6 to 14 days for the first study drug&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6. Subject Withdrawal Participation in the pharmacokinetic trial of pravastatin and&#xD;
      simvastatin is completely voluntary. As part of the informed permission/assent/consent&#xD;
      process; subjects are informed that they can withdraw their permission/assent/consent at any&#xD;
      time. If at any time, study subjects have social, philosophical, religious or family concerns&#xD;
      related to the study, they may decide to withdraw permission/assent/consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study subject or an authorized third party (PCP) may revoke permission/assent/consent at&#xD;
      anytime. The request to revoke permission/assent/consent may be made verbally or in writing&#xD;
      and addressed to study personnel (as indicated in the permission/assent/consent form). Study&#xD;
      personnel will take appropriate steps to respect the will of the study subject and ensure&#xD;
      that the study subject is able to withdraw without having a compromise in personal integrity&#xD;
      or medical evaluation/treatment. In the event permission/assent/consent to continue is&#xD;
      withdrawn after partial collection of samples or data, only existing data will be analyzed&#xD;
      and tabulated. The subject can be withdrawn from the study by the investigators, if at any&#xD;
      point, in the judgment of the investigators, that the subject's continued participation may&#xD;
      be associated with the production of unanticipated risks (e.g., a late onset hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reaction following administration of the study article).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7. Subject Study Visits The study will involve three total visits. One screening visit and&#xD;
      2 drug study day visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit (Approximately 1 hour) -Upon arrival for the screening visit, the study will&#xD;
      be reviewed in depth with the participating subject and subject's parents/legal guardian when&#xD;
      applicable. They will be provided sufficient time to review the permission/assent/consent&#xD;
      form, have all questions answered, and concerns addressed. If they agree to participate, they&#xD;
      will sign the permission/assent/consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Following permission/assent/consent, screening labs will be drawn. If the patient is unable&#xD;
      to complete the study labs at this time, a time will be arranged to have these performed at&#xD;
      least 1 day prior to Study Drug Day #1. The laboratory evaluation will consist of the&#xD;
      following.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research chemistry panel (Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Carbon Dioxide, Anion Gap,&#xD;
           Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, Total Protein, Albumin,&#xD;
           Bilirubin, ALT, AST, Alkaline Phosphatase, GGT, LDH, Cholesterol, Uric Acid and&#xD;
           Triglyceride) (3 mL blood in mint green or red top with yellow ring gel tube)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete blood count with differential (1 mL in a 3 mL EDTA lavender top tube or 250 uL&#xD;
           in a microtainer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creatine phosphokinase (0.2ml in gel mint green or red top w/ gold ring)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. C-reactive protein (1 ml of blood in a mint green or red top tube w/ yellow ring gel; or&#xD;
           EDTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           -If the patient is currently taking a statin, they will be asked to discontinue this&#xD;
           agent until after the completion of the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Finally, scheduling of the subsequent study days will take place at this visit. Study&#xD;
           Drug Day #1 will be scheduled 6 days and up to 14 days following the screening visit.&#xD;
           Study Drug Day #2 will be scheduled 6 days and up to 14 days following Study Drug Day&#xD;
           #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug Study Day #1 (Approximately 10 hours) -Upon arrival to the Children's Mercy&#xD;
           Hospital Clinical Research Unit, the subject will have a screening physical examination&#xD;
           including Tanner staging. For females, a urine specimen will be obtained for beta-human&#xD;
           chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Once cleared to participate, the subject will have an indwelling, silastic cannula (21&#xD;
           or 24 Ga) placed in a peripheral vein on the hand or forearm for the purpose of repeated&#xD;
           blood sampling to support the pharmacokinetic aims of the study. Patency of this cannula&#xD;
           will be maintained throughout the study period using a sterile solution of heparinized&#xD;
           saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -A single oral dose of either simvastatin or pravastatin will be ingested with 150ml of&#xD;
           tap water after an overnight fast. The sequence of statin administered will be&#xD;
           randomized between the two study visits. For two hours following study article&#xD;
           administration, subjects will remain fasted with only small sips of water permitted. A&#xD;
           standard, age-appropriate heart healthy meal will be served 2 hours after statin&#xD;
           administration and a snack will be served in the afternoon of the study day. Water will&#xD;
           be permitted ad libitum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the event that the patient vomits within 2 hours of ingestion of Study Drug Day&#xD;
                #1, they will be withdrawn from the study for that day and rescheduled. The subject&#xD;
                will be rescheduled up to 14 days after the screening visit. If they are unable to&#xD;
                be rescheduled within 14 days of the original screening labs, the labs will be&#xD;
                redrawn that day. In the event that the patient vomits within 2 hours of ingestion&#xD;
                of Study Drug Day #2, they will be withdrawn from the study for that day and&#xD;
                rescheduled. The subject can be rescheduled 6 days and up until 14 days after Study&#xD;
                Drug Day #1. If a more than 14 days, but no more than 21 days have transpired since&#xD;
                Study Drug Day#1, the subject can be rescheduled, but must have repeated screening&#xD;
                labs performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serial venous blood samples (1.5 ml each) will be drawn from the indwelling venous&#xD;
                cannula to measure plasma drug and drug metabolite levels of the ingested drug&#xD;
                before ingestion (time 0), and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post&#xD;
                ingestion. Should the patency of the indwelling cannula be lost, it will either be&#xD;
                placed or alternatively, remaining blood samples will be obtained by sterile&#xD;
                venipuncture at the desire of the study subject. After the samples are drawn, they&#xD;
                will be placed into glass tubes containing potassium EDTA and gently mixed by&#xD;
                repeated inversion. They will then be immediately centrifuged at 4ºC for a total of&#xD;
                10 minutes at 600g (~2000RPM) and will immediately be placed in an ice bath to be&#xD;
                transported to the Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory where they will be processed.&#xD;
                The cellular component of the time 0 samples will be retained for future isolation&#xD;
                of leukocyte DNA. The plasma component of each of the repeated blood sample&#xD;
                obtained to support the pharmacokinetic objectives of the study will be removed by&#xD;
                manual aspiration and transferred to a labeled, polypropylene cryovial which will&#xD;
                be placed at -80ºC where it will be stored until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Once the 8 hour post-dose sample is taken, blood (5.2 ml) for study safety labs&#xD;
                will be drawn, the IV cannula will be removed, and the patient will be discharged&#xD;
                from the Clinical Pharmacology unit after the Drug Study Day #2 is confirmed with&#xD;
                the study subject and/or subject's parent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug Study Day #2 (Approximately 10 hours) -Following a minimum of 6 days and up to 14&#xD;
           days after the first drug ingestion day (wash out period), the subject will brought back&#xD;
           to the CMH Clinical Research Unit for another single dose pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
           Following a physical examination and insertion of a peripheral IV cannula, the alternate&#xD;
           statin that was not administered on the first drug study day will be given with 150 ml&#xD;
           tap water after an overnight fast. The same blood sampling scheme will be used as&#xD;
           described for study day #1. Blood for study safety labs will be obtained after the last&#xD;
           drug level sample is drawn and the patient will then be discharged from the CMH Clinical&#xD;
           Research Unit. The total amount of blood required for the entire study is summarized in&#xD;
           the following table.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Day Amount of Blood Screening Visit 5.2ml (Screening Labs) Drug Study Day #1&#xD;
           13.5ml (PK study labs) 5.2ml (Safety labs) Drug Study Day #2 13.5ml (PK study labs)&#xD;
           5.2ml (Safety labs)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total 42.6ml (Over a 1 month period of time)&#xD;
&#xD;
           One week after completion of Drug Study Day #2 or in the event of early withdrawal, the&#xD;
           family will be contacted via telephone to screen for post-study adverse events as&#xD;
           defined section 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.10. Randomization The proposed study is a single-dose pharmacokinetic study comparing&#xD;
           two statin drugs, simvastatin and pravastatin. The sequence of administration of the two&#xD;
           statins will be randomized for each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Children's Mercy Hospital Investigational Drug Service (IDS) Pharmacy will be&#xD;
           responsible for the randomization procedure and will maintain control of the sequence&#xD;
           randomization. This is an open label study, so neither the investigators nor subjects&#xD;
           will be blinded to the sequence randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Laboratory Evaluation 2.1. Drug and Metabolite Analysis After ingestion of a single statin&#xD;
      dose, the corresponding drug and its metabolites will be quantified. Pravastatin is&#xD;
      administered in its active, open acid form and does not have any significantly active&#xD;
      metabolites 27. The most common inactive metabolite isolated in plasma is 3'α-isopravastatin&#xD;
      and it is formed non-enzymatically primary in the acidic conditions of the stomach 53.&#xD;
      Therefore, after pravastatin ingestion, serial plasma levels of pravastatin acid and&#xD;
      3'alpha-isopravastatin will be assessed. (Additional details of plasma sampling intervals are&#xD;
      outlined in Section 1.9). Simvastatin is administered in its inactive, lactone form and&#xD;
      undergoes hydrolysis to the major active metabolite which is beta-hydroxy simvastatin acid.&#xD;
      Minor metabolites are 6'-hydroxy-simvastatin, 3'hydroxy-simvastatin, 3''-hydroxy-simvastatin,&#xD;
      6'exomethylene-simvastatin, 6'-hydroxymethyl-simvastatin, and 6'-hydroxycarbonyl-simvastatin&#xD;
      25. Several of these metabolites, when converted to their acid forms, have reported&#xD;
      activities in dogs but seem to accumulate in the bile with little detectable in plasma 54.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, only serial plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid will&#xD;
      be assessed. (Additional details of plasma sampling intervals are outlined in Section 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical strategies for the determination of simvastatin and simvastatin acid:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simvastatin and simvastatin acid will be determined using a high-throughput salting-out&#xD;
      assisted liquid/liquid extraction (SALLE) method with acetonitrile and mass spectrometry&#xD;
      compatible salts for simultaneous LC-MS/MS analysis as previously described 55. This method&#xD;
      has been extensively validated according to FDA guidelines, and more importantly,&#xD;
      demonstrates minimal interconversion of simvastatin and simvastatin acid during sample&#xD;
      preparation. A brief outline of the method is as follows. Plasma samples will be thawed at&#xD;
      4ºC in a temperature-controlled water bath, and kept at this temperature during the procedure&#xD;
      to minimize analyte interconversion. To an aliquot of sample, a stable deuterated&#xD;
      isotope-labeled internal standard of simvastatin and simvastatin acid (Toronto Research&#xD;
      Chemicals) are added to allow stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry. The sample is then&#xD;
      extracted by the SALLE procedure at pH 4.5 to minimize the interconversion of simvastatin&#xD;
      between the lactone and acid form. The extract is stable in the autosampler for 33 hours at&#xD;
      4ºC, and will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS within this timeframe. Sample analysis will occur on a&#xD;
      Waters TQ-S triple quadupole mass spectrometer coupled to a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance&#xD;
      Liquid Chromatograph (UPLC-MS-MS), utilizing the chromatographic conditions (including&#xD;
      column) as previously described 55. Simvastatin and its internal standard will be monitored&#xD;
      in positive ion-mode utilizing the 450-285 and 453-285 transitions of the methyl ammonium&#xD;
      adducts respectively. Simvastatin acid and its internal standard will be measured in negative&#xD;
      ion-mode due to poor ionization in positive mode. Transitions for these analytes will be&#xD;
      435-319 and 438-319. All plasma samples will be run in duplicate for each sampling time&#xD;
      interval to assure validity. The remaining plasma not used in the analysis will be stored&#xD;
      within the Clinical Pharmacology laboratory in dedicated freezers/refrigerators as outlined&#xD;
      in the CPR Repository. Use of these samples for further study will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the CPR director as outlined in the CPR protocol (CMH IRB# 12040220).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical strategies for the determination of pravastatin and pravastatin lactone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of analytical strategies for the determination of pravastatin and pravastatin&#xD;
      lactone have been described in the literature 56-59, however many of these are labor&#xD;
      intensive and not as high throughput as the methodology presented for simvastatin. Due to the&#xD;
      structural similarities between simvastatin and pravastatin it is highly likely that the&#xD;
      analytical method for simvastatin can be adapted for the analysis of pravastatin and&#xD;
      pravastatin lactone with minimal change. In the unlikely event that the simvastatin method&#xD;
      cannot be adapted to pravastatin and pravastatin lactone analysis, we will utilize the method&#xD;
      presented by Vlckova et al 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Assessment of Pharmacokinetics 3.1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters Pharmacokinetic analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted using Kinetica version 5.0 (Thermo Electron, Philadelphia, PA). Pravastatin,&#xD;
      simvastatin, and metabolite plasma concentration vs. time data will be curve fit using a&#xD;
      peeling algorithm to generate initial monoexponential parameter estimates. Final estimates of&#xD;
      the terminal elimination rate constant (delta z) will be determined from an iterative, linear&#xD;
      least squares regression algorithm. A model-independent approach will be used and parameters&#xD;
      of interest determined as follows. Individual Cmax and Tmax will be obtained by direct&#xD;
      examination of the plasma concentration versus time profile. The area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration versus time curve during the sampling period (AUC0-n) will be calculated using&#xD;
      the mixed log-linear method where n refers to the final sampling time with quantifiable drug&#xD;
      or metabolite concentrations. Extrapolation of the AUC to infinity (AUC0-infinity) will be&#xD;
      achieved by the summation of AUC0-n + Cpn/delta z, where Cpn is the last observable plasma&#xD;
      concentration calculated from the curve fit of the terminal slope of the plasma concentration&#xD;
      vs. time curve and delta z is the apparent terminal elimination rate constant. Absorption and&#xD;
      elimination half-life (t½) will be calculated from the initial and terminal portions of the&#xD;
      plasma concentration vs. time curve for each analyte of interest. In the case of metabolites,&#xD;
      the corresponding half life term will be that used to denote metabolite formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Statistical Plan 4.1 Statistical Methods Pravastatin and simvastatin pharmacokinetic data&#xD;
      for the study cohort will be examined initially using standard descriptive statistics (i.e.,&#xD;
      arithmetic mean, geometric mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, 95% confidence&#xD;
      limits). A repeated measures analysis of variance model will be employed to determine&#xD;
      treatment, period, and sequence effects for the resultant primary and secondary&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. Pharmacokinetic parameters reflective of exposure (Cmax,&#xD;
      AUC0-n, AUC0-infinity) will be log-transformed using the natural logarithm, the 90%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for the difference in the means calculated and the antilog of the&#xD;
      confidence limits evaluated against the pre-established bioequivalence criteria as defined in&#xD;
      our power calculations. The significance limit accepted for all statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of different alleles to variation in the pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      pravastatin and simvastatin will be investigated with multiple regression analysis. The&#xD;
      genotype class (non-carriers and carriers) will be treated as independent variables. For Aim&#xD;
      #1, the pharmacokinetic variables for each drug will be compared between non-carriers and&#xD;
      carriers of variant alleles using independent t-test. Similarly, for Aim #2, the ratio of&#xD;
      each pharmacokinetic parameter in carriers to non-carriers (e.g. AUCcarrier/AUCnon-carrier)&#xD;
      for pravastatin will be compared to the corresponding ratios following simvastatin&#xD;
      administration. All analyses will be performed in SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Subject Population(s) for Analysis Previously studies have shown that highly hydrophilic&#xD;
      statins, such as pravastatin, are more dependent on the OATP1B1 transporter compared to more&#xD;
      lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin 41, 45. It is theorized that the upstream promoter&#xD;
      region (-11187) might have a more pronounced impact on the genotype-phenotype relationship as&#xD;
      seen in the previous pediatric study 49. Therefore, our study will be powered to observe a&#xD;
      dose-exposure difference in -11187 allelic variants and wild-type/wild-type with pravastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are anticipated to be 150 subjects enrolled in the CPR database meeting inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The frequency of SLCO1B1 SNPs (-11187G&gt;A, 7-8%) from previous adult studies 61,&#xD;
      suggests approximately ~19-22 heterozygous subjects (according to the Hardy Weinberg&#xD;
      Equation) in the anticipated number of participants from the CPR database. With a 90%&#xD;
      participation/10% attrition rate, there would be ~17-20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of previous data on the adult pharmacokinetics of pravastatin in the variant&#xD;
      alleles described above 45, a sample size of 18 in each group (-11187G&gt;A genotype and&#xD;
      wild-type control) will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of -101.0 in AUC (0-∞)&#xD;
      (the difference between a Group 1 mean, m1, of 102.7 and a Group 2 mean, m2, of 203.7, which&#xD;
      is nearly a 2-fold difference) assuming that the Group 1 standard deviation, s1, is 69.1 and&#xD;
      the Group 2 standard deviation, s2, is 126.4 using a two group Satterthwaite t-test with a&#xD;
      0.050 two-sided significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, our target sample size is 18 subjects with SLCO1B1 -11187G&gt;A allele. With age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched controls, the total sample size is 36 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any unintended change in the body structure&#xD;
      (signs) or body function (symptoms), whether or not considered drug-related. During the&#xD;
      entire duration of the study, subjects will be instructed to report all adverse events. All&#xD;
      adverse events, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study, (i.e., from the time of the first dose administration on Day 1&#xD;
      up to 1 week after the entire study completion or subject withdrawal from the study). The&#xD;
      severity of adverse events will be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe according to FDA&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the adverse event to the&#xD;
      study drug using a four-category system (not related, unlikely, suspected, and probable)&#xD;
      according to FDA guidelines. A serious adverse drug experience is any adverse test material&#xD;
      event occurring at any dose that results in any of the outcomes defined by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unexpected adverse experience is any adverse experience that is not identified in nature,&#xD;
      severity, or frequency in the current approved drug labeling or elsewhere in the general&#xD;
      investigational plan. Any serious and unexpected adverse clinical event, whether or not&#xD;
      related to the study drug, will be reported verbally to the primary investigators within 24&#xD;
      hours of notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form will be completed and Children's&#xD;
      Mercy Hospital and Clinics Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be notified. A statement&#xD;
      from the Principal Investigator outlining the details of the adverse reaction will accompany&#xD;
      this form. Laboratory reports and other safety reports will be forwarded as they become&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: The term &quot;severe&quot; is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific&#xD;
      event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may&#xD;
      be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same&#xD;
      as &quot;serious,&quot; which is based on participant/event outcome or action criteria usually&#xD;
      associated with events that pose a threat to the participant's life or functioning.&#xD;
      Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects This study will be conducted according to US and international standards of&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (FDA regulations 21 CFR 312 for IND studies and FDA guidance E6) for&#xD;
      all studies. Applicable government regulations and University of Missouri-Kansas&#xD;
      City/Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics research policies and procedures will also be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to the Children's Mercy Hospital and&#xD;
      Clinics Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval to conduct the study. The&#xD;
      decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects and parent/legal guardians, when applicable, will be provided a&#xD;
      permission/assent/consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for&#xD;
      subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent&#xD;
      form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB. Formal&#xD;
      consent/permission/assent will be obtained, using the IRB-approved forms, before a subject is&#xD;
      submitted to any study procedure. The consent/permission/assent form must be signed by the&#xD;
      subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator-designated research&#xD;
      professional obtaining the consent.&#xD;
