    <textblock>
      This is a pre-surgical study involving subjects with muscle invasive bladder cancer, or&#xD;
      urothelial cancer, who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. It is is a two-part trial with&#xD;
      a one-arm phase Ib portion followed by a two-arm phase II portion. The study treatment is&#xD;
      stratified into two cohorts based on cisplatin eligibility.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib Dose-Finding Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib is a 3+3 design for the cisplatin-eligible group only. Cisplatin-eligible subjects&#xD;
      receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles; cisplatin&#xD;
      70mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles. (Subjects with Ccr of 50-59 mL/min&#xD;
      must follow split dosing of cisplatin over two days). Pembrolizumab will be given every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 5 doses, with a starting dose of 200 mg. NOTE: the last dose of pembrolizumab falls&#xD;
      on what would be D8 of a 5th 'chemo' cycle, however gemcitabine/cisplatin is NOT GIVEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Arm A: Cohort I Cisplatin-Eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin-eligible subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days&#xD;
      repeated for 4 cycles; cisplatin 70mg/m2 IV D1 and D8 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles.&#xD;
      (Subjects with Ccr of 50-59 mL/min must follow split dosing of cisplatin over two days).&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab at recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is given every 3 weeks for 5 doses starting&#xD;
      with C1D8. NOTE: the last dose of pembrolizumab falls on what would be day 8 of a 5th 'chemo'&#xD;
      cycle, however gemcitabine/cisplatin is NOT GIVEN. Cohort I treatment with gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin will continue for a maximum of 4 cycles (cycle = 21days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Arm B: Cohort II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin-ineligible subjects receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV D1, D8 and D15 every 28 days,&#xD;
      repeated for 3 cycles. Pembrolizumab at RP2D is given every 3 weeks for 5 doses starting with&#xD;
      C1D8. NOTE: due to the timing of gemcitabine cycles every 4 weeks, and every three week&#xD;
      dosing of pembrolizumab, there are two doses of pembrolizumab given during cycle 2: D1 and&#xD;
      D22. Additionally, the last dose of pembrolizumab falls on what would be D8 of a 4th 'chemo'&#xD;
      cycle; however gemcitabine is NOT GIVEN. Cohort II treatment with gemcitabine will continue&#xD;
      for a maximum of 3 cycles (cycle = 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then have surgery to remove their primary tumor within 2-7 weeks after their&#xD;
      last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOC) performance status: 0-1 for cisplatin-eligible&#xD;
      subjects; 0-2 for cisplatin-ineligible subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Cisplatin-eligible subjects will receive pembrolizumab at starting dose of 200mg (dose level 0), and/or 120mg (dose level -1) in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. The MTD will be the highest pembrolizumab dose level in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles. (Subjects with Ccr of 50-59 mL/min must follow split dosing of cisplatin over two days). Once the MTD is established, this portion of the study will close and the phase II will open to cohorts I and II at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).</description>
