    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential clinical utility of PET imaging&#xD;
      using the radiotracer [C-11]alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan in the diagnosis, differentiation and&#xD;
      monitoring of various brain tumors, both before and after initial treatment. We will also&#xD;
      study mechanisms and clinical significance of abnormal brain tumor tryptophan metabolism&#xD;
      using resected tumor tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      If you agree to take part in this research study, you will be asked to have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. a PET scan, 2. brief clinical questionnaires, and 3. biochemical studies of blood and&#xD;
      tumor tissue. You may also have a second PET scan later, if you undergo therapy (such as&#xD;
      surgery and/or brain radiation), to determine if there are PET signs of tumor. Your ability&#xD;
      to participate in the study will be based, in part, on the results of the magnetic resonance&#xD;
      images (MRI) in your medical chart from earlier clinical procedures. Once we receive the&#xD;
      results of the PET scan, these will be compared to the MRI in order to help us analyze&#xD;
      whether the tryptophan uptake tells us anything about the type of tumor in your brain. It&#xD;
      will take about 3 hours to complete the PET scan; this includes the completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaires, preparation and scanning. The actual scanning time will be 70 minutes. If you&#xD;
      are a female of child-bearing age, we will need a small urine sample from you before starting&#xD;
      the PET scanning procedure to make absolutely sure that you do not have unknown pregnancy for&#xD;
      which radiation exposure might be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The PET scan will be used to measure the accumulation of the injected radioactive tracer&#xD;
           AMT in your brain. To make this measurement more accurate, we will use your clinically&#xD;
           obtained MRI scan(s), which was used to diagnose the tumor, to identify the exact&#xD;
           location and extent of the tumor. For the PET scan, an intravenous catheter (a small&#xD;
           tube placed in your vein) will be inserted for the injection of the AMT for this PET&#xD;
           scan. It is the tracer that the PET scanner &quot;sees&quot; when performing the scan. The amount&#xD;
           of the tracer, which will be given is very small (5 ml, the volume of a teaspoon), and&#xD;
           therefore no side effects are expected from the tracer itself. A second intravenous&#xD;
           catheter will be inserted to collect blood samples during the scan; a total of less than&#xD;
           2 teaspoons of blood will be collected. Participants may be sedated (put into sleep with&#xD;
           some medicine) if they are unable to remain still for the scanning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the day of the PET scan, we will ask you to fill out a brief clinical questionnaire,&#xD;
           and also an additional multiple-choice questionnaire to screen for potential mood&#xD;
           problems (which often coincide with brain tumors). Participants with a potential speech&#xD;
           (comprehension) problem will also be administered a brief speech test. The goal of these&#xD;
           tests is to identify various clinical problems that can be associated with brain tumors&#xD;
           and affected by abnormal tryptophan metabolism that we measure with the PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If you have surgery to remove the tumor, a portion of the removed tissue will be used&#xD;
           for biochemical studies. The doctor will not remove more tissue than needed for your&#xD;
           care. The blood (obtained during the PET scanning) and tumor tissue (obtained during&#xD;
           surgery) will be processed for analysis and stored in a locked container or freezer in a&#xD;
           laboratory. In addition, we will review the clinical pathology report, so that we can&#xD;
           correlate your PET results to type and grade of the tumor.&#xD;

      We will collect and analyze tumor specimens obtained after AMT-PET during tumor resection (if&#xD;
      not used for routine histopathology). Various histopathologic features will be studied, e.g.,&#xD;
      tumor proliferative activity, expression of amino acid transporter as well as enzymes and&#xD;
      metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, and these will also be correlated with neuroimaging&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
