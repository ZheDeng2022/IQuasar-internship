    <textblock>
      Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer for women and kills approximately&#xD;
      250,000 women every year, with the annual number of deaths expected to increase to 410,000 by&#xD;
      2030. The majority (88%) of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)&#xD;
      where screening and prevention services are limited. Prevention of cervical cancer by&#xD;
      identification and treatment of cervical cancer precursors is key, since treatment resources&#xD;
      for invasive disease are scarce. A cervical cancer screening program cannot be effective&#xD;
      unless it is linked with a proven intervention to prevent the development of cervical cancer.&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released the WHO guidelines for screening and&#xD;
      treatment of precancerous lesions for cervical cancer prevention, which recommends a&#xD;
      screen-and-treat approach for cervical cancer prevention, with cryotherapy being the first&#xD;
      choice of treatment for women who have a positive screen. However, these programs are still&#xD;
      slow to be implemented in part due to the current high cost and low efficiency of cryotherapy&#xD;
      equipment that is often prone to breaking. Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University,&#xD;
      has developed a new cryotherapy device, CryoPop, that is one tenth the cost of current&#xD;
      equipment while also ten times more efficient. Once proven safe, feasible and effective,&#xD;
      CryoPop could save tens of thousands of lives in low- and middle-income countries each year&#xD;
      by preventing cervical cancer.&#xD;

      The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released the WHO guidelines for screening and&#xD;
      treatment of precancerous lesions for cervical cancer prevention23 which recommends a&#xD;
      screenand- treat approach for cervical cancer prevention (CECAP), with cryotherapy being the&#xD;
      first choice of treatment for women who have a positive screen. Cryotherapy using nitrous&#xD;
      oxide (N2O) or carbon dioxide (CO2) to induce cryonecrosis of dysplastic tissues followed by&#xD;
      regeneration of normal cervical epithelium is the most common intervention used in LMICs&#xD;
      because it is simple and safe enough for mid-level providers such as nurses or midwives to&#xD;
      operate, and can be performed without anesthesia or electricity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CO2 is more often used than N2O due to its wider availability and lower cost. Mid-level&#xD;
      providers have been trained successfully to perform cryotherapy safely and with a high degree&#xD;
      of acceptability.24,25,26 Adverse effects after cryotherapy are relatively uncommon and&#xD;
      generally minor, reported in 1-2% of women. A recent meta-analysis of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      cryotherapy found cure rates of 85% and 92%, respectively, in CIN 2 and CIN 3. An alternative&#xD;
      to cryotherapy, loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) has largely supplanted&#xD;
      cryotherapy in well-resourced settings, as it provides a surgical specimen for pathologic&#xD;
      assessment and can be used on large lesions ineligible for cryotherapy. However, LEEP&#xD;
      requires electricity, is more costly, requires a higher level of training and is associated&#xD;
      with a higher rate of complications, all of which complicate its routine use in LMICs. While&#xD;
      LEEP may be available in national referral centers, WHO recommends cryotherapy in settings&#xD;
      where it is not available. Cost, reliability, durability and reparability are all factors&#xD;
      that prohibit the scale-up necessary for current cryotherapy methods to match the volume of&#xD;
      population-based screening needed to achieve a marked decrease in cervical cancer morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Each cryotherapy unit costs approximately $2,000, resulting in approximately&#xD;
      80% of the treatment cost of cryotherapy being directly attributed to equipment cost.&#xD;
      Additionally, the design involves many custom parts available only through the manufacturers,&#xD;
      which are all based in the U.S. or Europe. This prohibits local repairs and limits the life&#xD;
      of the product to only one or two years (or even less when spare parts are not available).&#xD;
      Cryoguns were initially developed for use with N2O but they can be used with CO2. CO2 is&#xD;
      approximately one fifth of the cost of N2O; however CO2, in its various usage, from&#xD;
      recreational to medical grade, is less regulated and often of variable purity and&#xD;
      concentration-leading to more equipment failures. Last but not least, the design of the&#xD;
      equipment makes it inefficient with the use of CO2 gas, increasing cost and missed&#xD;
      opportunities while the gas cylinder is being refilled at a central gas supply depot. In most&#xD;
      LMICs, this means sending the gas cylinder to the capital city. On average, a single 50lb CO2&#xD;
      tank can treat only 10 to 15 women. The subject of this proposal, CryoPop, is a new&#xD;
      technology specifically designed for LMIC settings and more appropriate to support&#xD;
      see-and-treat efforts because of its low cost and durability. The CryoPop device is currently&#xD;
      expected to cost one tenth of the price of current devices while also using one tenth of the&#xD;
      CO2 supply, thereby substantially reducing purchase price coupled with far greater efficiency&#xD;
      in the use of CO2, making the CryoPop attractive for further investment. Moreover, this&#xD;
      device is designed to have minimum moving components which at the same time are inexpensive&#xD;
      to replace and easy to repair in-situ by the providers themselves. Finally, the CryoPop is&#xD;
      not tethered to the gas canister during the procedure, adding more safely to the process by&#xD;
      not having to be concerned over tank or gas line placement. The goal is to have a device for&#xD;
      the frontline where screening is happening and provide the unique opportunity of minimizing&#xD;
      if not preventing loss to follow-up of screen-positive women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will accelerate access to cervical cancer prevention and treatment services by enabling&#xD;
      implementation of SVA to rural, underdeveloped regions, most of which have never had CECAP&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
