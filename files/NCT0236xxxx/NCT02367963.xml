  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Spain and worldwide. Interventions&#xD;
      targeting dietary patterns, weight reduction and new physical activity habits often result in&#xD;
      impressive rates of initial behavior changes, but frequently these are not translated into&#xD;
      long term maintenance. We hypothesize that a peer-group intervention, addressing multiple&#xD;
      facets of cardiovascular disease risk factor can be successfully implemented improving the&#xD;
      adherence of participants to healthy habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomized control trial scheme was adopted. A peer-group based intervention&#xD;
      approach in which community members support each other to promote health-enhancing changes&#xD;
      was chosen. Around 600 participants from 7 Spanish municipalities received a 12h initial&#xD;
      training and were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups for a 12-month peer&#xD;
      intervention. Baseline measurements took place before and after the initial training.&#xD;
      Follow-up measurements will be taken at the end of the intervention and 1 and 2 years after&#xD;
      the end of the study. The primary outcome is the improvement in a newly defined score&#xD;
      combining 5 individual variables. Secondary outcomes are 1, 2 and 3 years variations in&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters and/or healthy behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project seeks the empowerment of subjects from 25 to 50 years of age to improve their&#xD;
      overall health habits and self-control of risk factor through peer education. The initiative&#xD;
      is being developed in cooperation with the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety&#xD;
      and Nutrition (AECOSAN). This study will allow the economic and feasibility evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention, which will enable policy makers to consider its potential wider implementation&#xD;
      for a real community-based intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Spain and worldwide. Obesity,&#xD;
      smoking, physical inactivity and high blood pressure act as major risk factors. Although&#xD;
      these major risk factors cannot be necessarily eliminated developing healthy habits and&#xD;
      behaviors can reduce the possibilities of heart attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the project focuses on the thought that if adults are trained, among peers,&#xD;
      and are provided with new knowledge, skills and attitudes on a healthy lifestyle their&#xD;
      cardiovascular health and self-control of risk factors will improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this comprehensive intervention is to explore the evolution of multiple&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, risk factor including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a pilot study for a community intervention, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled and longitudinal in nature for a period of 15 months, lasting the intervention 12&#xD;
      months. Besides, the project entails a follow-up after 2 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall approach of the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment: For participant recruitment, town council representatives were contacted by&#xD;
           the management team and a strategy was designed for the publicity of the project among&#xD;
           the town population. A representative from the town council designed as the coordinator&#xD;
           for the local municipality works in close collaboration with the project team. Once&#xD;
           potential subjects were identified, a recruiting meeting was held in which the overall&#xD;
           project objective is presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion: Volunteers that expressed their interest in participating in the program were&#xD;
           examined for inclusion criteria. Eligible participants are aged 25-50 and present at&#xD;
           least one of the following cardiovascular risk factor and/or lifestyle-related risk&#xD;
           factor: hypertension (≥140/90 or ≤140/90 under treatment), overweight or obesity (BMI&#xD;
           ≥25), smoking (Smoker), or physical inactivity (≤150min/week).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those acceptable were included and registered at the program's website. A more detailed&#xD;
           and in-depth explanation of the program was then given to the selected subjects in a&#xD;
           second meeting. Afterwards subjects were invited to sign the informed consent and to&#xD;
           acknowledge the program's objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Baseline Assessment (A1): the physical annotations of the subjects are carried out.&#xD;
           Variables such weight, height, waist perimeter and blood pressure and the calculation of&#xD;
           the BMI are measured. Additionally information related to eating habits, smoking,&#xD;
           physical activity, quality of life, and socio-demographic data is collected using the&#xD;
           online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants followed a training period consisting on six workshops in which&#xD;
           education on health habits and encouragement to reduce risk factors was promoted.&#xD;
           Workshops addressed rigorous, accurate and effective technical information but were&#xD;
           tailored to general public to ensure that subjects became aware of the importance of&#xD;
           change in their overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment 2 (A2): after two months and the workshops' completion, at which contact&#xD;
           details are reassured and the non-occurrence of any of the exclusion criteria is&#xD;
           confirmed, repeated measures of body weight, waist perimeter, blood pressure and&#xD;
           surveyed habits are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the training period, those who did not attend the workshops and the second&#xD;
           assessment were excluded from the study. The remaining accepted participants were then&#xD;
           randomized to either control or interventional groups using the sex as stratification&#xD;
           factor to ensure that the groups were balanced by sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To promote reduction of cardiovascular diseases risk, the Fifty-Fifty program uses&#xD;
           evidenced-based recommendations for cardiovascular diseases prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention is designed to promote the active participation of subjects in their&#xD;
           own healthcare. The ultimate goal of the program, and specifically that of the&#xD;
           intervention, is to reinforce the self-accountability of the subjects and nurture their&#xD;
           self-care. The approach for health promotion is the peer education, in which community&#xD;
           members support themselves promoting health-enhancing changes among peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants are randomly assigned to subgroups for the intervention. The&#xD;
           intervention is initiated by health, education and psychology professionals who help&#xD;
           recruiting two volunteers from each subgroup to serve as peer educators or leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For selecting the leaders, each subgroup goes through a preset group-dynamics education&#xD;
           directed by an expert psychologist, for assessing group members for leadership,&#xD;
           availability for the role and clear understanding of the intervention. For preparing the&#xD;
           chosen leaders as peer educators, they are trained in a 3-hour session on relevant&#xD;
           health and health-promotion information, leadership and communication skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Twelve peer-group meetings will be held on a monthly basis and each meeting will last&#xD;
           for 60-90 minutes. The activities involved in the group dynamics will include, at their&#xD;
           own choice, group discussions, role-playing, brainstorming, relaxation techniques, menu&#xD;
           design, joint sportive activities, and others. These activities will directly stimulate&#xD;
           the incorporation of healthy habits by participants and will enhance their confidence in&#xD;
           their ability to manage risk factor and problems arising from healthy habits. At each&#xD;
           meeting, participants will address emotion management, problem resolution, relapse&#xD;
           prevention, diet control and physical activity engagement. Through these reflections&#xD;
           participants will propose affordable goals that will improve their life style.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a fundamental instrument for increasing awareness on healthy habits and self-control&#xD;
           of cardiovascular diseases risk factor, participants are provided with a health handbook&#xD;
           to register their health parameters and will record their immediate goals at each group&#xD;
           meeting. Progress and new goals will be discussed in the context of the whole group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An important aspect of the program is empowering individuals for the self- monitoring of&#xD;
           blood pressure. Blood pressure is a main target of the intervention and is directly&#xD;
           related to most healthy habits specifically targeted in this study. Automated blood&#xD;
           pressure measuring devices will be donated to participants for their own use and&#xD;
           appropriate training on the use of the devices is provided. Through this action&#xD;
           participants will then directly control a fundamental aspect of their cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases risk. Due to its special relevance, a specific blood pressure registry card&#xD;
           will be provided for the follow up of participants blood pressure during the whole&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, for increasing the awareness on their situation and evolution, participants&#xD;
           receive a copy of the score card in which the objective evaluation of their&#xD;
           cardiovascular diseases risk factor is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment at the end of the 12-month intervention (A3): this assessment is carried out&#xD;
           upon the 15-month duration of the study. Again contact details are reconfirmed and&#xD;
           repeated measures such as body weight, waist perimeter, blood pressure and surveyed&#xD;
           habits are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment (A4): this assessment is carried out one year after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Final assessment (A5): this assessment is carried out two year after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric data: blood pressure, weight, height and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy habits are collected by standardized questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-controlled blood pressure (BP) data are also obtained in the intervention group. A&#xD;
           frequency of self-measures (2 per day -2 days per week - 2 weeks per month) is intended&#xD;
           and will generate a total of 96 measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registry: the SHE Foundation owns the project database. It is registered with the&#xD;
      Spanish Agency for Data Protection under the name of the Fifty-Fifty Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A responsible for the database coordinates the management of the all data arising from the&#xD;
      study and monitors the quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be introduced by each of the subjects at the time of registration. Once&#xD;
      this data is included in the web application and a subject is selected by the research team,&#xD;
      the computer system will send a code and password to each of them ensuring the anonymity of&#xD;
      the assessment data arising from the study. If a subject has any troubles accessing the&#xD;
      database information the responsible is there to facilitate his/her accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the physical assessment-weight, height, waist perimeter, blood pressure-will be&#xD;
      collected by those trained for the purpose, and will be uploaded into the system; again,&#xD;
      ensuring the highest standards of confidentiality and security. The data collected will be&#xD;
      verified by the responsible for the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential part of the study is data anonymization to comply with current regulations and&#xD;
      legislation. At the moment that the subject enters the study, the system will assign him/her&#xD;
      an identification (ID) number that will be unique and exclusive to that subject. Each&#xD;
      subject's visit will be recorded by a code associated with his/her ID number. This will&#xD;
      guarantee that the information appearing in a list is anonymous and cannot be credited to any&#xD;
      specific individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The processing of the data will conform to the provisions of the Organic Law 15/1999,&#xD;
      December, 13, regarding the protection of personal data. Access to the subject information is&#xD;
      restricted to a very limited part of the staff involved in the study, but always maintaining&#xD;
      absolute confidentiality thereof and complying with current legislation therefrom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The website database will contain all the study information including data from different&#xD;
      explorations, survey information and data on the progress of the scores of both the initial&#xD;
      and longitudinal phases of the study. The database will be centralized and will be unique to&#xD;
      avoid redundancies and inconsistencies. The information contained in the database will have&#xD;
      followed a rigorous quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical concerns: Informed written consent for participation is required from the&#xD;
      participants to become part of the study. The written consent specifies the purpose of the&#xD;
      study and the intervention, test and measures that are going to be taken. Participants are&#xD;
      also notified that withdrawal at any time is immediate and without any consequences. We&#xD;
      assure the confidentiality of all the data submitted and measures taken from the&#xD;
      participants. The information collected is treated according to the organic law 215/1999 for&#xD;
      the protection of personal data. Ethical approval was received from a committee of reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The percentage of individuals in the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      who substantially improve their health habits will be estimated. Based on power calculations,&#xD;
      a difference of at least 15% between the intervention and control groups will be detected.&#xD;
      Assuming and approximate 10% loss to follow-up and/or refusal to participate, the minimum&#xD;
      number of subjects needed in each group to detect this change is 250 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the population based on selected variables will be carried out at&#xD;
      baseline and follow up. The prevalence of overweight, obesity, hypertension, smoking,&#xD;
      physical inactivity and adherence to Mediterranean diet in both groups by sex and age (from&#xD;
      25 to 34 and 35 to 50 years) in each of the 3 assessments will be calculated. Total&#xD;
      Fuster-BEWAT score (combination of 5 variables: blood pressure, exercise, weight,&#xD;
      alimentation and tobacco) values will be computed. The percentages of subjects who have&#xD;
      increased their total score from the beginning of the program to its completion will be&#xD;
      determined. A comparison test of proportions for independent samples will be used to assess&#xD;
      whether significant changes have occurred in the total score and in the various dimensions of&#xD;
      the score, assuming as statistical significance the value of p&lt;0.05. Student's t-test will be&#xD;
      used to assess whether the average score at the end of the program is significantly different&#xD;
      in both intervention and control groups.&#xD;
