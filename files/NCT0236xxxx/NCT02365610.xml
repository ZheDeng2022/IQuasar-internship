  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, two-part study. Part B only will be&#xD;
      described in this record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a four-week&#xD;
      baseline period, followed by a two-week dose escalation period (400 mg twice daily for one&#xD;
      week, then 600 mg twice daily for one week), a six-week stable treatment period (800 mg twice&#xD;
      daily) and a 12-day taper period. Subjects will be required to attend eight study visits. A&#xD;
      follow-up phone call will take place four weeks after last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive in a 1:1 ratio, GWP42006 or placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      required to record a daily diary with information about their seizures, investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP) and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) administration.&#xD;

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Well-documented history of focal epilepsy, compatible electroencephalogram and&#xD;
             clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented computerized tomography / magnetic resonance imaging that shows no&#xD;
             progressive neurologic abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has focal seizures despite prior treatment with at least two AEDs (whether as&#xD;
             monotherapies or in combination).&#xD;

             been stable for one month prior to screening and the subject is willing to maintain a&#xD;
