      The purpose of this study is to evaluate intravaginal culture using the medical device&#xD;
      INVOcell to generate day 5 blastocysts in comparison to traditional IVF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, single center, open label randomized comparative trial to evaluate&#xD;
      intravaginal culture using INVOcell vs. traditional IVF to generate day 5 embryos Pilot: 40&#xD;
      couples (80 patients), randomized to receive either intravaginal culture (n=20) using the&#xD;
      INVOcell or traditional IVF (n=20) Primary Endpoints: Blastocyst generation rate: number of&#xD;
      day 5 embryos of &quot;good quality&quot; defined as 2BB or greater (expansion of embryo 2,3,4,5 or 6&#xD;
      and inner cell mass and outer cell mass grades of A or B) or higher using the Gardner Grading&#xD;
      System divided by the number of eggs incubated Patient acceptability of INVOcell and&#xD;
      intravaginal culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Live birth rate: number of cycles with a live birth divided by the&#xD;
      number of cycles with embryo transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical pregnancy rate: number of cycles with fetal heartbeat at week 7 divided by the&#xD;
      number of cycles with embryo transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertilization rate: Number of embryos obtained after incubation divided by the number of&#xD;
      oocytes placed in the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embryo transfer rate: Number of cycles initiated divided by the number of cycles with embryo&#xD;
      transfers Miscarriage rate: Number of miscarriages divided by the number of cycles with&#xD;
      embryo transfers Multiple rate: Number cycles with twins or triplets divided by the number of&#xD;
      cycles with embryo transfers Miscarriage rate per clinical pregnancy: Number of miscarriages&#xD;
      divided by the number of cycles with clinical pregnancy&#xD;
