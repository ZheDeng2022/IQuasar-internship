  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus causes an infection known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). This it is generally a&#xD;
      severe disease which can also lead to death. The 2014 outbreak of EVD in West Africa is the&#xD;
      largest ever. Researchers want to develop a vaccine to prevent Ebola infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety of a single dose of the bivalent Ebola Zaire candidate&#xD;
      vaccine VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP (cAD3-EBO) when administered to healthy Malian adult volunteers,&#xD;
      age 18-65 years (mostly health care workers and other front line workers [e.g., individuals&#xD;
      who incinerate contaminated materials]), at one of 2 dosage levels, 2.0 x 10(10) vp or 2 x&#xD;
      10(11) vp. It is impossible for someone to get an Ebola infection from this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterologous booster dose allocation - Each participant will be offered the opportunity to be&#xD;
      included in the booster step of this study. After obtaining consent and the additional review&#xD;
      of pertinent medical history, participants in each group will be randomized to receive the&#xD;
      candidate booster vaccine, MVA-EbolaZ or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first clinical trial in Mali with bivalent cAd3-based Ebola vaccine and the&#xD;
      first where the dosage level contains &gt; 10(11) vp. It follows completion of a Phase Ib trial&#xD;
      in Malian health care workers that tested three dosage levels of monovalent cAd3-EBO Z&#xD;
      vaccine. The data generated in West Africans (Mali) on the tolerability and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      the bivalent vaccine will be compared to clinical and immunologic responses documented in in&#xD;
      parallel studies in East African subjects (Uganda) and North American subjects (NIH,&#xD;
      Bethesda, MD, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see if an Ebola vaccine is safe and to study immune responses to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of the MVA-EbolaZ booster on the immune response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults ages 18-65.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1B, double-blind, randomized study to examine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of two different dosage levels of investigational Ebola vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine is a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus Type 3-vectored Ebolavirus vaccine&#xD;
      (cAd3-EBO), VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP. The vaccine encodes wild type (WT) glycoproteins (GP) from&#xD;
      Zaire and Sudan species of Ebola virus. The primary objective is to assess the safety of a&#xD;
      single dose intramuscular injection of the bivalent vaccine at one of 2 dosage levels, 2.0 X&#xD;
      10(10) vp or 2 x 10(11) vp and to assess the safety of the heterologous prime boost regimen&#xD;
      of cAd3-EBO followed by MVA-EbolaZ or Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) placebo. A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the immunogenicity generated by 2 different dosage levels of the&#xD;
      bivalent Ebola candidate vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of Group 1 participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 20 Malian volunteers will be vaccinated in a staggered fashion. For safety reasons,&#xD;
      the first 10 Malian subjects to receive a vaccine dose in Group 1 will be vaccinated on day 1&#xD;
      and we will wait 24 hours before vaccinating 10 subsequent volunteers. After these 20&#xD;
      volunteers in Group 1 have been vaccinated and followed up for 7 days, an interim safety&#xD;
      review (ISR1) will be performed by the DSMB. Enrolment of subjects into Group 2 will commence&#xD;
      only after the DSMB has assessed the data and indicated that it is safe to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of Group 1 participants will be randomly assigned to receive the low dose and the&#xD;
      remaining 10 will be randomized to receive the high dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of Group 2 participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 40 subjects in Group 2 will be accrued as rapidly as possible. The 40 Malian volunteers&#xD;
      in Group 2 will be vaccinated over several days to limit wastage of the available doses of&#xD;
      cAd3 EBO. As a result, a proposed scheme would be 10 per vaccination day. This could be&#xD;
      adjusted as needed to limit wastage but no more than 20 participants would be vaccinated in 1&#xD;
      day. After the total of 40 volunteers in Group 2 have been vaccinated and followed up for 7&#xD;
      days, an interim safety review (ISR2) will be performed by the DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prime Boost Vaccine Randomization 4-16 weeks after priming dose: Each participant will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to be included in the booster step of this study. After obtaining&#xD;
      consent and the additional review of pertinent medical history, participants in each group&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive the candidate booster vaccine, MVA-EbolaZ or PBS placebo&#xD;
