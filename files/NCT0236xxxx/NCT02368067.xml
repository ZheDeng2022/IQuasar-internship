      Following consent, surgery will be determined by the physician thereby determining group&#xD;
      assignment- i.e the laparoscopic surgery group oror the robotic assisted surgery group. Both&#xD;
      groups will undergo SLN mapping by instillation and injection. The Laparotomy/Laparoscopy&#xD;
      Group will have Lymphazurin by injection and instillation of methylene blue dye. The Robot&#xD;
      Assisted Group will have ICG by injection and instillation of methylene blue. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy through laparotomy, laparoscopic or robotic assisted surgery as clinically&#xD;
      determined by their attending physician. Subjects will undergo this surgery whether or not&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any clinically indicated uterine manipulator will be acceptable. Potential subjects will be&#xD;
      informed of the potential risks of this device so they may make an informed decision about&#xD;
      participation in the study. However the manipulator is standard of care and is not a study&#xD;
      related risk. Subjects who agree to this study procedure will be monitored for adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dyes used in this study are commercially available and will be provided through internal&#xD;
      funding from the CTCA Gynecology/Oncology Department. Potential subjects will be informed&#xD;
&#xD;
      of the potential risks of these drugs so they may make an informed decision about&#xD;
      participation in the study. Subjects who agree to this study procedure will be monitored for&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of anesthesia, the intra-uterine uterine manipulator catheter will be&#xD;
      inserted using the following suggested instructions for use;&#xD;
&#xD;
      • After the standard of care vaginal prep with povidone-iodine or any other surgeon&#xD;
      preference cleansing solution, expose the cervix using a vaginal speculum. No additional&#xD;
      preparation of the cervix is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following exposure pf the cervix with the speculum, and before introduction of&#xD;
      the intra-uterine uterine manipulator with catheter, 4ml total of isosulfan 1% blue or ICG&#xD;
      (depending on what route of surgery is being elected) dye will be delivered by cervical&#xD;
      injection as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a 20 or 22 gauge spinal needle, inject dye into the cervix at the 12, 3, 6 and 9&#xD;
           o'clock positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each site will receive approximately 1ml of dye with ½ superficial just under the mucosa&#xD;
           and the remainder approximately 1cm deep to the prior injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 22 gauge needles are commercially available and will be provided as routine clinical&#xD;
      care. Potential subjects will be informed of the potential risks of injection so they may&#xD;
      make an informed decision about participation in the study. Subjects who agree to this study&#xD;
      procedure will be monitored for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Introduce the uterine manipulator with catheter trans-cervically until the distal balloon&#xD;
      is positioned in the lower portion of the uterus. This is no different from routine clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following cervical injection and placement of the uterine manipulator and once&#xD;
      intra-abdominal, the first step in surgery will be to occlude both fallopian tubes, as&#xD;
      typically done as part of this surgery, using electrocautery devices (e.g. Ligasure) for&#xD;
      sealing only the tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following occlusion of both fallopian tubes, the comparator instillation dye will&#xD;
      be instilled into the uterine cavity through the pre-inserted intra-uterine uterine&#xD;
      manipulator catheter as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insert the clinically selected uterine manipulator as per standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slowly inject the dye through the center uterine cavity catheter access port., Rapid&#xD;
           injection of dye could cause high intrauterine pressure resulting in extravasation. Use&#xD;
           slow constant pressure to instill the dye. This can be done by the surgical assistant or&#xD;
           by the operating surgeon via a long extension tubing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that it may take up to 40 minutes for the dyes to be absorbed by the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue and taken up by the lymphatic vessels turning the nodes blue or green.&#xD;
      During this time&#xD;
&#xD;
      the surgery will proceed without delay. These study procedures will not increase the&#xD;
      estimated total time to perform the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will proceed as routine for any sentinel node dissection. Briefly, during regular&#xD;
      dissection, visual identification of any dye taken up by any nodes and specific anatomical&#xD;
      distributions will be documented using an anatomical documentation sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual detection of the methylene and isosulfan blue dye will be done with the investigator's&#xD;
      naked eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual detection of ICG dye will include use of a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera called&#xD;
      Spycam equipped with 3 main components (a near-infrared sensitive image intensifier, 16-bit&#xD;
      dynamic-range frame transfer CCD camera and light-emitting diodes [LEDs] that is mounted to&#xD;
      the robotic surgical instruments. The Spycam will be directed onto the operative field&#xD;
      illuminating the fluorescing dye green. The camera is connected to a monitor and images will&#xD;
      display on the screen and will be analyzed using digital imaging processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the clock in the surgery room as a reference, a member of the surgical team will record&#xD;
      the exact time elapsed (in minutes) from administration until visual detection of dye is made&#xD;
      for each technique. Blue/green nodes will be labeled as sentinel nodes and non-blue/green&#xD;
      nodes will be labeled as non-sentinel. Blue/green nodes will also be labeled to describe&#xD;
      which dye is being detected (methylene, isosulfan or ICG). Differences in the dye&#xD;
      deposition/absorption by each method (injection vs. instillation) will be documented as&#xD;
      either detected or not detected in the nodes and channels using color photography in the&#xD;
      surgical setting. Continuous monitoring will be done for adverse events during the surgery&#xD;
      and post operatively up to time of patient discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All node samples will be histopathologically examined with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to detect micro-metastasis. Analysis will compare results&#xD;
      of the instillation technique to cervical injection technique in the same subject for&#xD;
      sensitivity of SLN mapping, estimating the false negative predictive value, time to detect&#xD;
      SLNs, anatomical distributions of the SLNs, and differences in dye absorption using each&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
