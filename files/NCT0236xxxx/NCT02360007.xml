      Despite the undisputed effectiveness of agonist maintenance for treating opioid dependence,&#xD;
      current capacity is inadequate to meet need in the U.S. and internationally. Indeed, an&#xD;
      alarming number of clinics have extensive waitlists for treatment slots. Patients can remain&#xD;
      on these waitlists for years, placing them at elevated risk for illicit drug use, criminal&#xD;
      activity, infectious disease, overdose and mortality during this period. These delays in&#xD;
      treatment access represent a significant barrier to the widespread delivery of effective&#xD;
      opioid treatment, and there is a critical need to develop creative new approaches for&#xD;
      mitigating these delays. Our overarching goal in this application is to develop a novel&#xD;
      Interim Buprenorphine Treatment (IBT) that can bridge delays in treatment access. Our&#xD;
      integrative treatment package includes five key components, each strategically chosen to&#xD;
      maximize patient access to pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence while minimizing&#xD;
      nonadherence, abuse and diversion: Buprenorphine, Computerized adherence monitoring, mHealth&#xD;
      clinical support delivered via Interactive Voice Response, Automated random call-backs for&#xD;
      urinalysis and adherence monitoring, and HIV+Hepatitis Education delivered via iPad. The&#xD;
      Primary Aim of this Stage I Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development application is&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of IBT in a 12-week randomized trial in&#xD;
      which 70 opioid-dependent adults wait-listed for agonist maintenance are randomized to&#xD;
      receive IBT (n=35) or continue in a Waitlist Control condition (WLC; n=35). WLC participants&#xD;
      who have not entered treatment by Week 12 will be offered the opportunity to cross over to&#xD;
      IBT at that time, contributing additional within-subject data with which to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the IBT intervention. The proposed research is innovative in several important&#xD;
      ways: By facilitating the eradication of waitlists for opioid treatment, it represents a&#xD;
      significant departure from the status quo and stands to produce a fundamental shift in how&#xD;
      treatment of opioid dependence is conceptualized and delivered. The IBT components are highly&#xD;
      novel, both individually and as an integrative interim treatment package for opioid&#xD;
      dependence. This study will be the first to investigate the utility of IBT in the patients&#xD;
      and settings that stand to benefit most from it. The investigators also propose a&#xD;
      multi-pronged dissemination approach that will ensure that our work is readily transported to&#xD;
      clinical practice and will have a direct impact on real-world treatment of opioid dependence.&#xD;
      Taken together, the proposed project will produce a highly innovative technology-assisted&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy protocol that can be widely disseminated to increase access to life-saving&#xD;
      opioid treatment. The overarching and specific aims of this proposal are directly relevant to&#xD;
      NIDA's mission of improving the accessibility, implementation and effectiveness of drug abuse&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Agonist maintenance is the most efficacious treatment for opioid dependence. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      demand for treatment far exceeds available capacity. An alarming number of clinics have&#xD;
      extensive waitlists for treatment slots (Gryczynski et al., 2009; Peles et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Peterson et al., 2010). Patients can remain on these waitlists for years, placing them at&#xD;
      elevated risk for illicit drug use, criminal activity, infectious disease, overdose and&#xD;
      mortality during this period (Peles et al., 2013; Warner-Smith et al., 2001; Wenger &amp;&#xD;
      Rosenbaum, 1994). These delays in treatment access represent a significant barrier to the&#xD;
      widespread delivery of effective opioid treatment, particularly in rural areas where there&#xD;
      are fewer providers and substantial unmet treatment need. One important effort to increase&#xD;
      access has been to extend interim methadone treatment (IMT; i.e., daily methadone + emergency&#xD;
      counseling only) to individuals awaiting enrollment into a methadone program. IMT&#xD;
      significantly reduces illicit opioid use and criminality and increases likelihood of&#xD;
      treatment entry (Schwartz et al., 2006, 2007, 2009a,b, 2011). However, methadone treatment in&#xD;
      the U.S. is limited to licensed specialty clinics, it requires frequent clinic visits, and&#xD;
      the medication itself has risks of diversion, abuse and overdose. Hence, methadone's&#xD;
      regulatory and pharmacological features substantially constrain the ability of IMT to expand&#xD;
      access to opioid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching goal in this application is to develop a novel Interim Buprenorphine&#xD;
      Treatment (IBT) that can bridge delays in treatment access. Our integrative treatment package&#xD;
      includes five key components, each strategically chosen to maximize patient access to&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence while minimizing nonadherence, abuse and diversion: (1)&#xD;
      Buprenorphine (BUP): Due to its pharmacological profile, BUP has less risk of abuse and&#xD;
      overdose and is available without the rigid dosing regulations required for methadone. Thus,&#xD;
      we will use BUP in this interim-treatment model. (2) Computerized adherence monitoring (CAM):&#xD;
      We will use CAM to promote medication adherence and reduce diversion risk. BUP doses will be&#xD;
      dispensed via a state-of-the-art portable device that makes each day's dose available only at&#xD;
      a predetermined time, after which all medication is inaccessible. (3) Mobile health clinical&#xD;
      support: mHealth platforms use information and communication technology to deliver patient&#xD;
      monitoring, education and support beyond the confines of the medical office. Interactive&#xD;
      Voice Response (IVR) systems are especially promising in that they provide customized support&#xD;
      via phone with low cost, consistent delivery, 24-hour availability, privacy and convenience.&#xD;
      We will develop an IVR system to deliver clinical support with branching logic in a seamless&#xD;
      fashion as well as immediate connection with staff or crisis service if needed. (4)&#xD;
      Urinalysis and adherence monitoring: We will develop an automated call-back procedure to&#xD;
      contact participants via IVR at randomly-determined intervals and notify them to return to&#xD;
      the clinic to provide a urine specimen and present the CAM device for inspection. This&#xD;
      component will provide a rigorous but efficient method for supporting abstinence and&#xD;
      adherence over an extended period of lower-frequency visits. (5) HIV+Hepatitis Education: We&#xD;
      have developed an intervention that produces significant improvements in HIV and hepatitis&#xD;
      knowledge. However its resource-intensive in-person format may limit its utility in IBT. We&#xD;
      will adapt our intervention for delivery via iPad, a state-of-the-art platform with&#xD;
      portability, sophisticated functionality and widespread appeal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this Stage I Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development application&#xD;
      is to develop a novel, manual-based IBT platform to increase access to opioid treatment.&#xD;
      During Months 1-6 we will refine treatment components using feedback from stakeholders.&#xD;
      During the remaining study period, we will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      initial efficacy of IBT in a 12-week proof-of-concept trial in which 70 opioid-dependent&#xD;
      adults wait-listed for agonist maintenance are randomized to receive IBT (n=35) or continue&#xD;
      in a Waitlist Control condition (WLC; n=35). IBT participants will visit the clinic every 2&#xD;
      weeks while receiving the IBT package described above. WLC participants will remain on the&#xD;
      waitlist for their treatment of choice but complete the same scheduled follow-up assessments&#xD;
      as IBT participants. WLC participants who have not entered treatment by Week 12 will be&#xD;
      offered the opportunity to cross over to IBT at that time, contributing additional&#xD;
      within-subject data with which to evaluate the efficacy of the IBT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By facilitating the eradication of waitlists, the proposed research represents a significant&#xD;
      departure from the status quo and stands to produce a fundamental shift in how treatment of&#xD;
      opioid dependence is conceptualized and delivered. The IBT components are highly novel, both&#xD;
      individually and as an integrative treatment package for opioid dependence. This study will&#xD;
      also be the first to investigate the utility of IBT in the patients and settings that stand&#xD;
      to benefit most from it and includes a multi-pronged dissemination plan to ensure that our&#xD;
      findings are readily transported into real-world clinical practice. Taken together, the&#xD;
      proposed project will produce a highly innovative technology-assisted pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      protocol that can be widely disseminated to increase access to life-saving opioid treatment.&#xD;
      These aims are directly relevant to NIDA's mission of improving the accessibility,&#xD;
      implementation and effectiveness of drug abuse treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For inclusion in the trial, participants must be &gt;18 years old, in good health, meet&#xD;
             DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence, provide an opioid-positive urine and be&#xD;
             currently waitlisted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To minimize disruption due to treatment becoming available during the study, we will&#xD;
             limit enrollment to those who joined a waitlist in the prior 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with a significant psychiatric or medical illness that may interfere with&#xD;
             consent or participation will be excluded, as will those who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females will be tested for pregnancy and, should a participant become pregnant during&#xD;
             the trial, her participation will be terminated and she will be assisted with&#xD;
             accessing treatment at the high-risk pregnancy clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those dependent on sedative-hypnotics will be excluded, due to the medical risks and&#xD;
             notably low success rates with sedative-dependent opioid abusers (Stitzer &amp; Chutuape,&#xD;
             1999).&#xD;
