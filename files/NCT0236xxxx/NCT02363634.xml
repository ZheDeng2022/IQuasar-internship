      Efficacy Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as compared to placebo on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anxiety and mood as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the&#xD;
           Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). For the HAM-A, total score and sub-scores&#xD;
           anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia and intellectual will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. quality of sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. cognitive abilities as measured by the Erikson Flanker Task and computerized cognitive&#xD;
           tests including Short-Term Memory Test (STM), Working Memory Test (WM), cued name recall&#xD;
           task and face-name association task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the acute effects and the effects of 12-weeks supplementation with Magtein™ as&#xD;
      compared to placebo on magnesium status as measured by the sponsor's protocol for determining&#xD;
      body magnesium status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if supplementation with Magtein™ is safe within the confines of this study as&#xD;
      denoted by changes from baseline to 12 weeks in blood work (comprehensive metabolic panel,&#xD;
      uric acid and complete blood count with differential), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      adverse events and subjective remarks.&#xD;
