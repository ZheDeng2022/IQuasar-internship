    <textblock>
      This phase II study is designed to determine the clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade, using&#xD;
      the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab (MK-3475), administered as consolidation&#xD;
      therapy after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      (R/R) Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) or peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in 1st remission.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab is an antibody drug that blocks a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is a receptor&#xD;
      molecule on the surface of immune cells that can be used to turn off the immune response.&#xD;
      Some cancers use this as a way to turn off the immune response against them. Blocking PD-1&#xD;
      with pembrolizumabmay restore an effective immune attack against the lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this study, patients who undergo ASCT for R/R cHL, DLBCL or PTCL in 1st remission will&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles,&#xD;
      beginning within a few weeks of ASCT.&#xD;

        one of the participating institutions. Eligible histologies are: Arm A: Diffuse large B&#xD;
        cell lymphoma; patients with a prior history of indolent B-cell NHL are eligible, as long&#xD;
        as they have histologically confirmed DLBCL prior to their pre-transplant salvage&#xD;
        treatment. Patients with mediastinal large B cell lymphoma are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arm B: Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (patients with nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin&#xD;
        lymphoma [NLPHL] are NOT eligible) Arm C: Peripheral T cell lymphoma - eligible subtypes&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;

             conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements or pose excess risk to the participant in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             clinician..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive.&#xD;

             with positive HepB viral load, or positive HepC antibody with positive HepC viral&#xD;
             load).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of the start of treatment. Examples are&#xD;
             measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, oral polio vaccine, and&#xD;
             oral typhoid vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with an anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, or anti CTLA-4 agent. Participants who&#xD;
             entered clinical remission with one of those agents and proceeded to ASCT without&#xD;
             intervening relapse may be eligible after discussion with the Study Chair. Note that&#xD;
             for patients who enter remission with checkpoint blockade therapy, this will not count&#xD;
             towards the 3 lines of prior therapy.&#xD;
