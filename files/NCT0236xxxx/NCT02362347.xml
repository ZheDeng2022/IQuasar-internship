      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effect of a weighted compression vest&#xD;
      in addition to usual medical care and exercise rehabilitation on cardiovascular,&#xD;
      neurocognitive, balance and anxiety measures in individuals medically diagnosed with, and&#xD;
      being treated for, a mild traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, induces significant impairment to a&#xD;
      patient's mobility and tolerance for daily living activities with symptoms that include&#xD;
      decreased balance, dizziness, confusion, headaches, visual and auditory sensitivities. If&#xD;
      recognized promptly, many of these injuries respond well to immediate rest and standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation strategies. However, approximately 10-30% of these patients will experience&#xD;
      persistent symptoms beyond the ~2 week period of spontaneous healing. The persistent symptoms&#xD;
      point to neural damage, or disrupted neural networks in the brain, but the actual mechanism&#xD;
      or nature of neural damage remains to be elucidated. The brain's neural activity must be&#xD;
      supported by rapid adjustments to, and optimal distribution of, blood flow. However,&#xD;
      cerebrovascular control remains poorly studied in the context of persistent concussion&#xD;
      symptoms, particularly the reactivity element of flow control such as how fast it recovers&#xD;
      during drops in blood pressure such as when one stands up from the sitting posture.&#xD;
      Cerebrovascular damage in mTBI appears to affect mostly the autoregulatory adjustments to&#xD;
      changes in brain perfusion pressure (i.e., from lying down to standing up) (Len et al.,&#xD;
      2013;Junger et al., 1997). The investigators will study the impact of mTBI in both acute and&#xD;
      persistent stages on cerebrovascular adjustments to metabolic and pressure-dependent stimuli.&#xD;
      Currently, decisions regarding rate and completeness of healing remain subjective which can&#xD;
      lead to earlier-than-optimal return of the patient to inappropriate levels of activity, work&#xD;
      or school. Improved and cost-effective markers of the rate and completeness of brain healing&#xD;
      are needed that can be obtained in the clinic. One challenge might be the emphasis in&#xD;
      previous investigations on searching for a single biomarker of damage in a highly integrated&#xD;
      system. Rather, the investigators believe it may be more effective to employ a holistic&#xD;
      perspective; focusing on a comprehensive neural outcome might provide enhanced insight into&#xD;
      the severity of damage and rate or completion of recovery. Previously, several investigators&#xD;
      established heart rate variability (HRV) as sensitive marker of abnormal brain function in&#xD;
      TBI (traumatic brain injury) cases for both adults and children (Goldstein et al.,&#xD;
      1998;Goldstein et al., 1996). Moreover, these studies imply that autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      control of heart rate is disrupted in proportion to the degree of neurologic insult. Thus,&#xD;
      heart rate power spectral analysis may prove to be a useful adjunct in determining severity&#xD;
      of neurologic injury and prognosis for recovery. Despite many studies outlining the&#xD;
      relationship between mTBI and HRV (Ryan et al., 2011;Goldstein et al., 1998;Goldstein et al.,&#xD;
      1996;Papaioannou et al., 2008;La Fountaine et al., 2009) no follow-up research has been&#xD;
      conducted to establish this method (which is cost-effective, non-invasive, comprehensive and&#xD;
      easily-obtained) as a routine assessment of TBI severity, or rehabilitative efficacy. An&#xD;
      additional neural network associated with cardiac function is the baroreflex and the&#xD;
      sensitivity of this neural network (baroreflex sensitivity; BRS) can be studied with&#xD;
      non-invasive measures of heart rate and blood pressure. In the past and currently our lab has&#xD;
      used both methods of HRV and BRS safely and effectively (Zamir et al., 2013;Kiviniemi et al.,&#xD;
      2010;Kiviniemi et al., 2011;Shoemaker et al., 2012). This current study will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and impact of routine measurements of cardiac dynamics as a sensitive marker of&#xD;
      the severity and persistence of &quot;overall&quot; brain damage in mTBI patients. Based on more than&#xD;
      30 failed clinical trials, no single pharmacological agent can be prescribed to minimize&#xD;
      TBI-induced brain damage, despite efficacy shown for several agents in rodent studies (see&#xD;
      (Kabadi &amp; Faden, 2014) for review). In contrast, non-pharmacological approaches in rodents,&#xD;
      show that both pathophysiological changes and neurological impairment after experimental TBI&#xD;
      can be attenuated by physical activity (Griesbach et al., 2004;Griesbach et al., 2009). Thus,&#xD;
      there is value in considering application of &quot;appropriate&quot; exercise as soon as possible in&#xD;
      mTBI patients, but not too soon because the value of exercise in rodent models were observed&#xD;
      only when applied after the acute stage (Griesbach et al., 2007;Piao et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will also examine the impact of adding prescriptive exercise in&#xD;
      addition to usual clinical care on the rate of concussion recovery. Enabling patients to&#xD;
      receive the benefits of enhanced levels of physical activity during treatments for concussion&#xD;
      may be limited by the concussion symptoms. Nonetheless, recent anecdotal evidence from our&#xD;
      Parkwood group has illustrated the remarkable benefit to many patients with persistent&#xD;
      symptoms provided by the wearing of a compression vest (HSREB #103325 and #104865). Briefly,&#xD;
      the weighted compression vests (5% of the individual's body mass) are individualized and&#xD;
      fitted to each subject to ensure its snug but does not impede one's respirations (similar to&#xD;
      a bulletproof vest). The noted benefits of the compression vest include instant improvements&#xD;
      to balance and gait, and reduced anxiety during stair climbing. Since this adaptive method of&#xD;
      treatment appears to exert a powerful effect on enhancing patient's ability to perform&#xD;
      exercise, and is consistent with the personalized medicine approach (like the exercise&#xD;
      intervention), further investigation into the effect of the compression vest on concussion&#xD;
      symptoms and rehabilitation is a viable area of research. To date the impact of compression&#xD;
      vest interventions has yet to be examined in patients during the acute TBI phase or in&#xD;
      younger individuals. Thus, the aim of the next phase of study is to establish whether&#xD;
      interventions with a weighted compression vest can enhance exercise tolerance for patients in&#xD;
      both acute and persistent phases of the TBI, with explorations into possible mechanistic&#xD;
      links to cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and neural outcomes. If so, then new evidence&#xD;
      supporting the use of compression vests could change clinical practice and, importantly,&#xD;
      improve long-term health outcomes for many patients. In review, the purpose of this&#xD;
      investigation is to determine the efficacy of novel methods of mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      rehabilitation in addition to usual concussion rehabilitation programs. Concussed&#xD;
      participants will complete a longitudinal study in which they will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of three rehabilitation groups: 1) usual care 2) usual care + exercise 3) usual care +&#xD;
      exercise + compression vest. The efficacy of each rehabilitation group will be primarily&#xD;
      quantified via changes in routine cardiac dynamic measurements (HRV, BRS, changes in blood&#xD;
      flow with changes in posture).&#xD;
