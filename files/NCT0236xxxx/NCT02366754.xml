      The purpose of this study is to address the need for targeted treatments that induce&#xD;
      functional and structural changes in the brain, ultimately improving neurobehavioral&#xD;
      functioning, the investigators propose examining the therapeutic effectiveness of repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). The objective is to improve functional recovery for&#xD;
      persons remaining in vegetative (VS) and minimally conscious (MCS) states 3 to 24 months&#xD;
      after severe TBI. The approach is to determine the neurobehavioral effect of rTMS, the&#xD;
      relationship between neurobehavioral changes and net neural effects, and to identify and&#xD;
      define the neural mechanisms related to neurobehavioral improvements by providing 30 active&#xD;
      or placebo rTMS sessions.&#xD;

      The specific aims (SA) of the CDMRP study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA-1: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS induced neurobehavioral&#xD;
      effects using the DRS (lower scores indicate more function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA-2: To determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS-induced changes in&#xD;
      functional neural activation and whether these changes correlate with improving&#xD;
      neurobehavioral function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA-3: To determine the rTMS effect on white fiber tracts and whether rTMS-related effects&#xD;
      correlate with neurobehavioral gains. White fiber tracts will be examined according to&#xD;
      changes in Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD), and&#xD;
      Axial Diffusivity (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA-4: To confirm rTMS safety for severe TBI. The investigators hypothesize that there will be&#xD;
      no difference between active and placebo groups according to average number of research&#xD;
      related adverse events (AE) during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these aims, the investigators will conduct a double blind, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial where 58 persons remaining in states of disordered consciousness&#xD;
      for 3 to 24 months after TBI are randomized to the active rTMS group or the placebo rTMS&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is neurobehavioral recovery slope as measured by the total Disability&#xD;
      Rating Scale (DRS), which will be collected at bedside at Baseline, Midpoint (15th rTMS&#xD;
      Session) and Endpoint (30th rTMS Session). The DRS-PI will be collected weekly via telephone&#xD;
      interview for the three weeks between Endpoint and Follow up (3 weeks after 30th rTMS&#xD;
      session). Secondary outcomes include four measures of functional neural activation: task&#xD;
      related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI),&#xD;
      EEG-Rest and EEG-Task. The functional neural activation measures will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, endpoint and follow up. Motor Threshold Testing and Neurobehavioral measures in&#xD;
      addition to the DRS and physical measures will also be collected as secondary outcomes. Motor&#xD;
      Threshold testing, neurobehavioral and physical measures will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      midpoint, endpoint and follow up. The additional Neurobehavioral and physical measures are&#xD;
      the Disorders of Consciousness Scale-25 (DOCS-25), Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R), Coma&#xD;
      Near Coma Scale (CNC), Modified Tardieu Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Spaulding Limb&#xD;
      Movement Protocol and the Consciousness Screening Algorithm.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of 30 active rTMS sessions. Each session is comprised of 300 trains of paired pulses with the following parameters: 100Âµs paired pulses separated by 100ms inter-pulse-intervals and a five second inter-train-interval. Pulse intensity will be set at 110% of each participant's motor threshold. Active rTMS sessions will be provided two times per day with a 70mm figure-of-eight coil over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Two Magstim-2002 units and a Bistim2 module will be used to administer active rTMS. Participants assigned to the active rTMS group will receive a total of 1.8 seconds of stimulation. Active rTMS will be administered 2 times daily with the following weekly schedule: 2 days of rTMS, 1 day of rest, 2 days of rTMS, 2 days of rest.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of 30 placebo rTMS sessions. Each session is comprised of 300 paired-pulse trains with the following parameters: 100Âµs paired pulses separated by 100ms inter-pulse-intervals and a five second inter-train-interval. Placebo rTMS sessions will be provided two times per day with a 70mm figure-of-eight coil over the left DLPFC. Two Magstim-2002 units and a Bistim2 module will be used to administer placebo rTMS. The placebo coil simulates magnetic stimulation, but does not actually emit a pulse. Participants assigned to the placebo rTMS group will receive 0 seconds of stimulation. Placebo rTMS will be administered with the following weekly schedule: 2 days of rTMS, 1 day of rest, 2 days of rTMS, 2 days of rest.</description>

    <description>Repetitive TMS is a non-invasive neural stimulation technique achieved via electromagnetic induction. An insulated metal coil is placed on the scalp and short discharges of electric current are directed through the coil producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is accompanied by an electric field that passes through the skull inducing currents in the tissue beneath the coil. If a cell beneath the coil is viable, then rTMS initiates or inhibits an action potential affecting ongoing neural activity. 30 sessions of active rTMS are provided.</description>

    <description>The placebo coil simulates magnetic stimulation, but does not actually emit a pulse. The placebo coil looks, sounds and feels like an active rTMS coil. The placebo coil, visually identical to the active coil, provides a slight sensory sensation and discharge noise (i.e., clicking) nearly identical to that of the active coil.</description>
