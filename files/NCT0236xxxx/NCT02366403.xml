      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that develops as a result of exposure to&#xD;
      a traumatic event. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a breathing meditation&#xD;
      technique (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; SKY) provides a treatment benefit that is as effective as&#xD;
      the standard intervention. Patients' PTSD symptoms will be monitored before treatment, at the&#xD;
      end of treatment, one month after treatment and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that develops as a result of exposure to&#xD;
      a traumatic event and is characterized by intense physiological and psychological reactivity&#xD;
      to stimuli associated with that trauma. PTSD represents a substantial proportion of the&#xD;
      burden of illness among Veterans. A recent study found that PTSD was diagnosed in 13% of&#xD;
      Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Recent reports have also highlighted that PTSD&#xD;
      is associated with suicidality - a fact that may explain the alarming rise of suicidal&#xD;
      behavior amongst returning Veterans. Several studies suggest that meditation-based treatments&#xD;
      may be helpful in treating PTSD. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a meditation technique that&#xD;
      involves a sequence of breathing exercises and has shown promise in treating PTSD. There are&#xD;
      several lines of evidence to suggest that such meditation techniques provide a solid&#xD;
      foundation for treating PTSD. First, breathing meditation techniques offer a powerful method&#xD;
      for balancing autonomic nervous system activity that is often heightened in PTSD. Second,&#xD;
      they promote the relaxation response that counters hyperarousal and results in a calmer&#xD;
      approach to difficulties and challenges. Third, they may improve sleep quality. This may be&#xD;
      important in treating PTSD because memories are encoded into long-term storage during sleep&#xD;
      via a process known as consolidation. It is possible that the disturbed sleep which is common&#xD;
      in PTSD (nightmares and insomnia) lead to disrupted memory consolidation. Therefore&#xD;
      improvement in sleep may lead to improvement in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite promising findings, meditation has not been sufficiently studied in Veterans to&#xD;
      recommend its widespread use in treating PTSD. The goal of this proposal is to examine the&#xD;
      effects of SKY meditation therapy on Veterans with clinically significant PTSD symptoms. SKY&#xD;
      intervention will be compared to cognitive processing therapy (CPT) that is commonly used to&#xD;
      treat Veterans with PTSD. CPT will be given as a &quot;cognitive only&quot; version (CPT-C) which is&#xD;
      efficacious in treating PTSD. Veterans will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups&#xD;
      (SKY, CPT-C; n=38 per group) and treatment will be delivered over a six-week period. A&#xD;
      &quot;noninferiority&quot; experimental design will be used as is appropriate for trials in which the&#xD;
      primary objective is to show that a novel intervention (SKY) is as effective as the standard&#xD;
      intervention. Patients' PTSD symptoms will be monitored across time; before treatment (i.e.,&#xD;
      baseline), at the end of treatment, one month after treatment and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
      Other measures will be taken at baseline and at the end of treatment, and will include&#xD;
      autonomic arousal (heart rate) and cognitive functioning including memory consolidation. The&#xD;
      investigators will also monitor dropout rates as these can be high in conventional PTSD&#xD;
      treatment programs. Based on preliminary studies using SKY in Veterans with PTSD and the&#xD;
      existing literature, the investigators expect that PTSD symptom severity will be reduced&#xD;
      following treatment with SKY, that this effect will not be clinically inferior to CPT-C and&#xD;
      that the dropout rates will be no higher than CPT-C. Such findings would provide strong&#xD;
      evidence for the efficacy of SKY in treating Veterans with PTSD. The investigators also&#xD;
      expect that improvements in clinical measures of PTSD will correlate with improvements in&#xD;
      memory consolidation, reflecting improvements in sleep following treatment. It is also likely&#xD;
      that the individual's response to treatment will be influenced by their baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. The SKY and CBT-C interventions focus on different aspects of PTSD; the SKY&#xD;
      intervention focuses on breathing and relaxation techniques whereas CPT-C focuses on&#xD;
      modifying the understanding of trauma through cognitive restructuring. For this reason the&#xD;
      SKY intervention may be more effective for Veterans who have exaggerated arousal (e.g.&#xD;
      heightened heart rate). In contrast the CPT-C intervention may be more effective for Veterans&#xD;
      who have more cognitive symptoms (e.g., flashbacks, attentional difficulties) since CPT-C&#xD;
      addresses cognitive processes. The long term goal of this project is to conduct a&#xD;
      fully-powered multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial of SKY meditation in&#xD;
      Veterans.&#xD;
