      The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibition effect of tea consumption on non&#xD;
      haem iron absorption with the use of an iron tracer. The study also aims to assess the effect&#xD;
      of time variability of tea consumption on non haem iron absorption from a typical western&#xD;
      breakfast.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non randomised controlled trial in 12 healthy participants over a period of 56&#xD;
      days. The study will investigate the inhibition effect of tea consumption on non haem iron&#xD;
      absorption with the use of a stable iron isotope (Fe57) tracer. The study also aims to assess&#xD;
      the effect of time variability of tea consumption on non haem iron absorption from a typical&#xD;
      western breakfast.There is evidence of lower iron absorption when a meal is given with tea,&#xD;
      compared to water. There is also evidence from previous studies that the inhibition effect is&#xD;
      higher when tea is consumed simultaneously with a meal, compared to in between meals.&#xD;
      However, there are limited number of human studies investigating iron absorption and time&#xD;
      interval, particularly in the UK. The study aims to recruit 12 healthy participants. The test&#xD;
      meals will be given together with black tea labelled with iron tracer, at various time&#xD;
      intervals which includes together and after the meals. Test meal given with water will be&#xD;
      used as a control. Blood samples will be collected 14 days post dosage for each of the meals.&#xD;
      The study will take place at University of Chester, and participants will attend 5 clinics&#xD;
      during the 56 day study. Prior to the start of study, participants will complete a 3 day food&#xD;
      diary, where they will be given instructions by the researcher. In each clinic, weight and&#xD;
      height will be measured, followed by a fasted blood sample and the administration of test&#xD;
      meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT HYPOTHESES H1: There is a significant difference in non haem iron absorption from a&#xD;
      typical western breakfast with tea consumption compared to without tea consumption H0:There&#xD;
      is no significant difference in non haem iron absorption from a typical western breakfast&#xD;
      with tea consumption compared to without tea consumption H1: Iron absorption will be lower&#xD;
      when tea is consumed simultaneously with meals compared to when it is consumed in between&#xD;
      meals H0: The iron absorption will not be lower when tea is consumed simultaneously with&#xD;
      meals compared to when is consumed in between meals H1: There is an inverse correlation&#xD;
      between tea consumption and iron status parameters H0: There is no inverse correlation&#xD;
      between tea consumption and iron status parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several parameters which will be measured in this study. Height and weight will be&#xD;
      measured using methods outlined in the Manual of Dietetic Practice using validated equipment&#xD;
      (weighing scales and stadiometer). These will be measured by the student researcher at&#xD;
      baseline and at each clinic (Clinic 1 to 5). Dietary intakes will be measured based on the&#xD;
      data gathered in the 3 days food diary completed by the participants prior to Clinic 1 and 5.&#xD;
      Additionally, blood samples will be taken by student researcher at each clinic. The analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out in the Clinical Laboratories and Phlebotomy Room within the Department of&#xD;
      Clinical Sciences and Nutrition (University of Chester), utilising the equipment and the&#xD;
      clinical space where the participants will have to report during the administration of the&#xD;
      meals with iron tracer. Test meals will be prepared in the food skills kitchen within the&#xD;
      department. Analysis of blood samples will also be carried out in Clinical Sciences&#xD;
      laboratories using relevant methodologies, including ELISA assays, bioanalysers and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry. After the administration of meals labelled with iron tracers, all the blood&#xD;
      samples will be stored at 80 Celsius in the laboratory until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT PROCESS The sampling will be carried out at the University of Chester.&#xD;
      Posters/leaflets and letter/emails will be used as a medium of advertisement to the targeted&#xD;
      group, especially to staff and students. The potential participants who require further&#xD;
      information will be given participant information sheet which explains the procedure of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE Clinic visits will take place between 0800 to 1000 (lasting for approximately&#xD;
      45 minutes) at the Clinical Sciences &amp; Nutrition laboratory, University of Chester. 5 clinics&#xD;
      are required, with a time interval of 14 days between clinics to allow the incorporation of&#xD;
      the stable iron isotope (Fe57) tracer into the blood. During each clinic, participants will&#xD;
      be given test meals labelled with iron tracer and tea, and no food or drink will be allowed&#xD;
      for the next 3 to 4 hours. All the containers used to administer the test meals will be&#xD;
      washed with ultrapure water to make sure complete consumption of both test meals and iron&#xD;
      tracer. Participants will attend each clinic after an overnight fast (10 hours), and 30 ml&#xD;
      blood samples (6 teaspoons) will be collected at each clinic. All the clinic details are&#xD;
      given below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic 1 (Day 0): Participants will complete a screening questionnaire, followed by physical&#xD;
      measurements of height and weight. If they satisfy the inclusion criteria, they will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study and be asked to sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked about their food consumption over the previous 24 hours and will&#xD;
      be required to complete 3 day food diary to reflect habitual intake. Participants will be&#xD;
      given an explanation on how to record the dietary intake. Height and weight will be measured,&#xD;
      followed by a baseline blood sample. This will be followed by consumption of the control test&#xD;
      meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic 2 (Day 14): Measurement of height and weight followed by a baseline blood sample and&#xD;
      24 hour food recall will be carried out. This will be followed by consumption of the test&#xD;
      meal II with tea given simultaneously with the test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic 3 (Day 28): Measurement of height and weight followed by a baseline blood sample and&#xD;
      24 hour food recall will be carried out . This will be followed by consumption of the test&#xD;
      meal III with tea given 1 hour after the test meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic 4 (Day 42): Measurement of height and weight followed by a baseline blood sample and&#xD;
      24 hour food recall will be carried out . This will be followed by consumption of reference&#xD;
      dose iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic 5(Day 56): Prior to the completion of the study, participants will be given another 3&#xD;
      day food diary which has to be completed before the clinic for another assessment of dietary&#xD;
      intake. Measurement of height and weight followed by a final blood sample drawn to measure&#xD;
      the incorporation of iron from the reference dose and 24 hour food recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA-PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination and justification :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated using iron absorption data (mean ± S.D) from a study by Derman et&#xD;
      al. (1977) in which they reported iron absorption (%) of 6.7 ± 6.2 when the test meals were&#xD;
      administered with tea and 34.0 ± 23.0 when the test meals were administered without tea. With&#xD;
      an effect size of 1.324, the total sample size required in the proposed study is 10. Taking&#xD;
      into account a 20% drop out rate, the total sample size required to demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      difference in iron absorption between consumption of meal with and without tea is 12 (Power =&#xD;
      0.95).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted by the research student with International&#xD;
      Business Machines (IBM)® Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)® Statistic Data&#xD;
      Editor Software (Version 21). Values for iron absorption and meal ratios will be expressed as&#xD;
      geometric means and standard deviations. Iron absorption values (in percentage) will be&#xD;
      logarithmically transformed for the purpose of analyses and will then be retransformed to&#xD;
      recover the original units (Hurrell et al., 1999). Assuming that the data is normally&#xD;
      distributed after performing normality test (Shapiro Wilks), paired student t tests will be&#xD;
      conducted (i) to compare the iron absorption from each pair of meals and (ii) to obtain the&#xD;
      absorption ratios in the test meals in relative to the reference dose without meal. Pearson's&#xD;
      correlation test will be performed to investigate the relationship between tea drinking and&#xD;
      iron status biomarkers. A nonparametric approach will be adopted if the data is not normally&#xD;
      distributed for all analyses. Differences will be considered significant with a p value &lt;&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
