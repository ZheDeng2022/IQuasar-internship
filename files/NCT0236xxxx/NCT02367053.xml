  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a randomized, double-blind First in Human trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ZP4207 in healthy volunteers (HV) and in insulin-induced hypoglycemic T1D&#xD;
      (type 1 diabetes) subjects as compared to native glucagon. The trial includes two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 includes dose escalation of ZP4207 in cohorts of 8 subjects. In each cohort, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized 3:1 to receive either a single ascending dose of ZP4207 (6 subjects) or a&#xD;
      single fixed dose (SD) of native glucagon (2 subjects). The doses will be administered s.c.&#xD;
      in 4-5 cohorts and i.m. in 3 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 includes two sequence groups of 10 hypoglycemic T1D subjects. The subjects will be&#xD;
      treated with fixed single doses of ZP4207 and native glucagon s.c. in a sequential cross-over&#xD;
      design in a randomized treatment order.&#xD;
