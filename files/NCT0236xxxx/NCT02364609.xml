  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when given&#xD;
      together with afatinib dimaleate in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with&#xD;
      treatment, or has come back and does not respond to erlotinib hydrochloride. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Afatinib dimaleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and afatinib dimaleate together may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in&#xD;
      combination with afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations&#xD;
      who have progressive disease on erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (response rate, disease&#xD;
      control rate and progression free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (DOSE DE-ESCALATION COHORT): Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (EXPANSION COHORT): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 for 2&#xD;
      courses. Beginning course 3, patients receive afatinib dimaleate PO and pembrolizumab IV as&#xD;
      in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both Arms, courses repeat every 21 days (for up to 2 years for pembrolizumab) in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
