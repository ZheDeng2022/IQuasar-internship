      This study was recommended by NICE, as part of its 2006 guidance for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension, and is urgently required to provide evidence for the treatment recommendations&#xD;
      in patients with resistant hypertension. The study will be a randomised placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double-blind crossover comparison of an α-blocker (α), β-blocker (β), and K+-sparing diuretic&#xD;
      (∆).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a BP at entry above target on ABPM or home monitoring despite supervised&#xD;
      administration of maximum tolerated doses of A+C+D. Over 48 weeks they will then receive, in&#xD;
      random order either placebo or two doses each of doxazosin (α), bisoprolol (β) or&#xD;
      spironolactone (∆). Each treatment cycle will last 12 weeks, with a forced dose-doubling at 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time course for the study will be similar to study one. 340 patients will provide 90%&#xD;
      power, at α=0.01 to detect a 3 mmHg overall difference in home sBP between any one drug and&#xD;
      placebo, with spironolactone hypothesized to be best overall. The study will be able to&#xD;
      detect a 6 mmHg difference in sBP between each subject's best and second-best drug predicted&#xD;
      by tertile of plasma renin, justifying routine use of the measurement in patients with&#xD;
      resistant hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In published surveys throughout the world the majority of patients with hypertension do not&#xD;
      achieve target blood pressure. According to most guidelines including NICE, target blood&#xD;
      pressure is 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes, 140/90 mmHg in other patients. In the UK&#xD;
      there are currently at least 3 million people with treated hypertension whose blood pressure&#xD;
      is not controlled. A significant number of these patients will have drug resistant&#xD;
      hypertension, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;a blood pressure that is not adequately controlled to recommended treatment targets despite&#xD;
      treatment with maximal recommended and tolerated doses of 3 drugs according to the current&#xD;
      BHS/NICE guidelines and treatment algorithm, i.e. (*ACE-inhibitor or *ARB or direct renin&#xD;
      inhibitor + *CCB + Diuretic (any diuretic except spironolactone), i.e. A+C+D)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (*where ACE-inhibitor=angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB=angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blocker, CCB=calcium channel blocker)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of treatment resistance are unknown, and the choice of fourth-line drug almost&#xD;
      entirely empirical. At present there is little comparative data for available drugs. There is&#xD;
      considerable evidence pointing to Na+ retention as a common culprit, and some data supporting&#xD;
      additional diuretics, or alpha blockade in resistant hypertension, though mainly added to two&#xD;
      rather than three drugs.20,29,30 A retrospective analysis of two-drug combinations in trials&#xD;
      reported that it makes no difference what is combined with what. 31 However, this conclusion&#xD;
      conflicts with the view that drugs for hypertension fall into two main categories, acting&#xD;
      respectively on the renin and volume components of hypertension, and that most benefit can be&#xD;
      derived from combining drugs from different categories.10,32&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the successful adoption of the BHS/NICE treatment algorithm for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension, there remains substantial clinical uncertainty about the preferred clinical&#xD;
      management of people with drug resistant hypertension. This is an important question because&#xD;
      such patients are at the highest risk for cardiovascular events. The current guidelines&#xD;
      acknowledge that there is currently no adequate clinical trial evidence upon which to base&#xD;
      recommendations for the preferred 4th line drug treatment for those with resistant&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that it makes no difference what drug is added as fourth-line treatment and&#xD;
      that the response, on average, will be the same for all classes. Alternatively, it is also&#xD;
      possible that one class of drug will always be superior to all the others because the&#xD;
      mechanism underpinning resistant hypertension is common to all patients. In this regard, a&#xD;
      popular view is that resistant hypertension is invariably due to excessive sodium retention&#xD;
      and thus &quot;further diuretic therapy&quot; will always be the most effective treatment. A third&#xD;
      possibility is that resistant hypertension is a heterogeneous state and that the study of&#xD;
      average responses in cohorts in clinical studies masks substantial individual patient&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to this, this study will address the hypothesis that the renin status of the&#xD;
      patient defines the response to 4th line treatment in resistant hypertension, i.e. that low&#xD;
      renin predicts sodium retention and the best response to diuretic therapy, whereas high renin&#xD;
      predicts a better response to drugs that suppress renin, i.e. a β-blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Novel Aspects of the Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that the commonest cause of resistant hypertension is&#xD;
      excessive Na+-retention, and that further diuretic therapy (spironolactone used in this&#xD;
      study) will be superior to other potential &quot;add-on drugs&quot; for people with inadequate blood&#xD;
      pressure control despite treatment with optimal or highest tolerated doses of the three drug&#xD;
      classes recommended by the BHS/NICE treatment algorithm, i.e. A+C+D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary objective is to use plasma renin measurements to evaluate an 'α, β, ∆'&#xD;
      rule for the selection of the 4th line drug for patients with drug resistant hypertension -&#xD;
      where α represents α-blockade, β represents β-blockade and ∆ represents &quot;further diuretic&#xD;
      therapy&quot; as cited above. The main secondary hypothesis states that plasma renin (measured on&#xD;
      a background of 3 drugs, i.e. A+C+D), will predict the most effective 4th line drug. We&#xD;
      propose that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      α-blockade will be the most effective 4th line drug at lowering BP in patients in the&#xD;
      mid-tertile of plasma renin, expected to be ≥20mU/L but &lt;100mU/L; β-blockade will be the most&#xD;
      effective drug when renin is in the top tertile (expected to be ≥100Mu/L) as the drug blocks&#xD;
      renin secretion; Further diuretic therapy with spironolactone will be most effective when&#xD;
      plasma renin is in the lowest tertile (expected to be &lt;20mU/L), indicative of excessive&#xD;
      sodium retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate whether the routine use of plasma renin to predict best&#xD;
      treatment in individual patients with resistant hypertension will be more cost-effective than&#xD;
      using further diuretic therapy indiscriminately as the preferred 4th line drug for all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally the study will investigate whether non-invasive assessment of haemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      indicative of sodium retention and volume status, i.e. cardiac output, peripheral resistance&#xD;
      and bioimpedance, can be used to predict the response to each drug in the α, β, ∆ sequence.&#xD;
