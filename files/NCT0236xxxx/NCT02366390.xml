      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether a minimal homebased psychoeducative&#xD;
      intervention is effective in management of anxiety and dyspnea in patients with severe&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) anxiety and dyspnea are&#xD;
      described as the primary symptoms with a high impact on the patients quality of life and use&#xD;
      of social services. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies aimed at reducing&#xD;
      anxiety in patients with severe illness are challenged by low compliance and/or side-effect,&#xD;
      which emphasized the need of focusing on treatment strategies that addresses the issues&#xD;
      characteristic for a population with severe pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is a single-centre randomised clinical trial that test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      minimal homebased psychoeducative intervention reduces anxiety in patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is anxiety assessed by the hospital and anxiety and depression scale&#xD;
      (HADS), subscale for anxiety (HADS-A). Secondary outcomes are mastery of dyspnea measured by&#xD;
      the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), Health-related Quality of Life (HRQL) measured&#xD;
      by the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and depression measured by the HADS,&#xD;
      subscale for depression (HADS-D). The outcomes will be assessed at follow-up four weeks and&#xD;
      three months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial population consist of patients with severe COPD affiliated the Department of&#xD;
      Pulmonary &amp; Infectious Diseases at Nordsjællands Hospital. Based on a sample size calculation&#xD;
      sixty-six patients with severe COPD and associated anxiety will be randomised 1:1 to either&#xD;
      intervention plus usual care or to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consist of a minimal psychoeducative dialogue delivered in the patient's&#xD;
      home follow by a telephone booster session after two weeks. The intervention is based on a&#xD;
      manual, where the theoretical foundation is cognitive behavior theory. The intervention is&#xD;
      carried out by a nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome of interest is intra-individual differences in HADS-A scores between&#xD;
      baseline and last follow-up after three months. To analyse this with-in group difference in&#xD;
      outcome we use paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank. Differences between the groups will&#xD;
      similarly be assessed with two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Same strategy will be&#xD;
      used analyzing the secondary outcomes CRQ, SGRQ and HADS-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To include all points of follow-up and to evaluate the development with-in group and between&#xD;
      groups we use a longitudinal regression model. Because of an expected high number of drop&#xD;
      outs, the censuring due to death and missing data due to possibly lost to follow up will be&#xD;
      handled appropriately, under supervision and in collaboration with an experienced&#xD;
      bio-statistician. The sample size calculation is based on HADS-A, a paired design and a&#xD;
      estimated drop-out of 33.3 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed with the aim of giving nurses and other health professionals an&#xD;
      instrument clinically applicable in proving care for patients with severe COPD and associated&#xD;
      anxiety. Positive or negative results of the trial will be submitted to international&#xD;
      journals.&#xD;
