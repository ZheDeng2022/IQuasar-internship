    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal&#xD;
      sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Measles virus, which has&#xD;
      been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare clinical efficacy of Arm A (MV-NIS therapy) and Arm B (standard cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy), as measured by overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 12 months (OS12),&#xD;
      progression-free survival at six months (PFS6), and objective response rate (ORR) between&#xD;
      MV-NIS therapy and standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess safety and tolerability of MV-NIS, and compare with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare quality of life as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian&#xD;
      (FACT-O) between MV-NIS and standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution&#xD;
      of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS using&#xD;
      single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging&#xD;
      within the MV-NIS treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess viremia, viral replication, and viral shedding/persistence following&#xD;
      intraperitoneal administration within the NV-NIS treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure humoral and cellular immune responses to MV-NIS within the NV-NIS treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure changes in anti-ovarian cancer (OC) immune responses in both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Perform transcriptomic analysis on tumor biopsy specimens to determine a gene expression&#xD;
      profile predictive of therapeutic response to MV-NIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter&#xD;
      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      1 hour on day 1, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or&#xD;
      topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 15 with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, or&#xD;
      paclitaxel. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression and then every 6 months for 5 years.&#xD;
