  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupressure has been used for thousands of years in China. Through applying pressure on the&#xD;
      specific acupoints based on TCM theory, acupressure could promote relaxation and wellness,&#xD;
      balance yin-yang and treat diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI has been using acupressure to treat various diseases in the clinics of the School of&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine, HKU. Acupressure has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating&#xD;
      geriatric diseases, obstetric diseases, pediatric diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and various&#xD;
      painful symptoms. When applying acupressure on the Head- Neck - Shoulder area, it could also&#xD;
      help to improve insomnia, reduce pain, and regulate the mood of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Frailty&quot; is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Prevalence of&#xD;
      frailty increases with age. As our life expectancy increase, there will be more elderly&#xD;
      suffered from frailty in the later stage of their life. Although there is still a lack of&#xD;
      universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now commonly understood&#xD;
      as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to negative stress. Frailty&#xD;
      could be initiated by single or multiple conditions including malnutrition, chronic diseases,&#xD;
      lack of exercise, stress and physiological or social changes caused by aging. Its&#xD;
      manifestation includes sarcopenia, anorexia, energy reduction, dysfunctional neuroendocrine&#xD;
      system and a pro-inflammatory state. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderly,&#xD;
      meanwhile, positive affect is protective against the functional and physical decline&#xD;
      associated with frailty.[1] There is limited treatment or medication for frailty. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that acupressure could be a possible non invasive means to improve the&#xD;
      general health conditions, including the emotional conditions of the frail elderly. In the&#xD;
      past 2 years, the school of Chinese Medicine has been promoting acupressure as a health&#xD;
      maintenance technique to the elderly, mostly frail elderly living in the community dwelling&#xD;
      through seminars. It is in our interest to run a prospective research to further understand&#xD;
      the efficacy of acupressure in a wider range of frail elderly. The investigators would like&#xD;
      to use a well-designed pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PRCT) to investigate if&#xD;
      acupressure could help the frail elderly to improve their general quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is a collaborative project by HKU and Yan Chai Hospital, with the aim of&#xD;
      investigating the potential benefits of applying acupressure regularly on frail elderly. The&#xD;
      study is designed as a prospective randomized control trial with the primary objective to&#xD;
      investigate if acupressure could help the elderly to improve their general quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Frailty&quot; is a geriatric syndrome of growing importance in the medical field. Although there&#xD;
      is still a lack of universally accepted clinical definition for frailty, the syndrome is now&#xD;
      commonly understood as decreased reserves in multiple systems, and lowered resilience to&#xD;
      negative stress. Frailty could affect the emotional state of the elderly; meanwhile, positive&#xD;
      affect is protective against the functional and physical decline associated with frailty.&#xD;
      Since there is limited treatment or medication for frailty. We would like to investigate if&#xD;
      acupressure could be a possible non-invasive means to improve the general health conditions,&#xD;
      including the psycho-social well being of the frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of this study are the frail elderly living in the community dwellings who are&#xD;
      members of the elderly centers. Our study is a pragmatic research comparing the acupressure&#xD;
      treatment with care as usual, with the objectives of investigating&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if a non invasive, easy to learn acupressure protocol could improve the general quality&#xD;
           of life of the frail elderly&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if there is a positive affect on the relationship between the informal caregiver and the&#xD;
           elderly through practicing acupressure on the elderly by the caregiver&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the Tilburg Frail Indicator (TFI) as our frailty assessment instrument to&#xD;
      identify the subjects for this study. The elderly will enroll with their informal caregiver&#xD;
      as a dyad. Appropriate training (min 4 hours) and certification will be offered to the&#xD;
      caregivers to ensure that they could practice the designed acupressure protocol on the&#xD;
      elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Trial Design This is a multicenter, pragmatic randomized control trial (PRCT) with a&#xD;
      prospective design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applying regular acupressure (4 times a week, totally 12 weeks) on frail elderly will improve&#xD;
      one or more of the following aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly's quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly's psychological functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly's psychosocial functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly's sleeping quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure/heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver's stress level&#xD;
&#xD;
           140 frail elderlies currently served by the Social Centers for the elderly and&#xD;
           Neighborhood Elderly Centers of the Yan Chai Hospital, Social Services Department&#xD;
           (YCHSS) and their caregiver will be recruited. All accepted subjects will be in dyad,&#xD;
           (i.e. 1 frail elderly and 1designated caregiver, who commits to learn and administered&#xD;
           the acupressure procedure on the frail elderly according to the set protocol). All&#xD;
           applications will be screened by the social worker in the centre based on the inclusion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria. Qualified applicants will be invited for a health assessment&#xD;
           conducted by registered TCM practitioner in the research team to confirm their&#xD;
           suitability and invite them to sign the consent form. The consented elderly-caregiver&#xD;
           dyad will be allocated randomly into treatment group and waiting control group.&#xD;
           Randomization is done by computer generated number list in block of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intervention Acupressure Group A 15 minutes structured acupressure protocol with specific&#xD;
      acupoints and applications technique will be performed on the elderly participants twice a&#xD;
      week by the research team in YCHSS centers. The caregiver of the elderly will be trained and&#xD;
      perform the same acupressure protocol on the elderly at 2 additional occasions during the&#xD;
      week. The total trial period is 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupressure treatment involved 12 steps, and mainly concentrates on the acupoints on&#xD;
      face, head, neck and shoulder. The treatment is designed to be operated by layman. The&#xD;
      acupoints chosen are all easy to be located. All the movements/steps selected are well&#xD;
      established and commonly used in the TCM practices. Any movement that demand professional&#xD;
      training or involve potential risk (e.g. joint mobilization) is excluded from the protocol.&#xD;
      The total treatment process will last for approximately 15 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waiting Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No acupressure therapy will be provided during the 1st 12 weeks' of study. The enrolled&#xD;
      elderly will join a group activity, resembling the other group activities that held in that&#xD;
      particular center, their caregivers will be requested to spend two 20 minutes sessions per&#xD;
      week with the elderly doing homework assigned by the activity group and log down the timing&#xD;
      in the LOG BOOK. This arrangement is to account for the placebo effect of additional social&#xD;
      interaction time and attention that the treatment group will receive during this period.&#xD;
      After completing the 1st 12 weeks' participation in the Waiting Control Group, the subject&#xD;
      dyads in the waiting control group will receive the same training and treatment as the&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measurement of efficacy and Data analysis Efficacy of the treatments will be measured in&#xD;
      multi dimensions before and after the treatment for both groups. The measurement taken before&#xD;
      the intervention will serve as the baseline, and the after treatment measurements will be&#xD;
      taken (1) within 7days after the 12 weeks intervention and; (2) 3 months after the 12 weeks&#xD;
      intervention completed. The primary outcomes will be the change in quality of life,&#xD;
      psychological functioning, psychosocial functioning, sleeping quality and physiological&#xD;
      aspects of the frail elderly. Secondary outcome will be the change of strain level of their&#xD;
      caregivers. All instruments employed are international recognized and provide an absolute&#xD;
      score in measurement.&#xD;
