      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of individualised homoeopathic treatment of&#xD;
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).This study is of descriptive case study design,&#xD;
      with a structured interview and quantitative measurement components taking place over 12&#xD;
      weeks, with a consultation every 4 weeks. Children aged 3-6 years of age with ASD are invited&#xD;
      to participate and their parent/guardian is required to be present during each consultation.&#xD;
      Each consultation will consist of a homoeopathic case taking, conduction of the Childhood&#xD;
      Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) measures and a&#xD;
      brief physical exam. After each consultation, the participant will receive an individualised&#xD;
      homoeopathic remedy, according to their individual symptoms and characteristics, to take for&#xD;
      the subsequent 4 weeks. This remedy will be determined using the Mercurius® repertory&#xD;
      software.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of individualised homoeopathic treatment of&#xD;
      children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A minimum of 10 participants between the ages&#xD;
      of 3 to 6 years, both male and female, will be recruited. This study is of a descriptive case&#xD;
      study design, with a structured interview and quantitative measurement components. The data&#xD;
      collection will take place over 12 weeks at both the University of Johannesburg's Health&#xD;
      Training Centre and the schools for Autistic children within Gauteng.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parent/guardian must be present for all consultations to aid data collection. Week 0 will&#xD;
      consist of an explanation of the study, the Participant Information and Assent Form and the&#xD;
      Parent/Guardian Information Form . The Consent Form will be signed by the parent or guardian&#xD;
      if they wish their child to participate in the study. The child will also be informed on the&#xD;
      details of the study and have to consent to their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be screened using screening checklist, which includes the completion of&#xD;
      the CARS by the researcher and guardian, to determine their eligibility to take part in the&#xD;
      research study. If they are eligible to take part in the study, the researcher will conduct a&#xD;
      case taking, the ATEC and a relevant physical examination (including vital signs). This&#xD;
      information will serve as a baseline for each participant in the study along with the&#xD;
      previous information attained from the CARS used in the participant's screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interview will consist of a structured interview of approximately 90 minutes&#xD;
      duration with the parent/guardian, where after the following structured interviews will take&#xD;
      60 minutes, wherein the participant will be free to move around and interact with their&#xD;
      environment as naturally as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will then establish the participant's individualised homoeopathic remedy&#xD;
      according to the principles of classical homoeopathy by using the Complete Repertory 2014&#xD;
      provided in Mercurius® repertory software.The selected remedy will be provided to the&#xD;
      participant within 24 hours with instruction on how to take it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be consulted with their parent/guardian 3 more times, at weeks 4, 8 and&#xD;
      12, where on each occasion they will have their case taken, the CARS and the ATEC conducted&#xD;
      as well as a relevant physical examination. At the interviews on week 4 and 8, each case will&#xD;
      be re-evaluated and the appropriate individualised homoeopathic remedy dispensed. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive their individualised homoeopathic remedy in aqua distilla drops to&#xD;
      be put into the participant's mouth, which will be prescribed with the most suitable&#xD;
      repetition and potency for the participant, according to laws of homoeopathy that govern&#xD;
      individualised homoeopathic prescribing. The case taking will assist in determining the&#xD;
      potency and frequency of the remedy given. No remedy will be dispensed at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed by Statkon using non-parametric tests including the Friedman and the&#xD;
      Wilcoxin post-hoc analyses. A positive outcome of this study will contribute to the&#xD;
      accessibility of a complementary treatment for ASD as well as denote the requirement for&#xD;
      further research studies on the subject. The outcome of this study may add to the body of&#xD;
      knowledge of individualised homoeopathic treatment on ASD.&#xD;
