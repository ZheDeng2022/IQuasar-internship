      It's known that organ transplant recipients with long-term drug-induced immunosuppression&#xD;
      have a increase of the life-time incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. This study will&#xD;
      analyze the incidence and type of skin cancer in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and the&#xD;
      association with exposure to immunosuppressive and antiinfective drugs and other parameters&#xD;
      like age or gender of organ transplant recipients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Organ transplant recipients with long-term drug-induced immunosuppression have an increase of&#xD;
      the life-time incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and are also affected at an earlier age&#xD;
      than the general population. In organ transplant recipients prognosis of squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma differs due to more rapid growth, less differentiation and higher risk for&#xD;
      metastases in comparison to the general population. Epidemiological data indicate that the&#xD;
      risk of skin neoplasms in organ transplant recipients is related to the cumulative exposure&#xD;
      to immunosuppressive drugs over time. It remains unclear wether this risk differs between&#xD;
      drug classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective observational cohort study of kidney, heart, lung, liver,&#xD;
      pancreas and small bowel transplant recipients enrolled into the Swiss Transplant Cohort&#xD;
      Study (STCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2008 almost all organ transplant recipients in Switzerland are enrolled to the STCS.&#xD;
      The STCS collects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline patient and case data: date of transplantation, age, gender, type of&#xD;
           transplanted organ, past immunosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow-up patient and case data: organ rejection with type and date of rejection, type&#xD;
           of immunosuppression in response to organ rejection, graft loss with date of graft loss,&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drug treatment, other drug treatment, death, drop out, occurrence of&#xD;
           cancer and infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drug exposure data (with start and stop dates): induction immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
           (Basiliximab, Rituximab, Thymoglobulin, ATG, ATGAM, IG iv, Plasmapheresis), maintenance&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drugs (Cyclosporine A, Glucocorticoids, Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate&#xD;
           mofetil, Everolimus, Azathioprine, Sirolimus, EC-MPA), infectious disease prophylaxis&#xD;
           (e.g. TM-Sulfamethoxazole, Valaciclovir, Fluconazole, Atovaquone, Voriconazole,&#xD;
           Quinolone), other drugs (e.g. Statins, beta-Blockers, oral antidiabetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will statistically illustrate the incidence, prevalence and type of skin&#xD;
      neoplasms in the STCS. The investigators will show the association of the incidence of skin&#xD;
      neoplasms and the exposure to different immunosuppressive drugs, other drugs and other&#xD;
      parameters in the STCS (e.g. age, gender).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  solid organ transplant recipients within the STCS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with multiple organ transplantations will be included as well&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients within the STCS, who gave the informed consent to use their data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with graft loss will remain in the study, since they remain at risk of skin&#xD;
             cancer development&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  organ transplant recipients of non-solid organs (e.g. hematopoetic stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation) within the STCS&#xD;
