      Main objective: To constitute a prospective multicentre French cohort of kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients including clinical, biological and immunological evaluation combined with&#xD;
      non-invasive biomarkers in peripheral blood and urine, and gene expression assessment in&#xD;
      allograft biopsy in order to increase the performance of rejection diagnosis in kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesise that the addition of non-invasive biomarkers and intragraft&#xD;
      assessment of gene expression profiles will improve the diagnosis capacity of histology in&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients as it reveals pathophysiological pathways that are not captured&#xD;
      by light microscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rejection currently represents the major cause of allograft failure worldwide, with immediate&#xD;
      consequences for the patients in terms of mortality, morbidity and costs for the society. The&#xD;
      field of transplantation lacks robust assessments for immune monitoring and diagnoses.&#xD;
      Currently, light microscopy still represents the gold standard, which has clearly been&#xD;
      identified as imperfect. Given those facts, success of clinical trials is impaired with space&#xD;
      for improvement of current diagnosis standards that should eventually lead to improved&#xD;
      outcomes for kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide the investigators with prospective data of kidney transplant patient&#xD;
      that will allow the improvement of rejection diagnosis and individual immune monitoring for&#xD;
      precision medicine: improvement of rejection diagnosis, stage and assessment of response to&#xD;
      therapy. In order to estimate for each patient a probability of rejection, The investigators&#xD;
      will generate algorithms using traditional clinical, biological and histological data that&#xD;
      will be enriched by tissue as well as blood and urine non-invasive immune biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These algorithms will be encapsulated in a &quot;user-friendly&quot; web-based application with best&#xD;
      in-class visualisation : the TransplanScreen will display individual information with&#xD;
      comparative and predictive context for clinicians and patients and better interfacing and&#xD;
      communication. It will include a comprehensive TransplanScreen report based on the algorithms&#xD;
      and included in Electronic Medical Record databases (object-oriented). It aims to provide&#xD;
      visual and contextual information to promote personalised decision making, addressing the&#xD;
      demand of public health authorities for improving efficiency and quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit for participants and society will be to reduce the financial burden of&#xD;
      graft rejection for society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will include n=750 kidney transplant recipients in 8 French centres : 3 Parisian&#xD;
      ones: Necker hospital, Saint-Louis Hospital and Bichat hospital and 4 regional ones: CHU&#xD;
      Nantes, Toulouse and Bordeaux, Montpellier and Lyon Hospitals. Bichat hospital will not be&#xD;
      recruiting but will contribute to the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulnerable participants excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inclusion period: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participation period (treatment - follow-up): 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total duration of the study: 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion period for participation in other studies, and justification: the participation to&#xD;
      other minimal risks and constraints studies and observational non-interventional studies is&#xD;
      allowed during this study. There is no exclusion period at the end of study. The&#xD;
      participation to other interventional and observational non-interventional studies is allowed&#xD;
      after the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of enrolments expected per site and per month :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Necker Hospital: 14 patients / month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saint-Louis Hospital: 8 patients / month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHU Nantes: 10 patients / month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lyon Hospitals: 9 patients / month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHU Toulouse: 13 patients / month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHU Bordeaux: 9 patients / month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHU Montpelier: 8/month&#xD;
