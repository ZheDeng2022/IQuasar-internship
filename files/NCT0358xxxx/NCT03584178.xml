  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disorder of the nose. The current practice at St&#xD;
      Paul's Sinus Centre is to prescribe budesonide via the mucosal atomization device or&#xD;
      impregnated saline irrigation. Both have shown to be a safe method of administration. A&#xD;
      previous study demonstrated a 6% elevation in intraocular pressure and 3% prevalence of&#xD;
      asymptomatic AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone-Axis (ACTH) suppression. However, a baseline&#xD;
      measurement was not conducted to ascertain the correlation of these findings with the&#xD;
      medication. Therefore, the investigators aim to conduct baseline measurements of IntraOcular&#xD;
      Pressure (IOP), ACTH-axis function, and Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and&#xD;
      obtaining regular measurements of these variables within a 12-month period to further&#xD;
      ascertain these previous findings.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term effects of budesonide via MAD (Mucosal&#xD;
      Atomization Device) or INSI (Intranasal Saline Irrigation) on intraocular pressure, ACTH-axis&#xD;
      function, and bone-density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budesonide delivered via MAD or INSI will be safe in the long-term (&gt; 12 months) demonstrated&#xD;
      objectively via IOP, ACTH stimulation test, and DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of both MAD and INSI has been widely studied in the literature. Although&#xD;
      both modalities are generally considered safe, several studies have demonstrated asymptomatic&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) suppression when used in the long-term. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional study at St Paul's Sinus Centre, found 3% of study participants on long-term&#xD;
      maintenance treatment via MAD to have asymptomatic HPAA suppression. However, the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study design limited the ability to ascertain the timeline for this adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the recent cross-sectional study at St Paul Sinus Centre was the first to study the&#xD;
      long-term effects of budesonide via the MAD in CRS patients, it did not include baseline&#xD;
      levels of HPAA function and IOP levels which served as a limitation to ascertaining the&#xD;
      timeline of the aforementioned adverse events. Additionally, there is currently limited data&#xD;
      on the effects of INCS on bone function in the setting of CRS treatment. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study aims to prospectively assess the long-term effect of high-dose nasal corticosteroids&#xD;
      (i.e. INSI and MAD) in CRS patients. The study design will obtain baseline measurements of&#xD;
      ACTH function, IOP measurement, and a DEXA scan to identify and describe the timeline of&#xD;
      adverse events should they develop during the 12-month study period. By determining the&#xD;
      impact of nasal corticosteroids on these outcomes, potential improvements can be made in the&#xD;
      safety monitoring practices of otolaryngologists. This may include more frequent monitoring&#xD;
      of intraocular pressure, Bone Mineral Density (BMD), and HPAA-axis function in at-risk&#xD;
      populations, development of budesonide tapering guidelines, and improved screening of&#xD;
      patient-reported adverse events. Overall, the investigators hope the results from this study&#xD;
      will be a step forward in the development of screening guidelines for monitoring patients on&#xD;
      long-term IntraNasal CorticoSteroids (INCS) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess long-term safety (&gt; 12 months) of budesonide delivered via MAD or INSI as measured&#xD;
      objectively via IOP, ACTH stimulation test, and DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Prospective Double-Cohort Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the baseline characteristic data and the data&#xD;
      from the administered surveys and objective findings of ACTH stimulation test, IOP&#xD;
      measurement, and DEXA scans. In addition, rigorous statistical analysis will be conducted on&#xD;
      the Likert scale-based SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and EuroQuol health-related quality&#xD;
      of life surveys (EQ-5D-5L). These analyses will include cross-tabulations (Pearson's chi&#xD;
      square test) and confidence interval calculations. Due to the variations in baseline&#xD;
      intraocular pressure measurements, the investigators will calculate an adjusted difference&#xD;
      instead of absolute values.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This sinus-specific questionnaire is divided into three parts consisting of 22 questions that are related to sinus health and health-related quality of life. This questionnaire was developed to assess symptoms and quality of life in patients suffering from CRS with or without nasal polyposis. Each question is scored on an ordinal, categorical scale ranging from 0 to 5. Patients are instructed to indicate if symptoms are &quot;absent (0)&quot;, &quot;very mild (1)&quot;, &quot;mild (2)&quot;, &quot;moderate (3)&quot;, &quot;severe (4)&quot; or &quot;as bad as it can be (5)&quot;. The highest score achievable on this questionnaire is 110 points. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity and burden on daily life. In a validation survey of 2803 subjects, the SNOT-22 showed high internal consistency, test-retest reliability and validity. The SNOT-22 was found to sufficiently distinguish between patients with CRS and healthy controls (P&lt;0.0001, t=85.3).</description>
