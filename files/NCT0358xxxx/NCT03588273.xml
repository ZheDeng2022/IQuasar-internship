      The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of bariatric surgery on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study was performed as a randomized, open-label, single-dose clinical trial,&#xD;
      with two periods of treatment, in which obese subjects (n=8) received amoxicillin 500 mg&#xD;
      capsule orally before and 2 months after the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The&#xD;
      amoxicillin plasma concentration was determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).&#xD;

      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight obese volunteers of both sexes, aged between 18 and 60 years old, were selected from&#xD;
      the obesity program of Hospital General Dr. César Cals with indication of bariatric surgery&#xD;
      based on the criteria established by the Federal Medical Council (2015) and who were operated&#xD;
      using the RYGB surgery technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects signed the informed consent form. The study was approved by the institutional&#xD;
      review board (IRB) of the Federal University of Ceará, accredited by the National Commission&#xD;
      for Research Ethics - National Health Council, Ministry of Health and the Scientific&#xD;
      Committee of the Hospital General Dr. César Cals. The study was performed according to the&#xD;
      ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013 and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and pharmacokinetic sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was performed as a monocentric, open-label, randomized, single-dose study with two&#xD;
      treatment periods - before the surgery (Time 0 - T0) and 2 months after the bariatric surgery&#xD;
      (Time 2 - T2). In each period, the obese volunteers received a single oral dose of&#xD;
      amoxicillin 500 mg capsule (Amoxil®, GlaxoSmithKline Brazil Ltda.) with 200 mL water after an&#xD;
      overnight fast (approximately 8 h). The subjects remained fasted for up to 3 h after taking&#xD;
      the medication. Water and food restriction was held up to 3 h after the intake of the&#xD;
      formulation. Standard meals were offered to all subjects. The volunteers who needed to use&#xD;
      any medication (antihypertensive, antidiabetic and others) were instructed to use it 3 h&#xD;
      after the intake of amoxicillin. Blood samples (6 mL) for determination of plasma&#xD;
      concentration of amoxicillin were collected via a venous catheter into heparinized tubes at&#xD;
      pre-dose (0 h), 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose. The plasma samples for&#xD;
      chromatographic analysis were obtained by centrifugation (2000 g x 12 min at 4 ºC) of the&#xD;
      blood samples. Plasma samples were stored at -20 °C until the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters before and after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit (T0 and T2), the weight and height of all volunteers were measured, followed by&#xD;
      the calculation of their body mass index (BMI) for anthropometric comparison before and after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. The body weight was measured using a digital scale, and the volunteers&#xD;
      were wearing light clothes, barefoot, with empty pockets and without accessories. The height&#xD;
      was measured using a stadiometer with 2 meters extension. The subjects were barefoot, with&#xD;
      legs and feet parallel, weight distributed on both feet, arms relaxed at the side of the body&#xD;
      and palms facing the body and head positioned on the Frankfurt plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers included in this trial were operated using the RYGB surgery technique,&#xD;
      performed by the same surgical team, following a standardization for the alimentary loop size&#xD;
      (1.20 m length) and the biliopancreatic loop (1 m length). The gastrojejunoanastomosis was&#xD;
      calibrated by a Fouchet 32F probe, resulting in a diameter of 12 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxicillin plasma concentration was quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a liquid-liquid extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To sample preparation, 100 µL of each plasma sample, 50 µL of the internal standard (IS)&#xD;
      cephalexin (2.5 µg/mL) and 500 µL of acetonitrile (100 %) were added into a glass tube. The&#xD;
      samples were vortexed (30 sec) and centrifuged (2000 g x 4 min at 4 ºC). The organic phase&#xD;
      was transferred to another glass tube, which was added of 500 µL of deionized water and&#xD;
      vortexed (10 sec). The samples were added of 10 mL of dichloromethane (100 %), vortexed (10&#xD;
      sec) and centrifuged (2000 g x 4 min at 4 ºC). The organic phase was transferred to the&#xD;
      auto-injector PCR plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent, Germany) consisted of a&#xD;
      LC-10AD pump, autoinjector model CTC HST PAL/ 110695 and a G1316A/DE03018295 oven. The&#xD;
      extracted solutions (10 µL) was injected into a 150 x 4.6 mm (5 μm particles) Inertsil&#xD;
      ODS-C18 column maintained at 65 ◦C and the mobile phase was methanol/water (30/70, v/v) + 0.1&#xD;
      % formic acid at a flow rate of 900 μL/min with a split ratio of 1:3. The mass spectrometer&#xD;
      used was a Quattro Micro (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with electrospray in positive mode for&#xD;
      MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) to monitor the transitions 366.00 &gt;348.90 and 348.00&#xD;
      &gt;158.00 for amoxicillin and cephalexin, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method validation was performed according to the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) bioanalytical method validation guidance [22] and the Brazilian National&#xD;
      Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) [23]. To evaluate the specificity of the method, eight&#xD;
      different blank plasma lots (4 normal, 2 haemolysed and 2 lipemic) were tested for its&#xD;
      interferences using the proposed extraction procedure and the chromatographic or&#xD;
      spectroscopic conditions and compared with those obtained in the samples processed from the&#xD;
      lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). The calibration curves were prepared by assaying&#xD;
      standard plasma samples at eight concentrations of amoxicillin (20-5000 ng/mL) in triplicate&#xD;
      and the linearity of each calibration curve was determined by plotting the peak area ratio&#xD;
      (y) of amoxicillin/IS vs. nominal concentration of analyte. The calibration curve was&#xD;
      constructed by weighted (1/x) least squares linear regression. The accuracy and precision of&#xD;
      assay were evaluated by intra- and inter-assay studies. Seven aliquots of LLOQ and each&#xD;
      quality control (QC) plasma samples (60, 850, 2500, 4000 and 12000 ng/mL) were run in three&#xD;
      validation batches on three different days. Inter and intra-day precisions were determined as&#xD;
      coefficient of variation, CV (%) = (SD/M) x 100 and the accuracy as the percentage relative&#xD;
      error, RE (%) = [(E - T)/T] x 100, where M is the mean, SD is the standard deviation of M, E&#xD;
      is the experimentally determined concentration and T is the theoretical concentration. The&#xD;
      matrix effect experiments were performed using the ratio between amoxicillin (60 and 4000&#xD;
      ng/mL) and IS injected directly into the mobile phase and standard solutions added to blank&#xD;
      plasma extracts (4 normal, 2 haemolysed and 2 lipemic). Each sample was obtained by a matrix&#xD;
      factor normalized by IS (MFN) according to the following formula: MFN = (response of the&#xD;
      analyte in matrix/internal standard response matrix)/(response of the analyte in&#xD;
      solution/response of the internal standard solution). Stability QC plasma samples (60 and&#xD;
      4000 ng/mL) were subjected to short-term (6.0 h) room temperature, three freezes-thaw (-20 to&#xD;
      25 °C) cycles and 46.5 h autosampler (25 ºC) stability tests in triplicate. The stability&#xD;
      results were compared with the nominal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained based on the plasma concentration vs. time&#xD;
      curves analyzed by a non-compartmental model using the Phoenix WinNonlin® software, version&#xD;
      5.0 (Pharsight Corp, MoutainView, CA, USA). Values for the maximum plasma concentration&#xD;
      (Cmax) and time to Cmax (tmax) were obtained directly from the observed individual plasma&#xD;
      concentration vs. time curves. The area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from&#xD;
      time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration was calculated by the linear&#xD;
      trapezoidal rule. Elimination rate constant (ke) was obtained by log-linear regression&#xD;
      analysis, and the elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated with the equation&#xD;
      [t1/2=ln(2)/ke].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative variables (continuous and discrete) were initially analyzed by the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify the normality of the distribution. As this requirement was&#xD;
      verified in most cases, mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for descriptive&#xD;
      statistics. Parametric tests were used for analytical statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of the obese volunteers obtained before (T0) and&#xD;
      after (T2) bariatric surgery, the t-test for paired data was used. The mean difference (or&#xD;
      mean of differences) and their respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were also&#xD;
      determined. Furthermore, the ratio between the parameter values verified before and after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery was calculated, being expressed as geometric mean and its 95% CI. The&#xD;
      degree and sign of the linear correlation between two variables were evaluated by the Pearson&#xD;
      correlation coefficient, accompanied by its 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all analyses, two-tailed tests were used, establishing the level of significance at 0.05.&#xD;
      The GraphPad Prism software, version 5.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) was&#xD;
      used for both statistical analyses and graphics.&#xD;
