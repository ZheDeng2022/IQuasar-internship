    <textblock>
      Patients with treatment naive wet AMD will receive an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection at Day&#xD;
      0 followed by an intravitreal injection of AAVCAGsCD59 at Day 7. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      monthly through Month 12 and receive an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection as needed based on&#xD;
      an increase in central subfoveal thickness (CST) of &gt;50 micrometers on OCT from Day 0, new&#xD;
      subretinal hemorrhage on clinical exam, and/or loss of 10 or more ETDRS letters from the&#xD;
      previous month exam.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open label study to assess the efficacy and safety of two&#xD;
      doses of the adeno-associated viral vector serotype 2 (AAVCAGsCD59) expressing sCD59&#xD;
      administered via intravitreal injection seven days after a single intravitreal injection of&#xD;
      anti-VEGF. All patients considered for enrollment in this study must have treatment naive wet&#xD;
      AMD, adequate pupillary dilation to permit a thorough ocular exam, and best corrected&#xD;
      distance visual acuity in the study eye of 20/25 to 20/400 using the Snellen eye chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from each study patient prior to his/her&#xD;
      participation in any study related procedures. Screening will determine patient eligibility&#xD;
      for the study according to written inclusion and exclusion criteria, which include both&#xD;
      general medical and AMD-specific criteria. Patients will be enrolled into the study upon&#xD;
      verification that they fulfill all eligibility criteria and after completion of all screening&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of a screening and injection of anti-VEGF (Day 0), injection of&#xD;
      AAVCAGsCD59 (Day 7), and a monthly follow-up period (Month 1 through Month 12) where enrolled&#xD;
      patients are treated as needed with intravitreal anti-VEGF based on an increase in central&#xD;
      subfoveal thickness of &gt;50 micrometers on OCT from Day 0, new subretinal hemorrhage, a&#xD;
      decrease in &gt; or equal to 10 ETDRS letters from the previous exam, or as needed based on the&#xD;
      treating clinician. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the number of anti-VEGF&#xD;
      injections that are required after a single intravitreal injection of AAVCAGsCD59 at a dose&#xD;
      of 3.56x10e11vg for subjects 1-22 and 1.071x10e12vg for subjects 23-25 is administered on Day&#xD;
      7. Anti-VEGF will be injected at Day 0 to treat the CNV per standard of care and enable the&#xD;
      AAVCAGsCD59 adequate time (up to two weeks) to enter the ganglion cells in the retina and&#xD;
      start producing the transgene product, sCD59. Up to twenty-five (25) patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at to 2 clinical sites in this study. A long-term follow-up safety exam will occur&#xD;
      at Month 24.&#xD;
