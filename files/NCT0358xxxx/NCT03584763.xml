  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study was to produce a high quality evidence on the best frequency of&#xD;
      performing umbilical artery Doppler for high risk pregnant women in the third trimester.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, high risk pregnancy forms a significant increasing proportion of any pregnant&#xD;
      population, according to some authors up to 50% of all pregnancies would have the label of&#xD;
      high risk pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, it is recommended that high risk pregnancies, thought to be at risk of placental&#xD;
      insufficiency should be monitored with Doppler studies of the umbilical artery. Doppler&#xD;
      assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired&#xD;
      placentation and its complications of intrauterine growth restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is to predict fetal academia thereby&#xD;
      allowing timely delivery prior to irreversible end-organ damage and intrauterine fetal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's systematic review and meta-analysis,&#xD;
      in which Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the&#xD;
      effects of one or more described antenatal fetal surveillance regimens were searched, the&#xD;
      optimal frequency of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our randomized controlled study was conducted on patients with high risk pregnancies at their&#xD;
      third trimester who attended Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital. A total of 292 high&#xD;
      risk pregnant women fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected by random sampling and&#xD;
      divided between two groups with 146 patients in each group. Group I underwent Doppler every&#xD;
      other week and Group II underwent Doppler once weekly.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  I-Singleton pregnancy. II-In the third trimester (starting from 28 weeks of gestation&#xD;
             till the time of delivery), Gestational age will be determined by the date of the last&#xD;
             menstrual period and early ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        III-Patient considered as high-risk pregnancies will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following will be considered as high-risk status:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previous obstetric history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, abruptio placenta,&#xD;
             intra-uterine growth restriction or still birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pre-existing medical disorders like:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Pregestational diabetes (Ang et al., 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Renal diseases (such as nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, renal&#xD;
                  transplant and hemodialysis) (Divon and Ferber, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythromatosis and rheumatoid&#xD;
                  arthritis) (Divon and Ferber, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Acquired thrombophilias (such as antiphospholipid syndrome). On the other hand,&#xD;
                  inherited thrombophilias (such as protein C or S deficiency) are not associated&#xD;
                  with IUGR (Reeves and Galan, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Chronic maternal hypoxemia due to pulmonary disease (such as uncontrolled asthma,&#xD;
                  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis), cardiac disease (such&#xD;
                  as cyanotic heart disease) or hematologic disorders (such as severe anemia,&#xD;
                  sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia) (Baschat et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). PIH is diagnosed in&#xD;
             women whose blood pressure reaches 140/90 mm Hg or greater for the first time after&#xD;
             midpregnancy, but proteinuria is not identified. Preeclampsia is best described as&#xD;
             pregnancy-specific syndrome that can affect virtually every organ system.It is much&#xD;
             more than simply gestational hypertension with proteinuria (Cunningham et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        IV- Obtaining valid informed consent to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  I-Patients with congenital anomaly of the fetus. As this will affect fetal outcome&#xD;
             with no effect of Doppler changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        II- Patients with multiple gestations. As they have different growth pattern. III- Patients&#xD;
        with unconfirmed Gestational age due to lack of sure reliable date and absent early&#xD;
        trimesteric scan. As we cannot diagnose small for gestational age without sure date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IV- Withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
