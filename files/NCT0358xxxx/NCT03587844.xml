    <description>Patients with MF/SS who were previously treated with brentuximab vedotin. Up to 10 patients will be enrolled onto this cohort. Following identification of a promising dose after the completion of the full Cohort 1 Simon two stage design, enrollment will initiate onto cohort 2 at the dose found to be promising in cohort 1. For MF patients: Treatment delays lasting longer than 8 weeks for toxicity will result in removal from study. The 0.9mg/kg dose did not meet the primary endpoint for response, therefore 1.2 mg/kg has been chosen as the dose for Cohort 2. As of October 2020, enrollment on our exploratory Cohort 2 has opened at the 1.2 mg/kg dose.</description>

Cohort 3 will enroll patients concurrently with Cohort 1. Treatment may be held if felt to be in patient's best interest (for example: for toxicity or no active disease). Treatment can be reinitiated after discussion with MSK PI as long as the study is still open and patient has not received alternate systemic therapy.</description>
