      The Clinical trial is a phase I/IIa clinical study for treatment of knee osteoarthritis by&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of bone marrow derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is safety of allogeneic BM-MSCs application on knee OA with single dose&#xD;
      IA injection and the MTD. Secondary endpoint is the effect of allogeneic BM-MSCs&#xD;
      transplantation including clinical and image observation since the MSCs have multi-lineage&#xD;
      differentiation potential such as chondrocyte differentiation, anti-inflammation and&#xD;
      immune-modulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee (Knee Osteoarthritis, Knee OA) is a joint disease that primarily&#xD;
      affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the&#xD;
      joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn&#xD;
      away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause&#xD;
      pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become&#xD;
      deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell&#xD;
      therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products&#xD;
      used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the&#xD;
      treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been&#xD;
      observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be&#xD;
      isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24&#xD;
      recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first&#xD;
      stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing&#xD;
      groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage,&#xD;
      knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as&#xD;
      determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6&#xD;
      months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which&#xD;
      the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments.&#xD;
