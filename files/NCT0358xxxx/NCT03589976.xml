  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-II, futility clinical trial to determine&#xD;
      if oral sirolimus is of sufficient promise to slow disease progression in MSA, prior to&#xD;
      embarking on a large-scale and costly phase III study to assess its efficacy. A futility&#xD;
      design under the null hypothesis assumes that sirolimus will slow the progression of the&#xD;
      disease, whereas the alternative hypothesis assumes no benefit of sirolimus. If the null&#xD;
      hypothesis is rejected (i.e., futility of sirolimus to slow progression of MSA), a major&#xD;
      phase III study will be discouraged, whereas non-futility will offer strong support for a&#xD;
      phase III trial to detect clinical efficacy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants aged 30-80 years old with a diagnosis of MSA based on clinical criteria&#xD;
             and standardized autonomic testing. This approach allows for identification of&#xD;
             patients with MSA with very high specificity and is yet sensitive enough to allow for&#xD;
             enrollment of patients at a disease stage at which an intervention on the natural&#xD;
             disease course has a meaningful impact on patient outcome. Patients therefore have to&#xD;
             fulfill current consensus criteria (1) for probable MSA of the parkinsonian subtype&#xD;
             (MSA-P) or cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) and have findings on autonomic function testing&#xD;
             suggestive of MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are less than 4 years from the time of documented MSA diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are still able to walk with or without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with an anticipated survival of at least 3 years in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to give informed consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for at&#xD;
             least 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during study&#xD;
             participation and for an additional 8 weeks after the end of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure&#xD;
             effective contraception with partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations (see section 5.3) throughout study&#xD;
             duration&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who do not practice an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control. Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are: surgical&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might preclude safe completion of the study&#xD;
             or might affect the results of the study. These include conditions causing significant&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS) or autonomic dysfunction, including congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, recent (&lt;6 months) myocardial infarct, cardiopulmonary disease, severe,&#xD;

             prior to baseline.&#xD;

             itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin, cisapride, metoclopramide,&#xD;
