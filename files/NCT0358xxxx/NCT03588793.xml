  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is experienced by 60-80% of all people who have had an amputation.&#xD;
      This persistent pain condition can impact on independence, activities of daily living and&#xD;
      overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is some research into PLP there is no consensus on appropriate outcome measures&#xD;
      and there is (to our knowledge) neither guideline nor literature evidence on the reliability&#xD;
      and validity of outcomes measures for this patient group. Such measures are vital to the&#xD;
      robust evaluation of any interventions and/or monitoring progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the reliability and validity of four self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires (Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2&#xD;
      (SFMPQ-2), Trinity Amputation and Prosthetic Evaluation Scale (TAPES), a health-related&#xD;
      quality of life measure (EQ-5D-L), a pain diary, a left/right limb judgement task (Implicit&#xD;
      Motor Imagery Testing - IMIT) and the two-point discrimination (TPD)test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collated and statistically analysed to assess how stable each of the&#xD;
      measures are over time (intra session reliability) and how each measure co-relates with the&#xD;
      others (validity).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: ≥ 18 years At least six months post amputation (date of surgery) The amputation&#xD;
             must be above wrist/ankle. Are currently experiencing PLP which has persisted for at&#xD;
             least 3 months or more They rate their PLP as ≥3 on a 0-10 scale on at least 2 days in&#xD;
             the preceding week Concomitant medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating in any research trial of any intervention hypothesised to affect PLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently under-going active prosthetic rehabilitation e.g. walking training sessions or&#xD;
        upper limb rehabilitation sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any current non-prescribed substance dependency An inability to understand and follow basic&#xD;
        instructions - both the two-point discrimination test and left/right limb judgement task&#xD;
        requires the participant to follow basic/simple instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any person, otherwise eligible, who commences any treatment for PLP (physical or&#xD;
        pharmacological, prescribed or non-prescribed) will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
