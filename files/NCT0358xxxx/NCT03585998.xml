  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II study, in which 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Etoposide and&#xD;
      Cisplatin) and durvalumab with thoracic radiotherapy (52.2Gy, 2.1Gy/Fx) start at the 3rd&#xD;
      cycle of chemotherapy and durvalumab for limited disease-small cell lung cancer. Four weeks&#xD;
      after completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, patients will receive durvalumab&#xD;
      consolidation monotherapy every 4 weeks until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      up to the maximum duration of 2 years since enrollment.&#xD;
