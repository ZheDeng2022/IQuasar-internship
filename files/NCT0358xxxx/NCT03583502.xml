  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) belongs to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs)&#xD;
      category and is a major building block for neuronal and retinal membranes, playing a crucial&#xD;
      role in brain and visual development within the first months of life. Due to the lack of&#xD;
      enzymes for the synthesis of its precursors, neonates strictly rely on dietary intakes of&#xD;
      DHA. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a small crustacean rich in phospholipid-bound&#xD;
      DHA, which is highly bioavailable, but whether it is effective in increasing DHA excretion in&#xD;
      breast milk (BM) has not been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether maternal supplementation with krill oil during&#xD;
      breastfeeding increases DHA contents in breast milk BM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      open, randomized, controlled study and randomly allocated in 2 groups. Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      an oral krill oil-based supplement providing 250 mg/day of DHA and 70 mg/day of EPA for 30&#xD;
      days, whereas group 2 serves as control. BM samples from both groups will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline (T0) and day 30 (T1) and will undergo a qualitative analysis of LCPUFAs composition&#xD;
      by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 n-3) and&#xD;
      arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6), are major building blocks for the lipid bilayer of neuronal&#xD;
      and retinal membranes. Brain maturation and visual development start during pregnancy and&#xD;
      continue throughout the first year of life; hence, the role of LCPUFAs is greatest during&#xD;
      this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like all mammals, humans lack enzymes for the synthesis of n-3 and n-6 precursors of DHA and&#xD;
      AA, which are therefore essential fatty acids and need to be provided by dietary sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast milk (BM) is the first nutritional choice in term and preterm neonates, and is&#xD;
      considered an appropriate and natural source of essential fatty acids in this population.&#xD;
      Among LCPUFAs, the role of DHA in the early phases of life has gained increased attention&#xD;
      over the last 20 years. Several studies have proved the beneficial effects of DHA on visual&#xD;
      acuity and learning skills in neonates; some of these trials have also underpinned the&#xD;
      importance of dietary DHA sources, showing improved visual acuity in breastfed term neonates&#xD;
      or preterm neonates fed LCPUFA-supplemented formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of LCPUFAs excreted in BM, however, is significantly influenced by the related&#xD;
      maternal dietary intakes, and this is particularly evident for mothers with extremely high&#xD;
      fish consumption or on a vegetarian diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sherry et al. have demonstrated that a 6-week supplementation with low or high dose of DHA in&#xD;
      lactating women significantly increases DHA concentration in BM and maternal plasma compared&#xD;
      with placebo; consistently, breastfed infants of supplemented mothers showed higher plasma&#xD;
      DHA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antarctic krill, a small crustacean belonging to the order Euphausiacea, is by far the most&#xD;
      dominant member of the Antarctic zooplankton community, and also represents a rich source of&#xD;
      n-3 LCPUFAs, such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Compared to fish oil, krill oil has&#xD;
      similar DHA contents, but provides higher amounts of EPA. In addition, fish oil fatty acids&#xD;
      are mainly stored as triglycerides (TG), whereas in krill oil are predominantly incorporated&#xD;
      to phospholipids (PL), with significantly enhanced bioavailability. To date, the effects of&#xD;
      maternal supplementation with krill oil during lactation on BM LCPUFAs composition is still&#xD;
      an issue for discussion/has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate whether oral maternal supplementation with krill&#xD;
      oil combined to fish oil in breastfeeding mothers increases BM concentration of DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breastfeeding mothers of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of&#xD;
      Sant'Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna, Italy, will be consecutively enrolled if a&#xD;
      written informed consent to participate in the present study is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled will undergo open randomization to 2 groups. Group 1 will receive 2 gelatin&#xD;
      soft capsules per day of a combined krill and fish oil supplement (Krilling DÂ®, Italchimici&#xD;
      S.P.A., Milan, Italy), providing 250 mg/day of DHA and 70 mg/day of EPA, for overall 30 days,&#xD;
      whereas group 2 will serve as control. Ten ml of fresh mid-BM samples will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline (T0) and at day 30 (T1) of supplementation in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection, DHA, AA and EPA contents of BM samples will be analyzed at the laboratory&#xD;
      of the Center for Applied Biomedical Research (CRBA) of Sant'Orsola-Malpighi University&#xD;
      Hospital, Bologna, Italy, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.&#xD;
