  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in the body (locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic). Ixazomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and doxorubicin, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ixazomib, gemcitabine, and&#xD;
      doxorubicin may work better in treating patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) treated with combination&#xD;
      of ixazomib with gemcitabine and doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of&#xD;
      response (DOR) and safety of the combination of ixazomib with gemcitabine and doxorubicin in&#xD;
      patients with RMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate potential biomarkers, such as tumor tissue protein disulfide isomerase (PDI),&#xD;
      binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), and phosphorylated eIF2a (eIF2aP), as well as serum&#xD;
      levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), for patient stratification, and as pharmacodynamics measures&#xD;
      of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine, via the molecular profiling of biopsy and blood speciments, the mechanisms&#xD;
      of resistance to the trial therapy (ixazomib + gemcitabine + doxorubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO), gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 90&#xD;
      minutes, and doxorubicin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for&#xD;
      up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ixazomib PO and gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 14 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic RMC histologically confirmed by expert&#xD;
             pathology review and loss of SMARCB1 staining by immunohistochemistry. Also eligible&#xD;
             are patients with other rare SMARCB1-negative tumors of the kidney, such as advanced&#xD;
             or metastatic unclassified renal cell carcinoma with medullary phenotype (a rare RMC&#xD;
             variant occurring in individuals without sickle hemoglobinopathies), and adult-onset&#xD;
             malignant rhabdoid tumors. The principal investigator (PI) is the final arbiter in&#xD;
             questions related to eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible regardless of whether they have had prior nephrectomy or&#xD;
             still have their primary tumor in-situ. Patients with prior nephrectomy can be&#xD;
             screened for enrollment at any time following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease, defined as a lesion that&#xD;
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded)&#xD;
             and measures &gt;= 15 mm with conventional techniques or &gt;= 10 mm with more sensitive&#xD;
             techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or spiral computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             scan. If the patient has had previous radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be&#xD;
             evidence of progression since the radiation. Patients with disease confined to bone&#xD;
             may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present or a serum marker is elevated&#xD;
             (&gt; 4 x upper limit of normal [ULN]). The PI is the final arbiter in questions related&#xD;
             to measurability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can have received prior immunotherapies such as anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1, or&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors, or targeted therapies such as sunitinib,&#xD;
             pazopanib, axitinib, cabozantinib, bevacizumab, erlotinib, and everolimus, or any&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens with the exception of regimens using a combination of&#xD;
             gemcitabine &gt;= 800 mg/m^2 plus adriamycin &gt;= 30 mg/m^2. In addition, the total&#xD;
             lifetime dose of doxorubicin prior to enrollment must not exceed 382 mg/m^2 as these&#xD;
             would preclude patients from receiving at least 4 cycles of induction therapy of the&#xD;
             trial protocol. Patients must not have received any proteasome inhibitors such as&#xD;
             bortezomib or carfilzomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be evidence of progression on or after last treatment regimen received.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2. NOTE: If subject is&#xD;
             unable to walk due to paralysis, but is mobile in a wheelchair, subject is considered&#xD;
             to be ambulatory for the purpose of assessing their performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adolescent patients age 12 years and older are allowed with signed assent and parental&#xD;
             consent according to institutional guidelines and requirements, as long as their body&#xD;
             surface area (BSA) is &gt;=1.2 given that this is the lower limit for which the&#xD;
             independence between BSA and ixazomib exposure has been ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dl (treatment allowed). May receive transfusion (within 14 days of&#xD;
             the first dose of the study drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1000/uL. Without growth factor support (filgrastim or&#xD;
             pegfilgrastim) for at least 14 days (within 14 days of the first dose of the study&#xD;
             drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 75,000/uL. Platelet transfusions to help patients meet eligibility&#xD;
             criteria are not allowed within 3 days before study enrollment (within 14 days of the&#xD;
             first dose of the study drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl. For patients with Gilbert's disease, total bilirubin&#xD;
             should be =&lt; 3 mg/dL (=&lt; 51.3 umol/L) (within 14 days of the first dose of the study&#xD;
             drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) or&#xD;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 2.5 X&#xD;
             institutional ULN, except in known hepatic metastasis, wherein may be =&lt; 5 x ULN as&#xD;
             per current American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations. Approximately 15%&#xD;
             of patients with RMC develop liver metastases (within 14 days of the first dose of the&#xD;
             study drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/kg/1.73 m^2. If creatinine is not &lt; 1.5 x ULN, then&#xD;
             calculate by Cockcroft-Gault methods or local institutional standard (within 14 days&#xD;
             of the first dose of the study drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN prior to study entry. Therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin is allowed if&#xD;
             target INR =&lt; 3 on a stable dose of warfarin or other oral anticoagulant, or on a&#xD;
             stable dose of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for &gt; 2 weeks (14 days) at the time&#xD;
             of enrollment. Patients who have liver metastases resulting in INR and/or PTT &gt; 1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN and require chronic (&gt;= 3 months) anticoagulation are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a measured ejection fraction of at least 45% as measured by either&#xD;
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan, echocardiogram, stress test, or ventriculography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with controlled brain metastases are allowed on protocol if they have&#xD;
             solitary brain metastasis that is asymptomatic and not requiring treatment or that was&#xD;
             surgically resected or treated with radiosurgery or gamma knife, without recurrence or&#xD;
             edema for 1 month (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are surgically sterile, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human&#xD;
                  chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of the study&#xD;
                  drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP must agree to practice 2 effective method(s) of contraception, at the same time,&#xD;
             from the time of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5&#xD;
             half-lives of study drug (s) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of&#xD;
             5 months post treatment completion, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is&#xD;
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception). Complete abstinence is defined as complete&#xD;
             avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for&#xD;
             all study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abstinence is only acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, profession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
             Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of&#xD;
             contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable&#xD;
             alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event&#xD;
             that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status&#xD;
             post-vasectomy), must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of treatment with study drug (s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus&#xD;
             90 days duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt&#xD;
             from contraceptive requirements. However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as&#xD;
             described in these sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study&#xD;
             enrollment or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of&#xD;
             residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any&#xD;
             type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection. Patients with another&#xD;
             malignancy on watch and wait without any needing of treatment can be enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received anticancer therapies (including chemotherapy and&#xD;
             targeted therapy) within 2 weeks (14 days) or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter)&#xD;
             prior to study day 1. Patients who have completed palliative radiation therapy more&#xD;
             than 14 days prior to study day 1 are eligible. If the involved field is small, 7 days&#xD;
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the&#xD;
             ixazomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury (injury&#xD;
             requiring &gt; 4 weeks [28 days] to heal) within 4 weeks (28 days) of start of study&#xD;

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt; 1 .5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is not controlled&#xD;
                  (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and&#xD;
                  without improvement) despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.&#xD;
