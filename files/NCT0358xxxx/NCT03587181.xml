  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two main mechanisms for atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after cryoablation include&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and the presence of non-PV associated arrhythmic focuses.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of each mechanism and if biomarkers&#xD;
      may be used to predict of these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF will undergo PV isolation with cryoablation&#xD;
      followed by loop recorder implantation. Patients in whom atrial tachyarrhythmias recur during&#xD;
      12 months follow-up (outside of the 3-month post procedure blanking window) will be offered a&#xD;
      second electrophysiology study (EP) study to assess PV isolation and non-PV focuses and&#xD;
      further ablation performed as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline blood samples will be taken to investigate the correlation between specific&#xD;
      biomarkers and both the incidence and type of recurrence. The correlation between recurrence&#xD;
      of atrial tachyarrhythmias due to non-PV associated arrhythmic focuses and elevated baseline&#xD;
      levels of NT-ProBNP, CRP, TNF, MMP1 will be pre-specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 consecutive patients will have a biopsy taken from the intraventricular and interatrial&#xD;
      septum to investigate the correlation between myocardial inflammation, the presence of&#xD;
      fibrosis and recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Correlation between biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and biopsy-proven myocardial inflammation or fibrosis will be assessed.&#xD;

      second EP study to assess PV isolation and non-PV focuses and further ablation performed as&#xD;
      required. Recurrence will be defined as an episode of atrial tachyarrhythmia (AF, atypical&#xD;
      atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia) on loop recorder with a duration greater than 30&#xD;
      seconds or ECG document atrial tachyarrhythmia. The incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmia&#xD;
      recurrence, and its association with symptoms after the index PV cryoballoon isolation, will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline blood samples will be taken to assess levels of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide (NT-proBNP), High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (high-sensitive CRP), Tumor Necrosis&#xD;
      Factor (TNF), Interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), Fatty acid binding protein (FABP), Matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), Matrix metalloproteinase-9&#xD;
      (MMP9), Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases&#xD;
      1 (TIMP-1), Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF-9). Correlation between recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias due to non-PV associated arrhythmic focuses and elevated baseline levels of&#xD;
      NT-ProBNP, CRP, TNF, MMP1 will be pre-specified. We will look with receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve analysis the level of biomarkers which predict recurrence of&#xD;
      atrial tachyarrhythmias with the best ratio between sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 consecutive patients will have a biopsy taken from the intraventricular and interatrial&#xD;
      septum to investigate the correlation between myocardial inflammation, the presence of&#xD;
      fibrosis and recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Correlation between biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and biopsy-proven myocardial inflammation or fibrosis will be assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Cryoablation of the pulmonary veins and myocardial biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Before intervention blood samples will be collected for biobank storage. After left atrial appendage thrombus exclusion, a cardiac biopsy from intraventricular and interatrial septum will be performed. PV isolation will be performed with cryoablation. Successful PV isolation will be confirmed by the confirmation of bi-directional block. Phrenic nerve function will be assessed in a standard fashion during intervention of the right PVs using high output phrenic nerve pacing from the superior vena cava. Loop recorder implantation will be performed during the same procedure.&#xD;
In patients with recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias an EP study will be performed to assess the mechanism of recurrence. PV reconnections will be re-isolated and linear lesions performed as required.</description>
