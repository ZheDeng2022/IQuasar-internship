      The aim of this study is to test a non-invasive imaging technique to reliably diagnose NAFLD&#xD;
      in children and adolescents with obesity and assess the degree of fibrosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) is by far the most common form of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease worldwide. It is estimated that it affects up to 1/3 of the adult population in&#xD;
      industrialized countries and additionally more and more children are affected. The term NAFLD&#xD;
      covers a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from simple hepatic steatosis (accumulation of&#xD;
      fat in hepatocytes) to NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). The latter is a progression of&#xD;
      liver steatosis with inflammation, fibrosis and chronic inflammatory structural changes. Up&#xD;
      to 20% of a NASH develops liver cirrhosis, more rarely also a hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the degree of fibrosis is the most important parameter for the clinical&#xD;
      course and prognosis. In addition, patients with mild lobular inflammation or fibrosis&#xD;
      (regardless of severity) have an increased risk of developing NASH compared to patients with&#xD;
      exclusive steatosis. A significant number of patients with NAFL may develop fibrotising NASH&#xD;
      (5-20%). This is particularly the case when metabolic factors continue to deteriorate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD. In particular,&#xD;
      differentiation between NAFL and NASH and the degree of fibrosis are still only possible&#xD;
      using histology. The invasive nature of the procedure involves risks to the patient's health&#xD;
      such as bleeding, injuries to other organs or nerves, and complications of anesthesia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, since the biopsy is taken selectively as a liver biopsy, it is possible to test&#xD;
      a sample that does not adequately represent the degree of actual fibrosis, since regional&#xD;
      differences in the severity of liver fibrosis can often be present. In addition, the liver&#xD;
      biopsy is associated with considerable costs. Accordingly, liver biopsy is not an optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure and is hardly suitable as a diagnostic method for short-term follow-up&#xD;
      under therapy. For this reason, a reliable, non-invasive method has long been sought to&#xD;
      diagnose NAFLD, to distinguish NASH from steatosis, to assess the degree of fibrosis and&#xD;
      which allows a less stressful assessment of the course of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging procedures are available here. B-image sonography is already routinely used in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with suspected or proven NASH for the detection of liver remodeling&#xD;
      processes, in particular fibrosis. B-scan sonography is an excellent method for determining&#xD;
      the presence and extent of hepatic steatosis, but the detection and graduation of liver&#xD;
      fibrosis using B-mode sonography is only possible in very advanced stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the determination of tissue stiffness in various organ systems and their&#xD;
      pathologies, such as the breast, tendons and liver, has been successfully used in adults.&#xD;
      Individual reports in adults give first indications that liver remodelling processes, in&#xD;
      particular fibrosis by means of shear wave elastography (SWE), can be diagnosed in early&#xD;
      stages. However, the evidence of the use of SWE in children to assess liver parenchyma&#xD;
      changes, especially in NAFLD, is still insufficient. Therefore, in this study it will be&#xD;
      investigated whether the rt-SWE provides reproducible values for liver stiffness and fibrosis&#xD;
      in children and adolescents and by that a reliably diagnosis of NAFLD and assessment of the&#xD;
      degree of fibrosis is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned clinical examination and blood collection for laboratory chemical examinations&#xD;
      are part of the routine follow-up of patients with obesity and steatosis hepatis. There will&#xD;
      be no additional examinations, so there will be no greater burden on the young patients and&#xD;
      no additional time expenditure.&#xD;

    <description>The SWE is carried out intercostally. If possible, the patient should hold the breath for 5-10 seconds. So-called colour charts are used, which indicate the derived liver stiffness in colour-coded form. In addition to the visual assessment of these colour charts, the quantitative ROI-based measurement of the SWE in kPa is performed in the &quot;hardest&quot; appearing areas. The measurement is performed at 5 different sites of the liver parenchyma and all SWE values are recorded.</description>

        The patient group is recruited from the obesity consultation hour as well as the emergency&#xD;
        consultation hour and the wards of the Clinic for Paediatrics and Youth Medicine at the&#xD;
        University Hospital Aachen.&#xD;
