      Investigators seek a new therapeutic strategy for castrated resistant prostate cancer(CRPC)&#xD;
      patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway deficiency by next generation sequencing(NGS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of castrated resistant prostate cancer(CRPC) is very poor.Now,there is not an&#xD;
      ideal therapeutic strategy.Further clarifying its mechanism and finding more effective&#xD;
      therapeutic targets on this basis are the clinical problems to be solved urgently. More and&#xD;
      more studies have confirmed that the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in the&#xD;
      development of castration resistance to prostate cancer.By next generation sequencing of 115&#xD;
      patients with CRPC, investigators found that 22% of the patients had mutations in the&#xD;
      PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling related genes.Investigators found that 50% of the patients could&#xD;
      benefit from the mTOR inhibitors.But the specific clinical significance and molecular&#xD;
      mechanism are urgently needed to be elucidated. This project is based on the hypothesis that&#xD;
      Everolimus can target CRPC patients with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways&#xD;
      deficiency.So,investigators intend to peform a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled,multicenter clinical study to find potential therapeutic targets and treatment&#xD;
      strategies for CRPC patients.&#xD;
