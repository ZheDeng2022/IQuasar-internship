  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in modern medicine and critical care interventions have greatly impacted survival of&#xD;
      critically ill patients, but these interventions are not without consequences. Although&#xD;
      patients may now survive the initial critical illness, these patients may not recover to&#xD;
      their pre-illness baseline state of health. Recent data in both the critically ill adult and&#xD;
      neonatal patients who survive sepsis or surgical events have been shown to progress to&#xD;
      persistent inflammatory, immunosuppressed, catabolic syndrome (PICS). This was first&#xD;
      identified in adult trauma patients, and more recently was defined in critically ill&#xD;
      neonates. To date, there are no published reports of PICS in the critically ill pediatric&#xD;
      population. Our long-term goal is to understand PICS in the pediatric population and how&#xD;
      early medical and nutritional interventions may impact overall morbidity and survival. To&#xD;
      achieve this goal first PICS must first be characterized in the pediatric population. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that PICS occurs in pediatric patients and is associated with increased time to&#xD;
      return to a baseline functional life post-injury or illness. The hypothesis will be tested by&#xD;
      pursuing the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the incidence of PICS in&#xD;
      the pediatric population and associate the diagnosis of PICS to survival and time to return&#xD;
      to baseline functional life and Specific Aim 2: To determine if early increased inflammatory&#xD;
      and immunosuppressive markers are associated with the development of PICS and increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. These aims will be accomplished by conducting a prospective&#xD;
      single-center observational pilot study to enroll pediatric patients with an anticipated&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay greater than 14 days. Through these two aims, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that this research will provide an explanation into the interplay of&#xD;
      inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism in critically ill children, which is&#xD;
      imperative to the development of early therapeutic and nutritional interventions that can&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness.&#xD;

      The long-term goal of this study is to understand PICS in the pediatric population and how&#xD;
      early medical and nutritional interventions may impact overall morbidity and survival, but&#xD;
      first PICS must be characterized in the pediatric population. The hypothesize is that PICS&#xD;
      occurs in pediatric critically ill patients and is associated with increased time to return&#xD;
      to a baseline functional life post-injury or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment/Randomization This is a prospective observational study with no randomization. The&#xD;
      patients will be approached between PICU stay days 9-12 for consent. Labs will be drawn&#xD;
      between PICU stay days 12-16 with a preference for PICU day 14, however, labs will be drawn&#xD;
      in accordance with the standard of care labs to avoid additional draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the incidence of PICS in the pediatric population and associate&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PICS to survival and time to return to baseline functional life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the incidence of PICS in PICU patients, a prospective single-center&#xD;
      study will be conducted of all critically ill pediatric patients admitted to PICU at Riley&#xD;
      Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, IN. Patients will be&#xD;
      included if they have an anticipated stay of &gt;14 days in the PICU. Patients will be excluded&#xD;
      from this study if they have are maintained on chronic mechanical ventilation, have a known&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory disease process, or are diagnosed with failure to thrive or malnutrition&#xD;
      upon admission to the PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected will include demographic data, nutrition data (weight,&#xD;
      protein/non-protein calories received, type of nutrition and prescribed goal nutrition by a&#xD;
      dietician), severity of illness, length of stay in the PICU and hospital. Existing routine&#xD;
      labs from admission and PICU stay including blood counts, electrolytes and nutrition labs&#xD;
      will be collected. At 14 days (± 1 day) the patient will be approached for inclusion into the&#xD;
      study. At that time, routine labs to check for inflammation and nutritional status such as&#xD;
      CRP, total lymphocyte count, albumin, prealbumin, and retinol binding protein will be&#xD;
      collected Diagnosis of PICS will be determined when a patient has been admitted to the PICU&#xD;
      for &gt;14 days and has signs of both inflammation (CRP &gt;15mg/L) and immunosuppression (total&#xD;
      lymphocyte count &lt; 0.80×109/L), as well as catabolism (Serum albumin &lt; 3.0g/dL, Prealbumin&#xD;
      &lt;10mg/dL, Retinol binding protein &lt;10μg/dL, and weight loss &gt;10% or body mass index &lt;18&#xD;
      during hospitalization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered and stored in in a de-identified/HIPAA compliant manner using a password&#xD;
      protected web-based database that has securities to protect confidentiality and data&#xD;
      integrity. The database will be constructed in REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical risk factors will be summarized and distributions examined. Relationships between&#xD;
      the variables and the development of PICS will be explored using plots, correlation&#xD;
      coefficients, and contingency tables. The association between clinical variables, including&#xD;
      nutritional interventions, and PICS will then be analyzed with logistic regression. Both&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate analyses will be conducted. The significance threshold p-value is&#xD;
      set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine if early increased inflammatory and immunosuppressive markers&#xD;
      are associated with the development of PICS and increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample management and processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to CRP and TLC, which will be collected at 14 days (± 1 day) of PICU admission ,&#xD;
      additional blood samples will be collected at these time points to be frozen for further&#xD;
      analysis. At the time of blood collection, an additional 5 mL of blood will be collected,&#xD;
      processed, and stored at -80 degree Celsius. Once desired time-points are identified and&#xD;
      further funding obtained, samples will be processed in batches to evaluate biochemical&#xD;
      markers of inflammation. This will be performed using The Inflammatory Cytokine Human&#xD;
      Magnetic 5-Plex Panel for the Luminex™ platform. This will quantify GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8&#xD;
      and TNF-α in serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcomes will focus on characterizing PICS in the pediatric population and&#xD;
      identifying early inflammatory markers that may correlate with the development of PICS and&#xD;
      subsequently increased morbidity associated with critical illness. The results are expected&#xD;
      to have a positive impact by filling a key gap in the understanding of the mechanism of PICS&#xD;
      in critically ill children. This research will provide insight into the interplay of&#xD;
      inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism in critically ill children, which is&#xD;
      imperative to the development of early therapeutic and nutritional interventions that can&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness.&#xD;
