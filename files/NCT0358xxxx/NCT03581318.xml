  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive tool to study and diagnose&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create&#xD;
      pictures of body organs. Researchers want to find better MRI methods and new ways of imaging&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and better understand normal and abnormal cardiovascular and brain&#xD;
      function. Researchers are also interested in seeing if gadolinium, the commonly used MRI&#xD;
      contrast agent, stays in the body long after the MRI was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop new methods for imaging the heart and other organs of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe cardiovascular diseases using newer MRI methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look at the relationship between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      and other organ systems&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look for gadolinium deposits in the brain from prior exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people and people with known or suspected cardiovascular disease ages 7 and older may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers may be particularly interested in those who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have suspected or known cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Were previously exposed to a gadolinium-based contrast agent,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need to have a heart MRI scheduled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need a test of the heart or other body part or will be undergoing a future cardiac&#xD;
           catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multiple arms to the study with optional components; therefore, there are multiple&#xD;
      variations as to what an individual participant s experience may involve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an MRI scan lasting up to 2 hours. The scanner is a large hollow tube.&#xD;
      During the scan, there may be loud knocking and buzzing sounds caused by the scanner.&#xD;
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the tube. Their vital signs may be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a test of heart electrical activity using wires connected to pads on&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be injected with an MRI contrast agent through a plastic tube inserted in&#xD;
      the arm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to develop and test new MRI techniques applicable to patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiovascular evaluation with the ultimate goal of translating the technical&#xD;
      advances into improving clinical diagnosis and management of patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiovascular evaluation. Patients undergoing cardiovascular evaluation and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be scanned under the protocol. We will evaluate new developments in&#xD;
      non-contrast and contrast MRI of the heart and blood vessels and novel post-processing&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the newer sequences will be used to improve clinical imaging workflow and disease&#xD;
      diagnosis. We hope to use this protocol to clearly describe cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      associated problems using novel MRI methods and follow certain subsets of patients with&#xD;
      disease as part of a natural history process. Inter-related physiologic systems may be&#xD;
      phenotyped by MRI with characterization of disease associations between different organ&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, information regarding gadolinium deposition of the brain will be gathered. The&#xD;
      literature regarding deposition of gadolinium in the brain has a large void regarding&#xD;
      information of prevalence of the phenomenon in healthy subjects. The National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health has a large healthy subject pool who have participated in gadolinium contrast MRI&#xD;
      studies. This pool of healthy subjects is not easily available at most clinical MRI centers,&#xD;
      and thus, we are uniquely well-situated to be able to answer this outstanding question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all objectives, MRI studies will be conducted in the NIH MRI systems located at the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. These procedures may involve the intravenous&#xD;
      administration of commercially available MR contrast media and exercise or pharmacologic&#xD;
      stress testing. Results will be used to evaluate the performance of various research pulse&#xD;
      sequences, gradient coils, and radiofrequency receiver coils on human subjects and will&#xD;
      provide essential ground work for specific patient protocols, both diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic.&#xD;
