      Evaluate the impact and satisfaction of Mobile Mindfulness Meditation on anxiety, pain,&#xD;
      fatigue, trauma, and sleep in cancer survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through previous research, mindfulness meditation has been linked to decreases in anxiety,&#xD;
      increased pain tolerance, better mood, and improved quality of life, in both healthy and&#xD;
      medical populations. Although mindfulness meditation is well promoted both clinically and in&#xD;
      the media, finding ways to promote engagement in and fidelity to the intervention, in a&#xD;
      format that is accessible for cancer survivors is crucial, as the availability of resources&#xD;
      and appreciation of the benefits does not necessarily lead to behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With many more people surviving cancer than in previous decades, there is an opportunity to&#xD;
      act on the residual effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, and with the prevalence of&#xD;
      technology ever increasing, online and mobile interventions have become more frequently&#xD;
      delivered and have a particular utility for this population. Physical and geographic&#xD;
      limitations could prevent cancer survivors from accessing psychosocial interventions. Whether&#xD;
      the repeated beneficial findings of face-to-face training in mindfulness meditation will be&#xD;
      found in a mobile environment is an open and timely question. This intervention will include&#xD;
      two arms: the impact of the use of the mobile app for anxiety and for cancer related&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured with the PEG-3, a three item measure assessing pain intensity, interference with general activity, and interference with enjoyment of life, with response options ranging from a 0-10 scale (0 being &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 being &quot;pains as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;completely interferes&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on fatigue as measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory (Anxiety Arm)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory, a 9-item measure where respondents are asked to rate their fatigue on an 11-point scale, with options on three items ranging from either &quot;no fatigue&quot; to &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot; and options on the remaining items ranging from &quot;does not interfere&quot; to &quot;completely interferes&quot;</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mindfulness Coach on pain as measured with the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Neuropathy Arm)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report questionnaire, consisting of 3 major classes of word descriptors--sensory, affective/emotional impact and cognitive evaluation of pain. The Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ) was developed to provide an instrument that could be completed in less time than the MPQ but would still reflect both the sensory and affective dimensions of pain and has been shown to have high correlations with the original McGill Pain Scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mindfulness Coach on anxiety as measured with the PROMIS anxiety (Neuropathy Arm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mindfulness Coach on fatigue as measured with the BFI (Neuropathy Arm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a 15-item measure assessing both the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning64. This is included at all three time-points as an additional outcome measure.</description>
