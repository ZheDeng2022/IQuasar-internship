      PreOperative Brain Irradiation in Glioblastoma (POBIG) is a phase I study that will test the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of a single fraction of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with a&#xD;
      new radiological diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM). After the single fraction of radiotherapy,&#xD;
      patients will receive standard treatment. The standard treatment consists of resection of the&#xD;
      tumor followed by (chemo)radiation (i.e. radiotherapy +/- daily temozolomide (75mg/m2) for 6&#xD;
      weeks (60Gy/30fr) or for 3 weeks (40Gy/15fr)).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults. Its outcomes are&#xD;
      poor due to local disease progression in most patients. Current treatment includes surgery&#xD;
      followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy 4-6 weeks after surgery. In this time interval,&#xD;
      some tumour cells do not receive any treatment. Furthermore, studies show that around half of&#xD;
      all glioblastoma patients experience rapid early progression (REP) i.e. growth of the tumour&#xD;
      in the time interval between surgery and postoperative chemotherapy/radiotherapy. REP is&#xD;
      associated with a shorter survival and there are currently no effective treatments or&#xD;
      preventative measures to address it. Radiotherapy delivered earlier before the operation&#xD;
      could prevent REP and improve patient outcome. In this phase I study - PreOperative Brain&#xD;
      Irradiation in Glioblastoma (POBIG), we will test the safety and feasibility of giving a&#xD;
      single dose (fraction) of radiotherapy before surgery in patients with a new radiological&#xD;
      diagnosis of glioblastoma. This study will be a dose escalation study to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of preoperative radiotherapy and maximum volume of tumour that can be&#xD;
      safely irradiated preoperatively. This study will take place over 18 months. We hypothesise&#xD;
      that preoperative radiotherapy will reduce the rate of REP and improve patient outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with a new radiological diagnosis of GBM (judged by the neuro-oncology multidisciplinary team) are to be considered for this study.&#xD;
This study arm will use 5 radiotherapy doses (6 Gy, 8 Gy, 10 Gy, 12 Gy and 14 Gy) and three treatment volumes (&lt;30 cm3, 30-60 cm3 and &gt;60 cm3). The study will use 6 dosing levels based on a combination of radiotherapy dose and treatment volume. The stepwise inclusion process allows for variation in tumour volume and location. The study will commence with dosing level 1: 8 Gy to &lt;30 cm3 and 6 Gy to 30-60 cm3. In collaboration with the Clinical Trials Unit, the Trial Management Group will enter outcome data for patients at a given dose level into the CRM model. The model output will then guide dose escalation to determine the next dose level. After the single fraction of radiotherapy, patients will receive the standard treatment.</description>
