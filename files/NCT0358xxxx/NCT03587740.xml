  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an investigational drug as a possible treatment for breast&#xD;
      cancer that is positive for the protein Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, also known&#xD;
      as HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied and research doctors&#xD;
      are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use and the side effects it&#xD;
      may cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the long-term benefits of T-DM1 with regard&#xD;
      to breast cancer and take a closer look at the side effects experienced by participants&#xD;
      receiving T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for use in patients&#xD;
      with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, but it has been approved for use in advanced,&#xD;
      previously treated, HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-DM1 is an antibody-drug conjugate; it is made up of an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a&#xD;
      cytotoxic drug, DM1 (chemotherapy). T-DM1 functions as a targeted cancer therapy because it&#xD;
      targets HER2-positive breast cancer cells directly, limiting exposure of the rest of the body&#xD;
      to chemotherapy. More specifically, the trastuzumab in T-DM1 first binds to the HER2 protein&#xD;
      on the surface of the breast cancer cells and the DM1 then enters the cells and can cause&#xD;
      them to die, preventing tumor growth&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2-positive disease&#xD;
             by local pathology, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or amplification by FISH&#xD;
             (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2 or an average of ≥6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) AND confirmed&#xD;
             by Central Pathology Review (Dr. Deborah Dillon at Brigham and Women's Hospital,&#xD;
             Boston, MA) prior to patient being registered to begin protocol therapy. See section&#xD;
             3.4. http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2013.50.9984&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: DCIS components should not be counted in the determination of HER2 status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥60 years at the time of study registration (men and women eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage I-III breast&#xD;
             cancer with the following criteria met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If node-negative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor must&#xD;
             be &gt;5 mm of any hormone receptor subtype (document ER/PR status: if some ER/PR&#xD;
             staining is present, ER and PR negative are defined as being positive in &lt;10% cells&#xD;
             [per local pathology read]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If node-positive (N1-N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible (see&#xD;
             below for further details on defining node-negative disease) Definition of&#xD;
             node-negative disease (when node status known): If the patient has had a negative&#xD;
             sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary dissection, then the patient is&#xD;
             determined to be node-negative. Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters ≤&#xD;
             0.2 mm by either H&amp;E or IHC will be considered node-negative. Any axillary lymph node&#xD;
             with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2cm is considered a micrometastasis. Patients&#xD;
             with a micrometastasis are eligible even if their tumor is &lt;/= 5mm. An axillary&#xD;
             dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a positive sentinel node&#xD;
             and management of the axilla will be left up to the treating provider. In cases where&#xD;
             the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation,&#xD;
             the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility. In&#xD;
             these special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the patient&#xD;
             medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ER/PR determination assays performed by IHC methods according to the local institution&#xD;
             standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard chemotherapy/trastuzumab declined by patient OR patient is deemed by&#xD;
             physician for any reason to not be a candidate for standard therapy (i.e. patient&#xD;
             and/or provider choose not to pursue standard trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
             because of concerns related to toxicity or provider/patient preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with bilateral or multifocal/multicentric breast cancers, one of the&#xD;
             following criteria must be met to enroll: (1) each cancer individually meets criteria&#xD;
             for enrollment (only ONE tumor has to undergo central confirmation for HER2), (2) at&#xD;
             least one tumor meets eligibility (per tumor size/nodes/subtype outlined above) and&#xD;
             the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are also HER2-positive but&#xD;
             are too small for enrollment (e.g., a patient is eligible if a cancer is T2N0 and&#xD;
             HER2-positive in one breast, but the contralateral breast has a T1a HER2+ cancer that&#xD;
             isn't eligible on its own, (3) there is at least one qualifying tumor of &gt;5mm but&#xD;
             there are other small foci of disease that are too small to test for ER/PR/HER2 and&#xD;
             are felt to be a part of the same tumor or similar tumor, OR (4) at least one tumor&#xD;
             meets eligibility and the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are&#xD;
             HER2-negative and do not meet criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy per provider&#xD;
             discretion (e.g. if a patient has a HER2-positive tumor meeting eligibility but also&#xD;
             has a second, HER2-negative, small, node-negative, ER+, low grade cancer present, she&#xD;
             is still eligible for enrollment). However, in the specific case that a second breast&#xD;
             cancer is stage III and HER2-negative, that patient is excluded (because the second&#xD;
             cancer is high-risk and likely will require non-HER2-directed therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All tumor removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy&#xD;
             (lumpectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: Management of axillary lymph nodes is up to the treating provider; however, all&#xD;
             surgical margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e., no tumor on ink).&#xD;
             The local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology&#xD;
             report. If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is&#xD;
             permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the&#xD;
             pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise, if all other margins are&#xD;
             clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided&#xD;
             the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -≤90 days from the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer. Note:&#xD;
             In cases where registration will occur &gt;90 days from surgery but within an acceptable&#xD;
             time frame, patient may be eligible for enrollment with approval from the PI, Rachel&#xD;
             Freedman MD, MPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2. See Appendix F.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline ejection fraction ≥50% by MUGA scan or echocardiogram performed ≤60 days&#xD;
             prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt;9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If patient has known&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome, the suggested threshold for treatment is a total bilirubin&#xD;
                  ≤2.0 x ULN, but will be left to the treating providers discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤2.5 x ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR &lt;1.5 x ULN for institution unless patient is on planned therapy with&#xD;
                  anticoagulants (i.e., warfarin) with higher target planned. In those cases, INR&#xD;
                  up to 3.5 is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PTT &lt;1.5 x ULN for institution unless patient is on planned therapy with heparin&#xD;
                  or heparin-like products Note: In the case of longstanding ethnic neutropenia,&#xD;
                  patient may be eligible for enrollment with approval from the PI, Rachel Freedman&#xD;
                  MD, MPH.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing to employ adequate and appropriate birth control if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: This study is for patients aged 60 and older, and most female patients will have&#xD;
             entered menopause by this time; however patients should not become pregnant while on&#xD;
             this study because T-DM1 can affect an unborn baby. Pre-menopausal women need to use&#xD;
             birth control while on this study and women should not breastfeed a baby while on this&#xD;
             study. Any man treated on this study will also need to use contraception if his&#xD;
             partner is a premenopausal female. Patients should check with their health care&#xD;
             provider about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test done ≤7 days prior to registration, for women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential only&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: In the rare case that a woman enrolling on study is of childbearing potential, a&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required prior to enrollment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to return to consenting institution for follow-up at 6 months&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients will not require baseline staging PET or CT chest, abdomen, pelvis or bone&#xD;
             scan to rule out metastatic disease prior to enrollment. Any staging scans will be&#xD;
             ordered at the treating provider's discretion. If metastatic disease is found on any&#xD;
             staging studies done, patients will not be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced tumors at diagnosis (T4), including tumors fixed to the chest wall,&#xD;
             peau d'orange, skin ulcerations/nodules, or clinical inflammatory changes (diffuse&#xD;

             registration if liver function tests are outside of the normal institutional range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: A hepatitis panel is required of all participants as part of screening. Patients with&#xD;
        positive Hepatitis B or C serologies indicating active infection without known active&#xD;
        disease must meet the eligibility requirements for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, INR, PTT, and&#xD;
        alkaline phosphatase on at least two consecutive occasions, separated by at least 1 week.&#xD;
        Patients with laboratory evidence of vaccination to Hepatitis B (e.g., positive antibodies)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Requirement for oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or&#xD;
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the&#xD;
             prescribed regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
