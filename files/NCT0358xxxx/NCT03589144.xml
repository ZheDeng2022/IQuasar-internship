  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research uses the Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS / MS)&#xD;
      technique on dried blot spot samples for the neonatal screening of congenital adrenal&#xD;
      hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that this technique allow dosage of&#xD;
      adrenal steroids on dried blot spot samples as efficiently and with the same sensitivity than&#xD;
      the current technic on a cohort of 132 newborns aged 2 to 5 days, with a gestational age&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 30 weeks of amenorrhea.&#xD;

        National neonatal screening covers all newborns aged between 48 and 120 hours, regardless&#xD;
        of birth term. Premature babies born before 30 weeks of amenorrhoea are cared for in&#xD;
        specialized neonatal or intensive care units and are intensively monitored to rule out any&#xD;
        risk of not diagnosing HCS in a child with it. This is why our study will be conducted on a&#xD;
        newborn population with a birth term greater than 30 weeks of amenorrhoea.&#xD;
