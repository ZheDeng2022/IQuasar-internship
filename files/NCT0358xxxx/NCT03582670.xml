  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal of this work is to reduce disability among people with Parkinson disease&#xD;
      (PD) by enabling them to cope with cognitive decline so they can perform and participate in&#xD;
      desired activities and roles. This project focuses on prospective memory, or the ability to&#xD;
      remember to execute delayed intentions at the appropriate moment in the future. The current&#xD;
      study tests the effects of two primary cognitive intervention approaches (process training &amp;&#xD;
      strategy training) on prospective memory performance in PD. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      single-blind randomized controlled trial in which individuals with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      in PD (PD-MCI; N = 90) will complete pre-training assessment, randomization to training group&#xD;
      (control, process training, strategy training), four training sessions (process and strategy&#xD;
      training groups), and post-training assessment.&#xD;

      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a participant is enrolled in the study and completes the Pre-testing session (described&#xD;
      in detail below), they will be randomized into one of the following study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Process Training Group - the trainer teaches the participant about event- and time-based&#xD;
           prospective memory tasks, respectively. The trainer simply tells the participant that&#xD;
           s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in training games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strategy Training Group - In training sessions 1 and 2, in addition to teaching about&#xD;
           event- and time-based tasks, the trainer teaches the participant specific strategies for&#xD;
           each type of task (implementation intentions for event-based and strategic&#xD;
           clock-checking for time-based; and instructs in their use before and during the training&#xD;
           games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contro1 Group - Receives no training sessions. Only Completes the PRE, POST and 1-month&#xD;
           &amp; 3-month Follow Up portions of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VISITS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the day of their testing appointment, participants will arrive at their designated&#xD;
           location at the WUSM Movement Disorders Clinic for their testing session. All&#xD;
           participants will provide written informed consent before their first testing session&#xD;
           begins, and the examiner will answer any questions before beginning testing. Scheduled&#xD;
           participants will be mailed or emailed (depending on their preference) study information&#xD;
           and a copy of the consent form. Participants will receive reminder calls 1-2 days before&#xD;
           their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics will be collected on all participants. This includes age, gender, years of&#xD;
           education, living status, race, and ethnicity after consent is obtained. This can be&#xD;
           completed online via Redcap or on paper at the testing session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigators will collect PD clinical characteristics from the Movement Disorders&#xD;
           Clinical Record. Clinical Characteristics includes: Hoehhn &amp; Yahr Stage, year of first&#xD;
           PD symptoms, year of initial PD diagnosis, MoCA score at most recent clinic visit, Side&#xD;
           of symptom onset, type of symptom onset (tremor vs. bradykinesia), PD medications, and&#xD;
           most recent Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Motor Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the PRMQ, CAPM, IPA and BDI questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ; attached) - Used to rate the&#xD;
           participant's everyday retrospective and prospective memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive Assessment of Prospective Memory (CAPM; attached) - Used to rate the&#xD;
           participant's everyday prospective memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of Participation and Autonomy (IPA; attached)- A questionnaire about the&#xD;
           participant's ability to take part in daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, attached) - Used to characterize current depression,&#xD;
           which is common in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informant Report Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's will identify an informant (spouse, relative, or close friend) to fill out the&#xD;
      PRMQ Proxy Report, a Self-Reported CAPM, and a CAPM - Proxy Report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics will be collected on all informants. This includes age, gender, years of&#xD;
      education, living status, race, and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant and Informant questionnaires can be filled out prior to the study session via&#xD;
      Redcap. Most participants request this method because it saves them time on the day of the&#xD;
      study session. The online questionnaires have a consent form to look over before filling them&#xD;
      out (see attached online consent), and the participant agrees to the consent by clicking&#xD;
      &quot;Next&quot; in the online form, and completing the questionnaires; if participants elect to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires on paper, they can complete them at their testing session. The&#xD;
      research team will will first go over the written consent with them at the session before the&#xD;
      participant fills out the written questionnaires. Experimenters will check the questionnaires&#xD;
      for completion. This procedure will also be followed if the participant elects to fill out&#xD;
      the online questionnaire in Redcap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform testing while on their regular PD medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-training Assessment: (1.5 hours) - MoCA and Virtual Week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; attached) will be administered to assess global&#xD;
           cognition at the time of the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Virtual Week test (attached) will be administered to the participant. It is a&#xD;
           computerized board game that simulates daily life and real-world prospective memory&#xD;
           challenges. Each circuit represents one day in which the participant completes&#xD;
           time-appropriate activities and makes choices about them (i.e. the ongoing activity).&#xD;
           Each day has 8 prospective memory tasks (4 event based, 4 time based). Participants&#xD;
           complete a practice day and then three test days, with equivalent versions&#xD;
           counterbalanced across Pre and Post testing. The main outcome variable is the proportion&#xD;
           of correct prospective memory responses for each task type (12 event based, 12 time&#xD;
           based).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy Training Sessions (GROUPS 1-Process Training AND 2-Strategy Training ONLY): These&#xD;
      are 4 sessions that occur over the next 2 weeks after the Pre-training Assessment. (1 HOUR&#xD;
      EACH) GROUP 1, Process training: In sessions 1 and 2, the trainer teaches the participant&#xD;
      about event- and time-based prospective memory tasks, respectively. In sessions 3 and 4, the&#xD;
      trainer simply tells the participant that s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in the&#xD;
      training games. In all sessions, the participant completes the training games with no&#xD;
      strategy instruction from the trainer. Feedback on accuracy is provided after each training&#xD;
      game. This is typical of a process training approach and expects that either practice of the&#xD;
      training tasks will improve prospective memory ability per se or participants will develop&#xD;
      effective strategies for completing prospective memory tasks on their own. At the end of each&#xD;
      session after completing both training games, the trainer reminds the participant of his/her&#xD;
      real-life prospective memory goals, provides a handout that lists the goals, and instructs&#xD;
      the participant to try to complete them as intended. It should be noted that the inclusion of&#xD;
      even this minimal level of discussion of real-life cognitive tasks is not typical of process&#xD;
      training interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2, Strategy Training: In training sessions 1 and 2, in addition to teaching about&#xD;
      event- and time-based tasks, the trainer teaches the participant specific strategies for each&#xD;
      type of task (implementation intentions for event-based and strategic clock-checking for&#xD;
      time-based) and instructs in their use before and during the training games. In sessions 3&#xD;
      and 4, the trainer tells the participant s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in the&#xD;
      training games and can support the participant's strategy use if needed. Feedback on accuracy&#xD;
      and strategy use are provided after each training game. At the end of each session after&#xD;
      completing the training games, the trainer and participant discuss how the strategies can be&#xD;
      applied to the participant's real-life prospective memory goals, and the trainer helps the&#xD;
      participant develop written action plans to do so. Plans are reviewed (and modified if&#xD;
      necessary) at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Bangor Goal-Setting Interview (BGSI) - The BGSI is a structured assessment developed&#xD;
           for use in cognitive rehabilitation research. It offers a standardized means of&#xD;
           eliciting individual goals and rating goal attainment over time and has been&#xD;
           successfully used in RCTs with older adults, including those with mild to moderate&#xD;
           dementia. During the first two training sessions, after an explanation of the&#xD;
           prospective memory task types (session 1: event, session 2: time), participants complete&#xD;
           the BGSI with the trainer to identify and set goals for their real-life prospective&#xD;
           memory tasks. Participants identify up to 6 prospective memory tasks they anticipate&#xD;
           having to complete over the next 2 weeks (before Post assessment), define goals for&#xD;
           completing each task, and describe what needs to happen for the goal to be considered&#xD;
           partially (25%, 50%, and/or 75%) and fully achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; attached) - this will be completed by the&#xD;
           participant after the second training session to rate how credible they think the&#xD;
           strategy instruction training is, and how well they think it will work on 1) their&#xD;
           performance on the computer task, and 2) their performance in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-training Assessment (1.5 hours) - (For Groups 1 (Process) and 2 (Strategy) = One week&#xD;
      after the last training session; For Group 3 (Control) = 3-4 weeks after the Pre-Training&#xD;
      Assessment): Virtual Week and NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Virtual Week Task will be administered again, but with new tasks to remember.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (instructions attached) will be administered to obtain&#xD;
           an overall measure of executive function. This battery includes a Picture Vocabulary&#xD;
           Test, Picture Sequence Memory Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test,&#xD;
           Dimensional Change Card Sort Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test, Pattern Comparison,&#xD;
           and Oral Reading Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GROUPS 1 (Process) and 2 (STRATEGY) ONLY: Based on their BGSI interview during the&#xD;
           training sessions, participants report on their performance of each task and, in&#xD;
           collaboration with the trainer, rate each task for attainment on a 10-point scale using&#xD;
           the previously determined descriptors as reference (higher scores indicate better goal&#xD;
           attainment). Task attainment scores are averaged to yield a mean attainment score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-month Follow-up Assessment (40 minutes) (One month after the Post Training Assessment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRMQ, IPA and CAPM Questionnaires will be given to participants for a second time as&#xD;
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the participant's preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study informant will fill out proxy-reported PRMQ and CAPM for a second time as a&#xD;
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the informant's preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-month Follow-up Assessment (40 minutes) (Three months after the Post Assessment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRMQ, CAPM, and IPA Questionnaire will be given to participants for a third time as&#xD;
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the participant's preference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study informant will fill out proxy-reported PRMQ and CAPM for a third time as a&#xD;
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the informant's preference).&#xD;
