      The proposed project will examine a promising brief therapy for PTSD for use in VHA Primary&#xD;
      Care and its impact on functional outcomes. This intervention will provide an alternative&#xD;
      point of access to effective PTSD treatment and improved function that does not require&#xD;
      referral to specialty mental health and accomplishes improved function in a short-term, brief&#xD;
      protocol. Many Veterans prefer to receive mental health care, including PTSD service in&#xD;
      primary care. The current protocol would allow them to access effective therapy options in&#xD;
      addition to the medication management that is currently the standard of care for PTSD in&#xD;
      primary care. In addition, this brief protocol may reduce the number of specialty mental&#xD;
      health referrals as many Veterans may not require additional PTSD specific treatment after&#xD;
      completion. Thus, if effective, this protocol will greatly increase Veteran treatment choice&#xD;
      and improve functional outcomes and access while also increasing efficiency of allocation of&#xD;
      specialty PTSD services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and costly mental health issue&#xD;
      (Greenberg, Sisitsky et al. 1999, Hoge, Terhakopian et al. 2007). RAND reported an estimated&#xD;
      two-year cost of $4.0 to $6.2 billion US dollars for mental health issues from the current&#xD;
      conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and further estimated that providing evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for PTSD and depression could save an estimated $86.2 million (Tanielian, et al.&#xD;
      2008). Even modest reductions in PTSD severity have been related to increased probability of&#xD;
      positive function outcomes (Smith, et al. 2005). Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy (Foa, et al.&#xD;
      2000, Foa, et al. 2005, Schnurr, et al. 2007) is an effective, first-line treatment for PTSD&#xD;
      (IOM 2007, VA/DOD 2010). While highly effective, PE is provided in specialty mental health&#xD;
      settings typically in 8 to 15, weekly 90 minute individual sessions. Veterans with PTSD are&#xD;
      often reluctant to seek care in specialty mental health, and, as a result, many are treated&#xD;
      solely in primary care and do not have access to this effective intervention (Possemato, et&#xD;
      al. 2011). While the DoD and VA have actively integrated behavioral health providers into&#xD;
      their primary care clinics (Maguen, et al. 2010, Seal, et al. 2011), current behavioral&#xD;
      interventions for PTSD in primary care are often inconsistent with clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines and/or not effective (Possemato, et al. 2011). Since functional outcomes are&#xD;
      critical, the investigators intend to extend beyond assessing the impact of PE-PC on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes to function. Thus, there is a clear and urgent need to further develop, validate,&#xD;
      and disseminate evidence-based psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD in integrated VHA PC-MHI&#xD;
      with a focus on functional outcomes. To fill this need and gap in care the study&#xD;
      investigators developed a Brief Prolonged Exposure for Primary Care (PE-PC) treatment&#xD;
      protocol with 4, 30-minute sessions for use in a stepped care model. A pilot study in&#xD;
      military treatment facilities found PE-PC resulted in reductions in PTSD that were maintained&#xD;
      at 6- and 12-month follow-up (Cigrang, et al, 2015). Preliminary results from a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT; PI: Cigrang; CoI: Rauch) of PE-PC compared to minimal attention&#xD;
      control (MAC, including continuation of any PC initiated treatment) found a significantly&#xD;
      larger reduction in PTSD severity (measured by PCL) in PE-PC than MAC (between group d = .78,&#xD;
      p = .01). The strength of these initial findings is limited by lack of functional outcomes&#xD;
      and examination of impact in VHA. While Service Members and Veterans have many similarities,&#xD;
      potential differences in motivation for treatment and other factors may influence the&#xD;
      efficacy of the protocol especially when examining changes in function. The proposed study&#xD;
      will randomize 120 Veterans at Ralph H. Johnson VAMC presenting in primary care with PTSD who&#xD;
      meet minimal inclusion/exclusion criteria to 6 weeks of PE-PC or PC-MHI-treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU). Recruitment will occur over 36 months. All Veterans will complete a baseline&#xD;
      assessment prior to randomization and post-treatment follow-up assessments at Weeks 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 24 post-randomization. Primary outcome will be function assessed as self-reported role&#xD;
      function in several domains. In addition, the investigators will examine symptoms severity&#xD;
      and effectiveness, acceptability, and utilization associated with PE-PC or PCMHI-TAU in the 6&#xD;
      months prior to randomization and 6 months following treatment completion. PE-PC may allow&#xD;
      access to effective treatment and efficient allocation of PTSD specialty treatment resources&#xD;
      in the VHA. This topic is of key relevance to Veteran mental health care and can provide a&#xD;
      new access point for high quality PTSD care to improve function allowing many more Veterans&#xD;
      to experience improvement.&#xD;
