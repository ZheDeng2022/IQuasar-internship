  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the considered gold standard for diagnosing diseases in the colon. A&#xD;
      colonoscopy is normally divided into the insertion from anus to cecum, the technical&#xD;
      difficult part, and a retraction or diagnostic part. No objective measure exists to evaluate&#xD;
      the performance of a colonoscopy. Based on a movement analysis of the colonoscope we wish to&#xD;
      seek evidence for an automated and objective system able to differentiate between&#xD;
      endoscopists with various experience in a clinical setting. The movement analysis is based on&#xD;
      information's from the colonoscope. Electromagnetic coils are built in along the length of&#xD;
      colonoscopes. They generate a pulsed magnetic field that is picked up a receiver coil. The&#xD;
      data-points for each coil are inserted into an algorithm for the movement analyzing. This&#xD;
      analysis is done as a change between the tip of the scope, and the next tracked magnetic&#xD;
      coil. The result is a relative movement of the colonoscope in relation to the previous&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted a three different University Hospitals in Denmark. Twenty physicians&#xD;
      with experience in colonoscopy are voluntary included. Patients appointed to a screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy are included and a minimum of five consecutive colonoscopies are recorded for&#xD;
      each physician. We predict the system to be automated and objective tool correlated with the&#xD;
      physician's technical level of expertise in clinical colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gather validity evidence for the 3D-Colonoscopy Progression score (3D-CoPS) and&#xD;
           3D-Colonoscopy Retraction Score (3D-CoRS) in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the relationship between 3D-CoPS/3D-CoRS and a retrospective calculated&#xD;
           Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) of endoscopists with various experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing adenomas and colorectal cancer. High Adenoma&#xD;
      Detection Rate (ADR) is essential to reduce the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer .To&#xD;
      maximize the detection of adenomas during a colonoscopy the endoscopist need to see as much&#xD;
      mucosa as possible. To increase the mucosa visualized quality indicators, such as bowel&#xD;
      preparatin, cecal intubation rate and an average time of at least 6 minutes spent during&#xD;
      withdrawal, should be used as supportive measures to minimize missed lesions and thereby&#xD;
      decreasing interval cancer. Bowel preparation, cecal intubation and time spent during&#xD;
      withdrawal are prerequisite measures for optimal visualization of the mucosa in the&#xD;
      colorectum, but are not a quality measure for actual detected pathology. Time as a quality&#xD;
      assurance for detection of adenomas means nothing if the physician isn't careful during&#xD;
      withdrawal and look behind folds and change position to get a clear view of the mucosa&#xD;
      surface. The ADR has been introduced as a surrogate measure of adequate visualization of the&#xD;
      mucosa, but a recommend and a minimum number of 500 colonoscopies are needed to calculate a&#xD;
      statistic reliable ADR. Although ADR is one of the most widely used and accepted quality&#xD;
      indicators great variance in number of performed procedures and ADR among physicians exits,&#xD;
      which makes ADR difficult to use in practice. Currently there is no quality parameter&#xD;
      evaluating the individual procedure and to our knowledge no objective tools exits to help&#xD;
      increase diagnostic accuracy during a colonoscopy. Objective, easy implementable and&#xD;
      automatic measures are needed to ensure a high detection of adenomas and subsequently prevent&#xD;
      missed lesions and interval cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the Technical University of Denmark we have developed a score of&#xD;
      progression and retraction during a colonoscopy, called 3D-Colonoscopy Progression Score&#xD;
      (3D-CoPS) and 3D-Colonoscopy Retraction Score (3D-CoRS). We predict the systems to be&#xD;
      automated and objective tool correlated with the endoscopists technical level of expertise in&#xD;
      clinical colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted at three different university hospitals. Twenty endoscopists with a&#xD;
      lifetime experience of no less than 50 screening colonoscopies are voluntarily enrolled. To&#xD;
      calculate the ADR for each endoscopist data of the last screenings colonoscopies is&#xD;
      retrospectively collected (minimum 50 colonoscopies per endoscopist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be noted for each endoscopist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of total colonoscopies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of colonoscopies within the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of other endoscopies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of screenings colonoscopies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intern, junior resident, senior resident, consultant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical or medical gastrointestinal background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time since graduation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of five consecutive screenings colonoscopies for each endoscopist are included.&#xD;
      Patients appointed to a screening colonoscopy are chosen due to a higher ADR (approximately&#xD;
      50%) and a more homogeneous group. All procedures are performed with a standard Olympus&#xD;
      colonoscope model in combination with the Magnetic Endoscopy Imaging system (MEI). Data&#xD;
      collection starts at the intubation of the colonoscope in the anus and stops when the&#xD;
      procedure is finished. The data collection is fully automated without any interference from&#xD;
      the investigators during the normal clinical setup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval is applied at the Danish Data Protection Agency, the Danish Patient Safety Authority&#xD;
      and the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General mathematical formulation for 3D-CoPS and 3D-CoRS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromagnetic coils are built in along the length of the Olympus colonoscopes. They&#xD;
      generate a pulsed low-intensity magnetic field that is picked up a receiver coil. The&#xD;
      data-points for each coil are inserted into an algorithm for movement analyzing. The two main&#xD;
      measurements conducted in relation with the colonoscopy is the Colonoscopy Progression Score&#xD;
      (CoPS) and Colonoscopy Retraction Score (CoRS). Both of these have a joint basis for the&#xD;
      analysis, in the form of a movement analysis. This analysis is done as a vector product&#xD;
      between the tip of the scope, and the next tracked magnetic coil - where on the relative&#xD;
      magnitude of the change in position is multiplied on. This results in a relative movement&#xD;
      that is scaled with how much the scope moves in relation to the previous position, and how&#xD;
      much this movement is deflected according to the direction the tip points in. This movement&#xD;
      analysis is used for distinction between the progression- and retraction phase, which is&#xD;
      essential, such that the CoPS and CoRS measurements is performed at the right times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D-CoPS: To perform the CoPS measurement, the above definition helps by defining the&#xD;
      progression phase. The general belief is that if the scope progresses smoothly, the&#xD;
      colonoscopist is experienced, and vice versa. Therefor tracking how much time the tip of the&#xD;
      scope is &quot;stagnant&quot;, is used to define the CoPS. Specifically, a two dimensional histogram is&#xD;
      used, spanned across the movement area of the colonoscopy. Filling the histogram is simply&#xD;
      performed by sampling the tip position at each time step, and putting it into the respective&#xD;
      bin. If the scope is then stagnant at many stages throughout the procedure, the bins values&#xD;
      will be locally very high. On the other hand, if a smooth progression is present, the bin&#xD;
      values will be smoothly distributed, across all the different bins. This is the basis for the&#xD;
      CoPS value. Finally followed with a normalizing, and scaling of the 2D histogram value, for&#xD;
      easing interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D-CoRS: Analyzing the retraction phase, must be done differently, as the tip is supposed to&#xD;
      be stagnant, at different times, through this phase. Therefor the movement analysis, as&#xD;
      described above, is used to measure how the instrument moves. This movement is then&#xD;
      high-passed filtered, as experienced colonoscopist seems to have much more high frequency&#xD;
      movements, where-in the novices moves with much lower frequency (more hesitant). This overall&#xD;
      movement is evaluated as a difference between the different positions (by differentiation),&#xD;
      and a count of peaks and valleys is done with a fitting margin. This final count is then high&#xD;
      if an expert is performing the procedure, as more high frequency movements will take place,&#xD;
      and low if a novice is performing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of polyps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The polyp size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyp type&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyp histology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyp location&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of validity is based on Messicks five major sources (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. 3D-CoPS and 3D-CoRS are being developed based on the evidence of an ongoing&#xD;
      simulation-based validation study &quot; A Validation Study of a Computerized Movement Analysis of&#xD;
      the Colonoscope in Simulated Colonoscopy&quot; and general good practice of how a colonoscope is&#xD;
      withdrawn from cecum to anus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process is standardized using an Olympus colonoscope and MEI system. All participants&#xD;
      will be instructed informed of the systems and the data-collection. All data-collection&#xD;
      regarding are presented in a uniform file-format. The 3D-CoPS and 3D-CoRS are objective,&#xD;
      automated and unbiased tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure internal consistency of the 3D-CoPS and 3D-CoRS among the endoscopists a minimum of&#xD;
      5 consecutive colonoscopies are needed (based on an article not yet published). The score&#xD;
      system is automated and unbiased why the internal structure in this regard is consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship to other variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume the sample data reflects a population that follows a probability distribution based&#xD;
      on a fixed set of parameters. The correlation between experience (logarithmic) and scores&#xD;
      will be investigated using Pearson's r. Scores from 3D-CoPS and 3D-CoRS will be correlated&#xD;
      with patient and endoscopist variables. The endoscopist is not blinded during&#xD;
      data-collection, which might affect the performance. Even thou data collection is fully&#xD;
      automated, the technic during withdrawal of the colonoscope from caecum to anus could change&#xD;
      and increase mucosa visualized and therefore polyp detection (increased awareness of the&#xD;
      endoscopist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrasting groups' method will be used to set a pass/fail standard based on the scores&#xD;
      imitating aminimum performance during intubation, a minimum ADR and false positive and false&#xD;
      negative will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains no biomedical involvement. Participants and patients will not suffer from&#xD;
      any physical or psychological discomfort. All endoscopists will be provided with oral and&#xD;
      written information and sign a letter of informed consent before entering the study. The&#xD;
      collected data are anonymized.&#xD;
