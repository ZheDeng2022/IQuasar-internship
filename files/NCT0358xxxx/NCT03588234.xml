      The objective of the current study is to assess the prevalence of poor food literacy in young&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes through a national on-line survey. More specifically, the&#xD;
      research question to be investigated as part of this project is: What is the current level of&#xD;
      food literacy among young adults with type 1 diabetes? It is hypothesized that at least 50%&#xD;
      of young adults with type 1 diabetes have a poor level of food literacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food literacy, the ability to plan and manage, select, prepare, and eat healthy foods, is a&#xD;
      contemporary concept that provides a mechanism to understand the relationship between&#xD;
      food-related knowledge, skills (ie., culinary competencies) and health behaviours and its&#xD;
      impact on decision-making regarding dietary intake. The Diabetes Canada 2018 Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines have recognized the role that food skills, a component of food literacy,&#xD;
      have in managing glycemic control in patients living with type 1 diabetes. The guidelines&#xD;
      also point out that no studies to date have investigated this skill level in the diabetic&#xD;
      population and that interventions aimed at improving these skills would be beneficial for&#xD;
      patients. There is therefore a need to assess the current level of food literacy among young&#xD;
      adults with type 1 diabetes in order for future studies to develop targeted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be cross-sectional in design and data will be collected with an on-line&#xD;
      questionnaire. This questionnaire will allow for the evaluation of the level of food literacy&#xD;
      in young adults with and without type 1 diabetes. The online survey software that will be&#xD;
      utilized is Survey Monkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be publicized through posts on Facebook©, Twitter©, and other forms of social&#xD;
      media as well as on websites of collaborating diabetes organizations (see appendix B for a&#xD;
      list of organizations). Participants interested in the study will be invited to go on the&#xD;
      survey webpage. The first information presented will be the electronic consent form. If they&#xD;
      have questions while reading the consent form, they will have the possibility to email or&#xD;
      call a research assistant. Once they have agreed, they will be re-directed to the first&#xD;
      question. The questionnaire takes approximately 20-25 minutes to complete. Completion of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will trigger a page requesting them to email the study coordinator in order to&#xD;
      be entered into the lottery for a chance to win an Ipad mini.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey includes sociodemographic questions as well as medical and diet history. For&#xD;
      participants with diabetes, this includes duration since their diabetes onset, types of&#xD;
      treatments (insulin), application of carbohydrate counting and the &quot;Type 1 Diabetes Nutrition&#xD;
      Knowledge Survey&quot;. Items on actual food intake, such as fruits and vegetables, and&#xD;
      self-efficacy regarding cooking are included. Food literacy will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      &quot;Short food literacy questionnaire (SQLF)&quot;, a short 12-item questionnaire that we adapted for&#xD;
      Canada. A score for the SQLF will be calculated (maximum 52 points) and participants will be&#xD;
      categorized under 4 different groups (Inadequate, Problematic, Sufficient, Excellent).&#xD;
      Participants categorized in inadequate or problematic will be considered having low food&#xD;
      literacy. Three questions regarding cooking ability were taken from the Canadian Community&#xD;
      Health Survey (CCHS). Current sources of information regarding diet and nutrition, as well as&#xD;
      questions to assess knowledge of chronic diseases linked to dietary intake, the frequency at&#xD;
      which participants cook their own meals vs. eat out vs. consume prepackaged meals as well as&#xD;
      specific dietary habits such as skipping breakfast will also be investigated. Lastly,&#xD;
      perceived food environment will be assessed by asking questions regarding where participants&#xD;
      shop for food and their satisfaction regarding the selection of food available to them.&#xD;
