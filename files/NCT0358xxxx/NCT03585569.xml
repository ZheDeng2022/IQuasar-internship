    <description>Mean change from baseline in Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).. The Modified Ashworth Scale issued to grade spasticity.

    <measure>12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking scale (MSWS-12) Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline weeks 12, 16, and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in the 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking. It consists of 12 questions concerning the limitations to walking due to MS during the past 2 weeks. Each item can be answered with 5 options, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 extreme limitation.&#xD;
A total score can be generated and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale by subtracting the minimum score possible (12) from the patient's score, dividing by the maximum score possible minus the minimum possible (60-12 or 48), and multiplying the result by 100. Walking improvement on the MSWS-12 is indicated by negative change scores</description>

    <description>Mean change from baseline in the (MISIS-29) Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale.The MSIS-29 is a 29 item measurement, which assesses the physical and psychological impact of MS on affected individuals; it is a self report questionnaire consisting of 20 and 9 items, respectively. Scores on the individual items are added and then transformed to a 0-100 scale, thereby generating two summary scores (for physical and psychological impact). Higher scores indicate worse health.</description>

    <measure>Improvement on the (EDSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline weeks 12,16 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. is a 20 point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (dead from MS). From 0-4.0, EDSS is determined by the combination of scores on 7 functional systems. From 4.0-6.0 EDSS is determined by the ability to walk a distance. EDSS 6.0 is the need for unilateral walking assistance. EDSS 6.5 is the need for bilateral walking assistance. Nonambulatory patients are scored EDSS ≥7.0, with higher number reflecting increasing difficulty with mobility and ability to perform self-care.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in speed, cadence, general symmetry, propulsion, stride length using the G-Walk device is a wireless system of inertial sensors composed of a triaxial accelerometer, a magnetic sensor, and a triaxial gyroscope that, when positioned on L5 vertebrae of the spine, it allows for a functional objective gait analysis to be performed. The system extrapolates the data and calculates all the spatial-temporal gait parameters required to perform an assessment or to define a training strategy</description>
