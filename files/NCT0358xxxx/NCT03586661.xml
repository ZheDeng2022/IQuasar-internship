      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of niraparib and copanlisib in&#xD;
      treating patients with endometrial, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer&#xD;
      that has come back. Niraparib and copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      the combination of niraparib and copanlisib in patients with recurrent high-grade serous or&#xD;
      BRCA mutant ovarian cancer or recurrent endometrial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the tolerability of the RP2D of niraparib and copanlisib. II. To determine&#xD;
      the safety and observed toxicities of the combination of niraparib and copanlisib in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent endometrial, recurrent high-grade serous ovarian, or BRCA mutant ovarian&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the activity of the drug combination at all dose levels in each patient&#xD;
      cohort by objective response rate and proportion of patients surviving progression free (PFS)&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine response duration of the drug combination at all dose levels. V. To&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination to assess the presence of any drug&#xD;
      interaction between the two co-administered agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if response to therapy is associated with molecular profile of the tumor&#xD;
      (including, but not limited to, molecular aberrations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway or defects&#xD;
      in homologous recombination) before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine associations with early changes in functional proteomic biomarkers in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies before and after treatment and tumor response in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      endometrial, recurrent high-grade serous ovarian, or BRCA mutant ovarian cancer treated with&#xD;
      the investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and copanlisib intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any histologically confirmed recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma (except for&#xD;
             carcinosarcoma), recurrent high-grade serous ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube&#xD;
             carcinoma, or deleterious BRCA mutant recurrent ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian&#xD;
             tube cancer for whom no curative option is available will be eligible. DOSE ESCALATION&#xD;
             ONLY: For patients with ovarian cancer in the dose escalation cohort, only patients&#xD;
             with recurrent, platinum resistant disease are eligible to enroll on study. Platinum&#xD;
             resistance is defined as progression within 6 months from completion of platinum based&#xD;
             therapy (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum&#xD;
             therapy). In addition, patients in this cohort with a BRCA mutation must have also&#xD;
             progressed after treatment with PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have unlimited prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of&#xD;
             recurrent endometrial or ovarian carcinoma. Patients who have received prior PARP&#xD;
             inhibitors ARE allowed to participate. Patients who have received prior PI3K-pathway&#xD;
             inhibitors ARE allowed to participate on the dose escalation phase ONLY. Patients may&#xD;
             have progressed on prior PARP inhibitor and/or PI3K-pathway inhibitor but they may not&#xD;
             have discontinued drug for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow parameters, any&#xD;
             unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy should be no greater than Common&#xD;
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) grade 1 at the time of&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. If no measurable disease is present, patients should have&#xD;
             assessable disease such as pleural effusion, ascites, with CA125 Gynecological Cancer&#xD;
             Intergroup (GCIG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of&#xD;
             0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of niraparib and copanlisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to taking study treatment. Female patients and&#xD;
             their male partners must also agree to use effective contraception when sexually&#xD;
             active. This applies since signing of the informed consent form and 6 months (for&#xD;
             women of child bearing potential) after the last study drug administration. A woman is&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and&#xD;
             until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization&#xD;
             methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
             in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women&#xD;
             not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral&#xD;
             orchidectomy. The investigator or a designated associate must advise the patient&#xD;
             (WOCBP or men who have not undergone bilateral orchidectomy) how to achieve highly&#xD;
             effective birth control method. Birth control should be used from the signing of the&#xD;
             patient consent form and for 180 days following the last dose of niraparib. Acceptable&#xD;
             methods of birth control include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two highly effective forms of contraception, defined as contraceptive methods&#xD;
                  with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
                  correctly. Patients and their sexual partners who've undergone vasectomy or tubal&#xD;
                  occlusion must also use a male condom with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Permanent sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral orchidectomy; postmenopausal, defined as a&#xD;
                  female patient or sexual partner &gt; 45 years of age who has not menstruated for at&#xD;
                  least 12 consecutive months; total sexual abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is unknown if niraparib or copanlisib are expressed in human breast milk. For this&#xD;

             syndrome or for patients with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies of the&#xD;
             hepatic hilum).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN unless&#xD;
             the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, ALT/AST must be =&lt; 5 x ULN (within 7&#xD;
             days prior to entry/randomization).&#xD;

             (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization). Prothrombin time (PT)&#xD;
             can be used instead of INR if PTT =&lt; 1.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= 50% (within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             entry/randomization).&#xD;

             evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the&#xD;
             CKD-EPI equation or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable&#xD;
             range, it may be used to fulfill the inclusion criteria instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have&#xD;
             gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of niraparib (e.g.&#xD;

             erythropoietin) within 4 weeks prior initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUDED PRIOR THERAPIES AND MEDICATIONS: - Myeloid growth factors less than 14 days&#xD;
             before start of treatment - Blood or platelet transfusion less than 7 days before&#xD;
             start of treatment - Ongoing systemic corticosteroid therapy at a daily dose higher&#xD;
             than 15 mg prednisone or equivalent. Previous corticosteroid therapy must be stopped&#xD;
             or reduced to the allowed dose 7 days before performing the screening computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and again prior to the first study&#xD;
             drug administration. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy,&#xD;
             corticosteroids should be de-escalated to the maximum allowed dose before the&#xD;
             screening. Patients may use topical or inhaled corticosteroids. - Anti-arrhythmic&#xD;
             therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted) - Use of strong inhibitors and&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 is prohibited from day -14 of cycle 1 until the end of study visit.&#xD;
             Copanlisib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore concomitant use of strong&#xD;
             inhibitors of CYP3A4(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir,&#xD;
             indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and inducers of CYP3A (e.g. rifampin,&#xD;
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted from day&#xD;
             -14 of cycle 1 until the end of study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For expansion phase only: Lack of accessible tumor for biopsy.&#xD;
