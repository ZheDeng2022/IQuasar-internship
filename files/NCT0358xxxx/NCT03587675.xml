    <textblock>
      The investigators recently observed airway inflammation and increased damage-associated&#xD;
      molecular pattern (DAMP) level in sputum of children (age 11-12y) and adolescents (18-23y)&#xD;
      from elite sport programs in Belgium with increased risk of bronchoconstriction upon extreme&#xD;
      exercise. They here want to validate these findings in a cohort 13-18y.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      State of the art Physical exercise, though absolutely beneficial for human well-being, is a&#xD;
      well-known trigger to induce bronchoconstriction. Aretaeus of Cappadocia described the first&#xD;
      cases of asthma triggered by exercise, already in the second century AD. Exercise can provoke&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction in subjects with pre-existing asthma but can also induce&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction in otherwise healthy subjects. The latter phenomenon is called&#xD;
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). EIB is frequent in the general population and&#xD;
      might affect between 5 and 10% of them, although population based reports are scarce. EIB is&#xD;
      most prevalent in individuals performing endurance sport disciplines, such as long distance&#xD;
      running, duathlon and triathlon, cycling and cross-country skiing. Due to frequent intense&#xD;
      physical training, its incidence is higher in elite athletes compared to non-elite athletes.&#xD;
      Its prevalence in elite athletes within these endurance sport disciplines is estimated to be&#xD;
      up to 13%. The percentage in aquatic endurance sports was surprisingly even higher and&#xD;
      reached 20% in the Olympic games of 2008. Besides intense physical training, environmental&#xD;
      factors such as chlorine or cold air exposure are therefore also linked to the appearance of&#xD;
      EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is not fully clear: airway cooling&#xD;
      resulting from conditioning of inspired air and post-exercise rewarming of airways have been&#xD;
      proposed as &quot;thermal&quot; mechanism. However, airway dehydration as a result of increased&#xD;
      ventilation, resulting in &quot;augmented osmolarity&quot; of the airway-lining fluid, seems to be a&#xD;
      major cause. This augmented osmolarity is thought to trigger the release of mediators, such&#xD;
      as histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandins, from airway inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      which leads to airway smooth-muscle contraction and airway edema. Last but not least, recent&#xD;
      evidence, including data from the investigator' s laboratory, points to &quot;epithelial damage&quot;&#xD;
      due to the high ventilation rate, with subsequent release of epithelial cell mediators, as&#xD;
      underlying mechanism. This damage, which can be more pronounced if additional triggers are&#xD;
      present, might lead to uncontrolled airway inflammation, can exacerbate the process and&#xD;
      increase exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, potentially leading to persistent asthma. It&#xD;
      is suggested that airway inflammation differ between subjects/athletes with pre-existing&#xD;
      asthma (in whom airway eosinophils and Th2 inflammation are present) and those with EIB that&#xD;
      developed during their career (in whom neutrophils and Th17 inflammation are present). If&#xD;
      symptoms develop during their career, a causal relationship between the intense exercise and&#xD;
      EIB can easily be suspected. In order to determine the exact moment of EIB development during&#xD;
      their career, longitudinal studies, starting before EIB is present, are needed. Indeed, most&#xD;
      adolescent elite athletes start their intense training protocols long before they start to&#xD;
      perform at the highest international level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If diagnosing EIB in adult elite athletes is difficult, its diagnosis in elite high-school&#xD;
      athletes is a terrible challenge. Indeed, different diagnostic tests have been suggested by&#xD;
      the International Olympic Committee-Medical Commission (IOC-MC) to identify EIB in adult&#xD;
      elite athletes. If upon symptoms, classical diagnosis of asthma (e.g. by performing&#xD;
      reversibility test after Salbutamol® inhalation) is excluded, airway hyperresponsiveness&#xD;
      should be documented with the use of bronchoprovocation testing. These tests include direct&#xD;
      challenges (e.g., with inhaled methacholine), which act on airway smooth muscle to cause&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, and indirect challenges, such as Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperpnea (EVH)&#xD;
      particularly recommended for athletes, hyperosmolar tests with saline or mannitol, and&#xD;
      laboratory or field exercise tests. However, athletes may have a positive response (with a&#xD;
      drop in Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) above the cited cut-off) to only one of&#xD;
      these types of tests. Therefore, more than one type of test may be needed, and ideally the&#xD;
      testing should be performed during a period of intense training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently adapted the EVH test, gold standard diagnostic test recommended by&#xD;
      IOC-MC to diagnose EIB in elite athletes for its use in teenagers. Instead of the maximal&#xD;
      voluntary ventilation (MVV) of 85% during 6 minutes, usually requested in adult subjects&#xD;
      (which is 30XFEV1, but would mean an unrealistic performance of 100% of MVV in adolescents),&#xD;
      a ventilatory target of 70% which corresponds to 21 x FEV1 in young athletes is feasible for&#xD;
      the majority of athletes (see table 1). Therefore the test aims at a ventilation target of&#xD;
      70% during 6 minutes. Moreover, to exclude exhaustion as a cause of artificial FEV1 drop, the&#xD;
      change in Tiffeneau index (TI=FEV1/FVC) was also calculated. Only if TI at the time of&#xD;
      maximal fall minus TI at baseline was below zero, the fall in FEV1 is thought to reflect true&#xD;
      airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With those small adaptations, the test can be performed in almost all high-school elite&#xD;
      athletes aged 12-14 years. Surprisingly, 23% percent of basketball players (3/13), 21% of&#xD;
      football players (4/19) and up to 54% of swimmers (6/11) aged 12-14 years, had a positive EVH&#xD;
      test at enrollment to an elite sport program compared to 13% of control subjects. During the&#xD;
      longitudinal observation (registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02432183) unpublished&#xD;
      results), two out of four football players with a positive EVH test, terminated their&#xD;
      high-school elite program early. Although sport technical reasons might also be the limiting&#xD;
      factor to continue the program, their EIB can also explain impaired performance that can&#xD;
      ensue if preventive measures are not taken. It is however not yet clear which medical&#xD;
      treatment ideally should be used in those elite athletes. Nevertheless, several treatment&#xD;
      opportunities exist, which might at least enable them to perform their sports in optimal&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing EVH tests as a screening test yearly in all high-school athletes is&#xD;
      labor-extensive and at high cost. The investigators therefore studied whether questionnaires&#xD;
      might help to indicate young (12-14 years) athletes at risk to have a positive EVH test. They&#xD;
      were able to test the validated AQUA (Allergy Questionnaire for Athletes) Questionnaire for&#xD;
      adults and adolescents, in a young elite athletes cohort. By performing skin prick tests in&#xD;
      those subjects to search for allergy, if the AQUA score was ≥ 5, the test predicted atopy&#xD;
      with a specificity of 78% and a sensitivity of 62.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      % Of MVV Adults Adolescents (12-14 y) 100% 35 × FEV1 30 × FEV1 85% 30 × FEV1 70% 21 × FEV1&#xD;
      60% 21 × FEV1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 Comparison of maximal ventilatory capacity between adults and adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators found that atopic individuals in the cohort had increased risk to test&#xD;
      positive for EIB (Fisher exact test p=0.04). However, due to the high number of subjects with&#xD;
      a positive EIB test but negative AQUA questionnaire, the AQUA questionnaire by itself can't&#xD;
      be used to predict EIB (p=0.4). However, one out of five questions added by our group to this&#xD;
      questionnaire (&quot;Do you suffer from wheeze during exercise?&quot;) by itself predicted EIB with 93%&#xD;
      specificity and 24% sensitivity. Adding a second question to this (&quot;Has a doctor ever&#xD;
      diagnosed you with an allergic condition?&quot;) increased the specificity to predict a positive&#xD;
      EIB test to 99% but lowered sensitivity to 15% only (manuscript in preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 1 Do you suffer from wheeze during exercise ? Question 2 Do you experience shortness&#xD;
      of breath during exercise? Question 3 Has a doctor ever diagnosed you with an allergic&#xD;
      condition? Question 4 Do you frequently suffer from upper respiratory tract infections or&#xD;
      fever? Question 5 Is anyone in your family allergic?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2. Questions added to AQUA questionnaire in screening protocol of 12-14y high-school&#xD;
      elite athletes&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings formed basis for the current idea about how to screen for EIB in young elite&#xD;
      athletes A/ If the young athlete answers positive to question 1, &quot;Do you suffer from wheeze&#xD;
      during exercise ?&quot;, A.1 asthma has to be excluded (by Salbutamol reversibility test) A.2 EIB&#xD;
      can be searched for by EVH test. B/ If the child has a positive AQUA score (&gt;5), B.1. atopy&#xD;
      might be present and can be searched for by CAPtest and/or SPT. B.1.a If atopy tests are&#xD;
      positive, EIB can be tested by EVH test. B.1.b If atopy tests are negative, a watch-full&#xD;
      waiting strategy can be chosen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those questionnaires can easily be repeated yearly&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although this would be a great advantage in the screening process of young athletes,&#xD;
      this pilot study should at least be repeated in an older age group of athletes (13-18 years).&#xD;
      Moreover, the question still remains whether we need to perform different tests to diagnose&#xD;
      EIB and whether a hierarchical structure in those tests can be chosen. Indeed, in daily&#xD;
      routine, EVH test at the UZ Leuven is restricted for those subjects in whom histamine&#xD;
      provocation test is negative but EIB is highly suspected, based on clinical history. It is&#xD;
      not known whether all subjects with positive histamine provocation test also have positive&#xD;
      EIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, sputum IL-1beta-low subjects, in the absence of atopy, had a very low chance to have&#xD;
      positive EVH testing (Fisher exact test p=0.0088; compared to 0.04 for atopy alone, see&#xD;
      higher). Adding sputum cytokine IL-1beta mRNA detection to the screening protocol might&#xD;
      therefore increase the negative predictive value of the flow chart. However, performing&#xD;
      induced sputum is also challenging and cytokine mRNA detection in the samples (though&#xD;
      routinely performed in the investigator's laboratory) is still no routine procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses The investigators hypothesize that the findings in the first young cohort will be&#xD;
      similar or even more pronounced in the slightly older cohort of athletes. This means that&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. they hypothesize that AQUA questionnaire can also predict atopy in this age group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. they hypothesize that atopy will be a risk factor for EIB in that age group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. they consider EVH test (in the absence of asthma) to be the best test to detect EIB (in&#xD;
           comparison to histamine provocation test) in that age group&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. they hypothesize that a positive AQUA score and/or a positive score to question 1 and 3&#xD;
           of table 2 can be used to screen for EIB (as outlined in figure 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. they hypothesize that adding sputum cytokine mRNA detection might increase the negative&#xD;
           predictive value of the screening protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study Therefore the aim of the study is to study the existence of EIB in high&#xD;
      school elite athletes as well as athletes performing at least 12 hours sport a week aged&#xD;
      13-18 years (n=50). More specifically the investigators want&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the proportion of EIB positive subjects (defined as ≥10% fall in FEV1 at&#xD;
           least 5' after EVH provocation) between those athletes and age matched controls (n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to correlate the answers in the questionnaires with the existence of EIB in the cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to correlate the PC20 (by histamine provocation test) with the % max fall in EVH test in&#xD;
           the cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to study sputum mRNA levels in correlation to the presence of EIB in the cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method&#xD;
&#xD;
      young athletes (swimmers, indoor and outdoor athletes) performing at least 12 hours sport a&#xD;
      week and controls performing less than 6 hours sport a week will be recruited. To that aim,&#xD;
      the investigators have a close collaboration with the Sport Medical Advice Center (SMAC UZ&#xD;
      Leuven) screening all high-school elite athletes from 'topsportschool' Leuven, as well as&#xD;
      with the medical coordinators of the Flemish Swimming Federation, Basketball federation and&#xD;
      Football federation. Controls will be recruited amongst children and relatives from&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires (AQUA and table 2), skin prick tests for common environmental allergens,&#xD;
      venous puncture, sputum induction, reversibility test after Salbutamol inhalation, FENO&#xD;
      measurement, histamine provocation test, EVH test and/or exercise field test will be&#xD;
      performed in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific IgE to allergens will be measured by CAPtest. Biomarkers such as serum CC16 will be&#xD;
      measured by ELISA. Sputum differential cell count will be done by cytospin and cytokine mRNA&#xD;
      detection by RT-PCR. Merocell obtained nasal lavage fluid biomarkers will be studied by&#xD;
      ELISA. All tests together will take +/-1.30h. If trainers from a specific discipline consider&#xD;
      this too busy, we can omit one or more of the following: sputum induction, Merocell and/or&#xD;
      skin prick tests. In case of the latter, allergy diagnosis will be based on CAPtest only.&#xD;
      This will be discussed in advance with trainers and sport doctors and manually added to the&#xD;
      IC/assent documents, if this is the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry, EVH test and histamine provocation test are routinely performed in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Sample size calculation has not been done, as all Flemish elite&#xD;
      high-school athletes within the cited sport disciplines (which are the largest branches in B)&#xD;
      will be invited. Prior studies revealed that more than 95% of them are willing to&#xD;
      participate. Based on the results of the previous study in the younger age group in an even&#xD;
      smaller sample size, the investigators consider the current sample size sufficient for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fisher exact test (or Chi-square in case of the different disciplines separately) will&#xD;
           be used to study whether the proportion of athletes with positive EVH test (at the cited&#xD;
           cut-off) is significantly different from its proportion in healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Differences in absolute maximal fall in FEV1, serum biomarkers, specific sputum cytokine&#xD;
           mRNA levels and sputum cellular counts between athletes and controls after EVH&#xD;
           provocation will be studied by two-tailed (one-tailed where appropriate) non-parametric&#xD;
           Mann-Whitney-U test (or if normality test is passed, by parametric t test). Differences&#xD;
           amongst the sports branches will be studied by Kruskall-Wallis (or ANOVA if normality&#xD;
           test is passed) with adequate post-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV (as well as ROC curves) to study the usefulness of&#xD;
           the AQUA questionnaire and/or the cited 5 questions and/or IL-1beta-low sputum mRNA&#xD;
           levels, to predict atopy on the one hand and positive EVH test on the other hand, will&#xD;
           be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation between PC20 and max fall in FEV will be studied by Spearman correlation&#xD;
           test without or with prior data (e.g. log) transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by Prism Graph 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to be able to repeat the findings observed in the younger age&#xD;
      groups. Moreover, they expect to be able to increase sensitivity of the screening protocol&#xD;
      and increase the negative predictive value of the screening test. To that latter aim, sputum&#xD;
      IL-1beta mRNA measurement might be of help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because only a limited group of 13-18 year old athletes (n=50) is studied, the study might&#xD;
      lack power to obtain the goal. Power analysis has not been performed, as the study is limited&#xD;
      by the number of elite high-school students in the 'topsportschool'.&#xD;
