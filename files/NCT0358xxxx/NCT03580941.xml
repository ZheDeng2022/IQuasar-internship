    <textblock>
      Haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is defined by the presence of the classic triad of&#xD;
      non-immune microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (negative direct Coombs), thrombocytopenia and&#xD;
      acute renal failure. Histological lesions of HUS are characterized by a systemic thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy (TMA), which mainly affects the renal vessels, with wall thickening,&#xD;
      thrombosis and obstruction of the vascular lumen. Atypical HUS (aHUS) is a subtype of HUS in&#xD;
      the TMA phenomena that results from the loss of regulation of the alternative complement&#xD;
      pathway on cell surfaces and is generally considered to be from a genetic cause.&#xD;
      Approximately 10% of HUS cases are classified as atypical HUS, which are associated with a&#xD;
      more adverse prognosis, with a mortality rate up to 25% and progression to end stage renal&#xD;
      disease in more than 50% of cases.&#xD;

      Introduction Maternal mortality is an important indicator of a country level of development.&#xD;
      Maternal death is considered as a death in pregnancy at any gestational age or up to 42 days&#xD;
      postpartum, either by direct or indirect causes. The United Nations in its Millennium&#xD;
      Development Goals proposed the reduction of the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters by&#xD;
      2015 in every country worldwide. Colombia has made great progress to reducing mortality from&#xD;
      direct causes, but not in deaths from indirect causes. In part, the problem is the large&#xD;
      knowledge gap in the incidence and characteristics of these diseases in middle-income&#xD;
      countries such as Colombia, where very little is known and research is scant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aHUS is defined as an ultra-rare disease, thus, it is not usually considered as a&#xD;
      differential diagnosis. This disease often progresses to end stage renal disease despite&#xD;
      standard treatment with plasma exchange, with a high mortality. In recent years, the role&#xD;
      played by the complement system in the induction of endothelial damage in patients with aHUS&#xD;
      has been established by characterizing multiple mutations and polymorphisms in genes encoding&#xD;
      certain complement factors. Recently, treatment with Eculizumab (monoclonal antibody that&#xD;
      inhibits the terminal moiety complement blocking complex formation membrane attack) in&#xD;
      prospective studies in patients with aHUS has demonstrated rapid and sustained interruption&#xD;
      of TMA, with a significant improvement of long-term renal function and a significant&#xD;
      reduction in requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or plasmapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature reports that the prevalence of aHUS is higher in adult women than in men, and&#xD;
      that 21% of all cases in women occur related to pregnancy. However, the approach and&#xD;
      treatment of this group represents a diagnostic and treatment challenge, because many of the&#xD;
      clinical pictures are similar to other well-defined disorders in the obstetric population,&#xD;
      with a high risk of misdiagnosis, especially with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver&#xD;
      enzymes and low platelet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification and Problem Statement The challenge of the clinician in obstetric patients is&#xD;
      to identify and assess a differential diagnosis, with both non-specific symptomatology and&#xD;
      laboratory results, resulting in a narrow line dividing the different TMAs, in this case,&#xD;
      aHUS with other pathologies related to pregnancy such as HELLP syndrome, Acute Fatty Liver of&#xD;
      Pregnancy (AFLP), sepsis and preeclampsia, as well as other microangiopathies that share many&#xD;
      of clinical characteristics of aHUS and can consequently generate a diagnostic challenge for&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, a model or algorithm leading to an accurate diagnosis that minimizes the chances of&#xD;
      incorrect identification of pathologies associated with TMA that can be triggered during&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum is needed. This diagnostic algorithm for TMA in pregnant women will&#xD;
      have an impact on improvements on health and could have a global health benefit. Currently,&#xD;
      two consensus documents (from Spain and Colombia), present a systematic approach and a useful&#xD;
      diagnostic flowchart for patients suspected with a TMA. The Colombian consensus flowchart was&#xD;
      developed in December 2014 and published in August 2015. However, these diagnostic approaches&#xD;
      have never been validated in the obstetric population. Therefore, the following research&#xD;
      question is presented:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the proposed diagnosis flowchart of thrombotic microangiopathies by the Colombian&#xD;
      consensus result in proper classification in critically ill obstetric patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives General objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To estimate the incidence of TMAs in obstetric, critically ill, patients using the&#xD;
      consensus flowchart proposed in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the TMAs incidence in obstetric critically ill patients according to the&#xD;
           Colombian consensus flowchart compared with expert judgment/opinion, in a single-center&#xD;
           critical care cohort of pregnant and postpartum women from Cartagena, Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the degree of agreement (i.e. Kappa index) of the two classifications (by&#xD;
           the Colombian consensus flowchart and expert judgment) in obstetric critically ill&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the risk of complications and adverse outcomes (death, mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation, vasopressor support, hysterectomy, transfusions, prolonged length of stay&#xD;
           in critical care, and multiple organ dysfunction) in obstetric critically ill patients&#xD;
           with aHUS, (Colombian consensus flowchart and expert judgment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate survival at 30 days after discharge in obstetric critically ill patients with&#xD;
           aHUS, according to two classifications studied (the Colombian consensus flowchart and&#xD;
           expert judgment) and determine if there are variables that can indicate degree of&#xD;
           severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed methodology A retrospective cohort study of critically ill obstetric patients. For&#xD;
      this purpose, two classifications of TMAs will be considered and assessed in pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum patients, one based in the Colombian consensus algorithm of TMAs, and the other&#xD;
      diagnostic approach based on clinical findings of highly qualified experts selected uniquely&#xD;
      for this purpose that will be considered as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible study population All obstetric admissions registered between 2006 and 2011 in a&#xD;
      medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary center (Gestion Salud clinic), in Cartagena, Colombia,&#xD;
      with about 8000 deliveries per year, will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation to detect agreement/disagreement Based on a very low prevalence of&#xD;
      TMAs in general population, but with an increased frequency in pregnant women (1 per 1000&#xD;
      deliveries, estimated from the Oklahoma TTP Registry data), looking for a low level of&#xD;
      agreement (null value) better than moderate (0.6) with a power of 80% and a clinically&#xD;
      acceptable level of agreement (effect size) of 0.9 and a proportion of positive ratings of&#xD;
      0.7, the sample size should be of 66 cases for TMAs, but expecting some missing data, the&#xD;
      sample should be at least of 20% more, thus the sample size should be of 75 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database identification and patient's selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included if admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypertensive disorder&#xD;
      associated with pregnancy and/or sepsis, and meet the following criteria for pregnancy&#xD;
      related thrombotic microangiopathy: thrombocytopenia &lt;150.000 cells/mL plus non-immune&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia (Hb less than 11gm/L plus Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 600 U/L), thus the&#xD;
      following algorithms will be established for the two main diseases proposed by the Colombian&#xD;
      consensus algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): platelets &lt;30.000 cells/mL plus neurological&#xD;
           impairment, or without neurological impairment, but in addition to a creatinine level of&#xD;
           &lt;1.7mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): platelets count &gt;30.000 cells/mL, plus&#xD;
           creatinine &gt; 1.7mg/dl with or without neurological impairment, or another organ&#xD;
           dysfunction per WHO dysfunction´s criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other diagnoses will also be considered using standard definitions, such as Acute Fatty&#xD;
           Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP syndrome. Finally, the patients not classified in&#xD;
           any of the above, shall be defined as severe preeclampsia or sepsis, as appropriate and&#xD;
           according to standard international definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) groups of experts will be defined. The first group (Group 1) shall consist of two (2)&#xD;
      Nephrologist and two obstetricians (JC, JN, JT, RB), with extensive experience in the&#xD;
      approach of MAT and aHUS. Each expert will separately assess the data. Meanwhile the second&#xD;
      group (defined as Group 2), will consist of two (2) intensivists (JARS, GO), this group will&#xD;
      apply the Colombian consensus flowchart without any other clinical guidance, on the patients&#xD;
      from the ICU database using a pathway already described by consensus on the retrospective&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All data will be collected in a database of Microsoft Excel©, and analyzed in&#xD;
      Stata 14 statistical package (Stata 14 for Windows; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant in all analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data of the study groups, stratified by TMA diagnosis, will be provided in&#xD;
      summary tables. Continuous data will be reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median&#xD;
      with interquartile range (IQR), depending on data normality. The normality of the variables&#xD;
      will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical data will be reported in percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic agreement between the two groups (Colombian consensus flow chart versus expert&#xD;
      opinion) will be evaluated. The cumulative incidence of each of the classifications will be&#xD;
      reported and compared using the Kappa index. The Kappa index is a measure of agreement beyond&#xD;
      chance. A value &lt;0 indicates no agreement and a value between 0.41 and 0.60 is indicative of&#xD;
      a moderate agreement. Values above 0.60 are considered very good or excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of adverse outcomes between TMA groups (TTP or aHUS) will be compared using&#xD;
      chi-square test for categorical data or t-test for continuous data. Non-normal data will be&#xD;
      compared through non-parametric test of medians. A crude and adjusted multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression will be carried out to determine independent risk factors for adverse outcomes by&#xD;
      TMA diagnosis. Data will be presented as unadjusted or adjusted odds ratios with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals. Kaplan-Mayer will be also calculated for the two classifications of&#xD;
      aHUS in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, an agreement analysis of each patient will be assessed between group 1 and 2.&#xD;
      Patients classified differently by the two groups (defined as overlap, overlapping or&#xD;
      imitator diagnoses), will be analyzed independently to find the peculiarities that led to&#xD;
      that situation. In case of no agreement, the conventional clinical approximation and&#xD;
      diagnosis performed by group 1 will be considered as the gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final analysis, the primary and the secondary outcomes, as well as any proposals will&#xD;
      be exposed in a meeting including all the authors and adjustments to the flowchart of the&#xD;
      Colombian consensus will be communicated as appropriate. Following this meeting, conclusions&#xD;
      and recommendations to adjust the flowchart for this population will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results Just in northern of Colombia, there were at least four cases of maternal&#xD;
      mortality associated with pathologies in which the diagnosis of a TMA was a differential&#xD;
      diagnosis in 2014. By mid-2015, over 4,000 cases of severe maternal morbidity have been&#xD;
      documented in Colombia, with diagnoses defined as hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, thus a&#xD;
      proposal of an adequate algorithm to discriminate the different TMA in the obstetric patient&#xD;
      will minimize underdiagnoses of aHUS.&#xD;
