  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 300, 000 youth and young adults across Canada are living with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)&#xD;
      which is considered the most common endocrine condition. Physical activity offers numerous&#xD;
      health benefits however the majority of persons living with T1D are physically inactive,&#xD;
      primarily due to fear of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This fear of hypoglycemia continues&#xD;
      to exist for physically active persons with T1D as no established physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines exist. Several acute studies have used high intensity interval training as a way&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia as it has the ability to activate fight or flight hormones&#xD;
      which can raise blood sugar; however the intensity needed to elicit this response is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to determine the acute effects of varying exercise intensities&#xD;
      on the time spent in a low blood sugar range in 10 sedentary (VIGOR acute sedentary) and 16&#xD;
      physically active (VIGOR acute trained) individuals with T1D. Each participant will complete&#xD;
      a maximal exercise test prior to the exercise sessions. Sedentary participants will complete&#xD;
      45 minutes of continuous moderate intensity exercise at 45-55% heart rate reserve (HRR) and&#xD;
      three high intensity interval sessions with six one minute burst of high intensity at 70%,&#xD;
      80%, or 90% of HRR every four minutes. Active participants will complete 45 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate intensity exercise at 45-55% of HRR and one high intensity interval session at 90%&#xD;
      of HRR with intervals spaced every two minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will track the blood sugar response to exercise using a device called a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) which records blood sugar every five minutes over a period&#xD;
      of six days. The CGM will help determine which exercise intensity does a better job at&#xD;
      reducing the time spent in a low blood sugar range. The information gained through this study&#xD;
      will help individuals with T1D remain active without fear of low blood sugar and provide&#xD;
      guidelines for professionals working with this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding high intensity bursts at 80% and 90% of maximum aerobic capacity (active participants)&#xD;
      or heart rate reserve (sedentary participants) to a moderate intensity exercise session will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the amount of time spent in a low blood sugar range in sedentary and&#xD;
      active persons with T1D compared to moderate intensity exercise alone.&#xD;

      Sedentary Arm: This portion of the study is complete. 10 participants completed the study in&#xD;
      its entirety. Maximal exercise testing utilized a Parvomedics Metabolic cart to analyze&#xD;
      oxygen consumption in ml/kg/min and maximum heart rate. Results from this test were used to&#xD;
      estimate intensity using heart rate for the exercise sessions. Prior to each exercise&#xD;
      session, participants arrived at 4:00 PM ate a Glucerna bar (to prevent drastic falls in&#xD;
      glycemia with exercise) and had an IV inserted. A total of six blood samples were taken at&#xD;
      each session at the following timepoints: (1) 0 mins-baseline, (2) 10 mins- end of warm up,&#xD;
      (3) 35 mins-end of intervals, (4) 45 mins-end of exercise, (5) 75 mins-mid recovery, and (6)&#xD;
      105 mins-end of exercise. Each blood draw was sampled for glucose, cortisol, and growth&#xD;
      hormone. Before exercise, blood glucose was measured on a handheld glucometer. If blood&#xD;
      glucose was &lt;5.7 mmol/L glucose was administered via Dex4 tablets. Exercise did not begin&#xD;
      until blood glucose was at least 5.7 mmol/L. If blood glucose was greater than 16.7 mmol/L&#xD;
      but less than 20.0 mmol/L ketones were tested on a urine ketone strip. If ketones were&#xD;
      negative or trace exercise began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first exercise session was 45 minutes of moderate intensity exercise at 45-55% of heart&#xD;
      rate reserve (HRR). The intensity determined from this session (speed and incline) was used&#xD;
      as the recovery intensity for the high intensity sessions. The high intensity sessions were&#xD;
      allocated in a random order from www.random.org where 1=70%, 2=80%, and 3=90%. Each high&#xD;
      intensity session started with 10 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (at the same speed&#xD;
      and incline from the first session) and six one minute bursts of high intensity every four&#xD;
      minutes followed by a 10 minute cool down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the small sample size and non-normal glucose profiles, data was analyzed using a&#xD;
      Friedman analysis of variance (non-parametric test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Arm: This portion is still recruiting participants. The procedures for this experiment&#xD;
      are very similar to the sedentary component. Blood glucose targets prior to exercise are the&#xD;
      same however no blood samples will be taken. Participants will arrive at the lab for 4:30 PM&#xD;
      and eat a Glucerna bar (to avoid drastic falls in glycemia with exercise). The two exercise&#xD;
      sessions, moderate and 90%, will be allocated in a random order from a coin flip where heads&#xD;
      is moderate exercise and tails is the 90% intervals. The moderate intensity session will&#xD;
      consist of 45 minutes of exercise at 45-55% of HRR. The 90% session will consist of 15&#xD;
      minutes of moderate intensity at 45-55% of HRR followed by six one minute bursts of exercise&#xD;
      at 90% of HRR every two minutes followed by a 10 minute cooldown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using a general linear model and logistic regression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin A1c &lt;9.9%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes duration &gt;/= 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sedentary Participants: participate in &lt;150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical&#xD;
             activity per week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active Participants: regular performance of vigorous physical activity &gt;3 times/week&#xD;
             for over one year. Display a maximal oxygen uptake that is at least 40.9 ml/kg/min for&#xD;
             females, and 49.3 ml/kg/min for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c ≥9.9% as the lack of compliance with insulin suggests they may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with the prescribed exercise requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have frequent and unpredictable hypoglycemia as they will be at a greater risk of&#xD;
             serious hypoglycemic events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had a change in insulin management strategy, including adoption of a pump within two&#xD;
             months of enrolment or switching back to multiple daily injections in the last two&#xD;
             months, as they may be at risk for a hypoglycemic event due to the novel insulin&#xD;
             management approach&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have conditions that would render vigorous intensity activity contraindicated&#xD;
             including: uncontrolled hypertension: BP &gt;150 mm Hg systolic or &gt;95 mm Hg diastolic in&#xD;
             a sitting position; severe peripheral neuropathy; or history of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive deficit resulting in an inability to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently taking beta-blockers as this would limit the ability to achieve target&#xD;
             heart rates within the prescribed range&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently being treated with medications (other than insulin) that alter glucose&#xD;
             metabolism (i.e. atypical antipsychotics, corticosteroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a job or profession that involves shift work (working during the night time, and&#xD;
             being asleep during the daytime, as this alters glucose levels.&#xD;
