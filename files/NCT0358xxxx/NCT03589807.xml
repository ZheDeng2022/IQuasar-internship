    <textblock>
      This is a trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one or&#xD;
      two doses of monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 virus vaccines&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly at different dosages, given with or without AS03 adjuvant, using&#xD;
      different vaccination schedules. This trial will enroll up to 180 males and non-pregnant&#xD;
      females, 19 to 50 years of age, who are in good health and who are influenza A/H7 naïve.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms (30 subjects per arm) to evaluate&#xD;
      the interval between the first and second doses and the presence of the adjuvant in the first&#xD;
      and second doses. The neuraminidase-specific antibody response and the neuraminidase content&#xD;
      of the Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine will be determined using tests that are currently&#xD;
      under development. Study duration is approximately 22 months with subject participation&#xD;
      duration of approximately 18 months. The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to assess&#xD;
      the safety and reactogenicity of 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs given with or without AS03&#xD;
      adjuvant following receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination&#xD;
      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the second&#xD;
      study vaccine.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      one or two doses of monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 virus&#xD;
      vaccines (2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs) administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75&#xD;
      or 15 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose), given with or without AS03 adjuvant, using&#xD;
      different heterologous and homologous prime-boost vaccination schedules. Phosphate buffered&#xD;
      saline (PBS) diluent may be used to achieve targeted dosages. This trial will enroll up to&#xD;
      180 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 50 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health&#xD;
      and meet all eligibility criteria and who are influenza A/H7 vaccine/infection naïve by&#xD;
      medical history. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms (30 subjects per&#xD;
      arm) evaluating the interval between the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses and the&#xD;
      presence of the adjuvant in the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses. The&#xD;
      neuraminidase-specific antibody response and the neuraminidase content of the Inactivated&#xD;
      Influenza Virus Vaccine will be determined using tests that are currently under development.&#xD;
      Study duration is approximately 22 months with subject participation duration of&#xD;
      approximately 18 months. The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs given with or without AS03 adjuvant following&#xD;
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and&#xD;
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the second study vaccine. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following&#xD;
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs),&#xD;
      including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and potentially immune-mediated&#xD;
      medical conditions (PIMMCs), following receipt of each study vaccine; 3) to assess the&#xD;
      kinetics and durability of serum HAI and Neut antibody responses following receipt of each&#xD;
      study vaccine.&#xD;

                  adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication&#xD;
                  change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription&#xD;
                  medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic&#xD;
                  medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any&#xD;
                  prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance&#xD;
                  company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same&#xD;
                  class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion&#xD;
                  criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease&#xD;
                  outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
                  sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
                  Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of&#xD;
                  the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no&#xD;
                  additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and&#xD;
                  immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition.&#xD;
                  Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are&#xD;
                  acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical&#xD;
                  condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk&#xD;
                  to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study&#xD;
                  vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of&#xD;
                  inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals,&#xD;

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Serum Hemagglutinin Inhibition (HAI) Antibodies Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 43 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 22.</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for HAI assay which was conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 21 days post second study vaccination (Day 43).</description>

        <population>The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population includes all participants who received study vaccination and contributed both pre- and at least one post-study vaccination venous blood samples for HAI antibody assays for which valid results were reported.</population>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Serum Hemagglutinin Inhibition (HAI) Antibodies Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 142 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 121.</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for HAI assay which was conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm and stratum from the available results at 21 days post study vaccination (Day 142).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Antibody Titer of 1:40 or Greater Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 142 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 121.</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for the HAI assay conducted with the H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. The percentage of participants with HAI titer &gt;= 1:40 was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 21 days post second study vaccination (Day 142 ).</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of Serum Neut Antibodies Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 202 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 22</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for Neut assay which was conducted with the 2013 and 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 180 days post second study vaccination (Day 202).</description>
        <time_frame>Day 202</time_frame>
        <population>The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population includes all participants who received study vaccination and contributed both pre- and at least one post-study vaccination venous blood samples for Neut antibody assays for which valid results were reported.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Neutralizing (Neut) Antibody Seroconversion Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 22</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for Neutralizing assay which was conducted with the 2013 and 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. Seroconversion was defined as Neut pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and post-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:40 or pre-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:10 and minimum 4-fold rise in post-vaccination antibody titer. 21 days after first study vaccination is Day 22.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Neutralizing (Neut) Antibody Seroconversion Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 301 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 121</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for Neutralizing assay which was conducted with the 2013 and 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. Seroconversion was defined as Neut pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and post-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:40 or pre-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:10 and minimum 4-fold rise in post-vaccination antibody titer. 180 days after second study vaccination is Day 301.</description>

          <description>Blood was collected for HAI assay which was conducted with the 2013 and 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. The percentage of participants with HAI titer &gt;= 1:40 was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 180 days post first study vaccination (Day 301).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Neut Antibody Titer of 1:40 or Greater Against the Influenza A/H7N9 Study Vaccine Viruses on Day 202 in Participants Who Received Their Second Study Vaccination on Day 22</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for Neut assay which was conducted with the 2013 and 2017 H7N9 vaccine viruses as the antigens. Each sample was tested at least twice per antigen per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results of each antigen was calculated as that sample's result. The percentage of participants with Neut titer &gt;= 1:40 was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 180 days post first study vaccination (Day 202).</description>
