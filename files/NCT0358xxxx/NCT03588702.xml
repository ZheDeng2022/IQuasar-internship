    <textblock>
      The Venus Legacy LB2 Body applicator is intended for circumference reduction treatment by&#xD;
      reducing fat cell size and enhancing collagen synthesis as the result of thermal and&#xD;
      non-thermal collagen stimulation. This is an open-label, evaluator-blind study of the safety&#xD;
      and performance of radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy&#xD;
      following liposuction. The study will enroll up to 50 male and female subjects requesting&#xD;
      treatment of the back, flanks and/or thighs to improve appearance following liposuction.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a total of six study treatments to one side of their body (back, flanks&#xD;
      and/or thighs) at one week intervals. Subjects will be followed up at one month after their&#xD;
      last study treatment. Treatment outcomes will be compared to the non-treated side.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is a loose type of connective tissue specialized to store lipids. The majority&#xD;
      of lipids stored in adipose cells are triglycerides formed from imported free fatty acids and&#xD;
      glycerol. It is not uniformly distributed in the body. The major adipose depot is&#xD;
      subcutaneous (about 80% of all body fat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology options for skin tightening and body contouring have included vacuum massage,&#xD;
      infrared laser energy, high frequency focused ultrasound, cryolipolysis, radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy and various hybrid energy device options. Radiofrequency energy devices have remained&#xD;
      the most common and dominant technology in the noninvasive management of skin tightening,&#xD;
      cellulite improvement and body contouring enhancement, as they can treat all these conditions&#xD;
      with relatively consistent results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RF energy is high frequency alternating electrical current that passes into the dermis&#xD;
      and hypodermal tissues without disruption of the epidermal-dermal barrier. The high frequency&#xD;
      oscillating electrical current results in collisions between charged molecules and ions and&#xD;
      the micromolecular mechanical energy from these collisions is transformed into heat. This&#xD;
      biological RF heat occurs irrespective of chromophore or skin type and is not dependent upon&#xD;
      selective photothermolysis. The RF heat has different biological and hence, clinical effects,&#xD;
      depending upon the tissue targeted. In the dermis, where the primary cellular element is the&#xD;
      fibroblast and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is comprised of collagen, elastin and ground&#xD;
      substances, the RF mediated thermal stimulation of the ECM results in an immediate and&#xD;
      temporary shrinkage of the collagen triple helix. Further, the RF thermal stimulation results&#xD;
      in a microinflammatory stimulation of the fibroblast which in response produces new collagen&#xD;
      (neocollagenesis) and new elastin neoelastogenesis), and ground substances. RF thermal&#xD;
      stimulation of adipose tissue results in a thermal mediated stimulation and augmented&#xD;
      activity of lipase mediated enzymatic degradation of adipocyte derived triglycerides into&#xD;
      free fatty acids and glycerol. This amplification of the physiologic breakdown and egress of&#xD;
      the triglycerides out of the adipocyte, while keeping the adipocyte cell membrane and cell&#xD;
      function intact, results in RF induced shrinkage of the fat cells and body contouring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Venus Legacy LB2 Body Applicator Combines Multi-Polar RF current and Pulsed&#xD;
      Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF) in synergy with suction/vacuum. PEMF has been shown to increase&#xD;
      fibroblast derived collagen production through a non-thermal mechanism of membrane&#xD;
      stimulation, and the stimulation of fibroblast mediated angiogenesis which facilitates and&#xD;
      enhances wound healing in tissues. Theoretically then, the synergistic RF and PEMF would&#xD;
      create RF thermal collagen stimulation and PEMF non-thermal stimulation of collagen, RF&#xD;
      thermally mediated reduction in adipocyte size and PEMF micro-tissue healing effects to&#xD;
      minimize edema, swelling and downtime that are associated with pure RF thermal therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and performance of RF and PEMF&#xD;
      using the Venus Legacy LB2 body applicator following liposuction to the back, flanks and/or&#xD;
      thighs.&#xD;
