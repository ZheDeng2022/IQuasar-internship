  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute or subacute comorbid syndrome characterized by decreased awareness and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction accompanied by attention deficit. It varies from 20% to 80%, depending&#xD;
      on the report. If delirium occurs in intensive care unit, complications such as intubation&#xD;
      tube and catheter removal that are not desired are increased, mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      deviation is prolonged, and eventually the intensive care unit is extended. Prevention of&#xD;
      delirium is therefore very important, but no medication has been found to prevent delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the&#xD;
      development of delirium, and as a result of the stimulation of the peripheral inflammatory&#xD;
      reaction, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) -6, tumor necrosis factor- ), And&#xD;
      IL-10) secretion, resulting in the induction of inflammatory responses of the central nervous&#xD;
      system. In addition, sleep habits have been shown to affect the pro-inflammatory pathway, and&#xD;
      sleep induction and inactivation of the pro-inflammatory pathway may be expected to prevent&#xD;
      and treat delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective a2-agonist with sedative and analgesic effects&#xD;
      and reduces sympathetic response to stimuli. Compared to benzodiazepine and opioid, there are&#xD;
      fewer side effects of respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, the possibility of intrinsic immune suppression of DEX has been&#xD;
      demonstrated, and recent studies have shown that intravenous DEX administration reduces IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, and TNF-a levels, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects. IL-6 plays a key role in&#xD;
      neuroinflammation with both proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      including infection, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders. DEX&#xD;
      plays a key role in IL-6 stimulated IL-6 And inhibits mRNA expression and thus has a brain&#xD;
      function-protecting effect. In clinical trials, DEX administration compared with propofol&#xD;
      decreased IL-6 secretion and decreased post-operative cognitive impairment in ICU patients&#xD;
      after primary surgery. This is closely related to the formation of inflammatory complexes&#xD;
      (Inflammasome). In addition, low-dose DEX infusion in patients with ICU at night has a low&#xD;
      incidence of delirium during the ICU period, and studies have shown that sleep quality is&#xD;
      improved in the DEX group in the mechanical ventilation group. Patients who did not undergo&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation also reported improved sleep quality with prophylactic low-dose DEX.&#xD;
      As such, the definitive mechanism has not yet been clarified, but the use of low-dose DEX is&#xD;
      increasingly proactively used to improve sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DEX on the inflammatory pathway&#xD;
      during nighttime after ICU admission and to observe the quality of sleep and the prognosis of&#xD;
      delirium.&#xD;

      Delirium is an acute and subacute comorbid syndrome characterized by decreased awareness and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction accompanied by attention deficit. It varies from 20% to 80% in patients&#xD;
      entering the ICU. If delirium occurs in the intensive care unit, complications such as&#xD;
      unintended intubation, unintentional drainage, and mechanical ventilation are prolonged.&#xD;
      Prevention of delirium is therefore very important, but no medication has been found to&#xD;
      prevent delirium. Recent studies have shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokine affects the&#xD;
      etiology of delirium. In addition, sleep habits have been shown to affect the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory pathway, and sleep induction and inactivation of the pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      pathway may be expected to prevent and treat delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEX is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with sedative and anti-anxiety effects and&#xD;
      reduces sympathetic response due to stimulation. Recent studies have shown that intravenous&#xD;
      DEX is effective in reducing inflammation by decreasing levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine, which is continuously administered at&#xD;
      night after ICU admission, on the development of delirium and inflammatory markers, and to&#xD;
      observe the prognosis. Patients who underwent spine, hip or femur surgery and who were&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU after institutional exhalation were randomly assigned to the DEX group&#xD;
      and the control group. Both groups can be combined with remifentanil for appropriate&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia. The DEX group injects DEX at 0.2 ug / kg / hr from 9 pm to 7 am. The&#xD;
      control group is inoculated with saline solution. At this time, the patient's blood pressure,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and cardiopulmonary function are continuously monitored. If an adverse&#xD;
      event occurs during DEX sedation, process it and record it. If hypotension occurs, 4 mg of IV&#xD;
      ephedrine is administered. If hypotension occurs, 4 mg is added or infused with&#xD;
      norepinephrine. If Bradycardia (HR &lt;45 bpm) occurs, IV glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg is administered.&#xD;
      If bradycardia persists after administration, administer 0.5 mg IV atropine at a maximum of&#xD;
      0.5 mg. If respiratory depression (RR &lt;10 / min) and hypoxia (SaO2 &lt;90%) occur, the patient&#xD;
      may be awakened by loud or mild stimulation. If the respiratory depression and hypoxia&#xD;
      persist despite these treatments, head extension , and maneuver for airway maintenance such&#xD;
      as jaw thrust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-1, NLRP3 and ASC were measured at the onset of surgery in both&#xD;
      the DEX group and the control group. Follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following morning the subjects themselves and the researchers evaluate the quality of&#xD;
      sleep (using RCSQ questionnaire) and delirium (ICDSC, CAM-ICU), respectively.&#xD;
