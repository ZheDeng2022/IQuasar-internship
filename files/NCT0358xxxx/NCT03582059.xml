  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation by means of an electrode in the back is used to treat patients with&#xD;
      persistent chronic pain after back surgery. Based on the stimulation patterns, there are&#xD;
      mainly three different technologies available - conventional, burst frequency and the high&#xD;
      frequency. It is known that the traditional frequency works through the lateral system of&#xD;
      pain pathways in the spinal cord to cause pain reduction. Electroencephalographic(tracing of&#xD;
      brain activity) recording of patients using burst have shown an additional effect on an&#xD;
      adjacent medial pain pathway which decreases the attention to pain. We want to therefore find&#xD;
      out if high frequency stimulation also has an effect on the same pathways. 20 patients who&#xD;
      have persistent neuropathic chronic pain after previous spinal surgery, would be eligible to&#xD;
      have this treatment as part of their normal care. They will be randomly chosen to undergo a 2&#xD;
      week cycle of high frequency and 2 weeks of burst stimulation. We will record EEG's, pain&#xD;
      scores and scores measuring attention to pain and compare findings. All patients will be&#xD;
      recruited at the Leeds Pain and Neuromodulaton centre and the EEg analysis will be done by a&#xD;
      research team based in Belgium. We hope that the study will improve our understanding of how&#xD;
      different stimuation waveforms used for spinal cord stimulation work. We hope to have&#xD;
      recruited all 20 patients in a 12 month period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  I. Patient is 18 years of age or older and has given written informed consent. II. Has&#xD;
             persistent chronic predominant low back pain of neuropathic origin, with or with out&#xD;
             radiculopathy, for a minimum of 6 months as per NICE Tag 0159. III. Patient has had&#xD;
             previous spinal surgery at least &gt; 6 months ago. IV. Numerical rating scale Scale&#xD;
             (NRS) back pain score of at least 5 at baseline V. Confirmation of pain from&#xD;
             neuropathic origin as per NICE guidance TAG 0159 VI. Total daily dose of opioids&#xD;
             equivalent to ≤120mg of Morphine VII. In the investigators opinion the patient is a&#xD;
             suitable candidate for SCS. VIII. Patient is willing to comply with the requirements&#xD;
             of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
