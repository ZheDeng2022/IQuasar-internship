  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, double blinded, Phase III study to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy and safety of TORIPALIMAB INJECTIO（JS001） in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine/cisplatin compared with placebo in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin as&#xD;
      first-line treatment in patients with histological/cytological confirmation of recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic NPC. The primary endpoint is PFS in all patients. Approximately 280 patients who&#xD;
      fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms. patients will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      combination of JS001 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B) with gemcitabine and cisplatin given every 3&#xD;
      weeks (Q3W) in 3-week cycles.&#xD;
