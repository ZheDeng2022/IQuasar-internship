    <textblock>
      Cardiorespiratory fitness is of vital importance to firefighters and yet is rarely, if ever,&#xD;
      tested in a systematic fashion over the course of an individual firefighter's career.&#xD;
      Investigators know that there are incremental health benefits to increased levels of fitness&#xD;
      and reduced morbidity and mortality associated with lower levels of fitness. The proposed&#xD;
      study will address this gap by enrolling up to 135 firefighters from local metropolitan fire&#xD;
      departments. The goal of this cross-sectional correlational study is to address which body&#xD;
      composition methods best correlate with cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in firefighters in&#xD;
      order to define a method to combine data into a risk score predictive of fitness.&#xD;
      Specifically, this study will 1) measure body composition data and evaluate the correlation&#xD;
      of BMI with non-BMI body composition measures, such as body fat percentage (BF%), lean body&#xD;
      mass percentage (LBM%), or waist circumference (WC), 2) measure cardiorespiratory fitness in&#xD;
      terms of VO2max and evaluate the correlation of body composition measures such as BMI, BF%,&#xD;
      LBM%, and/or WC with VO2max,, 3) evaluate diagnostic test metrics, such as sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, of population meeting obesity criteria by BMI and WC, as compared to BF% as the&#xD;
      reference standard, 4) develop a cardiorespiratory fitnessscore (CVFS) from a conjunction of&#xD;
      body composition measures (BMI, as BF%, LBM%, WC) and demographic variables that is&#xD;
      well-correlated with measured VO2max, evaluate the CVFS performance in age and&#xD;
      gender-stratified subpopulations relative to the accepted standard of gender-stratified&#xD;
      VO2max criteria, and identify age and gender-stratified CVFS threshold and diagnostic test&#xD;
      performance; and 5) correlate CVFS performance with cardiovascular risk measures. Results of&#xD;
      this analysis will provide pilot data and inform future work to assess whether providing more&#xD;
      accurate data on body composition can lead to more effective reductions in cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      risk in this population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Firefighters are exposed to extreme metabolic and cardiopulmonary stressors in the&#xD;
      performance of their vocation that are recognized to exceed the actual physical or&#xD;
      environmental hazards. The current medical literature regarding firefighting highlights two&#xD;
      frequently cited statistics: (1) based on body mass index (BMI), upwards of 73-80% of&#xD;
      firefighters are considered overweight or obese, and (2) &gt;45% of firefighter line-of-duty&#xD;
      deaths are due to cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This finding regarding BMI has been widely reported in the U.S. media after being published&#xD;
      in a 2014 CDC medical journal. Such a finding is particularly relevant to firefighters given&#xD;
      that there are recommended cardiorespiratory performance standards for firefighters, commonly&#xD;
      12 metabolic equivalents (METs) or maximum oxygen consumption during aerobic exercise&#xD;
      (VO2max) of 42 mL O2/kg of body weight/min. As a consequence, failure to meet such a standard&#xD;
      may limit a firefighter's ability to perform (or be employed) in full-duty tasks based on&#xD;
      individual fire station requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fire suppression activities account for 1-5% of a firefighter's duty time yet result in 32%&#xD;
      of firefighter deaths. This is attributable to the extreme physical demands of firefighting&#xD;
      activities in which anaerobic threshold (typically 85% of maximal heart rate) may be exceeded&#xD;
      and sustained throughout an engagement. Few professions, other than elite athletes, require&#xD;
      this level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). As such, CRF is of vital importance to&#xD;
      firefighters and yet is rarely, if ever, tested in a systematic fashion over the course of an&#xD;
      individual firefighter's career.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vital importance of CRF is well-established in the medical literature, such that many&#xD;
      advocate for its addition as a clinical vital sign. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      an inverse relationship between CRF and coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality&#xD;
      in healthy individuals. There are incremental health benefits to increased levels of fitness&#xD;
      and reduced morbidity and mortality associated with lower levels of fitness. The fitness&#xD;
      standard of 12 METs (the equivalent of a VO2max of 42 mL/kg/min) remains the testing metric&#xD;
      for firefighters in the NFPA 1582 guidelines; it is applied to all candidates, male or&#xD;
      female, and of any age. While a VO2max of 42 may be &quot;good&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot; for a 50-59 year&#xD;
      old male, it is only &quot;good&quot; for a 40-49 year old male, and only &quot;fair&quot; for a 30-39 or &quot;poor&quot;&#xD;
      for a 20-29 year old male. In women, a VO2max of 42 indicates a &quot;good&quot; level of CRF for a&#xD;
      20-29 year old female and &quot;superior&quot; CRF for a 50-59 year old female. Knowing that CRF&#xD;
      declines inevitably with age argues that a firefighter whose VO2max is 42 mL/kg/min at age 20&#xD;
      will decline significantly by age 50 and raises the question of their ability to safely&#xD;
      participate in fire suppression activities at that age. CRF measures in firefighters would&#xD;
      benefit from age-adjustment and gender stratification. This research would begin that&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While elevated BMI is associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, BMI has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to be a non-specific metric of body composition. Specifically, BMI &quot;is&#xD;
      limited as an index of obesity (body fatness) because it does not account for the composition&#xD;
      of body weight,&quot; and the concurrence of BMI and body fat percentage (BF%) is affected by age,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, and body shape. The misclassification of firefighters as overweight and&#xD;
      obese based on BMI has been discussed in a several studies. These studies utilized&#xD;
      bioimpedance testing or skin calipers for BF% measurement, methods known to have significant&#xD;
      levels of error in terms of false positives and false negatives. Interestingly, a series of&#xD;
      these studies cite a single article with a sample size of 39 individuals as validation of&#xD;
      bioimpedance in comparison to dual-energy X-ray absorption (DXA), but also report DXA as the&#xD;
      gold standard for BF% measurement. This inaccuracy of BF% compared to BMI was addressed&#xD;
      thoroughly in one study of U.S. firefighters, demonstrating the potential for false positive&#xD;
      and false negative identification of obesity in this population; specifically, they reported&#xD;
      rates of 15.4% false positive and 18.2% false negative identification of obesity when&#xD;
      identified by BMI as opposed to BF%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary advantages of using BMI in a clinical setting include the long-established&#xD;
      history of BMI usage and its extremely low cost (simply measuring someone's height and&#xD;
      weight). However, waist circumference (WC) is easily measured, and has demonstrated&#xD;
      comparable prediction of cardiovascular risk as compared to and in conjunction with BMI.10&#xD;
      Although classification of obesity has not been conducted by WC, an elevated cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk has been identified for men with WC &gt; 102 cm and women with WC &gt; 88 cm.More&#xD;
      specifically, WC classifications of very low, low, high, and very high have been developed.&#xD;
      For purposes of this study, WC measurements within the high and very high classifications are&#xD;
      considered as obese, with this population (WC &gt; 100 cm in males, WC &gt; 90 cm in females)&#xD;
      representing a similar population to those identified with an increased cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gap between BF% and cardiovascular risk as it pertains to clinical use of BMI&#xD;
      and other body composition metrics has been identified by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute (NHLBI), whose 2013 systematic review noted, &quot;studies using BMI and waist&#xD;
      circumference compared to more valid measures of percent body fat are needed to examine the&#xD;
      predictive role of various adiposity measures.&quot; However, strong correlations between body&#xD;
      composition metrics and CRF were found in a recent study in Brazilian firefighters, and in&#xD;
      this case, BMI was considered to be an adequate surrogate for other body composition methods&#xD;
      evaluating body composition. A limitation of this study was that it used skin caliper testing&#xD;
      for BF% measurement and a non-respiratory-based exercise test to indirectly estimate VO2max.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an evident need to clarify which among several potential measures of body&#xD;
      composition best predicts CRF, with firefighters serving as a relevant population for study.&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that utilize the accepted criterion&#xD;
      standard of dual X-ray energy absorption (DXA) scanning coupled with measured VO2max testing&#xD;
      that would allow coupling these two metrics into a reference fitness-leanness measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA is a widely-available technology that is relatively inexpensive compared with other&#xD;
      diagnostic technologies, is safe, and can accurately measure BF%. DXA studies can be&#xD;
      completed in less than ten minutes and provide data that is valid and reproducible over time.&#xD;
      The radiation from a DXA scan is less than that received from routine environmental exposure&#xD;
      in a single day. Americans typically receive approximately 3.0 milliSieverts (mSv) of&#xD;
      radiation exposure annually from cosmic radiation, household radon, and other environmental&#xD;
      sources. This does not include elective diagnostic imaging sources. The radiation exposure of&#xD;
      a DXA scan is ~0.005 mSv, about a tenth of that from a single chest x-ray (CXR). 19 By&#xD;
      comparison a CT scan of the pelvis, chest or abdomen can expose the patient to 6.0 -10.0 mSv&#xD;
      in one study (the equivalent of 2-3 years of environmental exposure in a single medical&#xD;
      study). A CT scan of the head is ~2.0 mSv.20 A lumbar spine X-ray series is ~1.5 mSv and a&#xD;
      single PA (posterior-anterior) chest X-ray (CXR) is ~0.06 mSv. The precept of As Low As&#xD;
      Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) in order to minimize radiation exposure is easily honored in&#xD;
      the case of DXA scanning due to the extremely low mSv exposures. The Biological Effects of&#xD;
      Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII report and executive summary provide definitive recommendations&#xD;
      regarding radiation exposure and cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA has been identified an accurate method of measuring BF%, with the additional benefit of&#xD;
      also measuring lean body mass percentage (LBM%) and, of course, bone mineral density (BMD),&#xD;
      as well. This is supported by numerous studies including BF% measured by DXA as the reference&#xD;
      against their study variable of interest. Obesity has been defined for BF% by age categories,&#xD;
      with classifications of low, mid, high, and obesity, where the bottom of the low range is the&#xD;
      minimum of essential body fat. On the other hand, LBM% has not been extensively studied in&#xD;
      correlation with obesity in adults, though contemporary work has been conducted to estimate&#xD;
      LBM% in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, this study aims to address which body composition methods best correlate with CRF in&#xD;
      firefighters. Investigators hypothesize that BF% will better correlate with CRF metrics than&#xD;
      traditional (but technologically outdated) body composition methods, such as BMI or waist&#xD;
      circumference (WC), and furthermore in conjunction with measurement of LBM%. Additionally,&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that these data, in conjunction with demographic, employment,&#xD;
      physical activity, and medical history data, can comprise a simplified metric (a&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness score) to estimate firefighter CRF. In this context, a cost&#xD;
      analysis of the evaluated surveillance methods will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk has been evaluated in the context of CRF previously, but not specifically&#xD;
      in terms of correlating VO2max and cardiovascular risk measures in firefighters. Most&#xD;
      recently, Yang et al. reported significantly decreased cardiovascular risk in a firefighter&#xD;
      population relative to increased number of push-ups performed.24 A well-accepted measure of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in adults is the Framingham Risk Score, which estimates a percentage of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk over 10 years as a function of age, serum cholesterol measures,&#xD;
      blood pressure, diabetes history, and smoking status; this tool is often considered the gold&#xD;
      standard of evaluating 10-year cardiovascular disease risk.25 Studies have demonstrated an&#xD;
      inverse association between CRF - in terms of VO2max or otherwise - and the Framingham Risk&#xD;
      Score, in a variety of populations, including men, women, and diabetics.26-30 Notably, Gander&#xD;
      et al. (2017) specifically discussed the added utility of correlating Framingham Risk with&#xD;
      estimated cardiorespiratory fitness in an asymptomatic male population, which to some degree&#xD;
      may mimic much of the firefighter population, wherein most are primarily male and&#xD;
      asymptomatic.31 This study aims to add to the literature base demonstrating that higher&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness is correlated with lower cardiovascular risk, but uniquely in the&#xD;
      context of the firefighter population. As cardiorespiratory fitness is a good measure of&#xD;
      performance, the concurrent demonstration of decreased cardiovascular risk in a&#xD;
      cost-effective way can add significant value to evaluation of firefighters, in whom these&#xD;
      more elevated risks have been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this analysis will provide pilot data and inform future work to assess whether&#xD;
      providing more accurate data on body composition can lead to more effective reductions in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory risk in this population. This study has the additional benefit of creating&#xD;
      the availability of DXA three-compartment (fat mass, lean mass, bone mineral content) body&#xD;
      composition at our institution, where this study is not currently performed despite the&#xD;
      required technology already being used for bone studies.&#xD;
