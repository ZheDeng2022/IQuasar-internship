  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HHT or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance&#xD;
      pattern, characterized by widespread telangiectases that can involve several organs including&#xD;
      the intestinal tract and the liver. Liver involvement by HHT is characterized by widespread&#xD;
      diffuse liver vascular malformations that give origin to arteriovenous, arterioportal and&#xD;
      portovenous shunts. The prevalence of hepatic involvement in HHT can reach 78%. Less&#xD;
      commonly, patients may also develop porto-systemic encephalopathy (PSE). However, there are&#xD;
      no studies on the possibility that patients with HHT might develop mHE, a highly plausible&#xD;
      hypothesis considering the presence of diffuse macroscopic and microscopic porto-systemic&#xD;
      shunt in this pathological condition.&#xD;

      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a potentially reversible disorder characterized by&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric abnormalities and motor disturbances that range from mild alterations of&#xD;
      cognitive and motor functions to coma and death (1-2). This condition has been linked to the&#xD;
      combination of gut flora alterations, which increase the production of gut-derived toxins&#xD;
      such as ammonia and indoles, and porto-systemic shunts, leading to endotoxemia associated to&#xD;
      systemic and cerebral inflammation (3-4). The subclinical expression of HE is defined minimal&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy (mHE) (5-7). The latter condition is characterized by the presence of&#xD;
      various quantifiable neurophysiological and neuropsychological deficits that are only&#xD;
      recognized by the use of specific diagnostic tools such as the paper-and-pencil tests and its&#xD;
      variants as well as critical flicker frequency (CFF) (8-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual test based on CFF measures the frequency (Hz) when impression of fused light turns&#xD;
      to a flickering one (5,11). This neurophysiological test has an elevated specificity and&#xD;
      reproducibility, with only little biases due to training effects and daytime variability&#xD;
      (7,11-13). CFF has also shown the ability to predict the risk of developing overt HE in&#xD;
      cirrhotics undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (14,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HHT or Rendu-Osler-Weber disease is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant inheritance&#xD;
      pattern, characterized by widespread telangiectases that can involve several organs including&#xD;
      the intestinal tract and the liver (16). There are two main types of the disease, HHT1 and&#xD;
      HHT2, which are caused respectively by mutations in ENG gene on chromosome 9 coding for&#xD;
      endoglin for HHT1and mutations in ACVRL1 gene on chromosome 12 for HHT2 (17,18). These two&#xD;
      types of the disease account for most clinical cases but mutations in MADH4 gene on&#xD;
      chromosome 5 (encodingSMAD4), have been recently described, and a new type HHT3 has been&#xD;
      reported (17). HHT2 is associated with a high rate of liver involvement (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver involvement by HHT is characterized by widespread diffuse liver vascular malformations&#xD;
      that give origin to arteriovenous, arterioportal and portovenous shunts. The prevalence of&#xD;
      hepatic involvement in HHT can reach 78% (19). Less commonly, patients may also develop&#xD;
      porto-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) (20). However, there are no studies on the possibility&#xD;
      that patients with HHT might develop mHE, a highly plausible hypothesis considering the&#xD;
      presence of diffuse macroscopic and microscopic porto-systemic shunt in this pathological&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
