  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral vestibular lesions are frequent and disabling pathologies causing a set of&#xD;
      oculomotor, postural and perceptual symptoms. These symptoms reduce over time according to a&#xD;
      vestibular compensation. However, vestibular compensation should be considered as a set of&#xD;
      sub-processes whose duration and recovery level differ. Indeed, after a unilateral vestibular&#xD;
      loss, some functions remain asymmetrical as a long-term effect, and these disorders may be&#xD;
      observed among patients with no functional complaints. Balance disorders may persist in some&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equilibration consists in handling real-time a considerable amount of information coming&#xD;
      from the environment and the subject himself, allowing an adaptation of the position and&#xD;
      movements of his body to satisfy the needs of posture, balance and orientation. This&#xD;
      information comes mainly from the vision, the vestibule and the somesthesic system. It is&#xD;
      pre-treated and harmonized in the brainstem, before being transmitted to the higher brain&#xD;
      centres. Brain centers thus learn about peripheral conditions. According to these and the&#xD;
      project of the movement, brain centers address in response orders to ophtalmological and&#xD;
      motor effectors ensuring look, posture and balance to be provided. The eye is a cornerstone&#xD;
      of the balancing system through the retina, an environmental sensor, and its extraocular&#xD;
      muscles, effectors of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of acute unilateral vestibular loss on visual&#xD;
      abilities evaluated by orthoptic balance in patients who presented acute unilateral&#xD;
      vestibular loss by surgical deafferentation (removal of vestibular schwannoma, vestibular&#xD;
      neurotomy or surgical labyrinthectomy for Meniere's disease), during the early phase and&#xD;
      decline of vestibular compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of a pre-existing anomaly of the visual&#xD;
      abilities evaluated by orthoptic assessment on the vestibular compensation capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in all, this study seems crucial to improve the management of patients with unilateral&#xD;
      vestibular dysfunction and contribute to improving their clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a standardized management of these patients, an audio-vestibular evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed before surgery (-1D), after acute unilateral vestibular loss at the early stage&#xD;
      (+7D), and then after vestibular compensation (+2M) as well as an orthoptic evaluation. A&#xD;
      good tolerance of the orthoptic evaluation is expected in this surgical context.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Unilateral vestibular lesions are frequent and disabling pathologies, with significant&#xD;
      psychological impacts, as well as on the socio-professional and daily life of the affected&#xD;
      subjects. Furthermore, socio-economic consequences have to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of the vestibular system in the stabilization control of the look, the&#xD;
      eye-head coordination, posture, locomotion and perception of verticality is widely&#xD;
      recognized. Therefore, the unilateral vestibular diseases cause a set of oculomotor, postural&#xD;
      and perceptual symptoms. These symptoms reduce over time according to a process known as&#xD;
      vestibular compensation. However, vestibular compensation should be considered as a set of&#xD;
      sub-processes whose duration and recovery level differ. Indeed, after a unilateral vestibular&#xD;
      loss, some functions remain asymmetrical as a long-term effect, and these disorders may be&#xD;
      observed among patients with no functional complaints. Balance disorders may persist in some&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      All in all, this study seems crucial to improve the management of patients with unilateral&#xD;
      vestibular dysfunction and contribute to improving their clinical management by prescribing&#xD;
      an appropriate rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a standardized management of these patients, an audio-vestibular evaluation (clinical ENT&#xD;
      examination, pure tone and speech audiometry, videonystagmography, vestibular evoked myogenic&#xD;
      potentials, Posturography, Vertical Visual Subjective, quality of life by Dizziness Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory) will be performed before surgery (-1D), after acute unilateral vestibular loss at&#xD;
      the early stage (+7D), and then after vestibular compensation (+2M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An orthoptic evaluation will be performed during 30 min and the audio vestibular evaluation&#xD;
      will be carried out at the same time. A good tolerance of the orthoptic evaluation is&#xD;
      expected in this surgical context.&#xD;
