    <textblock>
      The current trial will explore the feasibility of a larger efficacy trial to test a newly&#xD;
      developed form of online CBT called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which we have called&#xD;
      &quot;ACT OPEN&quot;) for people with HIV and painful peripheral neuropathy. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from HIV clinics in London, UK. Participants will be randomly chosen to receive the&#xD;
      new ACT OPEN treatment right away or after waiting for 5 months. The treatment lasts for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires to assess pain, functioning, and&#xD;
      mood at the beginning of the study and 8 weeks and five months later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major health problem in the United Kingdom and&#xD;
      worldwide. Neuropathic pain in the feet related to peripheral neuropathy is one of the most&#xD;
      common symptoms associated with HIV. This pain is difficult to treat and medications are not&#xD;
      effective. Chronic pain in people with HIV is related to higher levels of disability and poor&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can improve quality of life&#xD;
      for people with chronic pain in general (not HIV-related), and there have been efforts to&#xD;
      provide more accessible versions of CBT over the Internet. However, it is not known whether&#xD;
      Internet-based CBT is helpful for people with HIV and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial will explore the feasibility of a newly developed form of online CBT called&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which we have called &quot;ACT OPEN&quot;) for people with HIV and&#xD;
      painful peripheral neuropathy. Participants will be recruited from HIV clinics in London, UK.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly chosen to receive the new ACT OPEN treatment right away or&#xD;
      after waiting for 5 months. The treatment lasts for 8 weeks. Participants will complete&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires to assess pain, functioning, and mood at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study and 8 weeks and five months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a larger trial evaluating the&#xD;
      impact of online ACT for people with HIV and chronic pain in their feet. Key feasibility&#xD;
      parameters that will be evaluated will include an estimate of the recruitment and retention&#xD;
      rates, treatment completion rate and satisfaction, and an estimate of the effect size of&#xD;
      changes in standard pain outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will access the ACT OPEN treatment through a secure online platform. Each session consists of brief videos and audio recordings that provide information about pain and guide participants through experiential exercises (e.g., mindfulness, values clarification, goal-setting). Participants will respond to questions assessing their experiences during the session and their progress using online messaging and/or brief telephone calls according to their preference. Therapists will provide individualised feedback. ACT OPEN consists of 12 sessions over 6 weeks. Participants will be given two further weeks to finish any uncompleted sessions, or to complete additional sessions (up to four) as agreed with their therapist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Waiting list control</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive their usual treatment for 5 months, after which they will complete ACT OPEN as described. A waiting list control was chosen as there is no clearly credible active psychotherapy to serve as the comparator in this context, particularly in light of high drop-out rates in two previous studies of CBT for pain in HIV. Providing the online treatment without therapist support may appear to be a logical comparison group instead of a waitlist control. However, there is evidence that therapist support is a key component of online CBT and, therefore, without this support it may not represent a credible treatment against which to judge the full treatment. In the context of the feasibility aims of this trial these reasons, the use of a waiting list control is thus justified.</description>
