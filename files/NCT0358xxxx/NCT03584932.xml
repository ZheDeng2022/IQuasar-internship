  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the&#xD;
      general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year.&#xD;
      Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth achieve HIV viral load suppression, due to&#xD;
      poor retention and adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Existing linkage and retention&#xD;
      services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+&#xD;
      youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. The LINK2&#xD;
      study will develop and implement a youth service navigation (YSN) intervention to improve&#xD;
      linkage and retention among CJI YLWH and analyze results to address existing gaps in the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 (+364 days), incarcerated in Los&#xD;
      Angeles and Chicago jails and through community clinics serving recently released CJI YLWH.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control&#xD;
      group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate&#xD;
      unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing;&#xD;
      will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress&#xD;
      along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation&#xD;
      intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to&#xD;
      sexual and gender minority (SGM) culture that guides youth to needed services along the&#xD;
      continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health&#xD;
      care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 (+364 days) upon release&#xD;
      from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, the&#xD;
      study will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI&#xD;
      YLWH aged 16-25 (+364 days), compared to controls offered standard of care. The study team&#xD;
      will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention,&#xD;
      adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on substance use disorders, mental health,&#xD;
      services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims are to assess the intervention's effects&#xD;
      on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Linkage to care HIV care is measured as HIV primary care provider visits; time to 1st post-release HIV care visit. Measures will involve survey and electronic record sources; self-reported measures derived from Outreach Initiative and HCSUS instrument. Retention in HIV care is measured as number of visits and missed visits to HIV primary care providers. Measurement tools include surveys and electronic record sources; self-reported measures derived from the Outreach Initiative and the HCSUS instrument. ART adherence is measured using a visual analogue scale of % (0-100) in surveys. Additional tools include electronic record sources; self-reported measures derived from Outreach Initiative; HCSUS instrument. Viral suppression is deemed undetectable at &lt; 50 copies/ml as defined by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Tools will include survey and electronic record sources and items from the HCSUS instrument and Outreach Initiative.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cost offsets/effectiveness will be measured as number of outpatient HIV/general primary and specialty care; number of mental health and substance abuse treatment visits and stays. Measures will involve electronic data sets for outpatient HIV primary and specialty care; and data sets for mental health and substance abuse treatment visits/stays.</description>
