  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a major public health problem and is the main cancer disease in women&#xD;
      worldwide and in Europe. In Portugal it is the most common cancer, the third cause of cancer&#xD;
      death, following the European trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer (BC) triggers a myriad of physical and psychosocial stressors with&#xD;
      repercussions on quality of life (QoL). This study is a pioneering Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Trial (RCT) in Portugal, which seeks to study the impact of a hedonic aroma during&#xD;
      chemotherapy on women with breast cancer (3, 6 and 9 weeks, and 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy). To this end, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the groups. The&#xD;
      experimental group (EG) will be exposed to chemotherapy together with a hedonic aroma, while&#xD;
      the control group (CG) will only be exposed to chemotherapy. Both groups will be assessed on&#xD;
      psychological morbidity, illness perception, self-efficacy for coping, executive function,&#xD;
      cortisol levels, side-effects, beliefs about chemotherapy and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a hedonic aroma on the clinical, emotional&#xD;
      and neurocognitive variables that contribute to reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      promoting QoL in women with BC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample is non-probabilistic, consisting of 56 participants in the control group (CG) and&#xD;
      56 in the experimental group (EG). According to the calculations made for RCT studies&#xD;
      (Noordzij et al., 2010), it will take approximately a total of 100 participants (50&#xD;
      participants per group) to detect a 10-point difference between the groups in the result&#xD;
      variable QoL (e.g. EORCT QLQ-C30), with a population standard deviation of 15.43, according&#xD;
      to previous study data (Lua et al., 2015), assuming a power of 90% and a significance level&#xD;
      of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study contemplates four moments of evaluation: T1 (baseline: 2nd Cycle of CT but before&#xD;
      intervention), T2 (6 weeks - 3rd Cycle), T3 (9 weeks - 4th Cycle) and T4 (3 months after the&#xD;
      end of the CT). These moments were chosen taking into account the classes of drugs used in&#xD;
      the CT. Each cycle has an interval of 21. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT) being single blind (the participant does not know which group he belongs to, only the&#xD;
      investigator) and longitudinal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the 2nd. Chemotherapy cycle (T1), the GC received the standard chemotherapy treatment;&#xD;
      while the EG, in addition to the standard chemotherapy treatment, inhaled a hedonic aroma&#xD;
      selected at the time of the chemotherapy (among three types of essential oils: bergamot,&#xD;
      exotic verbena and geranium). The participant, as she received the CT, would inhale the aroma&#xD;
      in a phased manner and under the supervision of the researcher, until the end of the&#xD;
      treatment (about two hours). This intervention took place over three cycles of CT (2nd, 3rd&#xD;
      and 4th Cycles). Inhalation was carried out using cotton rolls impregnated with the selected&#xD;
      oil, since the more directly the odoriferous molecules are applied to the nose, the greater&#xD;
      their impact into the organism (Schneider, 2016). However, since it was necessary that the&#xD;
      researcher supervised the participants during the inhalation process, the number of times the&#xD;
      researcher was in contact with participants from both groups (GC and EG) were the same: 4&#xD;
      times during the chemotherapy treatment to assure the participants from the EG would not have&#xD;
      more contacts what could bias the results.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>On each moment of data collection, the researcher will apply the evaluation protocol to the participant regardless of the group and before chemotherapy treatment. Regarding the psychophysiological variable, each participant's saliva will be collected using salivettesÂ®, while cortisol concentrations will be analyzed through ELISA kits. At the time of the sample collection, before the CT, the participant who accepted to participate and fulfilled the inclusion criteria will be provided with three salivettes and an explanatory leaflet so that, on the day before the 2nd Cycle, they can collect their own saliva, around 23h, and on the day of CT, on waking up and thirty minutes after, fasting. This process will be replicated throughout the remaining evaluation moments. Subsequently, it is also our goal to evaluate the cortisol levels to CT by performing one collection of saliva before and another thirty minutes after CT.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Assessment instruments: Beliefs about chemotherapy (BMQ, Horne, Weinman, &amp; Hankins, 1997; Pereira, Pedras, &amp; Machado, 2013). This instrument is composed of 18 items and comprises two sections: BMQ - Specific and BMQ-General. In this study, only the specific section was used regarding chemotherapy. The BMQ - Specific section incorporates two sub-scales of five items each: Specific Needs and Specific Concerns related to the dangers of dependence and toxicity and concerns regarding long-term side effects, respectively. The total on the Specific Needs Scale ranges from 5 to 25 and on the Specific Concerns Scale from 5 to 25. Higher scores in each subscale indicate stronger beliefs regarding the need of treatment and regarding concerns towards the treatment, respectively.</description>
