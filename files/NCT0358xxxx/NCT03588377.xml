      The study assesses and compares the effect of 'pulse oximetry' (PO) used by Lady Health&#xD;
      Workers (LHWs) at household level on increasing hospital referral acceptance rates in&#xD;
      intervention clusters (district Jamshoro) for 0-59 months old children with severe pneumonia&#xD;
      with the effect of LHWs using clinical signs alone in non-intervention clusters of the same&#xD;
      district.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia accounts for an estimated 18% of under-5 mortality across the globe. Majority of&#xD;
      these pneumonia-specific deaths occur in 15 countries, in which Pakistan ranks fifth. Failure&#xD;
      to seek early care and delays in hospital referral are commonly acknowledged determinants of&#xD;
      mortality in childhood pneumonia with a higher proportion reported from rural settings than&#xD;
      urban. Acceptance rates of 'facilitated' hospital referral advice have been reported as low&#xD;
      as 8-23% for sick young infants in peri-urban Karachi. They are even lower for&#xD;
      non-facilitated referral in rural settings in children under five with severe pneumonia in&#xD;
      rural settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxemia is an important sign of cardio-respiratory compromise in acutely ill children with&#xD;
      a reported prevalence of 5.9%-58.9% in children aged 0-59 months from facilities and&#xD;
      16.1%-38.7% from community settings. Pulse oximetry (PO) is a rapid, portable, non-invasive,&#xD;
      and accurate method of measuring arterial hemoglobin oxygenation (Sp02), and has therefore&#xD;
      been used in the trial and clinical settings to detect hypoxemia. According to literature,&#xD;
      mortality increases 4.3 times in children with pneumonia and hypoxemia than in those without&#xD;
      hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that hypoxemia is a valuable sign of severe and very severe pneumonia&#xD;
      in children 0-59 months and early identification at the community level followed by&#xD;
      appropriate management with supplemental oxygen and antibiotics at the facility will improve&#xD;
      acceptance of hospital referral and clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims and design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the study is to assess if detection of hypoxemia and/or severe pneumonia&#xD;
      in children 0-59 months by LHWs during their monthly home visits will increase hospital&#xD;
      referral acceptance among families in District Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess and compare the impact of 'pulse oximetry' used by LHWs at household level on&#xD;
           increasing hospital referral acceptance rates in intervention clusters (district&#xD;
           Jamshoro) for 0-59 months old children with severe pneumonia with the impact of LHWs&#xD;
           using clinical signs alone in non-intervention clusters of the same district&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the likely predictors (demographic, clinical) of hospital referral&#xD;
           acceptance in both the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare clinical outcomes (treatment completion, treatment failure, hypoxemia) of&#xD;
           children 0-59 months who accepted referral to those who refused admission and were&#xD;
           treated at home&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining a cluster as (the catchment area of ) one Lady Health Worker (LHW), and assuming a&#xD;
      power of 80% in detecting 15% increase in referral acceptance from a baseline 10% to 25%&#xD;
      among 0-59 month old children with severe pneumonia (pneumonia prevalence at 2-week recall&#xD;
      (MICS Sindh):7.5% (18% of which is assumed severe) a total of 116 clusters/LHWs will be&#xD;
      selected from both intervention and control areas to capture 4160 children overall with&#xD;
      severe pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods: An enhanced acute respiratory infections training module will be developed&#xD;
      with training videos emphasizing classification of acute respiratory infections according to&#xD;
      the new WHO algorithm, use of pulse oximeters to identify hypoxemia, identification of danger&#xD;
      signs with addition of hypoxemia as a danger sign in intervention clusters, case management&#xD;
      of pneumonia at home with oral amoxicillin and severe pneumonia with stat dose of antibiotic&#xD;
      before referral to hospital. The faculty members of the Department of Pediatrics and Child&#xD;
      Health at Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan will lead these training sessions with&#xD;
      trainers of the LHW program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention delivery Children aged 0-59 months with cough and/or difficult breathing during&#xD;
      regular home visit will be assessed by LHWs for signs and symptoms of severe pneumonia (fast&#xD;
      breathing/chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign (unable to eat/drink, vomiting,&#xD;
      convulsion and lethargy/unconsciousness) and/or Stridor)) and hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;92%) using a&#xD;
      handheld pulse oximeter (Masimo Rad-5v) to measure blood oxygen level. LHWs will also do case&#xD;
      management of children with pneumonia and severe pneumonia. A 3-day course of oral&#xD;
      amoxicillin will be given to children with pneumonia at home, whereas children with severe&#xD;
      pneumonia and or hypoxemia (eligible for recruitment) will be requested for informed consent&#xD;
      and offered stat dose of oral amoxicillin and referral to nearest referral hospital (DHQ&#xD;
      Kotri).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators will have provided these pulse oximeters to the LHW Program in&#xD;
      advance and highlighted which ones will receive them. Physicians at the referral center&#xD;
      serving the intervention clusters will also receive handheld pulse oximeters. All the LHWs&#xD;
      and staff will be trained on the use, and maintenance of these pulse oximeters. Children with&#xD;
      severe pneumonia with or without hypoxemia will be advised to go to hospital for antibiotics&#xD;
      and oxygen, using the PO reading as a tool to convince parents. Name of the pre-designated&#xD;
      health facility with available oxygen and study physician will be provided to all the LHWs so&#xD;
      that follow up visits can be made to ensure the patient receives safe and recommended care at&#xD;
      referral facility. Project staff will pretest and regularly monitor PO accuracy and quality&#xD;
      of readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxemia will be defined as an arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;92%. SpO2 measurement will&#xD;
      be recorded after 1 minute of stable observation. If the SpO2 comes 92% or less, the child&#xD;
      will first be assessed for nasal obstruction with readings repeated after applying nasal&#xD;
      saline drops. If repeat reading shows hypoxemia, the child will be referred to nearest&#xD;
      designated referral hospital and admitted for oxygen via nasal or nasopharyngeal route and&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics, as per recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of active control: Clinical Signs assessment Children aged 0-59 months with&#xD;
      cough and/or difficult breathing during regular home visit will be assessed by LHWs for signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of severe pneumonia (fast breathing/chest in-drawing and one or more danger sign&#xD;
      (unable to eat/drink, vomiting, convulsion and lethargy/unconsciousness) and/or Stridor)). A&#xD;
      3-day course of oral amoxicillin will be given to children with pneumonia at home, whereas&#xD;
      children with severe pneumonia (eligible for recruitment) will be requested for informed&#xD;
      consent and offered stat dose of oral amoxicillin and referral to nearest referral hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure at referral facility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who accept hospital referral in both intervention and control clusters, and reach&#xD;
      hospital premises with LHW referral slip will be assessed by study nurse/physician at the&#xD;
      referral center. An SMS notification with brief details of referred child will have been&#xD;
      provided to trained study personnel (study physician/nurse) in advance at time of referral at&#xD;
      both the referral facilities. Children with severe pneumonia and/or hypoxemia as per LHWs who&#xD;
      reach referral hospital premises will be examined and subjected to pulse oximetry again by&#xD;
      the study physician at referral facility. If signs and symptoms of severe pneumonia is&#xD;
      present, the child will be admitted for further appropriate treatment (Oxygen therapy via&#xD;
      nasal or nasopharyngeal route and intravenous antibiotics etc.) and if the symptoms are not&#xD;
      severe (absence of danger sign), the child will be treated in outpatient care as per the&#xD;
      standard of referral facility. All the children admitted at referral facility will undergo 12&#xD;
      hourly monitoring by study personnel and filling of case reporting form (CRF) and hospital&#xD;
      physician form (HPF) at day 1 of visit. Those children who refused the referral will be&#xD;
      visited by study community health workers after 24 hours to confirm referral refusal and to&#xD;
      fill CRF. All the children will be again be visited by the study staff at day 7 and 14 to&#xD;
      collect data of follow-up form.&#xD;
