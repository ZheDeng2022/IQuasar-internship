  <brief_summary>

      The study aims to identify novel monogenic phenotypes from specific pedigrees and discover&#xD;
      the underlying causal genetic variant using genetic sequencing (Sanger and/or Next Generation&#xD;
      Sequencing - Panel/WES/WGS) methodologies in families across the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monogenic disorders result from a single defective gene and are inherited according to&#xD;
      Mendel's Laws (Mendelian disorders). Such gene defects arise from a mutation that can either&#xD;
      be inherited or occur spontaneously; both may occur in the absence of a previous family&#xD;
      history. Inherited mutations can be dominant or recessive, and autosomal or sex-linked.&#xD;
      According to WHO, although individually rare, collectively monogenic disorders affect&#xD;
      millions of people worldwide. Currently, over 10,000 human diseases are estimated to be&#xD;
      monogenic. Until recently the identification of the genetic causes, especially of extremely&#xD;
      rare phenotypes, has not been possible or cost effective due to the scientific challenges of&#xD;
      identifying causative mutations through linkage analysis. The advent of cost effective next&#xD;
      generation sequencing now facilitates the identification of all rare variants across the&#xD;
      whole genome, in turn allowing mutation identification in small families and, if de novo,&#xD;
      even in single cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical application of single gene sequencing potentially provides tangible benefits to&#xD;
      patients, informing diagnosis and prognosis, and may guide treatment choice. Next generation&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS) panels sequence multiple genes in parallel and are now entering the clinical&#xD;
      domain. NGS provides significant advantages over single gene sequencing for conditions which&#xD;
      are genetically heterogeneous, such as the epilepsies. However, as more genes are included in&#xD;
      an NGS panel, the possibility of incidental findings rises significantly, with associated&#xD;
      challenges in result interpretation. Since many conditions are phenotypically as well as&#xD;
      genetically heterogeneous, acquisition of detailed phenotypic information is essential for&#xD;
      meaningful interpretation of NGS results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monogenic (Mendelian) disorders have historically provided the clearest means of elucidating&#xD;
      human gene function. The linkage of a rare DNA variant to altered protein function or dose to&#xD;
      discrete phenotype has important implications for fundamental biology, monogenic disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis, complex traits, diagnostics and therapy. By representing the most readily&#xD;
      interpretable component of human genetics in defining a clear, high-penetrance phenotype&#xD;
      arising from alteration in function of a single gene, study of monogenic disorders can&#xD;
      identify the genetic basis for novel or existing phenotypes and provide insights into&#xD;
      non-redundant biological pathways that may inform therapeutic targeting for both the specific&#xD;
      rare variant and common diseases. Accordingly the primary purpose of this programme is to&#xD;
      identify novel monogenic phenotypes and discover underlying causal genetic variants by&#xD;
      genetic sequencing in families across the UAE.&#xD;
