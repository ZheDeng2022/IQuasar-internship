    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a drug that stimulates the immune system to fight lung cancer. Durvalumab is&#xD;
      FDA approved to treat lung cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a newer&#xD;
      radiation treatment that gives fewer, but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With SBRT, radiation is focused toward the cancer and away from normal surrounding lung&#xD;
      tissue. It is possible that when cancer cells are damaged by SBRT Durvalumab may be more&#xD;
      effective in activating the immune system. SBRT is a standard FDA approved treatment for&#xD;
      early stage (stage 1) lung cancer and is investigational in patients such as yourself with&#xD;
      stage 3 lung cancer. The combination of Durvalumab and SBRT is investigational. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the effects, good and bad, of the combination of Durvalumab and SBRT.&#xD;
