  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and effect on infant immune responses of a single dose of Tetanus diphtheria&#xD;
      acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in pregnant women in Mali. 200 healthy pregnant women,&#xD;
      ages 18 through 39 years, inclusive, who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Tdap (BOOSTRIX) or Tetanus diphtheria toxoid (Td)&#xD;
      at 14 0/7 weeks through 26 6/7 weeks estimated Gestational Age (GA). For the fetuses of&#xD;
      pregnant subjects, GA will be established by ultrasound, whenever possible, in combination&#xD;
      with date of last menstrual period (LMP), when available, and fundal height. Study duration&#xD;
      is 21 months: approximately 2 months in the start-up period, 6 months enrolling subjects, and&#xD;
      13 months (3-7 months while pregnant and 6 months postpartum) from last subject vaccinated&#xD;
      until she and her infant complete follow-up. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of BOOSTRIX in&#xD;
      pregnant women; 2) to assess the safety of a single maternal BOOSTRIX vaccination on the&#xD;
      fetus and infant; 3) to assess the level of Pertussis Toxin (PT) antibody at birth among&#xD;
      infants whose mothers received a single dose of BOOSTRIX or Td while pregnant.&#xD;

      infants whose mothers received a single dose of BOOSTRIX or Td while pregnant. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are: 1) to assess the antibody response to BOOSTRIX vaccine antigens in pregnant&#xD;
      women one month after receipt of BOOSTRIX, at the time of delivery, and at 6 months after&#xD;
      delivery; 2) to compare the antibody levels of BOOSTRIX vaccine antigens at birth (cord&#xD;
      blood) and 6 weeks of age (before receiving any infant doses of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and&#xD;
      whole-cell Pertussis (DTwP)) in infants whose mothers received BOOSTRIX or Td during&#xD;
      pregnancy; 3) to assess placental antibody transfer by determining the ratio of maternal and&#xD;
      infant BOOSTRIX -specific antibody responses at delivery; 4) to assess interference with&#xD;
      infant antibody responses to DTwP either prior to the second dose of the primary DTwP series,&#xD;
      at approximately 10 weeks of age (in 1/2 of subjects), or approximately one month after the&#xD;
      third dose of the primary DTwP series, at approximately 18 weeks of age (in 1/2 of subjects),&#xD;
      and at 6 months of age (all subjects).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy pregnant woman 18-39 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Singleton fetus, with estimated gestational age of 14 0/7 through 26 6/7 weeks&#xD;
             gestation, inclusive, on the day of study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Provide written consent after the nature of the study has been explained according to&#xD;
             local regulatory requirements and prior to any study procedures*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Prior to obtaining individual informed consent for each subject, the investigators&#xD;
             will obtain community consent by discussing the trial with all the appropriate local&#xD;
             groups, as necessary, to obtain permission to approach the subjects. Written, informed&#xD;
             consent for participation in the trial will be obtained by the investigators from all&#xD;
             individual subjects. The consent forms will be written in French, the official&#xD;
             language of Mali, and will be translated into Bambara, the most prevalent of the local&#xD;
             languages, and recorded on audiotape.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In good health as determined by medical history, targeted physical examination*&#xD;
             (physical examination performed as part of routine antenatal care of a study-specific&#xD;
             brief exam may be used to determine eligibility), vital signs (oral temperature &lt; 37.8&#xD;
             degrees Celsius; pulse 55 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), inclusive; systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure 90 to 140 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), inclusive; diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
             55 to 90 mm Hg, inclusive), and clinical judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *If indicated based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic&#xD;
             medical diagnoses or conditions that would affect the assessment of eligibility and&#xD;
             safety of subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions being actively managed&#xD;
             must be within acceptable limits in the last 180 days. Any prescription change that is&#xD;
             due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for&#xD;
             financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered&#xD;
             a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to&#xD;
             improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or&#xD;
             appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion&#xD;
             criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose&#xD;
             no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and&#xD;
             immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition.&#xD;
             Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and the study vaccination are&#xD;
             acceptable provided the subject is asymptomatic, condition stable, and there is no&#xD;
             additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to the&#xD;
             study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability to comprehend and comply with all study procedures, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator determining eligibility, and availability for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to allow study staff to gather pertinent medical information, including&#xD;
             pregnancy outcome data and medical information about her infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of illness or an ongoing illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             pose additional risk to the subject or her fetus if she participates in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infection requiring systemic antibiotics or antiviral treatment within the 7 days&#xD;
             prior to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fever (oral temperature &gt; / = 37.8 degrees Celsius/100.0 degrees Fahrenheit) or other&#xD;
             acute illness within 3 days prior to study vaccination*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining&#xD;
             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess&#xD;
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), anticancer&#xD;
             chemotherapy, or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study&#xD;
             vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of any hematologic malignancy at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A history of a serious adverse event following previous immunizations (e.g., Bell's&#xD;
             Palsy, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, encephalopathy), or history of progressive neurologic&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known or suspected disease that impairs the immune system including known or suspected&#xD;
             HIV infection or HIV-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, including long-term use of glucocorticoids:&#xD;
             oral, inhaled, intranasal or parenteral prednisone &gt; / = 20 mg/day or equivalent for&#xD;
             more than 2 weeks within the 30 days prior to enrollment. Use of topical&#xD;
             corticosteroids is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, by history or medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Behavioral or cognitive impairment or psychiatric disease (includes hospitalization&#xD;
             for psychiatric illness, suicide attempt, or confinement for danger to self or others&#xD;
             within 10 years prior to study vaccination) that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 5 years prior to study vaccination&#xD;
             (that is believed by the site investigator to potentially interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of the study vaccine (formaldehyde,&#xD;
             alum).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of&#xD;
             BOOSTRIX or any other vaccine directed against tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Receipt or planned receipt of any live licensed vaccine within 30 days before or after&#xD;
             vaccination or any inactivated licensed vaccine within 14 days before or after&#xD;
             vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Receipt of immunoglobulin (except RhoGAM, which is allowed) or other blood products&#xD;
             within 90 days prior to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Receipt of an experimental agent or device within 30 days prior to vaccination, or the&#xD;
             expected receipt of an experimental agent* (other than BOOSTRIX) during this&#xD;
             trial-reporting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Experimental agents include vaccines, drugs, biologics, devices, blood products, and&#xD;
             medications. Subjects who have received a licensed product, as a subject in a clinical&#xD;
             trial, within 30 days prior to vaccination or who are expecting to enroll in such a&#xD;
             trial during the study period will also be excluded. Observational studies, surveys,&#xD;
             and other studies that do not involve experimental agents or devices are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. High risk for serious obstetrical complication (refer to ACOG Practice Bulletins for&#xD;
             definitions, as necessary)*.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Including the following: (a) gestational hypertension (well controlled history of&#xD;
             essential or gestational hypertension, as evidenced by normal BPs as defined above, is&#xD;
             allowed), (b) gestational diabetes not controlled by diet and exercise (the use of&#xD;
             insulin or glyburide to control gDM, at the time of enrollment, is exclusionary), (c)&#xD;
             current pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, (d) known current multiple gestation, (e)history&#xD;
             of preterm delivery before EGA 35 weeks 0 days or current preterm labor, and/or (f)&#xD;
             known intrauterine fetal growth restriction (defined as ultrasound confirmation of an&#xD;
             estimated fetal weight that is less than the 10th percentile for gestational age).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Pregnant with a fetus with a known or suspected major congenital anomaly or genetic&#xD;
             abnormality.&#xD;
