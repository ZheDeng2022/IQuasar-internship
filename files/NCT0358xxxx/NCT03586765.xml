      Assess prevalence of urinary functional disorders in women of 40 and more, visiting a general&#xD;
      practitioner, occupational medicine or health examination center in Puy-de-Dôme. Study&#xD;
      conducted for a month using a self-filled survey distributed by secretaries or nurses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of urinary incontinence is clinical. Three types of urinary incontinence are&#xD;
      described: urinary stress incontinence, urinary incontinence by overactive bladder or mixed&#xD;
      urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To standardize the medical examination and to precise the urinary incontinence type, the use&#xD;
      of a validated questionnaire is recommended (USP), the quality of life's resounding also must&#xD;
      be assessing, using questionnaire of quality of life valid in French (ICIQ®, CONTILIFE®…)&#xD;
      Several medical cares exist, but patients often don't know it. Unhappily, it is still a taboo&#xD;
      subject. In a French medical study, conducted in 1992 by 60 general practitioners, of a total&#xD;
      of 2911 female patients, 37% said they had urinary disorders. Among them, 77% said they had&#xD;
      symptoms during an effort, 57% had urinary urge incontinence and 35 % had spontaneous leaks.&#xD;
      One in five women had three associated disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a French study conducted in 2005, it appeared that women talked to their general&#xD;
      practitioner about urinary disorders only four or five times out of ten, and six times out of&#xD;
      ten when they used panty liners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are eloquent, but the data is not recent, and the investigators need some, to&#xD;
      propose better cares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This medical study will be conducted during one month. Two self-filled questionnaires will be&#xD;
      distributed by nurses or medical secretary, working at recruited general practitioner's&#xD;
      place, to every female patient who will be 40 years old or more, coming for themselves or&#xD;
      accompanying somebody else (children for example). Every female patient will have to fill&#xD;
      both questionnaires alone, anonymously, and will have to let them in a closed box, in the&#xD;
      waiting room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two self-filled questionnaires are called USP and CONTILIFE. They are both validated to&#xD;
      evaluate symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional question about existence of fecal incontinence (and its type), and the reasons why&#xD;
      patients didn't talk about it with their general practitioner spontaneously (shame, absence&#xD;
      of information about cares, fatality…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior visit of each recruited service by Julie de la Roque, to explain the goals of the&#xD;
      study, to general practitioners, nurses and medical secretaries.&#xD;

    <description>A difference will be made between urinary stress incontinence and overactive bladder. Each disorder is characterized by a score (not available for patients). The doctor will calculate the score for each one ( from 0 to 9 for urinary stress incontinence, and from 0 to 21 for urinary incontinence by overactive bladder ). A disorder will be considered positive if it is greater than or equal to 1.</description>
