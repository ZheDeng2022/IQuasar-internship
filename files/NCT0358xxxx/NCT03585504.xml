  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate whether insertion of a long-acting&#xD;
      contraceptive implant in postpartum adolescents prior to hospital discharge increases use of&#xD;
      this highly effective contraception during the first twelve months postpartum among&#xD;
      adolescents who elect Implanon® as their preferred method of contraception. Additionally,&#xD;
      this study aims to compare the acceptability of bleeding in postpartum adolescents who have&#xD;
      an etonogestrel contraceptive implant prior to discharge versus those with insertion at the&#xD;
      six week postpartum visit. The investigators will evaluate the acceptability of bleeding&#xD;
      rather than collect prospective diaries because the investigators feel subjective perceptions&#xD;
      of bleeding impact contraceptive continuation more than quantitative differences in bleeding.&#xD;

      Study Design and Subject Recruitment The investigators propose a prospective randomized trial&#xD;
      comparing immediate postpartum insertion of Implanon® versus insertion at the standard six&#xD;
      week postpartum visit in adolescents. Recruitment will occur on our postpartum ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will approach all eligible women on the postpartum ward to offer&#xD;
      comprehensive contraceptive counseling including information about Implanon® as well as other&#xD;
      methods. Those who choose Implanon® will be screened for eligibility and consented for&#xD;
      participation in the study. If a subject is under 18 years of age, the investigators will&#xD;
      obtain parental consent from at least one parent or legal guardian as well as assent from the&#xD;
      adolescent participant according to our IRB guidelines. Those who are not interested in&#xD;
      participation will be provided with a standard postpartum appointment for insertion. Based on&#xD;
      our volume of adolescent deliveries, the investigators anticipate to complete enrollment&#xD;
      within 1 year and follow-up within two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Women will be eligible for enrollment if they are 21 years&#xD;
      old or younger, English or Spanish speaking, less than 120 hours (5 days) postpartum after&#xD;
      either vaginal or cesarean delivery, primiparous or multiparous, and breast and/or&#xD;
      bottle-feeding. Women will be excluded from enrollment if they have contraindications to&#xD;
      Implanon® insertion including current or prior thrombo-embolic disease, liver disease,&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to components of Implanon®, or are using medications such as rifampin,&#xD;
      phenytoin, or carbamazepine that increase metabolism of steroid hormones. Women will also be&#xD;
      excluded if they indicate unwillingness to continue follow-up for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After consent is obtained, each participant will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      groups. The study coordinator will open opaque sealed envelopes containing group assignment&#xD;
      in sequence. The envelopes will be prepared by a research staff member not involved in&#xD;
      recruitment or analysis prior to start of enrollment. The randomization scheme will utilize&#xD;
      permuted blocks of sizes four and six. The intervention group will undergo Implanon®&#xD;
      insertion prior to hospital discharge per package instructions. For those randomized to this&#xD;
      group, the study coordinator will notify the physician on call to ensure insertion prior to&#xD;
      discharge. This will not prolong hospital stay. The control group will receive an appointment&#xD;
      to undergo Implanon® insertion at the postpartum visit occurring approximately six weeks&#xD;
      after delivery as is standard care in our institution. In addition to standard counseling to&#xD;
      avoid sexual intercourse for six weeks, all participants will be counseled about condom use&#xD;
      for prevention of both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up At the time of enrollment, each participant will complete a questionnaire to&#xD;
      collect information about sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and reproductive history,&#xD;
      contraceptive history, bleeding expectations, breast feeding intentions, and prior sexual&#xD;
      education experiences. Each participant will be provided with a notice of study participation&#xD;
      to give their provider at their postpartum follow-up visit but there will not be contact&#xD;
      between study staff and participants at the six week postpartum visit. Each participant will&#xD;
      be contacted by telephone at three, six, and twelve months postpartum. Follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered at this time to assess use of Implanon® since delivery,&#xD;
      use of other highly effective and less effective contraceptive methods, the acceptability of&#xD;
      bleeding experiences, and the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Outcome is the proportion of participants in each group using Implanon® at six&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Outcomes Contraceptive Use and Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants using Implanon at three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants using Implanon at twelve months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants using another highly effective method at three, six, and&#xD;
           twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Intrauterine contraception and sterilization will be considered highly effective in this&#xD;
      study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants using a less effective method at three, six, and twelve&#xD;
           months. (DMPA, combined hormonal oral contraception, vaginal ring, transdermal patch,&#xD;
           progestin only pills, and barrier methods will be considered less effective methods in&#xD;
           this study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants practicing abstinence at three, six, and twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;

           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for non-use of Implanon at three, six, and twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for non-use of any method at three, six, and twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy rate in each group at twelve months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Bleeding Acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding expectations prior to insertion of Implanon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of bleeding perceptions to pre-insertion expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants who cite bleeding irregularities as a reason for non-use at&#xD;
           three, six, and twelve months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with bleeding on Likert scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Overall Acceptability 5 of 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion at three, six, and twelve months willing to use Implanon again after another&#xD;
           delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion at three, six, and twelve months willing to recommend Implanon to a friend&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Breast Feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants in each group planning to breastfeed at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of participants breast feeding at three, six, and twelve months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of breast feeding in weeks by participant report&#xD;
