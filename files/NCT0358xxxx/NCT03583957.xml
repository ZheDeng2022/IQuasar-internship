      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the devices ability: (1) to record&#xD;
      wireless EEG from patients in the long-term EEG monitoring unit (2) compare wireless EEG in&#xD;
      these recordings to standard-of-care wired EEG (3) to record wireless EEG from patients&#xD;
      undergoing ambulatory EEG monitoring (4) compare wireless EEG in these recordings to the&#xD;
      ambulatory EEG findings (5) develop automated seizure detection algorithms based on the data&#xD;
      collected herein (6) develop real-time seizure alerting based on the data collected herein&#xD;
      (7) record longitudinal EEG from Epilog outside of the epilepsy monitoring unit while&#xD;
      patients answer daily questions through a mobile app designed to provide a probability of the&#xD;
      patient having a seizure event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used to accurately detect seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used to alert to seizures in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used along with psychological,&#xD;
           behavioral, and environmental input to a mobile app to create an hourly forecast of&#xD;
           seizure probability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is a relatively expensive, time-consuming, inpatient&#xD;
      monitoring procedure that can require several days to complete. It is designed to aid&#xD;
      epileptologists in the diagnosis and localization of seizures and other abnormalities. EEG&#xD;
      monitoring outside of the clinic is limited to bulky and cumbersome ambulatory monitoring&#xD;
      systems that are prone to a variety of noise artifacts outside of the controlled confines of&#xD;
      the long-term EEG monitoring (LTM) unit. An effective wireless EEG solution could improve&#xD;
      long-term (continuous) EEG recordings. Importantly, long-term EEG monitoring outside of the&#xD;
      hospital could yield important data regarding the general brain state, including seizure&#xD;
      occurrence, in a realistic at-home setting. There is a clear need for a small, easy to use,&#xD;
      reliable, wireless device for human EEG monitoring to aid in the treatment of a patients&#xD;
      seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are frequently referred to the long-term epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) in order to&#xD;
      evaluate a suspect underlying neurological condition that may manifest through EEG and is a&#xD;
      common procedure. Despite its clinical significance and the desire to minimize the time spent&#xD;
      in the hospital, there is a gap in the ability to maintain a quantifiable report of EEG&#xD;
      activity in the patients home environment. In general, patients diagnosed with a seizure&#xD;
      disorder are asked to keep a seizure diary that is designed to aid the clinician in&#xD;
      diagnosis. Patient self reporting of seizures with a seizure diary is often unreliable up to&#xD;
      55% of all seizures can be missed, and still others go misreported [1-3]. This is especially&#xD;
      true of the developmentally delayed population where the burden of self-reporting seizures is&#xD;
      often placed upon a care giver. Most seizures are non-convulsive and can be relatively&#xD;
      subtle. It is extremely important for effective treatment to know how an anticonvulsant is&#xD;
      affecting a patients seizures, particularly focal seizures. Often, seizures are amnesic and&#xD;
      unless someone else recognizes the clinical signs of the seizure, it may go unnoticed[4].&#xD;
      Many seizures can occur at night or while a patient is sleepy or stressed [5-7] further&#xD;
      making the detection of seizures difficult. Obtaining an accurate report of such&#xD;
      unrecognizable seizures is difficult for persons with epilepsy and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of acute electrographic seizures could lead to more-effective application of&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches to block or minimize brain damage. Over 30% of patients with epilepsy&#xD;
      have intractable seizures that are difficult to manage, are an immense financial burden to&#xD;
      the person with epilepsy and their family, and drastically reduce quality of life [8, 9].&#xD;
      Thus, there remains a need to obtain quantifiable, continuous EEG records after a diagnosis&#xD;
      of epilepsy. This study will allow the development of automated seizure detection, alerting,&#xD;
      and prediction algorithms based on Epitel's Epilog single-channel, wireless EEG sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will evaluate an individual-use, patch-type telemetry sensor for simplified,&#xD;
      single-channel EEG recording from human patients. This sensor can be applied in a simple&#xD;
      fashion to the scalp allowing real-time recording of the EEG signal on the sensor. This&#xD;
      relatively small unit, roughly the size of a thick Band-Aid is self-contained, water&#xD;
      resistant, and powered by a watch battery. The sensor is compact and would be applied and/or&#xD;
      shown how to use during a clinical visit. The sensor is noninvasive and is attached to the&#xD;
      patient by external placement on intact skin below hairline with a one-piece, one-day-use&#xD;
      disposable conductive-adhesive sticker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is both a prospective, un-blinded, observational study as well as a prospective&#xD;
      un-blinded interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the inpatient unit, the findings of standard wired EEG will be compared to the findings&#xD;
      of wireless EEG recording device to develop a training dataset for machine learning&#xD;
      algorithms for automated seizure detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the outpatient unit, the characteristics of the EEG recorded with be combined with&#xD;
      psychological, behavioral, and environmental input by the patient in a mobile app that then&#xD;
      provides an hourly probability (percent change) of having a seizure in the next hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed patient population for this study involves pediatric patients, ages 5-17. The&#xD;
      consideration of the pediatric population as a vulnerable population for participation in&#xD;
      this study has been taken into account in determining the appropriateness of this protocol.&#xD;
      This study will specifically provide information as to the specific needs of the pediatric&#xD;
      patient population; which is anticipated to be a significant percentage of the user&#xD;
      population of the proposed device. The risk assessment of the study anticipates that the&#xD;
      pediatric subject population will not be exposed to risks greater than the current standard&#xD;
      of care for which they are already being evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria for inpatient and outpatient unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous diagnosis of Epilepsy or other seizure disorder admitted for scheduled EEG testing,&#xD;
      5 to 17 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for the inpatient and outpatient unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known or suspected allergy to adhesives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to four Epilog single-channel EEG sensors will be placed alongside gold-standard wired EEG&#xD;
      in the epilepsy monitoring unit. Each sensor (1&quot; x 1&quot; x 1/4&quot;, 6.6 g) is attached to the scalp&#xD;
      below hairline with a one-piece conductive adhesive sticker consisting of a hypoalergenic&#xD;
      hydrocolloid and hydrogel. Sensors are placed in roughly the F7, F8, TP9, or TP10 electrode&#xD;
      locations in the international 10-10 system. Epilog is constructed of a circuit board with&#xD;
      built-in gold EEG recording electrodes attached to both ends. The sensors are then be sealed&#xD;
      and packaged in the form of a pliable medical-grade silicone, and be designed to have a low&#xD;
      profile, such that it will not be easily dislodged or be uncomfortable to the user. The&#xD;
      wireless EEG device is powered by a single lithium watch battery (CR2016, 270mW) sealed&#xD;
      within the sensor to IPX3. The Epilog sensors only use batteries approved to IEC-60086-4.&#xD;
      Epilog transmits EEG through secure Bluetooth when interacting with the mobile app.&#xD;
      Otherwise, Epilog is capable of storing 10 consecutive days of EEG when the Bluetooth radio&#xD;
      is disabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once activated, the sensor begins transmitting and/or data logging the signal. The clinician&#xD;
      can connect the device to the USB port of an HIPAA-approved, password protected laptop or&#xD;
      other computer device for activating the sensor and/or imputing patient study ID information&#xD;
      in the sensor and/or downloaded data off of the sensor according to the European Data Format,&#xD;
      an internationally recognized standard EEG format (www.edfplus.info). In order to visualize&#xD;
      the EEG signal in real time, a specifically-designed, mobile app can be used when Bluetooth&#xD;
      is enabled on each sensor. For outpatient use, the ability to view EEG is disabled. Data can&#xD;
      be downloaded from the device by connecting to an USB-enabled, password-protected computer.&#xD;
      An USB-based acquisition hardware, computer, and software with an EDF-file viewer will be&#xD;
      used for viewing, analyzing, and storing of EEG data according to HIPAA patient privacy&#xD;
      policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigational devices will have the following label statement: CAUTION Investigational&#xD;
      Device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sensor will also be labeled with the manufacturer, business location, quantity of&#xD;
      contents and for identification and traceability, by serial number and date of manufacture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of the sensor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sensor is suitably similar to FDA-cleared, electroencephalography devices under section&#xD;
      number 21 CFR 882.1400, identified as a device used to measure and record electrical activity&#xD;
      of the patients brain obtained by placing two or more electrodes on the head. This sensor is&#xD;
      subject to FDA Class II performance standards. This sensor route-to-market is through 510(k)&#xD;
      clearance by demonstration of substantial equivalence to a legally marketed predicate device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor Receipt:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epitel will directly deliver sensors to the Principal Investigator, who will log them on the&#xD;
      sensor accountability form in the Study Binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor Storage: Sensors are singly housed in boxes marked with the sensor serial number and a&#xD;
      label statement: CAUTION Investigational Device. Limited by Federal law to investigational&#xD;
      use. Sensors will be kept under material control in the epilepsy monitoring unit prior to and&#xD;
      after use. Sensors shall be stored at approximately room temperature, under ambient&#xD;
      conditions. There are no other special storage requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor Dispensing: Sensors will be logged on a device accountability form in the Study Binder&#xD;
      when they 1 are delivered to neurology, 2 are placed on a study patient, 3 data has been&#xD;
      downloaded from the device, 4 device data has been erased, and 5 devices have been returned&#xD;
      to and received by the Study Sponsor. This will be signed and dated by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor Disposition: After use, the study team will return sensors to the storage box/cabinet&#xD;
      after downloading the data. Data on the sensors will be erased and each sensor will be used&#xD;
      once if in-patient and only on a single patient if out-patient. Sensors will then be returned&#xD;
      to the Study Sponsor where they will be accounted for, destroyed, and properly disposed of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Return or Destruction of Sensors: Following collection of the data and sensor inspection,&#xD;
      used sensors stored at neurology with battery level below 1.4V will be returned to the Study&#xD;
      Sponsor where they will be accounted for, destroyed, and properly disposed of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent process in inpatient and outpatient units:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Consent Processes: Patients presenting to the EMU for standard-of-care procedures&#xD;
      will be recruited for this study. The Study Coordinator also maintains the responsibility of&#xD;
      contacting eligible patients physician to ask for permission to approach family and patient&#xD;
      via email. If the physician grants permission, the Study Coordinator will approach and inform&#xD;
      the patient/guardian of the opportunity to participate in this study. All participants will&#xD;
      be required to participate in the consent/assent process. The patient and legal guardians&#xD;
      will be walked through the informed consent and assent documents and will be given&#xD;
      appropriate time to ask questions on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent/assent process for all patients who meet the criteria for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be described verbally when the Study Coordinator approaches the patient and&#xD;
      family and the description will also be written in the consent document. The patients will be&#xD;
      given a chance to ask questions at any point during the enrollment process. Upon their&#xD;
      agreement to participate in the study, they will be asked to sign the consent form and give&#xD;
      verbal consent/assent. There are no external recruitment procedures for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening process: Patients will be screened by the research staff prior to their hospital&#xD;
      admission. The research staff team will review the weekly admission list and screen patients&#xD;
      for enrollment appropriateness. Once an eligible patient is selected, the research team will&#xD;
      call or email the patients asummary of the study and request approval to approach the patient&#xD;
      for consent/assent when they are admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is determined and the research team receives approval to approach, the&#xD;
      eligible patient and their family will be given a verbal description of the study by the&#xD;
      research staff and offered a chance to participate in the study. The eligible patient and&#xD;
      their family where appropriate, will be walked through the informed consent documents and&#xD;
      will be given appropriate time to ask questions on the study. After informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study is obtained, the patient will be enrolled. Patient enrollment may be&#xD;
      performed by any of the study team members, as listed in the roles/responsibilities section.&#xD;
      Patient enrollment is documented in the Study Binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored by the Epilog sensor(s) and full-montage wired EEG for patients&#xD;
      who remain in the EMU. Sensors will be placed per the neurologists direction, next to a&#xD;
      standard electrode in an area where seizures are known to occur in the event that epilepsy&#xD;
      has been previously diagnosed or suspect to occur. Written documentation on the placement&#xD;
      location(s) of each sensor alongside the standard wired EEG electrodes shall be recorded for&#xD;
      each patient. Patients will wear Epilog for as long as wired EEG is simultaneously recorded&#xD;
      (1-7 days in the EMU). For patients who are to wear Epilog continuously outside of the EMU,&#xD;
      instructions will be provided in both written, a verbal interactive demonstration, as well as&#xD;
      video of how to use Epilog and the mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After use, the Epilog sensors will be removed by gently peeling it off the scalp. For&#xD;
      out-patient use, patients and their family/caregivers are instructed to replace the&#xD;
      conductive-adhesive sticker once per day, typically while showering or bathing, or before&#xD;
      bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of this study are minimal. There is a potential risk that the patient may have an&#xD;
      adverse reaction to the conductive-adhesive gel used to fix the recording electrodes to the&#xD;
      scalp. This risk will be minimized by observing the scalp around the device daily for redness&#xD;
      or irritation that could indicate a reaction to the conductive-adhesive. Only FDA-clear&#xD;
      hypoalergenic conductive hydrogel and adhesive hydrocolloids are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no direct benefits to the patient for taking part in this study. The potential&#xD;
      benefit to clinics and patients longer term is that recording wireless EEG may prove useful&#xD;
      for determining if a single channel of wireless, long-term EEG can be used to detect, alert,&#xD;
      and predict seizure activity outside of the hospital during a patients everyday activities.&#xD;
      The EEG may also be used to determine the prevalence of normal versus abnormal sleep cycling&#xD;
      in patients, though this information will not be directly evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject withdrawal: Subjects will exit the study if any of the following conditions exist; 1)&#xD;
      Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study, 2) Subjects well-being, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      Investigator would be compromised by study continuation, 3) Subject experiences an adverse&#xD;
      event defined by the Investigator as device related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to withdraw subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may report their voluntary withdrawal to any of the contacts of the study. Any&#xD;
      study team member receiving a notification of withdrawal shall report this to the Study&#xD;
      Coordinator. If an Investigator withdraws a subject; this shall be documented in the Study&#xD;
      Binder with the reason for withdrawal. If there were any adverse events related to the&#xD;
      withdrawal, the Investigator and the Study Coordinator in their role as Safety Monitor are&#xD;
      responsible for investigating, documenting and if applicable, reporting these incidents. The&#xD;
      Study Coordinator and Principal Investigator of the study are responsible for ensuring the&#xD;
      safety of the patient in the event of withdrawal and that all dispensed devices have been&#xD;
      recovered. The withdrawal of any patient is documented in the Study Binder under participant&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks to the patient for premature withdrawal from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reasonable effort shall be made to follow-up with all study participants who withdraw from&#xD;
      the study after the time of withdrawal to ensure that there are no device related adverse&#xD;
      events. Minimally, this effort should obtain survival data on the patient. The Study&#xD;
      Coordinator is responsible for this follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment the following data will be collected as part of the study: sex, age,&#xD;
      documentation of no known skin allergy/sensitivity to adhesives (exclusionary&#xD;
      characteristic), history of epilepsy diagnosis (if applicable). During the Study, wireless&#xD;
      EEG will be obtained from the study device. For in-patient, the EEG will be recorded by&#xD;
      traditional wired procedure for the duration the study device is worn. For out-patient data,&#xD;
      daily responses to ta set of survey questions presented to the patient by the Aura app,&#xD;
      modified with PROMIS, developed by Dr. Madison Berl. Each person enrolled will answer&#xD;
      baseline survey questions that include (1) average number of hours one sleeps per-day during&#xD;
      a typical week, and (2) 10-question Perceived Stress Scale survey. Answers to these baseline&#xD;
      questions will personalize risk associated with each change from baseline over time. As the&#xD;
      out-patient study begins and enrollees wear Epilog for the 90 day period, the mobile app will&#xD;
      continue to ask behavioral and psychological survey questions as a means to effect a change&#xD;
      in the seizure forecast provided by the mobile app. The number of questions asked of the user&#xD;
      by the app will not exceed four per day to reduce burden of using the app on a daily basis.&#xD;
      Along with physiological parameters (EEG and circadian seizure susceptibility), an hourly&#xD;
      seizure forecast will be estimated and optimized post hoc. This would be a forecast the user&#xD;
      would see and could use to plan their day. Importantly, we will track how the user interacts&#xD;
      with the mobile app to determine adherence, how often the app is used, clicks, crash&#xD;
      statistics, and overall satisfaction. It may be the case where the patient enrolled begins to&#xD;
      answer questions posed by the app infrequently or not at all. To mitigate this problem the&#xD;
      app will continue to prompt the user to answer the questions if they are dismissed. If the&#xD;
      user misses two or more days, the study coordinator will contact the patient to encourage&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures for this study are seizure event times marked by epileptologists&#xD;
      as the start, end, artifacts, and seizure type during the in-patient studies. These data are&#xD;
      used to develop the automated seizure detection and alerting algorithms. For out-patient&#xD;
      studies, the patients' interaction with the mobile app, how often the app is used, clicks,&#xD;
      crash statistics, and overall satisfaction with the seizure forecast probability performance.&#xD;
