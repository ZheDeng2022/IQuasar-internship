  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the most frequent cancers in women and is the most frequent&#xD;
      cause of death in the female population. It represents 18% of all female cancers in the&#xD;
      world.1 The incidence varies in different populations with almost half of the cases having&#xD;
      their origin in North America and Western Europe. In Egypt, according to the National&#xD;
      Population-Based Cancer Registry published in 2014, BC was the most frequent cancer among&#xD;
      females representing 32% of all female cancers2 Metastatic disease occurs in approximately&#xD;
      20-50% of patients with early BC history and in 6-10% of newly diagnosed BC cases.3 Since&#xD;
      patients with metastatic BC form a heterogeneous population, treatment recommendations ought&#xD;
      to be made on an individual basis, considering hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, metastasis-free interval (MFI), response to and&#xD;
      cumulative doses of previous therapy, location and extent of metastases and symptoms 4,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two thirds of BC patients have HR-positive (HR+) tumors 6, for whom endocrine therapy (ET) is&#xD;
      the preferred initial treatment for metastatic disease as recommended in the treatment&#xD;
      guidelines, even in the presence of visceral metastases 4, 6, 7. The use of ET is supported&#xD;
      by data showing a therapeutic benefit with less toxicity and better quality of life in&#xD;
      comparison to chemotherapy (CT) 5,8,9. Nevertheless, it is generally thought that CT is&#xD;
      associated with greater and earlier tumor response, especially in the case of high burden of&#xD;
      disease. For patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2+ disease CT plus HER2-targeted&#xD;
      therapy was strongly recommended, except for highly selected cases for whom clinicians may&#xD;
      offer ET 10. On the contrary, for women with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative disease&#xD;
      who are the scope of this study the question of whether to use CT or ET as first-line&#xD;
      treatment for metastatic BC remains, to date, partially unresolved.&#xD;

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Postmenopausal women with ER positive, HER-2 negative locally advanced/ metastatic breast&#xD;
        cancer, who either progressed during or after adjuvant endocrine therapy for early breast&#xD;
        cancer or those presenting with de novo metastatic disease who had not received prior&#xD;
        endocrine therapy. Patients should have already been prescribed first line treatment for&#xD;
        their locally advanced/ metastatic breast cancer as per routine clinical practice prior to&#xD;
        their enrolment in the study. Their participation in the study should in no way impact the&#xD;
        treatment and care that they receive.&#xD;
