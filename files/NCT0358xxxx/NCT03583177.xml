  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle wasting is present in almost 50% of patients treated with chronic hemodialysis. It is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of death (particularly from cardiovascular causes) and&#xD;
      compromises quality of life (loss of autonomy and fatigue). The mechanisms leading to muscle&#xD;
      wasting in chronic kidney disease have been the subject of several studies in animals. These&#xD;
      have highlighted the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Activation of UPS during&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease is multifactorial. It is the result of resistance to the action of&#xD;
      insulin/IGF1, metabolic acidosis, low grade prolonged inflammation and increased production&#xD;
      of myostatin. To date few studies have been conducted in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to identify blood markers related to muscle protein breakdown in&#xD;
      patients undergoing hemodialysis. In parallel, the investigators want to adress the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in muscle proteolysis. In addition, the investigators want to identify&#xD;
      the proteins degraded and the ubiquitination enzymes (E2/E3 couples) specifically involved in&#xD;
      muscle loss during hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies and blood sample will beperformed during scheduled surgeries in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (negative control), cancer patients (positive control) or undergoing chronic&#xD;
      hemodialysis. RNA seq analysis will be performed in blood samples and proteomic mass&#xD;
      spectrometry analysis for establishing a specific profile between muscle and blood markers. A&#xD;
      limited subset of blood markers common to cancer and hemodialysis atrophying muscles will be&#xD;
      used for elaborating a chip dedicated to early detect an atrophying process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators will first design a diagnostic tool for detecting non-invasively&#xD;
      muscle protein breakdown before the onset of muscle atrophy. This will enable early and&#xD;
      efficient nutritional counter-measures.&#xD;

      Hypothesis Measuring urinary 3-methylhistidine is a simple tool to assess proteolysis in&#xD;
      clinical practice. However it is not totally specific of muscle proteolysis because it may&#xD;
      reflect an intestinal catabolism. Moreover, its dosage cannot be used in patients with renal&#xD;
      impairment especially in case of anuria. Apart from achieving muscle biopsy or measuring the&#xD;
      overall kinetics of proteins it does not yet exist simple and reproducible diagnostic tool&#xD;
      for measuring muscle proteolysis. With the present study, the investigators expect to&#xD;
      identify in the blood of patients a particular transcriptomic profile related to the&#xD;
      activation of muscle proteolysis, including increased proinflammatory cytokine transcripts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rodent models of CKD were used to identify major proteolytic system and signal pathway&#xD;
      implicated in muscle wasting caused by uremia. These finding needs to be confirmed in humans&#xD;
      studies. Also, other actors of muscle atrophy could be identified in humans. Notably, so far,&#xD;
      few studies have been performed in order to determine which E2 are involved in muscle&#xD;
      atrophy, and to knowledge of the investigators no one in CKD. Finally, data on muscle&#xD;
      proteasome substrates are limited since only actin was clearly identified in humans by the&#xD;
      team. The investigators expect an activation of the proteasome system with an increase in the&#xD;
      expression of enzymes E2s, E3s including MURF1 and MAFbx and proteasome subunit in patients&#xD;
      treated with hemodialysis. The investigators could also observe an activation of caspase&#xD;
      system which is thought to work in concert with the UPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods 2.1. Population The experiments will be performed using blood sample&#xD;
      and human muscle biopsies obtained during programmed orthopedic surgery (negative control),&#xD;
      cancer (positive control) and hemodialysis patients. This translational research program has&#xD;
      already been accepted (DGS 2008-A00479-46) and inclusion of patients already started. A&#xD;
      maximum of 15 patients per group will be included. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      set-up according to the objectives (absence of any pathology for controls, etc.) and the&#xD;
      legislation (written consent, etc.). Thirty-two patients have already been included so far,&#xD;
      and biopsies are stored in liquid nitrogen. Blood samples are collected just before surgery&#xD;
      using Paxgene RNA tubes and stored following the manufacturer's instructions until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Blood sample Total RNA will be extracted from blood using Paxgene RNA Extraction kit and&#xD;
      analysed by RNAseq 2.3. Muscle biopsies 2.3.1. Transcriptomic analysis Total RNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from human muscle biopsies using commercial kits. The investigators will first&#xD;
      verify that known muscles markers are up-regulated in cancer patient biopsies (positive&#xD;
      controls) and address their levels in muscle biopsies from hemodialysis patients. We will&#xD;
      thus perform qRT-PCR UBE2B, UBE2D2, MaFbx, MuRF1, Ozz, ASB2, E4B, Nedd4, Mdm2 and 26S&#xD;
      proteasome subunits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2. Proteomic analysis Proteomic analysis will be performed usin shot gun spectrometry&#xD;
      analysis&#xD;
