      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether changes in uptake of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans at baseline and after&#xD;
           6 weeks of treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, correlates with&#xD;
           radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) as defined by Prostate Cancer Working&#xD;
           Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether changes in uptake of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans correlate with&#xD;
           overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether baseline SUVmax correlate with rPFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare number of lesions detected with standard imaging at baseline and at the time&#xD;
           of progression&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths in&#xD;
      American men. The lethal form of the disease is metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC). Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing has been relied upon heavily as a&#xD;
      marker of disease and is commonly used in the community to guide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PyL, also known as [18F]DCFPyL, is a second-generation fluorinated prostate-specific membrane&#xD;
      antigen (PSMA) targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. In preliminary&#xD;
      studies it demonstrates a higher detection of metastatic prostate lesions compared to&#xD;
      standard imaging. However, the role of [18F] PyL in tumor response to therapy has not been&#xD;
      evaluated, specifically the potential to serve as a predictive biomarker of response. Given&#xD;
      the high cost of current therapeutic agents in mCRPC, there is a need for an early response&#xD;
      biomarker to stratify which patients will benefit from therapy and which will not. This will&#xD;
      also allow for earlier change in management of patients who will not response to these&#xD;
      therapies, potentially improving patient outcomes.&#xD;
