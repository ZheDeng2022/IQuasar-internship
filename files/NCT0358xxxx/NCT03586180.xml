  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized children who undergo painful procedures are more susceptible than others to&#xD;
      experiencing iatrogenic effects, such as anxiety, pain, and severe stress. Clowns in clinical&#xD;
      setting have been found to be effective in reducing children's experiences of these effects&#xD;
      during hospitalization and before procedures. This article provides an overview of clowning&#xD;
      in health care settings; reviews major studies conducted on clowning for hospitalized&#xD;
      children, discussing evidence that clown interventions decrease pain and distress in&#xD;
      pediatric patients; and concludes with a discussion of health care clowning as a profession.&#xD;
