    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      study in patients with well-controlled celiac disease. Patients with confirmed CD diagnosis&#xD;
      (biopsy) will be recruited to participate in the study. Informed consent must be obtained&#xD;
      prior to performing any screening procedures. Patients who meet Visit 1 protocol enrollment&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled and begin the screening period. Patients that fail to meet&#xD;
      screening period eligibility will be discontinued from study participation at Visit 2. At&#xD;
      Visit 2, eligibility will be confirmed, adverse events will be documented at Visit 2.&#xD;
      Patients who continue to meet eligibility requirements at Visit 3 will begin the treatment&#xD;
      phase. During the treatment phase patients will self-administer treatment and gluten daily&#xD;
      with their evening meal. At the end of the treatment period, Visit 4, patient eligibility&#xD;
      will be confirmed and adverse events will be documented. The final visit, Visit 5, will be a&#xD;
      safety follow-up visit.&#xD;
