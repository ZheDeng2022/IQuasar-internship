  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke and cardiac&#xD;
      insufficiency) are the leading cause of death worldwide. They are a major cause of concern in&#xD;
      public health worldwide as well. Their incidence is increasing especially in emerging&#xD;
      countries. It has been shown through epidemiological and experimental studies that these&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases are influenced by environmental factors which can act early during&#xD;
      different periods of the development. Preterm birth is an emerging risk factor of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Preterm birth rate varies accordingly to countries from 6 % to 14 %&#xD;
      and accounts for 80% of low birth weight. These past thirty years have shown an improvement&#xD;
      in the management and survival rate of these babies. The number of preterm infants reaching&#xD;
      adulthood is thus increasing. Long term effects of preterm birth on cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      are little known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, emerging evidence suggest that preterm birth affects certain functions and&#xD;
      structure. A significant increase in blood pressure and alterations on the vascular,&#xD;
      metabolic, and renal systems have been reported in healthy young adult born preterm. And&#xD;
      abnormal heart shape with left ventricular hypertrophy have been demonstrated in these&#xD;
      population (Oxford)&#xD;

      metabolic, and renal systems have been reported in healthy young adult born preterm. And&#xD;
      abnormal heart shape with left ventricular hypertrophy have been demonstrated in these&#xD;
      population (Oxford) The aims of this study are to evaluate the effects of preterm birth on&#xD;
      heart functions and in a cohort of healthy young adults born preterm. Early alterations could&#xD;
      be observed, before the onset of disease. This study will include 60 young adults aged from&#xD;
      18 to 30 years, 30 of them born preterm (Preterm group) and 30 born at term with normal birth&#xD;
      weight (Control group). The groups will be matched for age and gender and tobacco exposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults born preterm who will be included in the study were born and followed-up in the&#xD;
      Neonatal Unit, APHM, in Marseille. Data from the Control adult born at term are well known&#xD;
      and available (Marseille DOHaD Study, D.Barker (University of Southampton, England) and&#xD;
      K.Thornburg (OHSU Portland, USA)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study addresses the mechanism underlying the association between cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      and preterm birth, and aims to identify early predictive markers in order to guide long term&#xD;
      follow-up of these young adults. The results of this study will help to develop specific and&#xD;
      accurate diagnostic tools and to implement preventive nutritional or pharmacological&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
