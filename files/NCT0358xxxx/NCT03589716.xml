      Partners Connected Health will conduct a clinical validation study to evaluate the accuracy&#xD;
      of measurement for each vital sign with the Vital Moto Mod platform, compared to appropriate&#xD;
      reference devices used in the hospital setting. The study will recruit volunteers from the&#xD;
      Partners Healthcare network of clinics and hospitals and the general public.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the comparative clinical performance of the Vital Moto Mod device in the&#xD;
      measurement of five vital signs (body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and blood pressure) in correlation with a reference device used in the hospital&#xD;
      environment for vital sign measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital sign measurement is a core process in delivering healthcare. Body temperature,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure are some of the most&#xD;
      frequently measured vital signs in inpatient as well as outpatient encounters. Currently,&#xD;
      separate devices exist for measurement of each of these vital signs, each of which may have&#xD;
      to be measured several times in a day. Consequently, measurement of vital signs is a time and&#xD;
      human resource intensive process. Moreover, most of the devices currently used to measure&#xD;
      vital signs cannot transmit data to the electronic medical record of patient, thereby&#xD;
      creating opportunities for human error. VVVital USA has used proprietary sensor technology to&#xD;
      develop Vital Moto Mod - a vital sign measurement platform that can non-invasively measure&#xD;
      body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure from a&#xD;
      person's index finger, and allows this information to be pushed into their electronic&#xD;
      medical/health record from the point of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary market focus use of the Vital Moto Mod is to replace the vital sign cart in&#xD;
      hospitals. Vital sign carts are expensive and cumbersome to move around the hospital. At a&#xD;
      fraction of the cost, the Vital Moto Mod provides the same functionality including bar code&#xD;
      scanning at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, the Vital Moto Mod can also be used at home&#xD;
      without the need for a trained nurse. The Vital Moto Mod App will guide a user through the&#xD;
      workflow of performing the measurements. The Vital Moto Mod is connected to a smartphone for&#xD;
      storage, and has a USB interface for charging, thereby requiring no electrical connections&#xD;
      during use. All measurements are taken by the device independent of the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partners Connected Health will conduct a clinical validation study to evaluate the accuracy&#xD;
      of measurement for each vital sign with the Vital Moto Mod platform, compared to appropriate&#xD;
      reference devices used in the hospital setting. The study will recruit volunteers from the&#xD;
      Partners Healthcare network of clinics and hospitals and the general public.&#xD;
