      This is a A Pilot Investigator-Initiated Study of Ribavirin in Indolent Follicular Lymphoma&#xD;
      and Mantle Cell Lymphoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women ages 18 and older with follicular lymphoma with&#xD;
      detectable BCL2-t or mantle cell lymphoma with presence of cyclin D1 overexpression (can be&#xD;
      newly diagnosed or relapsed). The objective of this study is to assess the possibility of&#xD;
      treating follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma patients with ribavirin and using cell&#xD;
      free DNA (cfDNA) for BCL2-t and cyclin D1 extracted from peripheral blood to measure&#xD;
      treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials of ribavirin have been conducted in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent with established doses, has resulted in the&#xD;
      regression of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ribavirin 1000 mg will be administered orally twice daily continuously for 28-day&#xD;
           cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed for up to 7 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not&#xD;
           experiencing unacceptable side effects.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility will be measured by the number of subjects who receive ribavirin for at least 3 months, have peripheral blood samples collected at baseline and monthly while on treatment, and have levels of BCL-t and cyclin D1, respectively, obtained from their peripheral blood samples. The intervention will be deemed feasible if all three criteria are met in 10 out of 15 subjects.</description>

    <description>Response rate will be assessed by the number of participants who achieve a response to ribavirin treatment based on PET/CT or CT at baseline and within 4 weeks after completion of treatment. International working group criteria will be used for response assessment based on imaging done at baseline and 2-4 weeks after completion of therapy. The total number of participants who achieve a response will be assessed after the last patient has their response assessed after completion of therapy.</description>
