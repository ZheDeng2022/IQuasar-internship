    <textblock>
      Patients with continued cognitive impairment after episodes of HE have few options beyond&#xD;
      lactulose and rifaximin in the US. Therefore using IV albumin in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial, which could beneficially impact inflammation, could be an&#xD;
      additional approach to improve cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 6 week trial will study changes in cognition, HRQOL and inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      covert HE after prior overt HE using multiple IV albumin infusions vs. placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a highly prevalent neuro-cognitive complication of cirrhosis&#xD;
      characterized by cognitive dysfunction, and high rate of subsequent mortality and recurrence.&#xD;
      HE also places a tremendous burden with a relentless increase in inpatient stay duration with&#xD;
      charges topping $7244.7 million in 2009. There were almost 23,000 hospitalizations for HE in&#xD;
      2009 and far more patients with HE who are being managed as an outpatient in the US. In the&#xD;
      NACSELD (North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease) experience&#xD;
      supported by Grifols, HE in inpatients is an independent risk factor for mortality and also&#xD;
      the leading cause of readmissions in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HE has two major phases, an acute inpatient phase, where patients undergo evaluation for&#xD;
      precipitating factors and HE treatment, and the post-discharge phase after HE resolution&#xD;
      where the patient has a normal mental status but may be cognitively impaired. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      is being increasingly recognized that even after the resolution of an acute HE episode with&#xD;
      normal mental status and ability to understand and consent, patients do not regain their&#xD;
      pre-HE cognitive function despite maximal therapy with the current standard of care. As many&#xD;
      as 70% of patients with HE, despite standard of care, have residual significant cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. Studies show that patients with HE, despite being on these medications which are&#xD;
      standard of care, continue to have significant cognitive impairment translating into poor&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL), poor employment status, and very poor socio-economic&#xD;
      status. This residual cognitive impairment is proportional to the number of HE episodes and&#xD;
      places a heavy medical and socio-economic burden on patients, caregivers and society. In some&#xD;
      cases, this approximates a dementia-like situation and makes this situation very difficult to&#xD;
      manage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients have three options in the current therapeutic situation which can improve&#xD;
      brain function. However all of these options have problems in widespread acceptance or&#xD;
      eligibility. First, if the patients are hyponatremic, correction of hyponatremia using&#xD;
      tolvaptan can help but tolvaptan is now not FDA-approved for cirrhosis. Second a selected&#xD;
      group of patients can undergo porto-systemic shunt embolization if their MELD score is &lt;11&#xD;
      and they have a double shunt, which is the minority of individuals. Lastly a small trial done&#xD;
      by our group showed improvement with fecal transplant but this requires several more years of&#xD;
      study before this becomes mainstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a major need for treating this continued cognitive impairment for which&#xD;
      there are currently no widely-available therapeutic agents available but which can improve in&#xD;
      selected cases. A medication or strategy that shows improvement in this functioning will be&#xD;
      rapidly assimilated into the therapeutic algorithm and will potentially affect several&#xD;
      thousand patients and their caregivers who continue to suffer from this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that this persistent cognitive impairment is accompanied by a&#xD;
      sustained pro-inflammatory state that is not quenched by our current standard of care15.&#xD;
      Ammonia, inflammation, endotoxemia, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction play an&#xD;
      important role in the pathogenesis of HE. There is also evidence that in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cirrhosis, i.e. those who are predisposed to HE, of reduction in albumin&#xD;
      concentration and capacity to bind to these metabolites that precipitate HE.&#xD;
