    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Treatment-emergent Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 56 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were collected in participants with overactive bladder (OAB) who previously completed treatment in Study RVT-901-3003. The treatment-emergent period was defined as the period of time from the first dose date of the active double-blind study treatment, whether in Study RVT-901-3003 or Study RVT-901-3004, through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or surgical intervention, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (CFB) at Week 52 in the Average Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours in All Overactive Bladder (OAB) Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A micturition/void is defined as &quot;Urinated in Toilet&quot; as indicated on the Patient Voiding Diary (PVD). The number of micturitions is defined as the number of times a participant voided in the toilet as indicated in the PVD. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of micturitions that occurred on a Complete Diary Day (CDD) divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: OAB type (Wet versus Dry) and sex.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CFB at Week 52 in the Average Number of Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes Per 24 Hours in OAB Wet Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The number of UUI episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked &quot;urge&quot; as the main reason for the leakage in the PVD, regardless of whether more than one reason for leakage in addition to &quot;urge&quot; was checked. The average daily number of UUI episodes was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of UUI episodes that occurred on a CDD divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when participant got up for the day each morning and time participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the MMRM were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: sex. Only participants with evaluable data were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>CFB at Week 52 in the Average Number of Urgency Episodes (Need to Urinate Immediately) Over 24 Hours in All OAB Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The number of urgency episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked &quot;need to urinate immediately&quot; on a CDD divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB is calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Over 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the MMRM were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: OAB type (Wet versus Dry) and sex.</description>

    <measure>CFB at Week 52 in the Average Number of Total Urinary Incontinence Episodes Over 24 Hours in OAB Wet Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The number of total incontinence episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked the accidental urine leakage box in the PVD, including for reasons of &quot;urge,&quot; &quot;stress,&quot; or &quot;other.&quot; CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Over 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the MMRM were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: sex. hr = hour.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 506 participants with overactive bladder (OAB) who completed 12 weeks in Study RVT-901-3003 (NCT03492281) and were screened and randomized for this extension study, 505 received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug (Safety Set Extension [SAF-Ext]: vibegron, N = 273; tolterodine, N = 232).</pre_assignment_details>

Thus, through participation in both Study RVT-901-3003 and this extension study, participants originally randomized to tolterodine ER 4 mg were to receive 52 weeks total of tolterodine ER. Participants were stratified by Baseline Overactive Bladder Type (Wet versus Dry) and sex.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (CFB) at Week 52 in the Average Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours in All Overactive Bladder (OAB) Participants</title>
        <description>A micturition/void is defined as &quot;Urinated in Toilet&quot; as indicated on the Patient Voiding Diary (PVD). The number of micturitions is defined as the number of times a participant voided in the toilet as indicated in the PVD. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated using the daily entries in the PVD (which was to be completed prior to each study visit) as the total number of micturitions that occurred on a Complete Diary Day (CDD) divided by the number of CDDs in the PVD. CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Per 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: OAB type (Wet versus Dry) and sex.</description>

Thus, through participation in both Study RVT-901-3003 and this extension study, participants originally randomized to vibegron 75 mg were to receive 52 weeks total of vibegron. OAB Wet participants were those participants with an average of â‰¥8.0 micturitions per Diary Day (DD); with an average of â‰¥1.0 UUI episodes per DD; and, if stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was present, with a total number of UUI episodes greater than the total number of SUI episodes from the previous visit diary. Participants were stratified by Baseline Overactive Bladder Type (Wet versus Dry) and sex.</description>

          <description>The number of total incontinence episodes is defined as the number of times a participant had checked the accidental urine leakage box in the PVD, including for reasons of &quot;urge,&quot; &quot;stress,&quot; or &quot;other.&quot; CFB was calculated as the post-BL value minus the BL value. &quot;Over 24 hours&quot; corresponds to one Diary Day (i.e., time between when the participant got up for the day each morning and time the participant got up for the day the next morning as recorded in the PVD). Covariates included in the MMRM were study visit, treatment, treatment by study visit interaction, Baseline, and the statistically significant terms in Study RVT-901-3003: sex. hr = hour.</description>
