  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in education have found that teachers often differ in their nonverbal behaviors&#xD;
      toward children from different social groups and these behaviors correlate with achievement&#xD;
      gaps and academic stereotypes about the groups. Early elementary school, when achievement&#xD;
      gaps first emerge, is also the time when White, majority children begin to show group-level&#xD;
      biases, and when racial minority children are able to detect discrimination and experience&#xD;
      anxiety related to their membership in a particular social group. Therefore, if children are&#xD;
      sensitive to teacher nonverbal behaviors, these behaviors could contribute to majority&#xD;
      children's group biases, and may impact minority children's awareness of being in a&#xD;
      negatively stereotyped group. In fact, children are adept at perceiving adult nonverbal&#xD;
      behaviors and using these behaviors to guide their own behaviors and to make judgments about&#xD;
      others. The primary goal of this research is to examine the effect of biased nonverbal&#xD;
      teacher behaviors on group biases for children from positively stereotyped groups, and on&#xD;
      affect and anxiety for children from negatively stereotyped groups. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that group biases in teacher behaviors will influence children's attitudes about&#xD;
      groups, and will result in negative affect and anxiety for students in groups targeted by&#xD;
      negative nonverbal teacher behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators test whether children attend to patterns in teachers'&#xD;
      nonverbal behaviors toward different groups, and use group-level differences to guide their&#xD;
      own evaluations of individuals from different groups. Although existing research has found&#xD;
      correlations between teacher behaviors and group-level attitudes (e.g., math/gender&#xD;
      stereotypes), it is difficult to identify the causal link between the specific teacher&#xD;
      behaviors and children's attitudes. Additionally, with existing groups such as those defined&#xD;
      by race or gender, there are a variety of factors that could influence children's stereotype&#xD;
      knowledge or bias before participating in the study. Therefore, in the present research&#xD;
      participants learned about students who were members of novel social groups (defined by&#xD;
      t-shirt color). Additionally, because children's intergroup preferences are influenced by&#xD;
      their own group membership, the investigators also assigned children to the novel groups.&#xD;
      Some children were assigned to the group that subsequently received positive behaviors from&#xD;
      the teacher ('positive group'), some children were assigned to the group that subsequently&#xD;
      received negative behaviors from the teacher ('negative group'), and a third group of&#xD;
      children participated in a control condition where they were also assigned to a group and&#xD;
      received a t-shirt, but did not see any interactions between their ingroup members and the&#xD;
      teacher ('no teacher cues').&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test whether teacher nonverbal behaviors play a causal role in children's intergroup&#xD;
      attitudes, after assigning participants to one of the three groups, they viewed a series of&#xD;
      interactions where students from each of two novel groups interact with a teacher, and the&#xD;
      teacher's nonverbal behavior was correlated with group membership: across the interactions,&#xD;
      one group always received positive teacher behaviors and the other received negative teacher&#xD;
      behaviors. The investigators then assessed children's group-level stereotypes and preferences&#xD;
      for new students from the positive and negative groups. Across three sets of test questions,&#xD;
      the investigators asked participants who they thought was smarter, who they would prefer as a&#xD;
      friend, and who they would select as a partner on an academic task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the studies of children's stereotyping, it was predicted predicted that children in&#xD;
      all three groups would report that new students in the positive group were smarter than&#xD;
      students in the negative group. However, when asked whom they would like to befriend, it was&#xD;
      hypothesized that children's own group membership would influence their choices: children who&#xD;
      were in the group that received positive behaviors or the group that did not interact with&#xD;
      the teacher would prefer to befriend students from the positive group, but children in the&#xD;
      group that received negative behaviors would show no preference or prefer their own group.&#xD;
      When asked who they would prefer as a partner on an academic task, it was once again&#xD;
      predicted that students in the positive and no cues groups would select students from the&#xD;
      positive groups. However, there were no clear predictions for participants from the negative&#xD;
      group; if they were more influenced by stereotypes, they would be more likely to select&#xD;
      students from the positive group and if they were more influenced by ingroup preferences,&#xD;
      they would be more likely to select students from the negative group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Participants were 96 5- to 7-year-old children (32 per condition, Mmean age =&#xD;
      6;6, range = 4;8-8;4, 48 males, 53% Multiracial, 23% White, 21% Asian) living in Hawai'i. The&#xD;
      investigators were able to obtain information about current school level for 91 participants;&#xD;
      of these participants, 26% were in preschool or pre-kindergarten, 69% were in kindergarten,&#xD;
      and 4% were in first grade. One additional child participated but was excluded for not&#xD;
      finishing the session. There was a pre-determined a stopping rule of 32 participants per&#xD;
      condition based on previous studies examining children's understanding of nonverbal&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials. At the beginning of the familiarization, participants were first presented with a&#xD;
      picture of three groups of 12 children gender matched to the participant and representing a&#xD;
      variety of races common in Hawaii. Each group wearing a different color shirt (orange, blue,&#xD;
      or green). Then, they viewed four 17-second clips featuring an interaction between a female&#xD;
      teacher and two students who matched the gender of the participant. In each video, the&#xD;
      students wore green and orange t-shirts and the teacher wore black. The teacher and the&#xD;
      students were unfamiliar to participants. Throughout each video, the teacher faced the&#xD;
      students and the participant; the participant could only see the backs of the students'&#xD;
      heads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each video, the teacher first faced forward, then turned toward the student on the left&#xD;
      while that student read a brief (7 s) passage. Then, she turned and faced the student on the&#xD;
      right while that student read the same passage. The audio clips of the students reading were&#xD;
      the same with minor adjustments made to tone and pitch so that the voices sounded different.&#xD;
      The teacher then faced forward at the end of the clip. Across the videos, the teacher&#xD;
      directed positive nonverbal behaviors (i.e., smiles and nods) toward students wearing one&#xD;
      color while they read and negative nonverbal behaviors (i.e., frowns and head shakes) toward&#xD;
      students wearing the other color while they read.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test trials featured photographs of children who matched the gender of the participant and&#xD;
      varied by race to match the racial diversity of classrooms in Hawaii. On each trial,&#xD;
      participants viewed a pair of children who were matched according to race, age, and&#xD;
      attractiveness (based on adult ratings). In each pair of children, one wore an orange shirt&#xD;
      and the other wore a green shirt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Participants were tested individually in the lab. The study was presented on a&#xD;
      monitor and an experimenter sat facing the child during the familiarization so that she was&#xD;
      unaware of which t-shirt group (orange or green) received positive or negative nonverbal&#xD;
      behaviors from the teacher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization Phase. At the start of the session, participants were told that they would be&#xD;
      learning about a school with three groups of kids: oranges, greens and blues. They were going&#xD;
      to pretend like they went to the school and would be in one of the groups. They then received&#xD;
      either an orange, green, or blue t-shirt to wear during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After putting on the t-shirt, they were told that they were going to watch some of the kids&#xD;
      in the orange and green groups do some reading for their teacher. Participants then watched&#xD;
      four familiarization videos in which the teacher directed positive behaviors toward students&#xD;
      from one group, and directed negative behaviors toward students from the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Phase. After viewing the familiarization videos, participants were told that the&#xD;
      experimenter was going to ask them some questions about new kids in the orange and green&#xD;
      groups. There were three blocks of four test trials. On smart test trials, participants were&#xD;
      asked to select the student they thought was smarter and the investigators defined smart as&#xD;
      &quot;someone who is really good at learning stuff.&quot; On friend test trials, participants were&#xD;
      asked who they would want to be friends with. On partner test trials, participants were asked&#xD;
      who would pick as a partner to help them read a hard book. Participants indicated their&#xD;
      answers by pointing and never received feedback. In between each block of test trials&#xD;
      participants viewed one of the familiarization videos for a second time. After the three&#xD;
      blocks of test trials, participants completed some additional measures that are not reported&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Participants were randomly assigned to the positive, negative, or no cues condition.&#xD;
      In the positive condition, they were assigned to wear a t-shirt that was the same color as&#xD;
      the student who received the positive nonverbal behaviors from the teacher in the&#xD;
      familiarization videos. In the negative condition, participants were assigned to wear a&#xD;
      t-shirt that was the same color as the student who received the negative nonverbal behaviors&#xD;
      from the teacher in the familiarization videos. In the no cues condition, participants were&#xD;
      assigned to wear a t-shirt that was not shown in either the familiarization videos or test&#xD;
      trials. The t-shirt color of the positive and negative groups, the order of familiarization&#xD;
      videos, the order of test trial blocks, the students in each test trial block, and the&#xD;
      students in the positive and negative groups varied across participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring. On each test trial, selecting the student who wore the same t-shirt color as the&#xD;
      students receiving positive nonverbal behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization was&#xD;
      scored as 1 and selecting the student who wore the same t-shirt color as the students&#xD;
      receiving negative behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization was scored as 0. For&#xD;
      each participant, the investigators created an average positive group score for each trial&#xD;
      type by summing across each block and dividing by the total number of completed trials (4 in&#xD;
      most cases, except for one participant who did not give a response on two trials, and two&#xD;
      participants who did not give a response on one trial, one participant in the no cues&#xD;
      condition failed to give any responses on friend trials so they were excluded from analyses&#xD;
      of that variable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonverbal Coding. To assess whether being a member of a group that received positive,&#xD;
      negative, or no teacher behaviors influenced participants' affect and anxiety, the&#xD;
      investigators analyzed footage of the participants during the task. The investigators first&#xD;
      created video clips of the participants when they were viewing the teacher directing&#xD;
      nonverbal behaviors to the students in the familiarization. For each participant, there was a&#xD;
      total of 8 clips: four clips of the participants viewing positive interactions and four clips&#xD;
      of participants viewing negative interactions. For participants in the positive condition,&#xD;
      the positive interactions were ingroup interactions and the negative interactions were&#xD;
      outgroup interactions. For participants in the negative condition, the negative interactions&#xD;
      were ingroup interactions and the positive interactions were outgroup interactions. For&#xD;
      participants in the no cues condition, both positive and negative interactions of&#xD;
      interactions were outgroup interactions. The videos were then coded for the affect and&#xD;
      anxiety of the participant on a scale of -3 to 3. For affect, negative codes corresponded to&#xD;
      behaviors like furrowing the brows, mouth turned down, or head shaking; for anxiety, negative&#xD;
      codes corresponded to behaviors like tense muscles, withdrawn or fidgety, or displaying&#xD;
      self-comfort behaviors. For affect, positive codes corresponded to behaviors like relaxed or&#xD;
      raised brows, mouth turned up, or head nodding; for anxiety, negative codes corresponded to&#xD;
      behaviors like relaxed muscles, open expansive posture, or fluid movement. Each coder rated&#xD;
      both kinds of codes for each clip.&#xD;
