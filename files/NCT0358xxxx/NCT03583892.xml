      The multimodal analgesia involves the administration of two or more analgesic agents that&#xD;
      exert their effects via different analgesic mechanisms, providing superior analgesia with&#xD;
      fewer side effects. This multimodal analgesic regimen includes opioids, nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, local anesthetics, and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve blocks. The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative analgesic benefit&#xD;
      in patients administered with 600mg oral gabapentin as premedication for laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy under general anesthesia, with respect to postoperative pain scores and total&#xD;
      postoperative requirements of morphine and/or tramadol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not only nociceptive but also&#xD;
      inflammatory, neurogenic and visceral. Therefore, because of involvement of multiple&#xD;
      mechanisms, multimodal analgesic techniques utilizing a number of drugs acting on different&#xD;
      analgesic mechanisms are being used. The multimodal analgesic mechanisms include opioids,&#xD;
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentinoids, local&#xD;
      anesthetics, and transversus abdominis plane block. Pre-treatment with gabapentin blocks the&#xD;
      development of hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia for up to two days. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate postoperative analgesic benefit in patients administered with 600mg oral&#xD;
      gabapentin as premedication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia, with&#xD;
      respect to postoperative pain scores and total postoperative requirements of morphine and/or&#xD;
      tramadol. In the preoperative period, consent is requested for patients who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria of the study. At this time it is verified whether gabapentin has been&#xD;
      prescribed by the attending physician or not. If enrolled, the patient is allocated to the&#xD;
      gabapentin group (Group A) or to the non-gabapentin group (Group B), according to his/her&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are monitored for electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      capnography, bispectral index (BIS®), and neuromuscular transmission with Train-of-Four&#xD;
      (TOF®) during intraoperative period. Anesthesia is induced with intravenous fentanyl 1 to 3&#xD;
      µg/kg and propofol 1 to 3 mg/Kg. Muscle relaxation is achieved with rocuronium 0.5 to 1,2&#xD;
      mg/Kg and orotracheal intubation is performed when TOF count had reached 0. Anesthesia is&#xD;
      maintained with Desflurane and Air/Oxygen, titrated to maintain the BIS value between 40-60.&#xD;
      Muscle relaxation is maintained with rocuronium bolus (10mg), when more than two responses&#xD;
      are detected in TOF stimulation. The lungs are mechanically ventilated and adjusted to&#xD;
      maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mmHg. All patients are given a continuous&#xD;
      infusion of polyelectrolyte solution. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular block is&#xD;
      antagonized with standard doses of sugammadex (2mg/Kg, if TOF≥2; 4mg/Kg if TOF=0 and&#xD;
      Post-Tetanic-Count (PTC) ≥2; 16mg/Kg, if TOF=0 and PTC&lt;2). The endotracheal tube is removed&#xD;
      when the TOF ratio is &gt; 90% and BIS &gt; 80, with the patient being conscious, with adequate&#xD;
      spontaneous ventilation and responded to verbal commands. Perioperative analgesia is provided&#xD;
      with intravenous paracetamol 1g (administrated after anesthetic induction), parecoxib 40mg&#xD;
      (administrated after anesthetic induction) and local anesthetic infiltration of trocar&#xD;
      insertion sites with ropivacaine 0.5%. When gabapentin is preoperative given, the usual doses&#xD;
      is 600mg. Postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis are assured with intravenous&#xD;
      dexamethasone 4mg after the induction, and intravenous ondansetron 4mg at the end of the&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the pain is assessed using a numeric pain rating&#xD;
      scale at the arrival (0h) and then at 1, 6, 12, 24h, both at rest and at movement (with a&#xD;
      maximum of 30minute variation at each evaluation time). The investigators will also consult&#xD;
      the nursing evaluation of pain scores (assessment of pain scores at intervals of 4hours).&#xD;
      Patients with sedation score of at least 4 are considered sedated. The occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative complications is also recorded. At any time, if analgesia is inadequate, the&#xD;
      anesthesia resident will provide intravenous bolus of morphine (0.05-0.1 mg/Kg) and stop if&#xD;
      patient has respiratory depression (defined as respiratory rate&lt;10 per minute or Blood Oxygen&#xD;
      Saturation (SpO2)&lt;90% on air) or is sedated. Droperidol 0.625mg will be given intravenously&#xD;
      if patient had persistent nausea or had two or more episodes of retching or vomiting. Total&#xD;
      consumption of morphine during the stay at the PACU is recorded. - Post-operative analgesia&#xD;
      is usually provided with intravenous paracetamol 1g 8/8h and intravenous parecoxib 40mg&#xD;
      12/12h. If the patient still complained of pain, then rescue analgesia will be given with&#xD;
      intravenous tramadol 100mg, maximum 8/8h. Besides that, nausea and vomiting prophylaxis are&#xD;
      assured with intravenous ondansetron 4mg 8/8h. Total consumption of tramadol during the stay&#xD;
      at the ward is recorded.&#xD;
