  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-preterm neonates are born between 34 and 36 weeks 7 days gestational age (GA). Neonates&#xD;
      born less than 34 weeks GA are at increased risk for morbidity and directly admitted to the&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a standard of care in many&#xD;
      units to aid in post-natal transitioning. Current guidelines published by the Neonatal&#xD;
      Resuscitation Program (NRP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend only&#xD;
      &quot;vigorous, term&quot; neonates initiate immediate SSC. There is no published data regarding safety&#xD;
      or guidelines relating to late-preterm neonates and immediate SSC. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that post-natal transitioning after immediate SSC within the first&#xD;
      hours after birth will be no worse for vigorous, singleton 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 week neonates&#xD;
      compared to those who transition to SSC after an initial period of 20 minutes observation&#xD;
      under the radiant warmer.&#xD;

      Aim: Determine safety of immediate skin-to-skin in vigorous 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 week&#xD;
      late-preterm singleton neonates after vaginal delivery compared to current practice of&#xD;
      observation under the radiant warmer for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization - University Hospital's Cleveland Medical Center Department of Obstetrics &amp;&#xD;
      Gynecology and Rainbow Babies Children's Hospital Department of Neonatology will be the only&#xD;
      participating members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design - This is a prospective, randomized-control, and equivalence study. The cohort&#xD;
      of subjects that will be recruited for this study will include singleton neonates born via&#xD;
      vaginal delivery to Mothers at 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks GA in UH MacDonald Women's Hospital&#xD;
      Labor &amp; Delivery Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment will occur at UH MacDonald Women's Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mothers who meet the inclusion criteria will be tracked in the EMR at time of admission&#xD;
           to the Labor &amp; Delivery Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent will be obtained by members of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consenting process will occur at the time of Mother's admission to the Labor &amp; Delivery&#xD;
           Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Consent will be obtained in Mother's room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Mother will not be consented if sedated, under distress from laboring process, or&#xD;
           clinically unstable per Labor &amp; Delivery Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A copy of the consent will be given to the Mother, a copy kept in a locked, secure&#xD;
           office for research collection purposes, and a copy will be scanned into the electronic&#xD;
           medical record (EMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Index cards with skin or warmer written on them will be placed in opaque, sealed&#xD;
           envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The envelopes will be shuffled randomly and numbered 1-120. The envelopes will be kept&#xD;
           in chronological order. Extra envelopes containing index cards will be made if needed&#xD;
           using the same randomized process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Envelopes will be stored in the Neonatal Treatment Room adjacent to Operation Room 1 on&#xD;
           the Labor &amp; Delivery Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After obtaining informed consent and if the Mother is agreeable to participate in this&#xD;
           study, a sealed envelope will be brought to the laboring room and opened prior to&#xD;
           delivery. No one in the delivery room will know what is written on the index card. The&#xD;
           envelope will be opened right before delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Skin is the intervention group (Group 1) and warmer is the control group (Group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Information about how the newborn transitioned after birth will be collected, regardless&#xD;
           if newborn is in the skin or warmer group. The information gathered will be analyzed to&#xD;
           determine if there are any differences in postnatal transitioning between the two groups&#xD;
           of newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods Preparation prior to vaginal delivery (all late-preterm neonates)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prepare Mother to receive newborn (bra removed &amp; uncover breasts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Place warm blanket on Mother's abdomen to receive neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulse oximeter will be turned on and placed bedside to allow uninterrupted contact and&#xD;
           positioning between Mother and neonate. Screen is to be visible to Labor &amp; Delivery RN&#xD;
           at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiate immediate SSC after vaginal birth of vigorous late-preterm neonate - Group 1 (skin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Newborn Nurse will assist Mother with initiating skin-to-skin contact&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Place nude neonate supine on warm blanket on Mother's abdomen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suction mouth and nose if necessary, dry, &amp; remove wet blanket&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Place pulse oximeter on right upper extremity, hat, diaper, and cover with warm&#xD;
           receiving blanket&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assign 1 minute APGAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any change in clinical status of either Mother (based on clinical judgment by OB&#xD;
           Physician or Midwife) or neonate (based on clinical judgment by Pediatric Team or&#xD;
           Neonate's RN) will preclude continued SSC and warrant immediate intervention until&#xD;
           stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Interventions to stabilize neonate: repositioning on Mother's chest, ensure&#xD;
                unobstructed airway, oral suctioning with bulb syringe if needed, reapply pulse&#xD;
                oximeter, &amp; remove from Mother's chest if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring during postnatal transitioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Place neonate in prone position on Mother's bare chest between breasts in upright&#xD;
           position within 5 minutes of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitor neonate's head position and ensure nose is unobstructed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cover with 2-4 layers of warm receiving blankets&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assign 5 minute APGAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neonate to stay on Mother's chest for uninterrupted SSC for first 60-90 minutes of life&#xD;
           or until completion of first feed&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Routine vital signs, including pulse oximetry, will be monitored and documented in the&#xD;
           EMR until Mother/neonate stable for transfer to antepartum unit. Vital signs will be&#xD;
           obtained per current UH protocol. Normal values and assessment data include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Axillary temperature 36.5-37.5 degrees Celsius&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Heart rate of 100 to 180 beats per minute (if not eating or crying)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Regular cardiac rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Respiratory rate of 40-60 breaths per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pulse oximetry parameters per NRP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Any pulse oximetry reading &lt; 88% at 1 hour of life will require the baby to be&#xD;
                repositioned on Mother's chest, ensure unobstructed airway, oral suctioning with&#xD;
                bulb syringe if needed, reapply pulse oximeter, &amp; remove from Mother's chest if&#xD;
                needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Screening and management of postnatal glucose homeostasis will be instituted, as is&#xD;
                the current policy at UH MacHouse Women's Hospital, for all late-preterm neonates&#xD;
                until 24 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Signs of tolerance of postnatal SSC:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pink or with mild acrocyanosis&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Respiratory effort easy, no audible grunting, or visible intercostal retractions&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Alert, demonstrating feeding cues, or sleeping comfortably&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Well-flexed posture with good tone&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Any change in clinical status of either Mother (based on clinical judgment by OB&#xD;
           Physician or Midwife) or neonate (based on clinical judgment by Pediatric Team or&#xD;
           Neonate's RN) will preclude continued SSC and warrant immediate intervention until&#xD;
           stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Interventions to stabilize neonate: repositioning on Mother's chest, ensure&#xD;
                unobstructed airway, oral suctioning with bulb syringe if needed, reapply pulse&#xD;
                oximeter, &amp; remove from Mother's chest if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of late-preterm neonate if randomized to Group 2 (warmer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial period of observation (20 minutes) under the radiant warmer per current UH&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Place pulse oximeter on right upper extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SSC within 1 hour after birth for at least 1 hour and until first breastfeed attempt&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SSC protocol to be followed as detailed in (numbers 2-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any change in clinical status of either Mother (based on clinical judgment by OB&#xD;
           Physician or Midwife) or neonate (based on clinical judgment by Pediatric Team or&#xD;
           Neonate's RN) will preclude continued SSC and warrant immediate intervention until&#xD;
           stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Interventions to stabilize neonate: repositioning on Mother's chest, ensure&#xD;
                unobstructed airway, oral suctioning with bulb syringe if needed, reapply pulse&#xD;
                oximeter, &amp; remove from Mother's chest if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection &amp; Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data to be de-identified once collected from the current electronic medical record and&#xD;
           entered into a linking log in a secure file in the RedCap Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mother and Baby will be assigned a study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If randomized into Group 1 (skin), dyad will be identified as: Mother - MS1 and Baby -&#xD;
           S1. Each additional dyad randomized into Group 1 will continue sequentially (i.e. MS2,&#xD;
           MS3, &amp; S2, S3, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Group 2 (warmer) will be identified as: Mother - MW1 and Baby - W1. Each additional dyad&#xD;
           randomized into Group 2 will continue sequentially (i.e. MW2, MW3, &amp; W2, W3, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A separate, secure file in RedCap Database will be created for Mother's and baby's&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Maternal information to be collected: medical record number, age, race, gravida/para&#xD;
           status, prenatal screens, medical history, medications, date of delivery, time of&#xD;
           delivery, &amp; planned feeding method (breast or formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Neonate information to be collected: medical record number, gestational age, sex, race,&#xD;
           Apgar scores (1, 5, &amp; 10 minutes), time of initial SSC, &amp; if SSC is interrupted (time &amp;&#xD;
           reason). Vitals, including pulse oximetry, will be collected per UH protocol. If&#xD;
           respiratory distress is present, initial glucose level &amp; time, time of initial feed, and&#xD;
           time of transfer &amp; location (postpartum unit or NICU with admission diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. All of the above information will be collected throughout the entire hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The investigators will also track any NICU admission and document reason for admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. A data safety monitoring committee will periodically review the collected data to ensure&#xD;
           continued safety during ongoing trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis &amp; Power Calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that Apgar scores at 1, 5 and 10 minutes,&#xD;
      temperature at each measured time, presence of respiratory distress and oxygen saturation is&#xD;
      not worse among the SSC babies compared to those with the standard of care (warmer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Means and standard deviations will be calculated for continuous variables, median and ranges&#xD;
      for scores, and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Differences between babies&#xD;
      in the two randomization groups will be analyzed using a t-test (for continuous variables,&#xD;
      such as temperature), a wilcoxon rank sum test (for ordinal variables, such as Apgar scores)&#xD;
      or chi-square test for categorical variables (such as presence of respiratory distress).&#xD;
      Prior to analysis, data will be tested for consistency with test assumptions and alternatives&#xD;
      (such as Fisher's exact instead of chi-square) will be used if more appropriate. P-values&#xD;
      will be one sided and a p&lt;0.05 will be used to reject our hypothesis of non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional variables, such as characteristics of the Mother, can be analyzed in a similar&#xD;
      fashion for exploratory analyses or hypothesis generation for future studies, and this is not&#xD;
      the primary aim of this study. Randomization is implemented to minimize the need for&#xD;
      multivariate analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test a two sample non-inferiority hypothesis, a sample size of at least 46 in&#xD;
      each arm will result in at least 80% power to conclude no more than 4% worse in SCC group vs.&#xD;
      standard of care group (for continuous variables). Other test are only slightly less powered.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to enroll at least 46 patients in each arm.&#xD;
