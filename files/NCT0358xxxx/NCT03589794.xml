      This is a study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a recombinant&#xD;
      circumsporozoite protein (rCSP) malaria vaccine administered with and without AP 10-602&#xD;
      [Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA) in liposome Quillaja saponaria 21 formulation (LSQ)] adjuvant.&#xD;
      59 healthy adult, malaria naive volunteers aged 18 to 45 will receive vaccination with or&#xD;
      without adjuvant (10 of those volunteers will receive rCSP alone) in five dose escalating&#xD;
      groups. Each group will receive 3 vaccination doses total, with intramuscular (IM) injections&#xD;
      on days 1, 29, and 85. A sixth group of 6 volunteers will receive no vaccinations and will&#xD;
      participate as a control in a Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) challenge with two of&#xD;
      the vaccinated groups. The study will be conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development&#xD;
      (CVD) in Baltimore, Maryland. The patient participation duration is expected to be up to 886&#xD;
      days (up to 117 days for nonvaccination group). This study will test two hypotheses: (1) the&#xD;
      rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will induce an immune response in a&#xD;
      dose-dependent manner as measured by anti-CSP antibody titer via ELISA and (2) the rCSP/AP&#xD;
      10-602 [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will provide a minimum of 50% efficacy in vaccines&#xD;
      compared to unvaccinated infectivity controls. The primary objective is to assess the safety&#xD;
      and reactogenicity of candidate rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine when administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day schedule (Groups 1-3, 4B, 5) and on a 1 and 490 day&#xD;
      schedule (Group 4) to healthy malaria-naive adults aged 18-45 years.&#xD;

      This is a phase I, single-site, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      and efficacy of the recombinant circumsporozoite protein (rCSP) antigen malaria vaccine&#xD;
      administered with and without AP 10-602 [Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA) in liposome Quillaja&#xD;
      saponaria 21 formulation (LSQ)]. The study population will consist of 65 healthy male and&#xD;
      female adults aged 18 to 45 years old and be conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development&#xD;
      (CVD) in Baltimore, Maryland. 49 healthy, malaria-na√Øve volunteers will receive rCSP&#xD;
      vaccination with AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] adjuvant. Ten volunteers will receive rCSP alone. Each&#xD;
      dose-escalating group will receive 3 intramuscular (IM) total doses of vaccine on days 1, 29,&#xD;
      and 85. Group 1 will receive a dose of 10 mcg rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2 mcg&#xD;
      LSQ) at each injection; Group 2 will receive 30 mcg rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2&#xD;
      mcg LSQ); Group 3 will receive 30 mcg rCSP without adjuvant; and Group 4 will receive 60 mcg&#xD;
      rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2 mcg LSQ). The dose for Group 5 will depend on&#xD;
      immunogenicity analysis from groups 1, 2 and 3. If immunogenicity analysis conducted 28 days&#xD;
      post-2nd dose in Groups 1, 2 and 3 show promise (at least fourfold increase in geometric mean&#xD;
      anti-CSP antibody or geometric mean anti-CSP titer of 20), the 10 volunteers in Group 5 will&#xD;
      receive the lowest rCSP dose that gives this predefined immunogenic response ((either 10 or&#xD;
      30 mcg rCSP) + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ],]), otherwise, Group 5 will receive 60 mcg rCSP + AP&#xD;
      10-602 [GLA-LSQ]. Groups will be vaccinated in a stepwise manner following a &quot;telescoped&quot;&#xD;
      design. A sixth group of 6 volunteers (Group 6) will receive no vaccinations and will be used&#xD;
      as an infectivity control for a Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) challenge. Groups 4&#xD;
      and 5 will also undergo the CHMI challenge together, 28 days after the last vaccination. The&#xD;
      patient participation duration is expected to be up to 886 days for Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5;&#xD;
      and up to 117 days for Group 6. This study will test two hypotheses: (1) the rCSP/AP 10-602&#xD;
      [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will induce an immune response in a dose-dependent manner&#xD;
      as measured by anti-CSP antibody titer via ELISA and (2) the rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ]&#xD;
      candidate malaria vaccine will provide a minimum of 50% efficacy in vaccines compared to&#xD;
      unvaccinated infectivity controls. The primary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of candidate rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine when administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day schedule (Groups 1-3, 4B, 5) and on a 1 and 461 day&#xD;
      schedule (Group 4) to healthy malaria-naive adults aged 18-45 years. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      are to (1) assess immunogenicity of rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine when&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day (Groups 1-3, 4B, 5) and on a 1 and 490&#xD;
      day schedule (Group 4) schedule and (2) to assess the preliminary efficacy of candidate&#xD;
      rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine against infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria&#xD;
      (defined as P. falciparum asexual parasitemia or a delay in patency of infection &gt; 2 days&#xD;
      versus unimmunized infectivity controls) under Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI).&#xD;
