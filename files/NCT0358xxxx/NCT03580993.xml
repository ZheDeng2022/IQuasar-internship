  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography is a commonly used diagnostic and procedural adjunctive modality in intensive&#xD;
      care. Weaning of neurosurgical patients off ventilatory support is a critical procedure,&#xD;
      fraught with risks of hypoxia and hypercapnia. Weaning involves sequential reduction of&#xD;
      ventilatory support and regular assessments for extubation followed by spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we evaluate parameters of ultrasonographic evaluation of lung aeration and&#xD;
      cardiac function in neurosurgical patients undergoing weaning and their ability to predict&#xD;
      successful weaning and extubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography has become a ubiquitous feature of Intensive care nowadays, with its&#xD;
      influence ranging from various diagnostics to various therapeutic interventions. It is&#xD;
      readily available at the bedside and is non-invasive, making it an ideal tool in the hands of&#xD;
      the intensivist. It has excellent safety profile, and hence can be performed repeatedly.&#xD;
      These days it has become an indispensable tool in the intensive care units owing to its&#xD;
      potential utility in the process of weaning a critically ill patient from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurosurgical patient is different from any other post-operative or critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Their altered cerebral physiology, specific goals of therapy, varied response to&#xD;
      usual management protocols, put them in a different league whole together. The primary aim of&#xD;
      care for these patients is to detect and prevent any secondary neurological insult while&#xD;
      supporting systemic and neurological homeostasis. Hypoxia and hypercarbia are factors which&#xD;
      need to be absolutely avoided while caring for such patients. A good proportion of these&#xD;
      patients will have respiratory instability, airway compromise and altered sensorium, which&#xD;
      makes them prone to hypoxia and hypercarbia. To avoid these secondary insults to the&#xD;
      neurological system, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is instituted in&#xD;
      patients who are at high risk. Mechanical ventilation is continued until the patient is&#xD;
      clinically stabilized and primary neurological damage has been taken care of. Subsequently&#xD;
      the transition from control ventilation to spontaneous ventilation begins&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weaning process from mechanical ventilation involves sequential reduction of ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters, assessment of readiness of the patient for extubation and when all these&#xD;
      criterias are acceptable, then finally extubation. Daily, meticulous evaluation of clinical&#xD;
      and neurological conditions and completion of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be&#xD;
      considered in order to recognize and facilitate the process of withdrawal of the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. Extubation is considered as a success when the ventilator prosthesis is removed&#xD;
      after the patient passed the SBT and there is no need for reinstitution of the MV in the next&#xD;
      48 hours. The entire process of weaning can be categorised as a six step process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Taking care of the primary event&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Deciding whether to start weaning&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessing the readiness to wean&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of probable reintubation6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several parameters have been instituted for assessing the capability of weaning. These&#xD;
      include: Rapid Shallow Breathing Index, which is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal&#xD;
      volume (RSBI=f/VT), Pulmonary gas exchange (like: PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2), Vital Capacity (VC),&#xD;
      Minute Ventilation and Static Compliance. Weaning may not always have a successful outcome.&#xD;
      Difficult weaning may in fact be due to different or mixed etiologies, the diagnosis of which&#xD;
      requires meticulous monitoring of various physiologic and objective parameters. Assessment of&#xD;
      lung aeration by ultrasonography is rapidly gaining significance in weaning protocol. Apart&#xD;
      from lung ultrasonography, the role of transthoracic echocardiography in successfully&#xD;
      predicting weaning capability have been investigated in the recent times. Cardiac related&#xD;
      weaning failure may be due to systolic LV dysfunction or isolated diastolic dysfunction. By&#xD;
      this study we are trying to evaluate the scope of ultrasonography in detection of lung&#xD;
      aeration and cardiac systolic and diastolic function in mechanically ventilated neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients undergoing weaning; and whether they can be used as a good diagnostic tool to detect&#xD;
      those who are likely to fail weaning in this specific subset of patient population.&#xD;

For a given region of interest, points are allocated according to the worst ultrasound pattern observed: N = 0, B1 lines = 1, B2 lines = 2, C = 3. The LUS score ranging between 0 and 36 will be calculated as the sum of points.</description>
