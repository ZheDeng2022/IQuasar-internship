    <textblock>
      Acute skeletal muscle wasting in ICU patients is associated with functional impairment and&#xD;
      with increased risk of death. Of what we know today, physical disability can persist up to 5&#xD;
      years. Adequate nutrition is the basis for an optimal recovery for ICU patients and for&#xD;
      prevention of muscle wasting. Today, continuous feeding is still the standard enteral&#xD;
      nutrition form for patients in the ICU to limit the incidence of aspiration. A study of Serpa&#xD;
      et al. and Georgia et al. compared the continuous feeding versus a bolus nutrition with a&#xD;
      feeding time of 30 - 60 minutes every 4 hours. They showed no statistical differences in&#xD;
      complications between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProBoNo is a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      a protein- rich formula to explore the impact of continuous or intermittent bolus nutrition&#xD;
      on muscle breakdown in ICU patients. The investigators would like to recruit 68 patients&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours after surgical intensive care unit admission. Prior beginning of&#xD;
      nutrition administration, and on the 7th day thereafter the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      muscle biopsy and an ultrasound from the vastus lateralis muscle in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the time from 6.00 am of the following day after admission until the&#xD;
      patient reaches his daily protein's target quantity. Secondary outcomes include the diameter&#xD;
      and densitiy of the hamstrings assessed by ultrasound and histology, the process of gastric&#xD;
      residual volume, number of diarrhoea events and laboratory findings like glucose, urea and&#xD;
      insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1, all compared between the two time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent feeding is not only more natural and could help to limit the muscle wasting in&#xD;
      ICU patients, it is also easier to handle for the ICU caring medical team. A trial from&#xD;
      Georgia et al. in 2007 compared continuous to intermittent enteral nutrition. They found that&#xD;
      the intermittently fed patients reached their nutrition goal faster than those being&#xD;
      continuously nourished. This might in part be explained by feeding interruptions in the&#xD;
      continuous feeding regimen. Presumably, preoperative holding of tube feedings in the&#xD;
      continuous nutrition group most commonly caused interruptions. Thus, independently from&#xD;
      prevention of muscle breakdown, a bolus nutrition would be more attractive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relevance of early continuous or intermittent enteral feeding of critically ill patients&#xD;
      has been discussed controversially in the last years. Today, continuous feeding is still the&#xD;
      standard for enteral nutrition in the ICU. The continuous nutrition can prevent abdominal&#xD;
      intolerance like vomiting, diarrhoea and aspiration. Pulmonary aspiration is the most&#xD;
      dramatic consequence of enteral nutrition and can be limited by a continuous feeding as shown&#xD;
      by a study in 2003. However, nutrition was started with a bolus of 125ml as baseline by force&#xD;
      of gravity over 15 minutes. Compared to the continuous nutrition, this is considered much&#xD;
      volume in a short time. Naturally, risk of gastric intolerance in this scenario is very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other studies, a similar amount of nutrition was given over a longer period of time (30 -&#xD;
      60 minutes) every 4 hours. In each cohort (continuous and bolus), only one case of pulmonary&#xD;
      aspiration or tube obstruction was detected. After this study, other trials with a similar&#xD;
      result followed. In 2007 a trial of Georgia et al. showed no statistical differences in&#xD;
      complications regarding tube feeding, no differences of diarrhoea, emesis or pneumonias&#xD;
      between continuous and bolus nutrition. The feeding time for bolus nutrition is also a&#xD;
      critical influential factor. When an intermittent feeding is given over a longer period of&#xD;
      time (20-40 minutes), the incidence of nausea and vomiting has not increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent feeding is not only a good alternative to continuous feeding, but also more&#xD;
      natural, as long-term intake of nutrition over 20 hours is not common in any mammal. The&#xD;
      alimentary tract and metabolic pathways of humans seem designed for intermittent ingestion of&#xD;
      essential nutrients reduced to a few times a day. Different hormones of the endocrine cells&#xD;
      affect complex roles of gastrointestinal motility, gall bladder contraction and nutrient&#xD;
      absorption. The level of these hormones depends on the amount of nutrient ingestion. This&#xD;
      response of the hormones is almost completely abolished in continuous feeding. But in&#xD;
      intermittent nutrition, hormones like incretin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide&#xD;
      (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) boost the level of insulin and&#xD;
      the resulting carbohydrate load and therefore influence the muscle protein synthesis and&#xD;
      breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, the anabolic effects of feeding occur due to an increase on the&#xD;
      synthetic rate of muscle protein synthesis of approximately 300% with a simultaneous 50%&#xD;
      decrease in the rate of protein breakdown. Two studies of 2009 and 2011 compared the&#xD;
      intermittent bolus and continuous feeding and the effect of protein synthesis in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle in neonatal pigs. They analysed the fractional rates of protein synthesis in muscle&#xD;
      samples of continuous and intermittent bolus feeding groups. They could show that although&#xD;
      both groups, continuous and intermittent bolus feeding, stimulate muscle protein synthesis,&#xD;
      but in the bolus-fed, in the fractional rates of protein synthesis called K's was greater&#xD;
      after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ongoing study wants to show the effect of bolus vs. continuous feeding in ICU patients&#xD;
      related to muscle wasting by measurements of ultrasound and blood samples. In this trial, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to have a similar approach but with different measurements. Using&#xD;
      ultrasound and muscle biopsies, the investigators aim to determine whether intermittent&#xD;
      enteral feeding could preserve muscle mass better or more than standard continuous enteral&#xD;
      feeding in the critically ill patients. In addition, the investigators would like to assess&#xD;
      if intermittent bolus feeding optimizes protein intake in the first 7 days of critical&#xD;
      illness since the intermittent route is less affected by interruptions following treatment&#xD;
      and diagnostic procedures.&#xD;
