    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of selumetinib and how well it works with&#xD;
      durvalumab and tremelimumab in treating participants with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      or that has come back. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving durvalumab, tremelimumab and&#xD;
      selumetinib may work better in treating participants with non-small lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Dose-escalation phase) II. To estimate the&#xD;
      progression free survival in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) treated with durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination with selumetinib in either an&#xD;
      intermittent or continuous schedule and compare to historical controls. (Dose expansion&#xD;
      phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess overall survival. IV. To assess safety and toxicity (in the dose-escalation&#xD;
      and dose expansion phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess markers of response and resistance in pre-treatment and on- treatment biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of selumetinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and 15-21&#xD;
      and durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Participants also receive&#xD;
      tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for courses 1-4. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-28 and durvalumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Participants also receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for&#xD;
      courses 1-4. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving or have received systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             starting study treatment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin, and suramin), or any&#xD;
             anticancer therapy which has not been cleared from the body by the time of starting&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that,&#xD;
             as judged by the investigator, makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would adversely&#xD;
             affect the absorption / bioavailability of the orally administered study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are male or female patients of reproductive potential and, as judged by the&#xD;
             investigator, are not employing an effective method of birth control from screening to&#xD;
             180 days after the last dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy&#xD;
