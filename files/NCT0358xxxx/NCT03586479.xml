  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) are slower to learn new words than their&#xD;
      peers, placing them at risk for academic failure. In this study, we are improving a storybook&#xD;
      reading treatment to help Kindergarten children with SLI learn new words. In this study, we&#xD;
      compare three versions of book reading that vary in how often children are tested on, meaning&#xD;
      asked to talk about, the words they are learning in the book: low vs. mid vs. high testing.&#xD;
      We then examine which version of the treatment leads to better learning of the words during&#xD;
      treatment and remembering of the words after treatment. We also seek to understand individual&#xD;
      differences in treatment outcomes by examining pre-treatment predictors as well as progress&#xD;
      during and after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) are slower to learn new words than their&#xD;
      peers, placing them at risk for academic failure. Our long-term goal is to develop an&#xD;
      effective word learning treatment for kindergarten children with SLI, thereby improving their&#xD;
      academic and vocational outcomes. During the prior funding period, we successfully taught new&#xD;
      words to children with SLI via interactive book reading, a treatment involving an adult&#xD;
      reading a storybook to a child and deviating from the text to teach new words. We identified&#xD;
      the adequate intensity of the treatment and showed that children with SLI learn an&#xD;
      appropriate number of words by the end of 8-weeks of treatment, approximating the number of&#xD;
      words learned by typically developing children in prior studies. However, this successful&#xD;
      support of short-term word learning revealed new challenges that must be overcome in this&#xD;
      renewal to continue to understand and improve long-term word learning by children with SLI.&#xD;
      Thus, a second preliminary clinical trial involving 60 kindergarten children with SLI is&#xD;
      proposed. Aim 1 addresses the challenge that newly learned words were forgotten once&#xD;
      treatment was withdrawn. We attempt to buffer forgetting by comparing different amounts of&#xD;
      testing during interactive book reading (low vs. mid vs high testing). Incorporating testing&#xD;
      into training is a well-established and highly replicated means of reducing forgetting by&#xD;
      adults and typically developing children. Aim 1 will determine whether testing can be&#xD;
      harnessed to buffer forgetting by children with SLI under real world conditions. Aims 2 and 3&#xD;
      address the challenge that not all children benefitted equally from interactive book reading.&#xD;
      In Aim 2, we identify pre-treatment characteristics of children with SLI that are associated&#xD;
      with the slope of learning during treatment or the slope of forgetting post-treatment.&#xD;
      Moreover, we select a pre-treatment battery that samples a wide array of skills likely to be&#xD;
      associated with learning (language processing, working memory, and episodic memory) or&#xD;
      forgetting (overall learning during treatment, decay rate). Aim 2 will provide a foundation&#xD;
      for predicting which children will benefit from interactive book reading and will identify&#xD;
      which skills are major barriers to long-term word learning by children with SLI. In Aim 3, we&#xD;
      classify each child's response at the end of treatment (learner vs. non-learner) and at the&#xD;
      end of post-treatment monitoring (rememberer vs. forgetter). Then, we examine earlier&#xD;
      performance to determine when treatment and post-treatment outcomes can be predicted. This&#xD;
      yields empirically based benchmarks for progress that can be used to tailor the treatment to&#xD;
      individual children and establishes the stability of learning and forgetting over time.&#xD;
      Overall, this research advances a promising treatment to effectively overcome the significant&#xD;
      word learning challenges faced by children with SLI and reveals the contribution of learning&#xD;
      and forgetting to language normalization by children with SLI. The results will have impact&#xD;
      beyond word learning and SLI because all treatments require boosting learning and buffering&#xD;
      forgetting. Thus, the knowledge gained will further catalyze clinical research.&#xD;
