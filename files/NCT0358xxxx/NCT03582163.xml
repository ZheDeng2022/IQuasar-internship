  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center is one of the largest-volume DBS centers in the country.&#xD;
      From 2007 through October 2017, 265 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients underwent deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS), 168 of those implanted in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and 97 in globus&#xD;
      pallidus interna (GPi). Pre-operatively, each patient is extensively evaluated with a battery&#xD;
      of validated motor, cognitive, and mood instruments. This information is stored in RedCAP, a&#xD;
      secure online database platform. In an attempt to capture longitudinal outcomes in this&#xD;
      population of interest, we will recruit all PD patients two years or more status post DBS who&#xD;
      are receiving regular care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Study participants will&#xD;
      undergo a condensed evaluation of motor function (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
      Part III), cognitive performance (Mini-Mental Status Examination), mood (Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory), and quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39). These results will be&#xD;
      compared to baseline measures performed pre-operatively, allowing for assessment of interval&#xD;
      change. STN and GPi DBS patients will be analyzed separately.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from review of movement disorders neurologists' outpatient census.&#xD;
      All patients with PD two or more years status post DBS will be contacted via phone and/or&#xD;
      mailed letter. Any interested patient will be mailed or e-mailed (via RedCAP) a copy of the&#xD;
      study informed consent form. Willing patients will present to the Vanderbilt Movement&#xD;
      Disorders Clinic for an opportunity to inquire further about the study and sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a single study visit, ideally coordinated with their regularly&#xD;
      scheduled neurology follow-up. During the study visit, the following evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed by a trained research assistant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video-recorded UPDRS III BDI MMSE PDQ-39 In addition, current PD medications and number of&#xD;
      falls in the past 6 months will be recorded. Assessments will occur in the on-medication,&#xD;
      on-DBS state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video-recorded UPDRS III will be reviewed and score at a subsequent date by a blinded&#xD;
      rater (movement discord trained neurologist).&#xD;
