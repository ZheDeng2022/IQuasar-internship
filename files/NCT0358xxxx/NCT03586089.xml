  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition&#xD;
      characterized by agitation, confusion, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. Typically,&#xD;
      clinicians treat the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal with a class of medications known as&#xD;
      benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium). These medications have a short duration of activity and&#xD;
      require repeated administration, often every hour or less, to reduce the symptoms of alcohol&#xD;
      withdrawal. Many patients suffer complications related to inadequate treatment of alcohol&#xD;
      withdrawal (e.g., abnormal heart rhythms, aspiration, seizures) resulting in admission to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit and prolonged hospital stay, all of which increase healthcare costs.&#xD;
      Although alcohol withdrawal is common, especially among disadvantaged (e.g., homeless)&#xD;
      patients, limited funding is available to advance the care of patients suffering from alcohol&#xD;
      withdrawal. A safe and effective treatment for severe alcohol withdrawal would benefit&#xD;
      patients and our healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phenobarbital is an inexpensive, commonly available medication that is typically used to&#xD;
      treat seizures. A key advantage of phenobarbital is that its calming effect lasts for a long&#xD;
      period of time and it can be given as a 'one-time-dose' intravenously, so that it both&#xD;
      prevents and treats withdrawal symptoms and reduces the need for repeated benzodiazepines.&#xD;
      Through better symptom control, phenobarbital is expected to reduce the costs and&#xD;
      complications of alcohol withdrawal. At present, physicians rarely use phenobarbital for this&#xD;
      purpose, and additional research is needed for this medication to become part of routine care&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PHENOMANAL pilot trial will assess safety and whether clinicians can administer a single&#xD;
      dose of phenobarbital intravenously, in addition to benzodiazepines, compared to&#xD;
      benzodiazepines alone for treating patients with severe alcohol withdrawal. This information&#xD;
      will inform the design of a larger clinical trial. For patients, the PHENOMANAL trial has the&#xD;
      potential to revolutionize how patients suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal are treated.&#xD;
      For society and the healthcare system, phenobarbital is expected to reduce the complications&#xD;
      and costs associated with severe alcohol withdrawal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 39 patient, single-centre pilot trial of phenobarbital as an adjunctive treatment for&#xD;
      severe acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AAWS), the PHENOMANAL trial will demonstrate the&#xD;
      ability to recruit, consent, and randomize participants and adhere to the assigned treatment&#xD;
      protocol with minimal loss to follow up and infrequent adverse events. This pilot trial will&#xD;
      provide data and proof of feasibility in preparation to conduct a multicentre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of phenobarbital as an adjunctive treatment for severe AAWS. Patients will&#xD;
      be recruited from the Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit, Medical Step-Up unit, and&#xD;
      wards of Unity Health Toronto - St. Michael's Hospital, a quaternary care centre located in&#xD;
      downtown Toronto, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients will be identified by research personnel during daytime hours from&#xD;
      Monday to Friday using a multi-modal approach. With the assistance of the hospital&#xD;
      informatics department, personnel will collect a daily census of patients who have been&#xD;
      started on symptom-triggered benzodiazepine therapy using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal&#xD;
      Assessment (revised) (CIWA-Ar) protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent The investigators will use a hybrid consent model. Whenever possible, consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient or his/her substitute-decision-maker (SDM) at the time of&#xD;
      recruitment. In this instance, Research Coordinators will ask one of the members within the&#xD;
      'circle of care' (e.g., physician, nurse, respiratory technologist, social worker, etc) to&#xD;
      ask for permission from patient or their SDM for a research coordinator to contact him/her&#xD;
      about participation in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization To conceal allocation, central randomization will be conducted by the Pharmacy&#xD;
      Department of St. Michael's Hospital using a list of random treatment assignments created on&#xD;
      www.randomize.net.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention As soon as possible after randomization, patients will receive either a single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose of phenobarbital (7.5 mg per kg of ideal body weight, prepared in 250&#xD;
      ml D5W; n=26) or placebo (250 ml D5W; n=13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety During the infusion patients will be monitored with continuous oximetry, non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure measurement q 30 minutes (+/-, and continuous cardiac monitoring in a&#xD;
      high-acuity unit (e.g Intensive Care, Cardiac Intensive Care, Emergency, Step-Up).&#xD;
      Phenobarbital achieves peak serum concentration within one hour of administration; however,&#xD;
      study participants will be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and q 30 minute&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure measurement for a minimum of 3 hours post administration. Each&#xD;
      patient will thus receive a total of four hours of intensive monitoring (i.e. one hour of&#xD;
      monitoring during the study drug administration, and three hours of monitoring subsequently&#xD;
      to ensure clinical stability). Eligible female trial participants &lt; 55 years of age will have&#xD;
      a urine or blood ÃŸhCG checked prior to treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Research personnel will collect data on (i) Patient Demographics including&#xD;
      age; sex; housing; relevant comorbidities; time since last alcohol consumption; baseline&#xD;
      laboratory investigations; and baseline CIWA-Ar scores. (ii) Treatment including maximal&#xD;
      CIWA-Ar score; number, dose and type of benzodiazepine or alternative treatments&#xD;
      administrated (e.g., benzodiazepines, propofol, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, haloperidol);&#xD;
      vital signs; need for admission to a monitored setting (i.e. vitals recorded more often than&#xD;
      every 4 hours, or need for continuous oximetry); use of non-invasive or invasive ventilation;&#xD;
      and the presence of a bedside sitter. These data will be recorded for a span of 7 days or&#xD;
      until hospital discharge (whichever comes first). (iii) Clinical Outcomes including adverse&#xD;
      events (aspiration, intubation, seizures); monitored care and hospital length of stay; time&#xD;
      to Addictions Medicine assessment; and vital status at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Power Fifty patients will be recruited in the PHENOMANAL pilot trial. This sample&#xD;
      size will ensure that clinicians gain experience with the treatment protocol, enable&#xD;
      assessment of recruitment and consent practices, and provide preliminary estimates of&#xD;
      treatment effect (safety and efficacy) to inform the design of a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis In the primary analysis, recruitment will be considered feasible if the&#xD;
      investigators can recruit 2 or more patients per month, on average, over the 24-month study&#xD;
      period. In secondary analyses, compliance rates greater than 80% will be considered&#xD;
      acceptable in both study arms. Similarly, a cross-over rate of &lt; 10% from the control arm to&#xD;
      the phenobarbital arm will be taken to be acceptable. Preliminary estimates of treatment&#xD;
      effect will be compared between the alternative treatment strategies using the Chi-Squared&#xD;
      test (alternatively, Fisher's Exact test) and Student's T-test (Alternatively, Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Rank-Sum test) for binary and continuous data, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion This pilot randomized controlled trial will assess feasibility of a multicenter&#xD;
      trial to investigate intravenous phenobarbital as an adjunctive treatment for severe AAWS.&#xD;
      Randomization of 39 patients will allow us to assess feasibility metrics, including&#xD;
      clinicians' ability to comply with the protocol and cross-over rates, and generate&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of safety and treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial protocol has been designed in light of the unique challenges of studying patients&#xD;
      with severe AAWS. It is important to clearly define the population of interest. Patients with&#xD;
      mild alcohol withdrawal may not benefit from IV adjunctive treatment with phenobarbital, and&#xD;
      may lead to over-sedation, complications (e.g., intubation, aspiration), and/or prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization. Oral phenobarbital administration may warrant further investigation in this&#xD;
      patient population. In contrast, highly agitated patients suffering from AAWS may not show a&#xD;
      clinically important response to the dose of IV phenobarbital that the investigators are&#xD;
      evaluating. The investigators decision to limit enrollment to patients with a severely&#xD;
      elevated CIWA score (&gt;16) after receiving at least 60 mg of diazepam or equivalent represents&#xD;
      an attempt identify the patient population that is most likely to benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      adjunctive IV phenobarbital. Base on pharmacokinetics, phenobarbital is most likely to be&#xD;
      useful if administered early in the course of treatment and thus enrollment will be&#xD;
      accordingly limited to the first 16 hours after patients are identified.&#xD;
