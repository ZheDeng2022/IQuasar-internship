  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to change walking patterns is important for daily tasks such as stepping over an&#xD;
      obstacle. This change of walking pattern can occur in a strategic manner, i.e., consciously&#xD;
      making one step longer or shorter. Healthy individuals can learn a new walking pattern&#xD;
      through perturbed visual feedback of their walking information (Kim et al., 2015; Kim et al.,&#xD;
      2017). This type of learning is thought to largely involve explicit strategy. Transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can&#xD;
      enhance learning of some motor tasks (Reis et al., 2009), and primarily has been studied in&#xD;
      the upper extremity. In locomotor learning, prior recent work by the investigators has&#xD;
      suggested that tDCS does not affect non-strategy based locomotor learning, and the&#xD;
      investigators speculate that tDCS may benefit learning of strategic tasks instead. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine if tDCS can enhance learning and retention of a new&#xD;
      walking pattern in a strategy-based, visually guided locomotor task in healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Two groups of young, healthy participants will be recruited to learn a new walking pattern&#xD;
      through perturbed visual feedback, with retention of learning tested on the second day. One&#xD;
      group will receive tDCS, which is expected to enhance learning. The other group will receive&#xD;
      placebo stimulation and serve as a control. Results from this work will provide information&#xD;
      on which type of motor learning is sensitive to enhancement with tDCS, and may help pave the&#xD;
      path for utilizing tDCS for neurorehabilitation.&#xD;
