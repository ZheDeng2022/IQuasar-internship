  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goals of the CARE-C study are to demonstrate the effectiveness of HCV models of care&#xD;
      in a rural state (A) to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake, (B) to increase retention&#xD;
      in care, and (C) to broaden access to care. To achieve these goals the following two systems&#xD;
      interventions will be separately implemented: (1) Implementation of the Psychosocial&#xD;
      Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C) and related standard&#xD;
      of care best practice PREP-C related interventions facilitated by a social worker-patient&#xD;
      navigator team, and (2) implementation of a modified ECHO model (with one patient visit at&#xD;
      specialty center to include PREP-C and fibrosis assessment in contrast to standard ECHO&#xD;
      model). To test the effectiveness of our two systems interventions 600 patients will be&#xD;
      equally distributed into three study arms representing 3 care models: Arm 1: Current Care&#xD;
      Model (management with current interdisciplinary team); Arm 2: PREP-C Model (management with&#xD;
      expanded interdisciplinary team (social worker, patient navigator, PREP-C); and Arm 3:&#xD;
      Modified ECHO Model (management with expanded team in collaboration with community&#xD;
      providers). An additional Arm 4 was started January 2021 to follow subjects experience with&#xD;
      HCV management and treatment via telemedicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related complications (end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, and&#xD;
      death) are increasing in the U.S., and extrapolated from U.S. data most of the estimated&#xD;
      49,200 patients with chronic hepatitis C in the state of Kentucky are untreated. In addition,&#xD;
      the state of Kentucky is at the center of the rural opioid epidemic in the United States&#xD;
      which has led to a dramatic increase in the transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV)&#xD;
      infection. HCV treatment uptake has been suboptimal in Kentucky despite the availability of&#xD;
      highly effective, well-tolerated, timely limited treatment options due to multiple patient-,&#xD;
      provider-, and system related barriers. Effective models of linkage to care, treatment, and&#xD;
      retention in care are urgently needed to overcome the epidemiological challenges facing our&#xD;
      rural state and put Kentucky on a path to planned elimination of HCV infection in the state.&#xD;
      The demonstration of the effectiveness of new models of care in Kentucky which are&#xD;
      appropriate to rural states will have great relevance and value to other states struggling&#xD;
      with new HCV transmission and similar urgent need for effective models of linkage to care,&#xD;
      treatment, and retention. Standardized care interventions expanding the reach of specialty&#xD;
      providers (Project ECHO) and overcoming patient and provider related barriers to HCV&#xD;
      treatment initiation (PREP-C assessment and interventions) have been evaluated, but the&#xD;
      implementation of both models has been hampered by a lack of financial incentive, PREP-C has&#xD;
      not been evaluated in rural populations, and the two models have never been used in&#xD;
      conjunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of the study are to demonstrate the effectiveness of HCV models of care in a&#xD;
      rural state (A) to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake, (B) to increase retention in&#xD;
      care, and (C) to broaden access to care. To achieve these goals the following two systems&#xD;
      interventions will be separately implemented: (1) Implementation of the Psychosocial&#xD;
      Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C) and related standard&#xD;
      of care best practice PREP-C related interventions facilitated by a social worker-patient&#xD;
      navigator team, and (2) implementation of a modified ECHO model (with one patient visit at&#xD;
      specialty center to include PREP-C and fibrosis assessment in contrast to standard ECHO&#xD;
      model). To test the effectiveness of our two systems interventions up to 1000 participants&#xD;
      will be distributed into four study arms representing 4 care models: Arm 1, Current Care&#xD;
      Model (management with current interdisciplinary team);arm 2, PREP-C Model (management with&#xD;
      expanded interdisciplinary team (social worker, patient navigator, PREP-C); arm 3, Modified&#xD;
      ECHO Model (management with expanded team in collaboration with community providers); and Arm&#xD;
      4, current Telemedicine care model (management with current interdisciplinary team).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare HCV treatment uptake within 12 months after the first clinic visit (time of&#xD;
      enrollment) in all Arms 1, 2, and 3. It is hypothesized that (A) treatment uptake will be&#xD;
      higher in Arms 2 (PREP-C model) and 3 (modified ECHO model) as compared to Arm 1 (current&#xD;
      care model) as a result of overcoming patient level treatment barriers (such as ongoing&#xD;
      substance use, psychiatric instability, non-compliance, loss to follow up) facilitated by&#xD;
      implementation of the PREP-C assessment, PREP-C related interventions, and assistance of the&#xD;
      social worker-patient navigator team, and (B) treatment uptake in Arm 3 will be non-inferior&#xD;
      to Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare HCV treatment outcomes (treatment completion and sustained virologic&#xD;
      response, SVR12) in all arms 1, 2, and 3. It is hypothesized that treatment completion and&#xD;
      SVR12 in arms 2 and 3 will be noninferior to arm 1 due PREP-C enhancement, even though&#xD;
      expected additional patients who start treatment in Arms 2 and 3 are expected to have less&#xD;
      favorable treatment readiness scores prior to PREP-C interventions due to higher rates of&#xD;
      treatment uptake as hypothesized in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare retention in care in all 3 arms for patients who do not start treatment&#xD;
      (within 12 months after initial appointment). It is hypothesized that retention in care will&#xD;
      be higher in arms 2 and 3 due to implementation of PREP-C assessment and interventions, and&#xD;
      the support through the patient navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To record the treatment uptake and analyze patient experiences with telemedicine&#xD;
      appointments in Arm 4, the telemedicine arm.&#xD;
