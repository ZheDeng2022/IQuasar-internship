      The purpose of this study is to determine the beneficial effect of n-acetylcysteine (NAC), an&#xD;
      inhaled medication that breaks down mucus, on lung function. NAC is a medication approved by&#xD;
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic diseases of the&#xD;
      respiratory system, including asthma. With CT lung imaging, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      identify a subgroup of patients with asthma with a 'mucus' profile. This is a single-arm&#xD;
      study which means all participants will receive the same treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      N-acetylcystine (NAC) is a mucolytic medication, meaning that it breaks apart mucus.&#xD;
      Investigators know that mucus is a factor in severe asthma attacks. However, mucus may be a&#xD;
      factor in chronic severe asthma as well. This role has been hard to prove because of&#xD;
      difficulty in showing that mucus occludes the lumen in chronic severe disease. Using a novel&#xD;
      approach of scoring mucus occlusion, investigators have used CT imaging to uncover that a&#xD;
      majority of people with severe asthma have at least one lung segment with a mucus plug and&#xD;
      27% have more than four lung segments with mucus plugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, studies of mucolytics, like NAC, have not shown benefit in other obstructive&#xD;
      lung diseases, like COPD. However, utilizing CT mucus scores as a biomarker, investigators&#xD;
      believe that mucolytic treatment may prove useful for those with significant mucus impaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm study of participants with asthma who also have evidence of mucus in&#xD;
      their lungs as determined by CT imaging. Investigators hypothesize that by treating&#xD;
      asthmatics, chosen based on the presence of mucus in the airways, with a mucolytic like NAC,&#xD;
      will result in an improvement of lung function.&#xD;

    <description>This study will look at the effects of a medication, called n-acetylcysteine or NAC, on lung function. NAC is already approved for use in people with chronic airway conditions, including asthma. However, it is not known who this medication works best in. We believe this medication will likely have the most benefit in people with asthma that have mucus in their airways or &quot;mucus plugging.&quot; Initial study procedures will include lung function measurements, a low dose CT scan, a blood draw, and a sputum induction. The CT lung imaging will identify asthmatics with mucus plugs.</description>

            <description>This study will look at the effects of a medication, called n-acetylcysteine or NAC, on lung function. NAC is already approved for use in people with chronic airway conditions, including asthma. However, it is not known who this medication works best in. We believe this medication will likely have the most benefit in people with asthma that have mucus in their airways or &quot;mucus plugging.&quot; Initial study procedures will include lung function measurements, a low dose CT scan, a blood draw, and a sputum induction. The CT lung imaging will identify asthmatics with mucus plugs.&#xD;
N-acetylcysteine: Research participants that meet the study inclusion criteria will be admitted to a medical-surgical ward in Moffitt-Long Hospital (UCSF Medical Center) for 6 days and 5 nights and treated with an inhaled mixture of NAC and albuterol four times per day spaced at 4 to 6 hours apart.</description>
