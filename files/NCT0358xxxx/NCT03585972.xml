  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 20-60% of older adults experience frailty as they age. Frailty is a clinical state of&#xD;
      increased vulnerability resulting from aging-associated declines in biological reserve across&#xD;
      multiple physiologic systems. Because of the lack of biological reserve, relatively minor&#xD;
      physical or psychological assaults have the potential to trigger a cascade of negative&#xD;
      sequelae for frail older adults resulting in adverse health outcomes including mortality,&#xD;
      disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, hospitalization and&#xD;
      emergency visits, and institutionalization in community-dwelling older adults. Despite the&#xD;
      potential personal and economic consequences of frailty syndrome, frailty is not an&#xD;
      irreversible process. For example, a 4.5-year longitudinal study conducted by Gill et al.,&#xD;
      (2006) demonstrated that of their 754 community dwelling older adults, 58% had at least one&#xD;
      change in frailty status during the study period and that approximately one third of these&#xD;
      transitions were from a state of greater frailty to one of lesser frailty, suggesting that it&#xD;
      is possible to reverse the frailty trajectory. Nonetheless, there is a lack effective means&#xD;
      of reversing frailty or slowing the progression of older adults along the frailty&#xD;
      continuum.The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of an occupational therapy intervention delivered through the primary care&#xD;
      setting for improving frailty status and physical functioning among older adults ages 55 and&#xD;
      older who are pre-frail when compared to usual care.&#xD;

      Between 20-60% of older adults experience frailty as they age. Frailty is a clinical state of&#xD;
      increased vulnerability resulting from aging-associated declines in biological reserve across&#xD;
      multiple physiologic systems. Because of the lack of biological reserve, relatively minor&#xD;
      physical or psychological assaults have the potential to trigger a cascade of negative&#xD;
      sequelae for frail older adults resulting in adverse health outcomes including mortality,&#xD;
      disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, mobility impairment, falls,&#xD;
      hospitalization and emergency visits, and institutionalization in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      adults. In addition, frailty results in increased healthcare cost and service utilization&#xD;
      across both acute and community settings. Frail older adults (OA) have a higher frequency of&#xD;
      primary care visits, consume 50% of all hospital care, use over 80% of home care services,&#xD;
      and occupying 90% of all nursing home beds in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the potential personal and economic consequences of frailty syndrome, frailty is not&#xD;
      an irreversible process. For example, a 4.5-year longitudinal study conducted by Gill et al.,&#xD;
      (2006) demonstrated that of their 754 community dwelling older adults, 58% had at least one&#xD;
      change in frailty status during the study period and that approximately one third of these&#xD;
      transitions were from a state of greater frailty to one of lesser frailty, suggesting that it&#xD;
      is possible to reverse the frailty trajectory. Nonetheless, there is a continued lack&#xD;
      effective means of reversing frailty or slowing the progression of older adults along the&#xD;
      frailty continuum. Interventions have been developed to slow or reverse frailty and have&#xD;
      typically focused on exercise training, nutritional supplementation, pharmaceutical agents,&#xD;
      or some combination of those elements. The efficacy of such interventions has been mixed with&#xD;
      intensive physical activity interventions demonstrating the most promise. Yet intensive&#xD;
      physical activity interventions are difficult to disseminate at a population level, and&#xD;
      evidence suggests that even when participants experience a change in their frailty status as&#xD;
      a result of intensive exercise intervention, they generally return to their pre-intervention&#xD;
      state once exercise training is discontinued. Because of the lack knowledge about how best to&#xD;
      address the problem of frailty in older adulthood, researchers have argued that the continued&#xD;
      development and evaluation of interventions designed to prevent frailty or ameliorate the&#xD;
      consequences of frailty should remain a top priority in aging research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach that holds promise for preventing or slowing the progression of frailty is early&#xD;
      identification of pre-frail individuals in the outpatient setting and referring them to&#xD;
      occupational therapy services before individuals require more intensive inpatient services.&#xD;
      Primary care geriatric clinics afford a unique opportunity for early identification and&#xD;
      referral of at risk older adults during the course of routine care. Providers are often times&#xD;
      more familiar with their patients, have had the opportunity to track their patient's progress&#xD;
      over time, and therefore, are uniquely situated to identify changes in functional or health&#xD;
      status and make appropriate referrals on behalf of their patients. While occupational&#xD;
      therapists have not traditionally provided services in the primary care setting, occupational&#xD;
      therapy services delivered in hospital, home, and community settings improve function and&#xD;
      reduce healthcare costs among older adults. Occupational therapy services delivered in the&#xD;
      primary care setting offers a unique opportunity to improve the health, function and&#xD;
      wellbeing of frail, pre-frail, and at risk older adults (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of an occupational therapy intervention delivered through the primary care&#xD;
      setting for improving frailty status and physical functioning among older adults (OA) ages 55&#xD;
      and older who are pre-frail when compared to usual care. Secondary aims include conducting&#xD;
      exploratory analyses to examine potential mechanisms that may explain the intervention's&#xD;
      effects, and evaluating the intervention's impact on secondary outcomes including&#xD;
      occupational performance, quality of life, and care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that occupational therapy services will result in greater&#xD;
      improvement in the primary outcomes of frailty status (measured via the Fried Frailty&#xD;
      criteria), physical function, and the secondary outcomes of occupational performance, health&#xD;
      status (measured via weight and blood pressure), and care utilization (assessed via&#xD;
      structured questionnaire) Quality of Life among the treatment group compared to usual care.&#xD;
      The two specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability. Determine if the occupational&#xD;
           therapy services delivered are feasible and acceptable. By tracking time, effort, costs,&#xD;
           adherence to recommendations, participant recruitment and retention rates, and&#xD;
           intervention satisfaction among a sample of 150 pre-frail older adults, we expect to be&#xD;
           able to provide data that both support the feasibility of the intervention and help us&#xD;
           improve it for a subsequent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a pilot randomized trial of the intervention components with 150 older adults&#xD;
           to evaluate the impact of the occupational therapy intervention on the primary outcomes&#xD;
           of frailty status and physical functioning, and the secondary outcomes of occupational&#xD;
           performance, health status, quality of life and care usage. Hypotheses: Frailty status&#xD;
           and physical functioning will be significantly improved following the intervention and&#xD;
           will be maintained for 6-months after treatment termination.&#xD;
