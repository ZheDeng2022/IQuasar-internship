  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate if veno-venous (vv)-extracorporeal carbon dioxide Removal&#xD;
      (ECCO2R) is capable of reducing mortality and/or severe disability at day 60 after&#xD;
      randomisation in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Extubation will be&#xD;
      facilitated by VV-ECCO2R and compared to IMV alone in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study hypothesizes an advantage for veno-venous extracorporeal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      removal (VV-ECCO2R) in severe acute exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (IMV) to facilitate early extubation in terms of reducing mortality or severe&#xD;
      disability. The study hypothesizes that avoiding IMV could reduce mortality and substantially&#xD;
      improve quality of life, especially in regard to avoidance of tracheostomy and long-term home&#xD;
      IMV. Improvement in mobility due to sooner recovery has a further major impact on patients'&#xD;
      QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization patients with acute exacerbation of severe COPD, requiring invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation will be treated either with conventional care or VV-ECCO2R to&#xD;
      facilitate early extubation. VV-ECCO2R is used in a standard configuration with either double&#xD;
      lumen cannula (22-24Fr) or two small single vessel cannulas (15-19 Fr), allowing a blood flow&#xD;
      rate between 1-1.75 L/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional care in the control arm includes invasive mechanical ventilation and the attempt&#xD;
      to extubate the patient as early as possible and to switch to non-invasive ventilation (NIV).&#xD;
      If extubation fails, tracheostomy can be performed according to the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
