    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess priming with antigenically mismatched live attenuated&#xD;
      A/H7N3 influenza virus vaccine followed by inactivated A/H7N9 influenza virus vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will assess priming with antigenically mismatched live attenuated A/H7N3 influenza&#xD;
      virus vaccine (H7N3 pLAIV) followed by inactivated A/H7N9 influenza virus vaccine (H7N9 pIIV)&#xD;
      in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a dose of H7N3 pLAIV on Days 0 and 28, followed by a single dose of&#xD;
      H7N9 pIIV on Day 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days -2 and 26, participants will be admitted to an inpatient clinic. They will receive&#xD;
      the H7N3 pLAIV vaccine on Days 0 and 28. They will remain in the clinic for 9 days after&#xD;
      receiving the vaccine and until they are no longer shedding vaccine virus. An additional&#xD;
      study visit will occur on Day 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 84, participants will receive the H7N9 pIIV vaccine. Additional study visits will&#xD;
      occur on Days 87, 91, 98, 112, 140, and 180. Study visits may include physical examinations,&#xD;
      nasal washes, and blood and urine collection. Participants will be contacted by phone on Day&#xD;
      264 for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
