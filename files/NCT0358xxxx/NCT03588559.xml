      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Automated blood pressure cuff measurement is the standard of care in numerous medical&#xD;
           settings today. This study was designed to assess the accuracy of a previously cleared&#xD;
           automated blood pressure cuff system using the same arm sequential dual observer&#xD;
           auscultation method. The study was conducted in accordance to ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013&#xD;
           Non-invasive sphygmomanometers - Part 2: Clinical investigation of automated measurement&#xD;
           type, the Code of Federal Regulations requirements for Non-Significant Risk Device&#xD;
           Investigations and as appropriate ISO 14155: Clinical investigation of medical devices&#xD;
           for human subjects - Good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Purpose of Clinical Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to provide supporting documentation for non-invasive blood&#xD;
           pressure measurement Accuracy claims for the TMB-1591-A-002 Blood Pressure System with&#xD;
           Reusable Cuffs on the intended adult and pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Investigation Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following Salus Independent Review Board (IRB) approval, a total of 90 subjects were&#xD;
           screened and enrolled into the study and data was collected. Two subjects were withdrawn&#xD;
           from the study and the data was not used in the data analysis. These subjects were&#xD;
           removed due to difficulty in hearing the reference blood pressure range (systolic and/or&#xD;
           diastolic) and the other was removed due an unstable systolic range. A total of 88&#xD;
           healthy subjects, (53 adult / adolescent and 35 pediatric) ages 3-75yr, arm&#xD;
           circumference 15-49.5 cm, systolic blood pressures ranges 79-176.5 and diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure ranges of 49-116 were included in the study for analysis. The study was&#xD;
           conducted May 30 - June 16, 2017 to perform an accuracy validation on TMB-1591-A-002&#xD;
           Blood Pressure System with FlexiPortTM Reusable Cuffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirements for the study were to include a minimum of 85 subjects with a minimum of 35&#xD;
      pediatric subjects 3-12 years of age and the remainder over 12 years of age, with at least&#xD;
      30% being male and 30% being female, and an arm circumference range of 15-55cm where at least&#xD;
      six subjects were evaluated in each of the seven cuffs. For the data collection, at least 90%&#xD;
      of the subjects needed to contribute 3 paired observations allowing the remaining 10% to be 2&#xD;
      paired observations. A minimum of 255 valid paired observations were needed for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilized the same arm sequential method (Dual Observer) in which the observers&#xD;
      alternated the measurements for the reference sphygmomanometer and the sphygmomanometer-under&#xD;
      test. Each paired reading incorporated the average of the reference reading prior to the&#xD;
      device under test and after the device under test. (ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013, Section&#xD;
      5.2.4.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TMB-1591-A-002 Blood Pressure System with FlexiPortTM Reusable Cuffs,&#xD;
      (sphygmomanometer-under-test) was designed for use on the upper arm of patients with arm&#xD;
      circumferences that range from 15-55cm. Seven cuff sizes were included in the investigation&#xD;
      requiring that each cuff size have data collection on at least 6 subjects. Two trained&#xD;
      observers (auscultators) simultaneously observed (listened to) the Korotkoff sounds at the&#xD;
      brachial artery during the automated blood pressure cuff measurement. The 5th Korotkoff (K5)&#xD;
      sound was used to identify diastole for the adult/adolescent subjects and the 4th Korotkoff&#xD;
      (K4) sound was used for the pediatric subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference sphygmomanometer used in this study [Baumanometer Desk Mercury&#xD;
      Sphygmomanometer, SN: CT1573] complied with the requirements of ISO 81060-1 (the maximum&#xD;
      error was 1 mmHg per NIST traceable calibration verification.&#xD;
