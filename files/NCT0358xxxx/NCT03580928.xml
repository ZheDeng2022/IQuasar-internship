      This research study is evaluating the combination of three drugs - acalabrutinib, venetoclax,&#xD;
      and obinutuzumab -- as a possible treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acalabrutinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obinutuzmab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied. The FDA (the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved acalabrutinib for CLL, although it is&#xD;
      FDA-approved for patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. The FDA has approved venetoclax&#xD;
      and obinutuzumab separately for the treatment of patients with CLL. However, the FDA has not&#xD;
      approved the combination of these three drugs together (acalabrutinb, venetoclax, and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab) as a treatment for any disease. This combination is investigational. In this&#xD;
      research study, the investigators are trying to learn if giving the three drugs together can&#xD;
      safely and effectively treat CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. It blocks a type of protein called&#xD;
      Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By blocking BTK,&#xD;
      acalabrutinib may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. As of September 2017,&#xD;
      acalabrutinib has been administered to more than 2,000 people including healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      patients with cancers, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A few hundred patients with&#xD;
      CLL have been treated with acalabrutinib as a single drug, and some of these patients had&#xD;
      improvement of their cancer with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. It targets a protein on the&#xD;
      surface of the CLL cell, causing it to die. Obintuzumab has already been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      effective at treating CLL, and is FDA-approved when given together with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an oral drug that blocks the function of a protein called BCL-2. CLL cancer&#xD;
      cells are thought to depend on the BCL-2 protein for their survival. By blocking BCL-2,&#xD;
      venetoclax may kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Venetoclax has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and effective when given alone to treat patients with CLL and is FDA-approved for&#xD;
      patients with CLL after their disease has worsened after at least 1 prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, after 15 or 24 cycles of this investigational therapy, participants have a complete&#xD;
      response to the drugs in this trial -- meaning that the investigators cannot detect any CLL&#xD;
      using CT scans, bone marrow biopsy and a sensitive test called minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      testing -- participants will stop therapy with acalabrutinib and venetoclax. The&#xD;
      investigators will continue to monitor participants while they are off of therapy, and if the&#xD;
      CLL comes back participants will be able to restart acalabrutinib and venetoclax. The use of&#xD;
      MRD testing to identify small amounts of CLL is investigational, meaning that it has not been&#xD;
      FDA-approved. The use of results from this test to guide the decision to stop and re-start&#xD;
      therapy, as is done in the trial here, is also investigational.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with P-gp inhibitors or narrow therapeutic&#xD;

             require continuous administration of these agents, these patients are eligible if&#xD;
             there is a 3-day washout period between discontinuation of the P-gp inhibitor and&#xD;

             Investigator would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements, compromise the subject's safety, or put the study outcomes at&#xD;
             undue risk.&#xD;
