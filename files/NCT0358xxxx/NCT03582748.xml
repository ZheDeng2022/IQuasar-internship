  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is an important treatment option for morbidly obese patients who fail to&#xD;
      lose weight through diet and exercise. Despite intervention, 20-50% of patients either fail&#xD;
      to lose targeted amounts of weight or regain weight that was lost initially. Attempts at&#xD;
      predicting degree of weight loss have had only modest success and none have long term (&gt;2&#xD;
      year) reliability. Moreover, research predicting weight loss beyond the 1st or 2nd year&#xD;
      post-surgery and for outcomes other than weight loss including comorbidities common in the&#xD;
      bariatric population is lacking. The investigators' pilot data in 45 patients suggest that&#xD;
      individual differences on pre-surgical neural activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI)&#xD;
      reliably explains 33% of the variance in weight loss up to 1 year post surgery, and over 50%&#xD;
      of a multifaceted outcome measure, far outperforming many other indicators. These predictors&#xD;
      implicate regions that closely conform to a theoretical model emphasizing both consummatory&#xD;
      urges (a &quot;Now&quot; neural circuit) vs. regulation of craving and self-control (a &quot;Later&quot;&#xD;
      circuit). The central hypothesis in this study is that individual differences in these neural&#xD;
      pathways exert a powerful effect on the ability to sustain weight loss and achieve other key&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will replicate and refine this model over a longer timeframe and assess its&#xD;
      predictive utility for key weight-related health outcomes. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      replicate the model derived from their fMRI pilot data and secondarily to explore its&#xD;
      predictive utility for changes in calorie intake, activity levels, liver fat, hemoglobin A1c,&#xD;
      plasma lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose in a new, independent cohort of N=150&#xD;
      successively consenting, presurgical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) patients in study years 1-3. The&#xD;
      study will follow the pilot cohort for up to 7 years and the new cohort for 3 or more years&#xD;
      to determine if predictors replicated in Aim 1 retain their long-term predictive power,&#xD;
      particularly when supplemented with non-brain imaging variables and using a larger&#xD;
      longitudinal dataset. The study will use imaging and non-imaging data to develop multivariate&#xD;
      statistical models incorporating energy balance, fMRI, and laboratory values with the&#xD;
      variables described in Aim 1 to help to separate predictors vs. consequences of post-surgical&#xD;
      outcomes. To help separate scan-to-scan variability from true post-surgical,&#xD;
      trajectory-related brain changes, the study will enroll N=20 obese subjects who will not&#xD;
      undergo bariatric surgery, and are individually matched with the above SG subjects. Finally,&#xD;
      the study will evaluate whether several related, non-fMRI cognitive tests might potentially&#xD;
      act as surrogates in clinical practice.&#xD;

    <measure>Regulation of Craving (ROC) functional MRI (fMRI) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>This task tests food cue- induced craving and the ability to regulate craving. Participants are given an instruction, see pictures of high-calorie foods (previously shown to increase craving) and then rate their craving on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot).</description>

    <measure>Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MID) fMRI Task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants see cues that they may win or lose money ($0, $1, $5), then wait for a variable anticipatory delay period, and respond to a rapidly presented target with a single button press to try to either win or avoid losing money.</description>

    <measure>Affective Pictures Paradigm (APP) fMRI Task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>This task examines neural activity elicited by incidental emotional processing that engages emotional systems. Forty-two single-face pictures (14 happy, 14 angry and 14 neutral expressions) are presented in pseudorandom order for 3 sec with a 9-sec inter-stimulus interval during which a fixation cross serves as a baseline measure. Participants are instructed to identify via button press whether the face was male or female.</description>
