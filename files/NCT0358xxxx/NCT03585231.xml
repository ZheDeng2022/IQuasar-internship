  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conversational agents (CAs) are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term&#xD;
      social-emotional connections with users through conversations. We have developed a CA for&#xD;
      cigarette smoking cessation. In a pilot randomized trial (N = 415), we will compare the&#xD;
      experimental messaging program (n = 155) with the standard of care national government&#xD;
      smoking cessation messaging program (n = 157), and then we will compare immediate (n=51)&#xD;
      versus delayed (n=51) access to the the experimental messaging program, to assess 12-week&#xD;
      usability, receptivity, and preliminary cessation results in adults in western Washington&#xD;
      State and nationally across the US who want to quit smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of cancer in the US, accounting for one-third&#xD;
      of all cancer deaths. Within the Fred Hutchinson Center's western Washington State 13-county&#xD;
      catchment area, there are enormous disparities in adult cigarette smoking rates. Our recently&#xD;
      completed WebQuit website RCT for smoking cessation had low engagement and no personalization&#xD;
      to users' needs. Fortunately, a potentially game-changing solution to the problems of&#xD;
      engagement and lack of personalization provide a new direction for my research. Advances in&#xD;
      machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are making it possible to&#xD;
      create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital&#xD;
      coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through&#xD;
      conversations. We have developed a CA for cigarette smoking cessation. In a pilot randomized&#xD;
      trial (N = 415), we will compare the experimental messaging program with the standard of care&#xD;
      national government smoking cessation messaging program, and then we will compare immediate&#xD;
      versus delayed access to the the experimental messaging program. Twelve-week usability,&#xD;
      receptivity, and preliminary cessation results will provide critical and timely pilot data.&#xD;
