  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among Veterans, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is reported to be as high as&#xD;
      47.3% and a third higher than the general population. Muscle wasting and dysfunction have&#xD;
      been identified as primary consequences of CKD. Disease-induced reductions in lean tissue&#xD;
      adversely affect muscle fatigability. Consequently, muscle fatigability may serve as a&#xD;
      potential limiting factor that contributes to activity limitations. However, there is a lack&#xD;
      of evidence informing our understanding of muscle fatigability in patients with CKD. Dialysis&#xD;
      treatment is a major factor contributing to the high financial costs of CKD care. Thus, in&#xD;
      addition to potential health and quality of life benefits, treatments capable of maintaining&#xD;
      kidney function or delaying the onset of dialysis treatment would provide substantial&#xD;
      socio-economic benefit. Both lean body mass and muscle fatigability may be improved through&#xD;
      strength training. Eccentric-overload (i.e. muscle lengthening) progressive resistance&#xD;
      exercise (PRE) has been shown to be safe and effective for a variety of chronic conditions.&#xD;
      Eccentric PRE using portable flywheel technology may provide a clinically viable treatment&#xD;
      option to combat muscle impairments in CKD given the cost effectiveness and minimal space&#xD;
      requirements for this mode of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility of the eccentric-overload PRE regimen for&#xD;
      Veterans with CKD stage 3 &amp; 4 predialysis using a prospective single-arm pre-test post-test&#xD;
      intervention design. The primary aim of the project is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      eccentric-overload PRE on muscle fatigability in Veterans with CKD Stages 3 &amp; 4 predialysis.&#xD;
      Feasibility of the regimen will be determined by the time needed to complete the 4-exercise&#xD;
      regimen and the perceived exertion levels reported by the study participants.&#xD;
