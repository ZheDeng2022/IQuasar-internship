      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease with no cure. Some people&#xD;
      with HIV have depression and other mood problems. They can have problems with thinking and&#xD;
      memory. Researchers think 2 chemicals in the brain may cause those problems. The chemicals&#xD;
      are serotonin and dopamine. The researchers want to take images to learn more about those&#xD;
      chemicals in HIV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how HIV affects serotonin and dopamine in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-70 with HIV who have been on antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-70&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must be already enrolled in protocol 13-N-0149.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a urine drug test. The results could be shared with&#xD;
           insurance companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who could be pregnant will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a physical exam and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1 or 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A needle will&#xD;
           guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein. A radioactive drug will be&#xD;
           injected into the plastic tube. This is a tracer that helps researchers understand the&#xD;
           PET images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have the dopamine scan will have to fast for 4-6 hours before the scan.&#xD;
           They will take a pill to help direct the tracer to the brain one hour before the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each scan will last about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to drink a lot of fluids and empty their bladder frequently&#xD;
           for the rest of the day after each scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: An extensive body of literature points towards neuronal brain injury in human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV-positive) subjects despite virological suppression of&#xD;
      the virus in the periphery under the effect of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Existing&#xD;
      evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) could be an important reservoir for&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) regardless of cumulative time on treatment. This results&#xD;
      in progressive neurocognitive dysfunction despite optimal treatment and peripheral control of&#xD;
      the infection. Even though structural imaging studies have described abnormalities in&#xD;
      optimally-treated HIV-positive subject population, there has been only a few attempts at&#xD;
      deciphering the cellular levels of brain damage in those subjects using in vivo molecular&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers. As part of CNS involvement, specific neurotransmitter systems including&#xD;
      the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are thought to be affected by the infection with&#xD;
      distinct neurological, cognitive and psychological manifestations, even in optimally-treated&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This protocol aims at identifying aspects of dopaminergic and serotonergic&#xD;
      dysfunction in optimally-treated HIV-positive subjects using high resolution positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) of the brain and radioligands targeted against the dopaminergic&#xD;
      (18F-FDOPA) and serotonergic (11C-DASB) systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will identify 25 eligible HIV-infected individuals and 50 eligible&#xD;
      HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals for the dopaminergic arm, and 20 HIV-infected individuals and&#xD;
      20 HIV-negative individuals for the serotonergic arm. Subjects will be selected from IRB&#xD;
      approved NIH protocols, self-referred or will be referred form outside providers/institutions&#xD;
      and those who meet eligibility criteria will be offered enrollment in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Subjects will undergo either a one-time 18F-FDOPA PET scan or a one-time 11C-DASB PET&#xD;
      scan or both, if eligible. HIV-positive subjects and HIV-negative individuals will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Influx constant (Ki) for 18F-FDOPA PET and Binding potential relative to&#xD;
&#xD;
      non-displaceable binding (BPND) values for 11C-DASB PET&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Illness or other condition that, in the opinion of the PI, may interfere with study&#xD;
             participation at the time of enrollment, including known history of significant&#xD;
             intracranial structural damage such as previous stroke(s) or history of intracranial&#xD;
             benign or malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions other than HAND associated with cognitive impairment or dementia such as&#xD;
             Alzheimer s, Parkinson s disease, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;30 minutes,&#xD;
             or seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A positive screening result for psychiatric diseases that are known to affect the&#xD;
             dopaminergic or serotonergic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current substance abuse that would interfere with PET scan results at the&#xD;
             investigators discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medications: use of any drug with known dopaminergic or serotonergic activity within 6&#xD;
             months prior to planned imaging date(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or Lactating women: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to study entry. Pregnancy testing&#xD;
             will also be performed in enrolled female participants prior to any radiation&#xD;
             exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior or planned/anticipated exposure to radiation due to clinical care or&#xD;
             participation in other research protocols, which would exceed the recommended&#xD;
             acceptable annual limit of radiation exposure once accounting for the requirements of&#xD;
             the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the Dopaminergic Arm (Groups A, B and C):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of any of the following drugs within 6 months from planned imaging date(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Haloperidol (increased intracerebral dopamine turnover caused by haloperidol may&#xD;
                  result in increased accumulation of 18F-DOPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (may result in increased accumulation of&#xD;
                  18F-DOPA in the brain)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Reserpine (reserpine-induced depletion of the contents of intraneuronal vesicles&#xD;
                  may prevent retention of 18F-DOPA in the brain)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Carbidopa/LDOPA (LDOPA competes with 18F-DOPA for DOPA decarboxylase activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Allergy to carbidopa&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note that HBV is not an exclusion criterion for groups A, B, D or E since it s not known to&#xD;
        have direct CNS pathology in the absence of advanced liver disease and cirrhosis.&#xD;
