    <measure>Effective Radiation Dose Following Injection of 18F-JNJ-64326067 per Organ</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Effective Dose (ED) per organ will be calculated using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment (OLINDA) software. After injection of 370 megaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-JNJ-64326067, a series of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images will be obtained over a period of up to 6 hours and corrected for attenuation by computed tomography (CT) transmission scans using PET/CT. The unit of radioactivity will be milli Sieverts per mega Becquerel (mSv/MBq) for each organ and the effective dose per participant. The final values will be averaged across the participants.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The ED for whole body will be calculated using OLINDA software. After injection of 370 MBq of 18F-JNJ-64326067, a series of whole-body PET images will be obtained over a period of up to 6 hours and corrected for attenuation by CT transmission scans using PET/CT.

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy for their age group on the basis of physical examination, medical&#xD;
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening or&#xD;
             Day 1 predose. If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the age of the&#xD;
             study population. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source&#xD;
             documents and initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Otherwise healthy for their age group on the basis of clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
             performed at screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or&#xD;
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included&#xD;
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not&#xD;
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under&#xD;
             study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and&#xD;
             initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be postmenopausal (must be documented by medical records or physician's&#xD;
             note). A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an&#xD;
             alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at&#xD;
             screening (greater than [&gt;] 40 International Units Per Liter/ milli International&#xD;
             Units Per milliLiter [IU/L) or mIU/mL]) in the postmenopausal range may be used to&#xD;
             confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal&#xD;
             replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH&#xD;
             measurement is insufficient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as&#xD;
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug, a man:&#xD;
&#xD;
             (a) who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had&#xD;
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (that is, condom). In&#xD;
             addition, their female partner should also use a highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control (example, hormonal contraception) for at least the same duration, (b) who is&#xD;
             sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom, (c) must agree not to&#xD;
             donate sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified for this&#xD;
             clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation exposure through prior participation in other research protocols or clinical&#xD;
             care in the last year in addition to the radiation exposure expected from&#xD;
             participation in this clinical study, such that radiation exposure exceeds the&#xD;
             effective dose of 50 milli sievert (mSv), which would be above the acceptable annual&#xD;
             limits established by the United State (US) Federal Guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematological disease, bronchospastic&#xD;
             respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid&#xD;
             disease, Parkinson's disease, infection, epilepsy or fits or unexplained black outs,&#xD;
             or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             antibodies (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
             of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-5) criteria within 6 months before screening or&#xD;
             positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse (opiates (including&#xD;
             methadone), cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, barbiturates,&#xD;
             3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and benzodiazepines) at screening or&#xD;
             admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and&#xD;
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy&#xD;
             that in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the sponsor's&#xD;
             medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
