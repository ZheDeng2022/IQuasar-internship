  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, double-blind, randomized, crossover study designed to compare the&#xD;
      effects of dietary supplementation with flax oil rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and fish&#xD;
      oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on oxylipin profiles over time (0 to 4 weeks) and&#xD;
      among obese females varying in their inflammatory state. Additional assessments will include&#xD;
      plasma fatty acid composition, adipokines, markers of adipocyte dysfunction and inflammation;&#xD;
      immune cell/monocyte fatty acid composition, and functional properties including their&#xD;
      metabolism and oxylipin production; and vascular function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A single site, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study designed to compare the effects of&#xD;
      flax oil and fish oil supplementation on the oxylipin profile in females with obesity (n=24).&#xD;
      Eligible participants will complete two supplementation phases (flax oil and fish oil rich in&#xD;
      DHA) and will be asked to attend 3 in-person clinic visits (0, 3, and 28 days) for blood and&#xD;
      urine collection during each phase. In addition to oxylipin profiles, assessments will&#xD;
      include plasma fatty acid composition, adipokines, markers of adipocyte dysfunction and&#xD;
      inflammation; immune cell/monocyte fatty acid composition, and functional properties&#xD;
      including their metabolism and oxylipin production; and vascular function. If participants&#xD;
      sign an optional consent form, vaginal fluid samples will be obtained at 0 and 28 days of&#xD;
      each Supplementation Phase and analyzed for oxylipin and immune cell profile.&#xD;
