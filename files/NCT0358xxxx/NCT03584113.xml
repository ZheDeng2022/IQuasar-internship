  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Association of Thoracic Surgery defines empyema as pus in the pleural space. It&#xD;
      is a common thoracic surgery presentation with an estimated 65,000 cases occurring annually&#xD;
      in the United States. Despite the high prevalence of empyemas, there has been no consensus as&#xD;
      to its optimal first line management. Methods of acceptable treatment currently include chest&#xD;
      tube insertion (thoracostomy), thoracostomy with fibrinolytics, decortication via a&#xD;
      thoracotomy (removal of fibrous peel on the lung) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery&#xD;
      (VATS) decortication. The investigators aim to determine the rate of re-intervention within&#xD;
      thirty days for adults presenting with empyema in the fibrinopurulent phase by comparing the&#xD;
      initial treatments of Interventional Radiology (IR) guided chest tube insertion with&#xD;
      intrapleural fibrinolytics (as per Multi-Institutional Sepsis 2 Trial; MIST 2 Trial) versus&#xD;
      VATS decortication. Currently, either of these treatments is considered first-line depending&#xD;
      on the surgeon and institutional preference.&#xD;

      2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgeons expert consensus statement for the&#xD;
      surgical management of empyema groups empyema into three entities. They are Parapneumonic&#xD;
      (stage I), Fibrinopurulent (Stage II) and Chronic Organizing (Stage III). Fibrinopurulent is&#xD;
      further characterized by bacterial invasion across the damaged lung epithelium with pH&lt;7.2,&#xD;
      glucose &lt;2.2mmol/L and LDH &gt;1000IU/L. These criteria along with a positive culture, gram&#xD;
      stain or observed pus, is defined as an empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high incidence of empyemas, there continues to be controversy regarding first&#xD;
      line management. Conventional thoracostomy has evolved to include the addition of&#xD;
      intrapleural fibrinolytics for those in the fibrinopurulent phase. Many different agents and&#xD;
      combinations of fibrinolytics have been described in the literature, as well as optimal&#xD;
      techniques for chest tube insertion. With respect to fibrinolytics, the most recent MIST 2&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) examined four separate treatment arms; double placebo, placebo&#xD;
      combined with intrapleural DNAse (5mg), intrapleural t-PA (10mg) with placebo, and&#xD;
      intrapleural t-PA (10mg) combined with DNase (5mg) for six doses over three days. This study&#xD;
      demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the reduction of pleural empyema in&#xD;
      the t-PA and DNase combined arm (P=0.005) when compared with all the other arms. This RCT has&#xD;
      established intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy as the gold standard treatment for those with&#xD;
      empyema. When considering thoracostomy itself, the literature overwhelmingly suggests that&#xD;
      image-guided thoracostomy decreases the rate of complications (pneumothorax, infection,&#xD;
      procedure failure, intercostal bleeding), compared with a blind chest tube insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane Systematic Review of eight trials (6 children and 2 adults) examining treatment&#xD;
      methods for empyema provided moderate quality evidence suggesting there were similar&#xD;
      complication rates between VATS decortication and chest tube drainage. The review also&#xD;
      demonstrated VATS decortication potentially decreases hospitalization length of stay. A&#xD;
      recent study examined 4,095 patients using the New York State database to investigate&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment for empyema with chest tube insertion, VATS decortication, or&#xD;
      open thoracotomy. Patients had a higher mortality during their initial hospital stay when&#xD;
      they received a chest tube compared with those who underwent a surgical approach (chest&#xD;
      tube:15.4%, VATS:4.7%, open: 6.0%, p&lt;0.001. Additionally, patients' readmission rate within&#xD;
      thirty days was significantly higher for the chest tube group (6.1%) compared with the&#xD;
      surgical group (VATS 1.9% and open: 2.1%, p&lt;0.001) lending support that an initial surgical&#xD;
      approach for empyema may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate adult RCTs have attempted to compare VATS decortication to thoracostomy with&#xD;
      fibrinolytics. Wait et al. in 1997 used a small study population of twenty patients in each&#xD;
      arm, randomizing participants to either bedside thoracostomy with streptokinase or VATS&#xD;
      decortication. This study demonstrated that in adults with a fibrinopurulent effusion, VATS&#xD;
      decortication is associated with an increased rate of empyema resolution and a shorter length&#xD;
      of stay. A review article published by Chambers et al examined twenty-eight studies,&#xD;
      comparing decortication via thoracotomy to VATS decortication for empyema. The majority of&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that VATS has a decreased length of hospital stay, decreased&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and decreased post-operative pain. Furthermore, there was a higher&#xD;
      resolution of empyema during the fibrinopurulent phase. Despite these two studies&#xD;
      demonstrating superior outcomes with VATs decortication, they still do not compare modern day&#xD;
      standards of treatment for empyema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the above literature suggests, there have been multiple proposed methods for first-line&#xD;
      treatment of an empyema. However, there have not been any studies that compare modern&#xD;
      standards of practice. Image-guided chest tube insertion has been shown to be superior to&#xD;
      bedside chest tube insertion. Fibrinolytics administered as per MIST2 protocol has become the&#xD;
      standard of practice at many institutions. Furthermore, VATS decortication has shown&#xD;
      promising outcomes as first-line treatment and is associated with decreased morbidity&#xD;
      compared with an open thoracotomy approach. Therefore, it is being proposed to compare&#xD;
      image-guided chest tube insertion with MIST 2 trial fibrinolytics (six treatments of DNAse&#xD;
      5mg and t-PA 10mg over three days) to VATS decortication for the primary treatment of adults&#xD;
      presenting with empyema in the fibrinopurulent phase. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
      rate of re-intervention required within thirty days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN/ METHODOLOGY This is a randomized control trial occurring at the&#xD;
      Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC). Empyema is a disease that is best managed with the&#xD;
      expertise at an institution with thoracic surgeons. The standard practice is that once the&#xD;
      diagnosis is made at another hospital in our LHIN, these patients are transferred to our&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a baseline CT Chest to confirm the presence of an empyema. Participants&#xD;
      will have a diagnostic pleural thoracentesis performed by their primary care team initially&#xD;
      to determine whether the pleural fluid is an exudate suggestive of an empyema in its&#xD;
      fibrinopurulent phase (see inclusion criteria). Once this is performed and the diagnosis of&#xD;
      an empyema is obtained, patients in our LHIN not at KHSC will be transferred as usual to KHSC&#xD;
      to be managed by the thoracic surgery team. For patients under the care of a different&#xD;
      service at KHSC, they will be transferred to be under the care of the thoracic surgery team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once admitted under the thoracic surgery service, the study team will be notified and&#xD;
      information will be provided to the patients. Informed consent will be obtained at this time&#xD;
      by a member of the study team. Using an online randomization tool, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into either the image-guided thoracostomy combined with MIST 2 Trial fibrinolytics&#xD;
      arm or the VATS decortication arm. Both procedures will be carried out within forty-eight&#xD;
      hours of participant arrival. Both arms will also receive concurrent IV broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics. The image-guided thoracostomy arm will go to the interventional radiology suite&#xD;
      where a 12-24Fr chest tube will be inserted at the discretion of the interventional&#xD;
      radiologist based on the specific clinical picture. Data will be collected during their stay.&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be to determine the rate of reintervention required,&#xD;
      including additional chest tube insertion or surgery. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      mortality, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. Data will be collected 30 days&#xD;
      after their initial intervention to determine if any re-intervention was necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repeat CT Chest will be performed prior to discharge, clinical consideration of chest tube&#xD;
      removal, or if there is no clinical improvement.&#xD;
