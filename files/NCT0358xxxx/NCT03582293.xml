      Rationale: Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a frequently occurring disease, occurring&#xD;
      mainly in the elderly. Surgical evacuation is effective, but also associated with&#xD;
      life-threatening risks. In these old, often frail, patients with multi-comorbidity, surgery&#xD;
      also comes with significant risks for future cognitive functioning and therefore, loss of&#xD;
      independency. In five small retrospective series, tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      drug, showed a beneficial effect on the spontaneous resolution of the hematoma and, with&#xD;
      that, the necessity for surgery. This randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to&#xD;
      prove the efficacy of TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primarily to evaluate the efficacy of TXA to prevent surgery for cSDH.&#xD;
      Secondarily to evaluate the efficacy of TXA to reduce cSDH volume, neurological impairment&#xD;
      (mNIHSS), the incidence of falling incidents, the mortality rate, the use of care and&#xD;
      health-related costs (iMCQ and iPCQ), to improve cognitive functioning (MOCA), performance in&#xD;
      activities of daily living (Barthel and Lawton-Brody), functional outcome (mRS), the level of&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients, age 50 and above, diagnosed with cSDH for whom a conservative&#xD;
      treatment is selected as primary treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention group will receive oral TXA 500mg twice daily for 4 weeks, the&#xD;
      control group will receive a placebo twice daily. The TXA or placebo treatment is additional&#xD;
      to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoint: The number of patients requiring surgery within 12 weeks after start&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients will use the study medication twice daily for four weeks. Follow-up is&#xD;
      at 4, 8and 12 weeks with a standard CT-scan of the head, outpatient clinic visits and 4&#xD;
      patient-reported questionnaires. These outpatient clinic visits are standard care; the third&#xD;
      CT-scan, the questionnaires and extra clinical tests are extra. Each patient may benefit from&#xD;
      the study if the study medication proves effective in preventing surgery for cSDH, whereas&#xD;
      the risk of potential side effects of the medication is slight (e.g. the risk of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events is only 0.01-0.1%). Surgery remains a possibility for those patients in&#xD;
      whom study medication is not effective.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a frequently occurring&#xD;
      neurological disease of the elderly and common in daily neurosurgical practice. It consists&#xD;
      of an extracerebral encapsulated collection of mostly liquefied old hematoma, located between&#xD;
      the dura and arachnoid. The original small, and often asymptomatic, haemorrhage is caused by&#xD;
      rupture of a bridging vein after, often minor, head trauma. Due to generalized cerebral&#xD;
      atrophy, increased venous fragility, and the more frequent use of anticoagulation therapy,&#xD;
      older people are more at risk of developing a cSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During several weeks, the original hematoma is encapsulated by a membrane consisting of weak&#xD;
      neocapillaries from where recurrent small bleedings occur. The pathophysiological mechanism&#xD;
      is thought to be a problem in the local haemostasis due to fibrin degradation products of the&#xD;
      original small hematoma that inhibit further haemostasis in the subdural space. Together with&#xD;
      an osmotic draw of water, owing to its high protein content, this results in growth of the&#xD;
      hematoma. Therefore, it usually takes several weeks for the cSDH to grow and become&#xD;
      symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs and symptoms arise due to compression of brain tissue. These can be generalised, such&#xD;
      as headaches, light-headedness, cognitive disturbances, apathy, somnolence, seizures,&#xD;
      frequent falling and depression. Also focal deficits, such as dysphasia, motor weakness or&#xD;
      sensory disturbances, can be symptoms of a cSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current incidence of cSDH is estimated to be 15/100,000 per year. The number of patients&#xD;
      with cSDH is expected to increase considerably in the near future due to the continuing&#xD;
      growth of the elderly population, and the increase in the use of anticoagulation and&#xD;
      anti-aggregation therapy. By 2030, the incidence is expected to rise up to 20/100,000 per&#xD;
      year, thus making cSDH the most common neurosurgical condition in adults. In The Netherlands,&#xD;
      this comes down to 3,600 new patients each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Treatment options are conservative and surgical. Conservative treatment currently&#xD;
      consists of a wait-and-scan policy in which the patient is regularly monitored for&#xD;
      neurological deterioration and growth of the hematoma on follow-up imaging. Anticoagulation&#xD;
      and antiplatelet therapy is discontinued in low-risk patients, based on individual&#xD;
      risk-benefit assessment and the discretion of the treating physician. If the clinical&#xD;
      condition of the patient worsens, the indication for surgical evacuation of the hematoma is&#xD;
      re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous resolution of cSDH with a conservative treatment occurs in approximately 2.5% of&#xD;
      patients, and is therefore relatively rare. Of all patients diagnosed with cSDH in The&#xD;
      Netherlands, about 50% is primarily treated conservatively. Of these, around 75% still need&#xD;
      an operation (own data). If the symptoms are serious or worsen over time, surgical evacuation&#xD;
      of the hematoma is currently the designated therapy. This therapy is an effective treatment,&#xD;
      but is also associated with life-threatening risks. In these old, often frail, patients with&#xD;
      multi-comorbidity, surgery comes with significant risks for future cognitive functioning and,&#xD;
      therefore, loss of independency. In a large series of 1205 patients, symptomatic recurrence&#xD;
      after surgery was 9%, mortality 2% and unfavourable functional outcome 22%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement Studies evaluating quality of life and functional outcome with cSDH&#xD;
      patients are scarce. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score is usually the only clinical&#xD;
      outcome parameter. A literature search for quality of life in cSDH results in only two&#xD;
      clinical studies. The first used the postoperative mRS, Barthel Index and Sickness Impact&#xD;
      Profile as outcome measurements; the second used a pre- and postoperative Karnofsky&#xD;
      Performance Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid As hyperfibrinolysis is thought to play a role in the liquefaction and&#xD;
      enlargement of cSDH, pharmaceutical options to block fibrinolysis have been explored in an&#xD;
      effort to eliminate the necessity for surgery. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA), an&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic drug, has so far been reported in five small series. In the first&#xD;
      retrospective series, a total of 21 patients were treated with TXA, of whom three after&#xD;
      primary burr hole surgery. In none of these 21 patients, additional surgery was necessary.&#xD;
      The second, a prospective pilot study in 14 patients, showed a 41% reduction of cSDH after&#xD;
      surgery, and an additional 91% residual volume reduction on CT after 90 days, during oral TXA&#xD;
      treatment of 650 mg per day, for a mean (SD) duration of 90 (27) days, without recurrence,&#xD;
      re-expansion, or any complicating venous thromboembolisms. The third study, a case report&#xD;
      series of three patients treated with 650mg TXA per day for one month after surgery for cSDH,&#xD;
      showed no recurrences and thromboembolic complications. The fourth, a case report of one&#xD;
      patient successfully treated primarily with TXA, was recently published, and finally, in the&#xD;
      abstract of a Asian article, the authors conclude that administration of Gorei-San, a&#xD;
      Japanese herbal Kampo medicine, combined with TXA has the potential to prevent recurrences of&#xD;
      cSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these limited, however promising, data no definitive conclusion can be made regarding&#xD;
      the role of TXA in the treatment of cSDH. Therefore, a prospective study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TXA is needed. Currently, two prospective trials (the TRACS study and&#xD;
      the TRACE study are running in an effort to answer this question. The first study, a phase 2b&#xD;
      trial with the aim to provide preliminary data required to plan a larger phase III trial,&#xD;
      excludes patients using anticoagulants. These patients comprise a significant portion of the&#xD;
      cSDH patient population, and therefore, the results of the TRACS study will be difficult to&#xD;
      extrapolate to the future care of all cSDH patients. The second study (TRACE) is a&#xD;
      randomised, observer blinded trial, investigating the value of treating cSDH patients with&#xD;
      TXA after surgery. This is a different patient population than proposed in the investigators'&#xD;
      trial, in which they plan to include only patients in whom the primary treatment is&#xD;
      conservative. Also, both trials are set up with a primary radiological outcome parameter and&#xD;
      therefore potentially provide insufficient clinically relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase III trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of TXA as an addition to a&#xD;
      primary conservative treatment of cSDH, in an effort to prevent surgery for cSDH. Since&#xD;
      surgical treatment under general anaesthesia and a hospital admittance of a minimum of two&#xD;
      days is associated with significant morbidity, as described earlier, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that preventing surgery also prevents deterioration of patients' quality of life. This trial&#xD;
      is also the first in describing functional outcome and quality of life of cSDH patients in a&#xD;
      prospective manner. Since the target population partially comprises patients with a depressed&#xD;
      level of consciousness, and patients using anticoagulants and antiplatelets, these patient&#xD;
      groups will be included in this trial as well.&#xD;
