      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell&#xD;
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genetic mutation. The&#xD;
      EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in the&#xD;
      genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients who&#xD;
      have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or &quot;inhibit&quot;) the effect of the mutation in the EGFR&#xD;
      gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Osimertinib has been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

             of receiving commercial osimertinib therapy (up to 84 days of commercial osimertinib&#xD;
             before entering the study). In order to enter the study after starting commercial&#xD;
             osimertinib, subjects must meet all eligibility criteria listed above, have baseline&#xD;
             and follow up imaging available for review for response assessment, and must not have&#xD;
             developed disease progression during the first 3 months of commercial osimertinib&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy, including CNS radiation, within 2 weeks of the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) disease, including parenchymal brain&#xD;
             metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord compression. Patients with&#xD;
             asymptomatic untreated brain metastases are eligible. Patients with treated CNS&#xD;
             disease will be allowed to enroll provided they have asymptomatic clinically confirmed&#xD;
             stable disease with ≥2 weeks since definitive CNS therapy (radiation or surgery) and&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it&#xD;
                  undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize&#xD;
                  compliance with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  known active infection or ongoing antiviral medication for viral infections&#xD;
                  including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
                  Screening for chronic conditions is not required. HIV-positive participants on&#xD;
                  combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
                  pharmacokinetic interactions with osimertinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of&#xD;
             birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine&#xD;
             or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry. Women of child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of osimertinib on the&#xD;
             development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with osimertinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with osimertinib.&#xD;
