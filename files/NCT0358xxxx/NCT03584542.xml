  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several years, the French Addictovigilance Network (FAN) highlights potential problematic&#xD;
      consumptions with zolpidem. To prevent abuse and misuse of zolpidem, the French Health&#xD;
      Products Agency has changed the regulatory framework of zolpidem prescription. Thus, since&#xD;
      the 10th of April 2017 zolpidem prescriptions have to be secured (particular support, dosage&#xD;
      written out). The investigators hypothesized that this change will affect zolpidem&#xD;
      consumption but also the consumption of all sedative drugs. In order to assess the incidence&#xD;
      of the regulatory change for zolpidem prescription the investigators conduct a two part&#xD;
      study: an epidemiological study with French National Health Insurance Fund for Employees&#xD;
      database and an observational study with general practitioners and zolpidem consumers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several aspects of the incidence will be assessed (number of zolpidem consumers, change in&#xD;
      consumption profile, and consumption of other sedative drugs) before and after the regulatory&#xD;
      framework change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiological study will enable us to respond to all these aspects and it will be&#xD;
      completed by the observational study with practitioners and patients that have been affected&#xD;
      by the regulatory framework change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners will be interviewed by phone about their perception of the regulatory&#xD;
      framework change, their attitudes towards their patients with zolpidem prescription and the&#xD;
      drugs they used if they had changed the patients prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consumers included in the study will have to fulfill a self-questionnaire about their&#xD;
      perception of the regulatory framework change, their attitudes towards their consumption of&#xD;
      zolpidem (stop, diminution, replacement) and their favorite replacement drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of regulatory prescription change of zolpidem will have a pleiotropic impact which&#xD;
      can't be evaluated on a single criterion. It must be considered in a global, multifocal&#xD;
      manner. This is why several criteria will be used to assess several incidence and several&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These different approaches will enable us to respond to three questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the impact on the number of consumers? Prevalence and incidence of zolpidem&#xD;
           consumers over several periods (before and after the regulatory prescription change)&#xD;
           will be evaluated from French National Health Insurance Fund for Employees database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the impact on consumption patterns of zolpidem? The investigators will assess&#xD;
           different patterns of zolpidem consumption (i) occasional use versus chronic use will be&#xD;
           assessed from French National Health Insurance Fund for Employees database and from&#xD;
           consumers of general medicine and specialized centers for drug addict patients (ii)&#xD;
           problematic use (consumption not in accordance with summary of product characteristics&#xD;
           according to at least one of these parameters: duration of consumption, dosage, manner&#xD;
           in which zolpidem is obtained, route of administration, or seeking psychoactive effects&#xD;
           different from hypnotic effect) versus no problematic use will be assessed from French&#xD;
           National Health Insurance Fund for Employees database and from consumers of general&#xD;
           medicine and specialized centers for drug addict patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the impact on consumption of other sedatives drugs? The investigators will look&#xD;
           for reports of zolpidem prescriptions on other drugs and if reports are maintained from&#xD;
           French National Health Insurance Fund for Employees database, general practitioners will&#xD;
           be interviewed about change in their prescriptions and their preferred drug for&#xD;
           replacement, and consumers of general medicine and specialized centers for drug addict&#xD;
           patients will be asked about their attitudes towards their consumption of zolpidem&#xD;
           (stop, diminution, replacement) and their favorite replacement drug.&#xD;
