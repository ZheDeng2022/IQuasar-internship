    <textblock>
      APG-1387 is a potent, bivalent small-molecule IAP antagonist. This study is multi-center,&#xD;
      single-agent, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation study of APG-1387.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has a 4-dose-schedule which is escalated one by one after confirming safety in the&#xD;
      previous lower dose schedule. A total of 60 subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B will be&#xD;
      participated in the study. APG-1387 will be administrated via intravenous infusion, once a&#xD;
      week for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle.The start dose is 7mg. 3 patients' cohorts will be&#xD;
      evaluated, the dose of APG-1387 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 12mg, 20 mg, 30&#xD;
      mg, 45 mg accordingly. 3 patients in 7mg,12mg cohorts and 6 patients in 20mg, 30mg and 45mg&#xD;
      cohorts will be recruited. If there is any one of the following event is observed within 28&#xD;
      days of the first dose of APG-1387, the recruitment will be hold and a discussion on MTD dose&#xD;
      level will happened.1 ≥1/2 patients experience ≥Grade 2 toxicities[CTCAE 4.0.3] related or&#xD;
      possibly related with APG-1387 and with clinical manifestation. 2 ≥1/3 patients experience&#xD;
      ≥Grade 3 toxicities[CTCAE 4.0.3] related or possibly related with APG-1387.3 any SAE related&#xD;
      or possibly related with APG-1387. Expansion study will be designed to explore primary&#xD;
      efficacy and safety after the dose escalation study. The expansion number and dosage will be&#xD;
      decided according to the results of each cohort.(no more than 36 patients).&#xD;
