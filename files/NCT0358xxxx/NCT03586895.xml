  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to create e-Connect: a new service delivery model that will enable&#xD;
      real time identification and targeted, county-specific referral and linkage of participants&#xD;
      with suicidal behavior (SB) and related behavioral health (BH) problems. e-Connect will: (i)&#xD;
      establish and formalize interagency referral decisions based on clinical need, jointly&#xD;
      derived by JJ (juvenile justice) and BH agencies; (ii) train probation staff to increase&#xD;
      BH/SB understanding; (iii) utilize an existing evidence-based (EB) BH/SB screen; and (iv)&#xD;
      develop a mobile application to seamlessly integrate screening, classification of clinical&#xD;
      need and development of a related referral plan. There are 4 project phases: Development,&#xD;
      Baseline, Implementation, and Sustainment/Evaluation. After development, activities take&#xD;
      place in 10 NY (New York) counties, 9 of which will be randomized to one of 3 Waves, to begin&#xD;
      implementation of e-Connect at 4m intervals in a Stepped-Wedge design (Hemming, Haines,&#xD;
      Chilton, Girling, &amp; Lilford, 2015). The 10th county will serve as a pilot site. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine changes in outcomes (e.g., service use) relative to baseline in&#xD;
      (i) identification of participants service need (SB and BH correlates) in juvenile&#xD;
      probationers; (ii) cross-system (probation-BH agency) referral; and (iii) participants BH&#xD;
      service use (access and engagement). Analyses will further consider contributions of&#xD;
      multi-level factors (e.g., staff, organizational, family, and community) that influence&#xD;
      implementation (feasibility, acceptability, sustainability) of e-Connect across various&#xD;
      probation department processing categories (e.g. status offenders, diversion cases). The&#xD;
      investigators will consider the role of mediating elements (e.g., probation practices) in&#xD;
      explaining the association between e-Connect and identification, referral, and service use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While youth at all juvenile justice (JJ) processing points are at increased risk for suicidal&#xD;
      behavior (SB) and associated behavioral health (BH) issues, those supervised in community&#xD;
      settings (e.g., probation), may be at greatest risk: (a) protocols for identification and&#xD;
      service referral are far more common in secure settings, (b) national policy increasingly&#xD;
      favors community supervision/diversion over incarceration, (c) participants supervised in the&#xD;
      community have far more access to means and opportunity than do those in secure settings, and&#xD;
      (d) the multi- system coordination challenges to accessing BH care for community JJ&#xD;
      participants are far greater than for those secure care. The investigators propose to adapt&#xD;
      and test the utility of a multi-level service delivery model that increases identification of&#xD;
      SB and related BH problems, guides targeted referral, trains staff and structures interagency&#xD;
      collaboration to increase uptake of BH services by participants on probation; and document&#xD;
      the organizational elements required to widely-implement this model in juvenile probation and&#xD;
      community treatment settings. The model is based on our earlier, evidence-based linkage&#xD;
      protocols from Project Connect, and capitalizes on technological advances unavailable at&#xD;
      Connect's 2007 development, so as to address earlier implementation issues. Working in 9 NYS&#xD;
      counties, project specific aims are (1) to develop technologically advanced cross-system&#xD;
      identification/linkage service model that trains staff, formalizes interagency collaboration&#xD;
      and referral decision-making and uses a mobile application to seamlessly combine (a)&#xD;
      screening for SB and related BH problems, (b) classification of clinical need and (c)&#xD;
      county-specific streamlined referral plans for BH services; (2) to examine the degree to&#xD;
      which, compared to Baseline, e- Connect improves (a) intermediary PO practice outcomes&#xD;
      (service need identification, cross-system referral) and increasing (b) participants BH&#xD;
      service use (access, engagement); and (3) to elucidate multi-level factors (e.g., staff,&#xD;
      organizational, participants/family, community,) that influence implementation (feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, sustainability) of e-Connect across various probation department processing&#xD;
      categories (e.g. status offenders, diversion cases) to inform comprehensive scale-up. The&#xD;
      theoretically based mechanisms (e.g., changes in staff knowledge and self-efficacy; agency&#xD;
      structural characteristics) by which PO practice change affects BH service use will also be&#xD;
      examined. Guided by the GPM and CFIR framework, this 5-year study will comprise 4 project&#xD;
      phases: (1) Development, (2) Baseline data collection, (3) Implementation, and (4)&#xD;
      Sustainment. After development, counties are randomized to one of 4 Waves to begin&#xD;
      implementation of e-Connect at 4-month intervals in a stepped-wedge design. Implementation&#xD;
      activities continue for 18m and sites' use of e-Connect protocols after 18m will be an&#xD;
      indication of sustainability. This initiative is one of the first to address SB and advance&#xD;
      JJ participants enrollment in BH treatment. Because the investigators propose addressing risk&#xD;
      and acute SB, this study has the likelihood of identifying and linking to services high-risk,&#xD;
      high need participants that are often overlooked.&#xD;
