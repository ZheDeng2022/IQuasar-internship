  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the dynamic changes of the intestinal microbiome are observed over a&#xD;
      4-week period in the different stages of the menstrual cycle in women at childbearing age.&#xD;
      The focus is on how the dynamic changes of sex hormones during a menstrual cycle of women at&#xD;
      childbearing age (with or without contraception) are related to microbiological colonization&#xD;
      of the gut. In Addition the Expression of the β-glucuronidase by the bacteria will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our gut has a complex and diverse bacterial population which is called the microbiome. The&#xD;
      number of bacteria in the intestine is estimated to exceed 10^14. The composition of the&#xD;
      microbiome is individual and changes over the lifetime of the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of a healthy microbiome consists more than 90% of bacteria from the&#xD;
      Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla types. Nevertheless the microbiome varies even between&#xD;
      healthy individuals and evolves over the lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the microorganisms are not pathogen, thus they have been shown to interact with&#xD;
      several physiological processes in our body. In Addition it has been shown that the bacterial&#xD;
      population has an impact on building our gut epithelial cells, our immunology and the defence&#xD;
      against pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly estrogen and the microbiome seem to be under reciprocal influence. In our body&#xD;
      estrogen is only active in the deconjugated form. Therefore, after it was conjugated in the&#xD;
      liver, the bacteria in the gut can perform a deconjugation through the secretion of the&#xD;
      enzyme ß-glucuronidase. Ultimately, the activated estrogen is going back into blood&#xD;
      circulation, otherwise it would leave the body through bile excretion. The composition of the&#xD;
      microbiome is fundamental, because the presence and abundance of different gene expressions&#xD;
      varies between the different types of bacteria. The bacterial genes which are responsible for&#xD;
      metabolizing estrogens are called the estrobolome. However, data whether there is a&#xD;
      relationship of the changes of the sex hormones during the menstrual cycle and the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome in women is sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts of the estrogens circulating in the body are metabolised in the liver and are then&#xD;
      secreted to the intestine conjugated with glucuronide. The intestinal microbiota could&#xD;
      potentially affect estrogen metabolism via Beta-glucuronidase activity. Beta-glucuronidase is&#xD;
      an enzyme that catalyses the deconjugation of estrogen. As a consequence, it may bind to&#xD;
      estrogen receptors and unfold its downstream effects.&#xD;

    <description>Parts of the estrogens circulating in the body are metabolised in the liver and are then secreted to the intestine conjugated with glucuronide. The intestinal microbiota could potentially affect estrogen metabolism via β-glucuronidase activity. β-glucuronidase is an enzyme that catalyses the deconjugation of estrogen. As a consequence, it may bind to estrogen receptors and unfold its downstream effects.&#xD;
RNA and total DNA will be extracted from the fecal samples and microbiome community composition will be assessed by sequencing the 16s ribosomal RNA gene. Then reverse transcription of the total RNA and targeted amplification and sequencing of β-glucuronidase gene fragment will be applied in order to find out which bacteria are producing the β-glucuronidase enzyme.&#xD;
Furthermore, the enzymatic activity in the samples will be measured using the β-glucuronidase colorimetric assay with p-nitrophenol glucuronide.</description>
