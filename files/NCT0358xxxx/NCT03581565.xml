  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cement retention has been widely used for implant-supported fixed partial dentures in daily&#xD;
      dental practice. The cementation approach indeed offers straightforward clinical application&#xD;
      protocol which is basically conceptualized for tooth/teeth supported fixed restorations.&#xD;
      However, removal of excess cement around implant restorations presents specific difficulties.&#xD;
      More importantly, there are certain biological consequences due to residual cement leftover&#xD;
      in peri-implant sulcus. There is no evidence based guidance with regards to cementation&#xD;
      techniques applied for implant supported fixed restorations due to limited clinical studies.&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this clinical trial is to compare three different cementation technique&#xD;
      with regards to removal of excess cement and other clinical subsidiaries (abutment margin,&#xD;
      crown surface and contour) involving indirectly as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-tooth implant crowns to replace missing molar tooth were addressed to qualify and&#xD;
      quantify residual cement on implant-abutment complex and peri-implant soft tissue following&#xD;
      cementation. Thirty bone-level dental implants of one kind enrolled in the study. Prior to&#xD;
      delivery of screw-retained crowns completed for usual treatment, implants were allocated&#xD;
      randomly to a trial comparison group. Three different cement loading approach, ten in each&#xD;
      group, was applied using cement-retained trial crowns on prefabricated metal abutments.&#xD;
      Following completion of the assigned cementation technique, the trial crown was removed with&#xD;
      its abutment accessing from the occlusal hole prepared after removal of excess cement. Then,&#xD;
      the presence of residual cement on implant-abutment complex and implant soft tissue in&#xD;
      accordance with axial and proximal surfaces was qualified. To quantify the amount of residual&#xD;
      cement in accordance with location and distribution, the crown-abutment complex was digitized&#xD;
      three-dimensionally using an intra-oral scanner. The output of surface data was evaluated in&#xD;
      virtual 3-D image for cement excess, when detected location in the abutment-crown complex is&#xD;
      recorded, area and distribution was calculated using a software. The frequency of occurrence&#xD;
      and quantity of residual cement of 3-different cementation techniques was statistically&#xD;
      evaluated using logistic and linear regression model separately considering abutment margin,&#xD;
      crown surface and contour.&#xD;
