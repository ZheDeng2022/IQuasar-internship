  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-armed randomized cross-over comparison of leakage with nasal prongs and&#xD;
      nasal mask interface in newborn infants treated with CPAP, born after 28 weeks of gestational&#xD;
      age. For infants with an interface leakage, the trial also includes an observational part&#xD;
      evaluating simple measures to reduce leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in the Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm and in the&#xD;
      Östersund Hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit a total of 50 infants receiving CPAP for respiratory support at the&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital and the Östersund Hospital. The infant should be stable and&#xD;
      not in major respiratory distress. Consent from the parents will be obtained before&#xD;
      enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included infants should have stable spontaneous breathing and be older than 28 weeks&#xD;
      (corrected age) at the time of enrolment. The reason for respiratory failure and CPAP&#xD;
      treatment is not relevant for study purposes. If an infant cannot participate in the study at&#xD;
      a given time, he or she can be enrolled later. A child can only participate once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is leakage. This is recorded using equipment for measuring air flow&#xD;
      during CPAP treatment. Measurement of leakage is first performed for one interface and then&#xD;
      the next (cross-over). The interface order is randomized. The leakage will be measured after&#xD;
      a few minutes of stabilization (part 1). If there is leakage, a few simple measures to reduce&#xD;
      the leakage will be evaluated (part 2). The second part will approximately add 10-20 minutes&#xD;
      and includes simple measures such as adjusting the nasal mask, closing the mouth, changing&#xD;
      the position or changing the size of nasal mask/prongs. Part 1 and part 2 are then repeated&#xD;
      for the next interface. If the child shows signs of distress or agitation the measurement&#xD;
      will be paused or stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: The CPAP system with the randomized interface (nasal mask or nasal prongs) is applied&#xD;
      and adjusted by experienced NICU staff. The staff is blinded for the outcome variable,&#xD;
      leakage. The choice of size and other adjustments are guided by clinical experience and not&#xD;
      by protocol. The NICU staff is not allowed to participate in the explorative part where&#xD;
      measures to reduce leakage are evaluated. This precaution is to avoid staff learning what&#xD;
      adjustments affect leakage and influence care of infants enrolled at a later stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: In this part the investigators can evaluate the effect of simple measures to minimize&#xD;
      the leakage. The level of leakage is displayed on a screen. Examples of measures are; closing&#xD;
      the mouth of the infant, adjusting straps, adjusting position and changing the size of the&#xD;
      interface. Not every child will undergo all measures to reduce leakage, since the aim of this&#xD;
      explorative part is to explore ways to reduce leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that these tests and measures will take 15-60 minutes per child. No other&#xD;
      measurements or follow-up is planned. No blood samples will be collected or analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect information on the infant and the birth. This includes birth weight,&#xD;
      gestational age at birth, gender, previous respiratory support and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome variable is absolute leakage (via mouth or via CPAP interface). Other&#xD;
      collected variables are oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, inspired oxygen concentration,&#xD;
      apneas, heart rate, if the infant is awake/asleep or in distress. Safety variables include&#xD;
      skin irritation or damage of the nose caused by the interface, instability or deterioration&#xD;
      of respiration or circulation, problems with the equipment or other adverse events. The&#xD;
      investigation can be stopped immediately in the case of distress or instability. The study&#xD;
      is, as far as the investigators know, the first one of its kind. The air flow meters do not&#xD;
      affect the CPAP system and use a technique that measures the total leakage in L/min. These&#xD;
      improvements have been emphasized in previous studies. The study follows GCP (good clinical&#xD;
      practice) standards and The Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
