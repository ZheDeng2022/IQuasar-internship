      The Researchers are trying to determine the paths of change in imaging biomarkers of Dementia&#xD;
      with Lewy bodies (DLB) and their associations with rate of cognitive and functional decline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will enroll 90 subjects with probable DLB, 60 from Mayo Clinic Rochester&#xD;
      (MCR) and 30 from Mayo Clinic Jacksonville (MCJ). Additionally, 45 controls will be enrolled,&#xD;
      30 from MCR and 15 from MCJ. We will obtain up to six assessments in each subject over the 5&#xD;
      years of the study, baseline, six month and annually thereafter. We will follow these cohorts&#xD;
      with clinical and biospecimen data collection annually and once at six months, and CSF&#xD;
      collection annually within the guidelines of the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker's Program&#xD;
      (PDBP). Clinical neuroimaging will be performed annually and include: a) dopamine transporter&#xD;
      imaging with Ioflupane (123I) SPECT (DaTscan) as the biomarker of LBD-related loss of&#xD;
      dopaminergic activity, b) structural MRI AD- signature atrophy as the biomarker of AD-related&#xD;
      neurodegeneration, c) β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition on PET as the biomarker of Aβ pathology. In&#xD;
      patients from the MCR site, we will investigate AV-1451 PET. Since the specificity of AV-1451&#xD;
      PET is not established for tau deposition in DLB, we will investigate this biomarker in a&#xD;
      subset of DLB patients to determine the pattern of AV-1451 uptake compared to clinically&#xD;
      normal controls, and its association with atrophy, Aβ load and clinical disease progression&#xD;
      in DLB.&#xD;
