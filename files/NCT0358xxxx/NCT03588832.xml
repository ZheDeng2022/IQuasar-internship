  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high number of patient with stroke develops spasticity of the upper extremity, this&#xD;
      clinical sign of damage of 1 motoneuro (MN), causes postures and patterns of abnormal&#xD;
      movement, due to the hyperexcitability of the MN and the rheological alterations that occur&#xD;
      in the affected muscles. These alterations limit the use of upper extremity, restricting its&#xD;
      use in functional activities and affecting the quality of life and social participation of&#xD;
      the users. During the last few years the classification of the Hefter patterns for spasticity&#xD;
      of the upper limb was created, with the end of having a common language and orienting the&#xD;
      current therapeutic strategies oriented towards the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the prevalence of patterns and their impact on the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: Descriptive design of cross section, the sample will be composed of 600&#xD;
      people who attend integral rehabilitation center of regions V, VIII, IX and X in Chile, that&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent. The study will include a&#xD;
      measurement made by a trained professional from each participating center using a&#xD;
      registration form, the FIM scale and the Barthel index, to assess quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: It will be analyzed with the SPSS software through descriptive and inferential&#xD;
      statistics considering the nature of the variables, all the analyzes will consider as&#xD;
      statistically significant the results with p values less than or equal to 0.05. Depending on&#xD;
      the interval or ordinal level of the measurements, the coefficients r of Pearson and rho of&#xD;
      Spearman will be used to calculate the correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability: The results will determine the prevalence in this geographical sector,&#xD;
      disseminate this classification and promote the use of a common language among professionals&#xD;
      to enhance their daily work. In addition, it will allow to determine how the affectation of&#xD;
      the upper extremity through the identification of a certain pattern alters the quality of&#xD;
      life of the patient. This new information can be a fundamental input in the generation of&#xD;
      future studies that seek to guide in relation to the use of therapeutic strategies in these&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The impact generated by spasticity in the performance of functional activities in post-stroke&#xD;
      patients is undeniable. Given the above, it is essential to evaluate this construct,&#xD;
      considering the impact it has on the ADL. There are numerous scales that allow evaluating how&#xD;
      spasticity affects post-stroke functionality, even helping to detect which beneficial aspects&#xD;
      of spasticity should be considered when defining a therapeutic strategy. Among the most used&#xD;
      scales are the Barthel Index, which assesses the level of patient independence with respect&#xD;
      to the performance of some ADL. The scientific evidence suggests that patients with&#xD;
      spasticity have low rates in Barthel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific evidence suggests that a careful and continuous evaluation of spasticity,&#xD;
      would allow to identify establishment times and affected structures; as well as, to recognize&#xD;
      predictive factors that assist rehabilitation professionals, identifying which patients are&#xD;
      predisposed to develop spasticity, in order to reduce the risk of its establishment and&#xD;
      influence its evolution, helping to identify preventive measures and effective interventions,&#xD;
      that allow to achieve better motor and functional results, promoting its application in&#xD;
      search of an optimal recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the above, the purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of patterns and&#xD;
      their impact on the quality of life of patients after sequelae of a stroke. The generation of&#xD;
      new scientific evidence acquires vital importance and are key to the management of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>These will be evaluated through the:&#xD;
Barthel Index that assesses the quality of life with respect to performing ADL. The values assigned to each activity depend on the time spent and help to carry it out.&#xD;
The activities are valued differently, being able to assign 0, 5, 10 or 15 points. The global range can vary between 0, completely dependent, and 100 points, completely independent.</description>

Scale Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Evaluates the functional independence given through the activities of daily life (ADL). It consists of 18 items that cover two areas: motor activity (13 items) and cognitive skills (5 items). Each item is evaluated according to seven options ranging from 1 (total attendance) to 7 (total independence). The total score range goes from 18 to 126 points.</description>
