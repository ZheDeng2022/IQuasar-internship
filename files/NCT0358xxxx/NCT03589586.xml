      This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of DermACELL in subjects with a single target chronic venous leg&#xD;
      ulcer (VLU). After eligibility is determined at a screening visit, VLU subjects will be&#xD;
      entered into a 2 week run-in period of conventional wound care with moist wound therapy and&#xD;
      multilayer compression bandage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, those continuing to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to either&#xD;
      DermACELL or conventional care wound management at a ratio of 1:1. The appropriate size of&#xD;
      DermACELL will be applied to the wound of subjects in the DermACELL arm. The ADM will be&#xD;
      attached with sutures, sterile adhesive strips, or bioadhesive, and covered with a dressing.&#xD;
      For subjects in the conventional care wound management arm, the debrided wound will undergo a&#xD;
      moist-wound therapy consisting of alginates, foams, or hydrogels, and will be covered with a&#xD;
      gauze that is appropriate for the type of wound (moist or dry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent study visits will occur every week until 100% re-epithelialization or up to 16&#xD;
      weeks after treatment (whichever comes first).&#xD;
