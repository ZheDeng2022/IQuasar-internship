    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a sub-retinal&#xD;
      injection of BIIB111 in participants with Choroideremia (CHM) who have been previously&#xD;
      treated with BIIB111 and who have exited an antecedent study; these treated participants will&#xD;
      be compared with untreated control participants who have exited the STAR (NCT03496012) study&#xD;
      and BIIB112 in participants with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) who have been&#xD;
      previously treated with BIIB112 and who have exited an antecedent study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA will be assessed for both eyes using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart. BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be carried out before BCVA is measured. Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 meters from the chart. If &lt;20 letters are read at 4 meters, testing at 1 meter should be performed. BCVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the participant using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</description>

    <description>The LLVA was measured by placing a 2.0-log-unit neutral density filter over the best correction for that eye and having the participant read the normally illuminated ETDRS chart. The assessment was performed prior to dilating the eyes. Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 metres from the chart. If &lt;20 letters are read at 4 metres, testing at 1 metre should be performed. BCVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the participant.</description>
