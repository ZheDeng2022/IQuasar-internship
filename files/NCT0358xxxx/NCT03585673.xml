    <textblock>
      Esophageal or esophageal-gastric junction squamous cell cancer has dismal prognosis. And&#xD;
      still no promising chemotherapeutic drugs is existed. In this study, The investigators wanted&#xD;
      to look at the effects and safety of first line docetaxel-PM and oxaliplatin weekly&#xD;
      administration chemotherapy for the participants with inoperable or metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few results directly study the combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in the squamous cell&#xD;
      cancer of the esophagus, but some studies have shown that it is safe to In the phase II study&#xD;
      for the patients with gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a prior study reported the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of docetaxel 80mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 100mg/m2&#xD;
      every 3 weeks schedule. Entire response rate was 34% and median survival duration was 11.6&#xD;
      months. Over grades 3 anemia and neutropenia were found in 17%, respectively, and&#xD;
      non-hematological toxicities were mostly mild to moderate. In this study, a five-day&#xD;
      preventive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used to reduce hematology&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, there was the phase I/II studies of added capecitabine to docetaxel and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin with divided schedule d1 and d8 every 3weeks for reducing toxicities. The&#xD;
      subjects who participated in this study had at least one previous history of chemotherapy,&#xD;
      but overall response rates were 43% and median values for the entire duration of survival&#xD;
      were 9.8months. However, the side effects were significant, with 30 % of patients seeing&#xD;
      diarrhea of Grade 3 or higher and 17 % seeing infection of Grade 3 or higher (SAE) reported&#xD;
      at 37 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking at the reasons and background for this, the effects of docetaxel on esophageal&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer patients are already known, and weekly divided administration has also&#xD;
      demonstrated a reasonable level of effectiveness and safety. In studies conducted on gastric&#xD;
      and esophageal adenocarcinoma, the combination of docetaxel and oxaliplatin also showed&#xD;
      reasonable levels of effects and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, The investigators wanted to look at the effects and safety of first line&#xD;
      docetaxel-PM and oxaliplatin weekly administration chemotherapy for the participants with&#xD;
      inoperable or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
