  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In North Carolina, and nationally, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death&#xD;
      and disease among adults. North Carolina adults have high rates of CVD behavioral risk&#xD;
      factors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy eating habits, smoking, and being overweight&#xD;
      and obese. To help reduce these risks, researchers from the University of North Carolina at&#xD;
      Chapel Hill Prevention Research Center (UNC PRC) will test the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation of Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equality (CHANGE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHANGE is a health promotion strategy to link public health and clinical services through&#xD;
      community health workers (CHWs). Primary care clinics, public health, and CHWs all have&#xD;
      strengths in addressing chronic disease risk factors, but there is a widely recognized gap in&#xD;
      the coordination among them. The CHANGE strategy will use CHWs as members of primary care and&#xD;
      public health teams to distribute a behavioral change intervention called Heart-to-Health to&#xD;
      a total of 480 clinic patients at risk for CVD. Heart-to-Health is an effective lifestyle and&#xD;
      medication adherence intervention that includes a computerized decision aid to guide delivery&#xD;
      of tailored counseling sessions. The counseling sessions are focused on diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, tobacco cessation, and medication adherence and are facilitated by CHWs using&#xD;
      tablet computers. The CHWs will use tablet computers to communicate with a medical home team&#xD;
      about important patient health information to be acted on in real time. The CHWs also will&#xD;
      link participants to public health and other community based resources to support behavior&#xD;
      change. The CHANGE strategy will be tested in one underserved, rural community and then&#xD;
      replicated in a second community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers from the UNC PRC will examine whether CHANGE is effective at increasing the reach&#xD;
      of clinic and public community services to at risk populations and at improving composite&#xD;
      coronary heart disease risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity among North&#xD;
      Carolina (NC) and US adults, yet evidence-based CVD prevention interventions are often&#xD;
      minimally implemented and poorly integrated across community and clinical settings. To&#xD;
      address this gap, we will develop and test a multi-component strategy to help communities&#xD;
      effectively implement evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to prevent CVD. We call our&#xD;
      strategy the Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity (CHANGE) strategy. The&#xD;
      CHANGE strategy will specifically address NC's large underserved, rural population, which is&#xD;
      at increased risk for CVD due in part to behavioral risk factors, including physical&#xD;
      inactivity, poor diet, and tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHANGE strategy is designed to improve the dissemination and implementation of CVD EBIs&#xD;
      by strengthening clinical-community linkages. Clinics have strengths in identifying&#xD;
      individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease and prescribing medications and&#xD;
      behavioral change to mitigate risk. However, clinics only reach those who seek care, and most&#xD;
      clinics lack the capacity to deliver behavioral change EBIs. Public health has strengths in&#xD;
      implementing behavioral and environmental change EBIs in the communities where people live.&#xD;
      Therefore, the core focus of the CHANGE strategy is to create new structures to leverage the&#xD;
      complementary strengths of clinics and public health departments, thereby expanding the reach&#xD;
      and effectiveness of both clinic- and community-based EBIs. Because of their potential to&#xD;
      reach underserved populations, community health workers (CHWs) are at the center of the&#xD;
      CHANGE strategy. Working as part of a clinic/public health collaboration, CHWs will deliver a&#xD;
      behavioral change EBI (Heart-to-Health). By linking and leveraging clinical and public health&#xD;
      prevention activities, new opportunities for individuals and communities to reduce their risk&#xD;
      for CVD will be created. CHWs will be equipped with tablet computers that provide decision&#xD;
      support for delivering Heart-to-Health and facilitate linkages among clinics, public health,&#xD;
      and community services. Linking services within complex systems is challenging, and many good&#xD;
      ideas fall short at the level of implementation. Therefore, the study will apply an&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with a primary focus on the effective&#xD;
      implementation of the CHANGE strategy and a secondary focus on its effectiveness at reducing&#xD;
      CVD risk. With support and input from community stakeholders the investigators will refine&#xD;
      the CHANGE strategy (Year 1), test it in one underserved, rural community (Years 2-3) and&#xD;
      then replicate it in a second community (Years 4-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guided by key constructs from implementation science53 and the expanded Chronic Disease&#xD;
      Model,54 the study's specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Refine the CHANGE strategy through community-engaged formative research to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) identify existing CVD-related clinic and community services and barriers to their use,&#xD;
      (b) engage stakeholders in designing the CHWs' roles and systems for integrating their work&#xD;
      within clinical and public health practice, and (c) assess the tablet's usability for&#xD;
      decision-support and data transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Assess the CHANGE strategy's implementation and effectiveness. Aim 2a. Use an&#xD;
      explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach55 to assess the strategy's&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Best processes for engaging partners and building capacity to plan and implement EBIs.&#xD;
      (2) Effectiveness at increasing the reach of CVD-related public health EBIs.56 (3) Other&#xD;
      Implementation outcomes (fidelity, cost, sustainability, acceptability, and feasibility).53&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b. Use a pre-post comparison design to confirm the effectiveness of Heart-to-Health at&#xD;
      improving composite coronary heart disease risk (primary outcome = Framingham Risk Score) and&#xD;
      related risk factors: blood pressure, blood lipids, diet quality, physical activity, and&#xD;
      tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2c. Use a matched control, pre-post comparison design to assess the overall CHANGE&#xD;
      strategy's effects on the proportion of the clinic's total at-risk population that have&#xD;
      cholesterol and blood pressure under control as compared to three matched comparison clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Plan for taking the CHANGE strategy to scale by replicating it in one additional&#xD;
      community, identifying its core components,57, 58 creating and disseminating a replication&#xD;
      toolkit, and promoting the strategy's adoption through NC's multiple clinical, public health,&#xD;
      and research networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHANGE Project seeks to recruit 380 adults who live or receive health care in Hertford&#xD;
      County (Phase I) or Edgecombe/Nash Counties (Phase II) and are at risk of CVD. The&#xD;
      investigators have completed enrollment in Herford County and are about to begin enrollment&#xD;
      in Edgecombe/Nash. Through a series of 4 in-person and 3 phone sessions, 2 CHWs will meet&#xD;
      with adults who are at risk of CVD to provide health information, support in setting&#xD;
      behavioral goals and referrals to community resources. The CHWs' intervention activities are&#xD;
      adapted from the evidence-based Heart-to-Health curriculum for individual behavior change.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured using pre- post- data from all enrolled participants, including&#xD;
      pre- post- CVD risk score (Framingham Risk Score (FRS) or the atherosclerotic cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (ASCVD)) data from a participant subgroup. Process outcomes will be assessed using a&#xD;
      tracking tool designed specifically for this study to facilitate the CHWs' data collection,&#xD;
      intervention delivery, and case management activities in the field. Interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with program participants within a month of the final study visit to better&#xD;
      understand their experience with the CHANGE program.&#xD;
