    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies how well pembrolizumab works with combination chemotherapy in&#xD;
      treating participants with small cell/neuroendocrine cancers of the urothelium or prostate&#xD;
      that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, docetaxel,&#xD;
      cisplatin, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy may work better in treating&#xD;
      participants with small cell/neuroendocrine cancers of the urothelium or prostate.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with&#xD;
      standard-of-care cisplatin-based chemotherapy by assessing the durable response rate (DRR),&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and overall survival (OS) in&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 2, and radiographic PFS (rPFS) by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) and&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with etoposide&#xD;
      and cisplatin/carboplatin or docetaxel and carboplatin assessed by parameters of adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine correlation of biomarkers including PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 positive &gt;= 1% by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry [IHC] using 22C3 antibody), and serum and tissue molecular (including&#xD;
      genomic, proteomic) biomarkers that may be indicative of clinic response or safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 3 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Participants also receive standard of care chemotherapy comprising either etoposide&#xD;
      IV on days 1-3 and cisplatin IV or carboplatin IV on day 1 (Cohort 1), or etoposide IV on&#xD;
      days 1-3, carboplatin IV on day 1, and docetaxel IV on day 1 (Cohort 2). Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 9-12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require&#xD;
             corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is permitted&#xD;
             for palliative radiation (=&lt; 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous system&#xD;
             (CNS) disease.&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette?Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

             agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational&#xD;
                  study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the&#xD;
                  previous investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;

             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For Cohort 1, a history of prostate cancer that was identified incidentally&#xD;
                  following cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer is acceptable provided that the&#xD;
                  PSA is &lt; 0.2.&#xD;

             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging&#xD;
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current&#xD;
             pneumonitis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected) infection. Note: no testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C&#xD;
             is required unless mandated by local health authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject?s&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
