  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, case-control phase IV clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the EV71 vaccine. About 40000 children in the town aged 6-35 months will be&#xD;
      recruited and vaccinated with EV71 vaccines, which account for 20-40% of the children aged&#xD;
      6-35 months in the areas. The subjects will be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine at day 0 and day&#xD;
      28. Other children of appropriate age in the town will choose voluntarily whether or not to&#xD;
      be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine. All children's vaccination of EV71 vaccines will be recorded&#xD;
      in the study areas and the coverage rate of EV71 vaccine in the town will be calculated. The&#xD;
      vaccination is expected to complete before the epidemic peak of HFMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance of HFMD cases caused by EV71 will be conducted in hospitals of the study areas&#xD;
      for 10-12 months, which cover a whole HFMD epidemic period. Throat and anal swabs will be&#xD;
      collected from children with a clinically diagnosed HFMD for typing of human enteroviruses&#xD;
      tested by PCR. The HFMD cases with EV71 positive will be recruited as cases, while those with&#xD;
      EV71 negative will be recruited as test-negative controls. Besides, for each EV71-associated&#xD;
      HFMD cases, the investigators will select 4 community controls mateced with each case for&#xD;
      age, sex and residence.&#xD;

    <description>Cases are defined as eligible patients who tested positive for enteroviruse 71. For each case, we will select two groups of control children, including hospital test-negative control and community control. Logistic regression is performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of vaccination in cases vs each of the control groups.</description>
