    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dexrazoxane hydrochloride works in preventing&#xD;
      heart-related side effects of chemotherapy in participants with blood cancers, such as acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myeloproliferative&#xD;
      neoplasms. Chemoprotective drugs, such as dexrazoxane hydrochloride, may protect the heart&#xD;
      from the side effects of drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, idarubicin,&#xD;
      cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, in participants with blood cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the percentage of patients experiencing a decrease in left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10 percent from baseline or decrease in LVEF below the normal&#xD;
      limit of 50% during treatment with dexrazoxane (dexrazoxane hydrochloride) combined with&#xD;
      cladribine, idarubicin, cytarabine, and Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) within the first&#xD;
      6-months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the incidence of these cardiac symptoms while on dexrazoxane combined with&#xD;
      idarubicin-based treatment: clinical heart failure, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, S3 gallop,&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome, acute pulmonary edema and life-threatening arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess and monitor the change of troponin I (while still standard of care at MD&#xD;
      Anderson) and high-sensitivity troponin T during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Collect safety/toxicity profile. IV. To assess rates of complete remission (CR)/complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi). (Cohorts 1-3) V. Other efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints of interest include overall response, overall survival, event-free survival and&#xD;
      remission duration. (Cohorts 1-3) VI. To assess the recurrence-free survival rate at 6&#xD;
      months. (Cohort 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the metal chelation effects of dexrazoxane combined with chemotherapy (Mylotarg,&#xD;
      cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine) by quantifying concentrations of toxic and essential&#xD;
      metals and isotopic abundance ratios of blood and bone marrow before and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study and describe the relationship between pretreatment patient / disease&#xD;
      characteristics (including cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities) and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify molecular biomarkers predictive of response to therapy. IV. To study and&#xD;
      describe the relationship between patient / disease characteristics, use of intrathecal&#xD;
      prophylaxis, and incidence of leptomeningeal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To observe rates of fungal and other infections on the regimen. VI. To study environmental&#xD;
      exposure data based on an environmental health assessment survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore the impact of minimal residual disease (MRD) on relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours&#xD;
      on days 1, 4, and 7, cladribine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 15 minutes on days 1-3, idarubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3, and cytarabine IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3-7 weeks for up to 2 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION PHASE: After induction phase, participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on day 1, cladribine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3, dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV&#xD;
      over 15 minutes on days 1-2, idarubicin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2, and cytarabine IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3-7 weeks for up to 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Participants who go into remission or who are already in remission receive&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1 and then every 2-3 months as&#xD;
      needed. Participants also receive dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes and idarubicin&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 3-7 weeks for 32 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6-12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which judged by the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements per the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
