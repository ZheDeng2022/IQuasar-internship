  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to develop new methods to help smokers with schizophrenia to&#xD;
      successfully reduce their smoking and/or quit. This is not a treatment study, but will help&#xD;
      find new techniques to create better treatments. Specifically, the investigators are&#xD;
      interested in learning more about how thoughts and attention problems associated with&#xD;
      schizophrenia might play a role in smoking, as well as the impact of cognitive (thinking,&#xD;
      reasoning, and remembering) training and brain stimulation on these symptoms and on actual&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with severe mental illness (SMI) are three times more likely to smoke than non-SMI&#xD;
      adults, consuming 35-44% of all cigarettes in the U.S.; and, the highest rates of&#xD;
      tobacco-related illnesses and death are among smokers with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, not&#xD;
      only are patients with schizophrenia less likely to receive smoking treatments, but cessation&#xD;
      medications are only modestly effective in helping this subset of smokers quit. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is vital to discover new treatment adjuncts that specifically aid this high-risk subset of&#xD;
      smokers to achieve successful abstinence. Toward that end, the investigators propose a novel&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic technique that directly targets both cognitive impairment, an avenue&#xD;
      considerable past research suggests may be particularly effective to exploit in smokers with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and reactivity to prepotent stimuli, shown to be enhanced in smokers with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Combining a subset of cognitive enhancement therapy known as Cognitive&#xD;
      Remediation (CR), with another safe and effective technique, Transcranial Direct Current&#xD;
      Stimulation (tDCS), the investigators propose a new cognitive training method aimed at&#xD;
      enabling smokers with schizophrenia to gain greater control over smoking and stimuli-induced&#xD;
      reactivity (e.g., craving). Recent studies have found significant tDCS-induced cognitive&#xD;
      enhancement, as well as reduction in both cue-induced craving and smoking behavior among&#xD;
      healthy smokers. This combined with knowledge of the cognitive deficits that exist among&#xD;
      individuals with schizophrenia, and clear evidence of a relationship between cognitive&#xD;
      function and smoking treatment success, provides the rationale for testing novel CR + tDCS to&#xD;
      target underlying mechanisms of smoking among individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically,&#xD;
      the proposed study will examine the extent to which targeted cognitive enhancement with CR +&#xD;
      tDCS, leads to changes in cognitive control, cue-provoked craving, reaction time and ERP&#xD;
      measures of attentional bias; as well as the impact of these changes on smoking behavior and&#xD;
      intention and confidence to quit among 80 smokers with schizophrenia. The goal of this study&#xD;
      is to inform the development of new non-medication, noninvasive, therapeutic techniques to&#xD;
      specifically target smoking among patients with schizophrenia. The long term goal is to&#xD;
      establish an effective treatment adjunct to help smokers with schizophrenia successfully&#xD;
      achieve abstinence.&#xD;
