  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in Japanese&#xD;
      participants with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received prior systemic&#xD;
      anticancer therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is being tested to&#xD;
      treat advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients. This study will look at the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Cabozantinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 34 patients. Participants will be assigned to Cohort A (at least 17&#xD;
      participants) or Cohort B (approximately 15 participants) and will receive the following&#xD;
      treatment. Participants who have received prior sorafenib will enroll to Cohort A and&#xD;
      participants who have not received prior sorafenib will enroll to Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cabozantinib 60 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one tablet of cabozantinib once daily in the fasted&#xD;
      state (dose at least 2 hours after meal and no more food intake for 1 hour postdose)&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately at most 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic&#xD;
      during the treatment and posttreatment period, including a follow-up assessment after last&#xD;
      dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <measure>24-Week Progression-Free Survival Rate (PFSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>24-week PFSR was defined as percentage of participants with progression-free survival (PFS) at Week 25 Day 1 plus 7 days. PFS was defined as time from the first day of study drug administration to the earlier of PD per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause as assessed by IRC. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the baseline sum of the diameters (SoD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants whose best overall response was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by IRC, which was confirmed by a subsequent evaluation conducted &gt;= 28 days later. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SoD.</description>

CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SoD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
