  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DECART study will determine if primary care physicians, including internists and family&#xD;
      physicians, are able to identify and address drug-drug interactions among simulated patients&#xD;
      and whether those physicians, when given access to Aegis Drug-Drug Interaction test results,&#xD;
      improve patient management, take steps to reduce DDI risk, and optimize unnecessary resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DECART study is a pre-post, two round, randomized controlled study of a nationally&#xD;
      representative sample of 330 primary care physicians randomly assigned to a control or one of&#xD;
      two intervention arms. Once eligibility is determined and providers are enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, they will be asked to complete a questionnaire describing their practice and&#xD;
      professional background. They will then care for a total of 6 CPV® simulated patients. The&#xD;
      simulated patients will be adults aged 30-75 and present with various clinical conditions and&#xD;
      potential drug interactions. The design and intervention consists of two rounds with an&#xD;
      intervention among two thirds of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Round 1 (Baseline Assessment): Providers in both the control and intervention groups&#xD;
           will care for 3 CPV simulated patients using their standard practice approach, to&#xD;
           evaluate their awareness of DDI interactions and associated variability in caring for&#xD;
           patients at risk for DDIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention/DD! Education: Approximately 3 weeks after CPV Round 1 is complete, the&#xD;
           intervention arms will receive Aegis test education materials, consisting of: 1)&#xD;
           on-demand, online video on the Aegis DDI test, 2) example test results, 3) example case&#xD;
           study, 4) clinical care reference guide, and 5) test overview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Round 2 (Post-Educational Intervention Assessment): Approximately 3 weeks after the&#xD;
           intervention, all providers in the control and intervention arms will receive another 3&#xD;
           simulated patients to care for to determine if their awareness has changed and if their&#xD;
           practice has improved. In the post--educational assessment, one-half of intervention&#xD;
           participants will have access to Aegis DDI test results for their patients to help guide&#xD;
           their decision making. The other half will have the option of receiving test results if&#xD;
           ordered. Control physicians will continue to their standard practice approach.&#xD;
