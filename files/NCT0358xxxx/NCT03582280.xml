  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory open label study to improve the function and welfare of late-stage solid&#xD;
      cancer subjects (with or without lung involvement) who failed or refused anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment by ACC treatment, administered orally and concomitantly by inhalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measures will be evaluated: improvement of pain, performance status, dyspnea&#xD;
      measurement (Modified Borg Scale)/ oxygen saturation (if applicable) and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects' medical charts will be reviewed for their eligibility including the following:&#xD;
      medical history, prior cancer treatments, pathologic diagnosis of cancer, and CT/Chest X-ray&#xD;
      results. Assessment of prior and concurrent medication use, physician evaluation of patient&#xD;
      status, and measurement of Albumin Corrected Serum Calcium level (to be done at baseline and&#xD;
      prior to dose escalation, so that results are available prior to the visit) will be performed&#xD;
      prior to each dose escalation; in addition, vital signs, ECOG/Karnofsky performance status&#xD;
      and VAS pain assessments will be recorded at each visit as well. CT test will be executed&#xD;
      during the study period: at baseline, week 12 and week 24 visits in order to assess&#xD;
      progression free survival by CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests during the visits will be performed by a physician/nurse. Each subject will receive&#xD;
      individual doses of AMOR-powder by escalating doses up to 1,800 mg of ACC powder per day&#xD;
      (Amor powder administration will be continuous along the day - each eppendorf every two&#xD;
      hours). Patients who will not be able to swallow the powder, will receive similar doses of&#xD;
      ACC in tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subject will inhale 1% ACC in 8 ml suspension, for inhalation three times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's functionality will be assessed by serially determining ECOG/Karnofsky performance&#xD;
      status. Subject's progression free survival will be assessed by CT to evaluate tumor response&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
