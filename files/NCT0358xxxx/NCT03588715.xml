      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and innate immune mechanisms activation&#xD;
      following administration of the combination of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b (peg-IFN-α2b)&#xD;
      with two broadly neutralizing antibodies (3BNC117 and 10-1074) in the setting of&#xD;
      well-controlled HIV infection with antiretroviral treatment and a monitored analytical&#xD;

      alpha, 3BNC117 and 10-1074 alone in separate clinical trials that included a closely&#xD;
      monitored analytical treatment interruption. The hypothesis is that the joint administration&#xD;
      of peg-IFN-α2b with 3BNC117 and 10-1074 will be more effective than either intervention&#xD;
      separately in suppressing HIV viremia during 8 weeks of analytical treatment interruption&#xD;

      The proposed study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and innate immune mechanisms&#xD;
      activation following administration of the combination of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b&#xD;
      (peg-IFN-α2b) with two broadly neutralizing antibodies (3BNC117 and 10-1074) in the setting&#xD;
      of well controlled HIV infection with antiretroviral treatment and a monitored analytical&#xD;
      treatment interruption. This proposal builds on previous experience using interferon alpha,&#xD;
      3BNC117 and 10-1074 alone in separate clinical trials that included a closely monitored&#xD;
      analytical treatment interruption. The hypothesis is that the joint administration of&#xD;
      peg-IFN-α2b with 3BNC117 and 10-1074 will be more effective than either intervention&#xD;
      separately in suppressing HIV viremia during 8 weeks of analytical treatment interruption&#xD;
      (Step 4) and reducing integrated HIV DNA in blood and tissue when measured during an&#xD;
      analytical treatment interruption in participants with well-controlled HIV infection. A&#xD;
      review of the conceptual framework for the strategy to be tested includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why peg-IFN-α2? The therapeutic effects of peg-IFN-α2 yield two essential outcomes that&#xD;
           are the fundamental objectives of HIV curative strategies: control viral replication in&#xD;
           the absence of ART and reduce the levels of integrated HIV DNA in CD4+ T-cells. To date,&#xD;
           peg-IFN-α is the only intervention that has been shown to maintain viral suppression to&#xD;
           levels &lt;50 copies/mL in the absence of ART in chronic infection. Preliminary data&#xD;
           supports that correlates of anti-HIV reductions are centered on activation of NK&#xD;
           responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why bNAbs + peg-IFN-α2b? The addition of bNAbs may act independently to control virus&#xD;
           replication or decrease fitness thereby increasing the potential for a larger antiviral&#xD;
           effect after IFN by enhance NK-mediated clearance via a reduced viral levels and the&#xD;
           complementarity of bNAbs in enhancing mechanisms of antibody-mediated cytotoxicity&#xD;
           against infected cells by binding to virus emerging from or viral proteins expressed on&#xD;
           activated latent cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why combined bNAbs? In vivo, multiple bNAbs targeting different epitopes provide better&#xD;
           neutralization and antigen recognition than single bNAbs, which suggests that adoptive&#xD;
           transfer of multiple bNAbs may lead to superior viral control. Although bNAbs may have&#xD;
           neutralization effects that are of greater clinical impact than ADCC, it is possible&#xD;
           that antigen targeting through multiple bNAbs may also enhance NK-mediated cytotoxicity&#xD;
           more than a single bNAb. The administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies alone in&#xD;
           the setting of an analytical treatment interruption delays the return of viremia in a&#xD;
           fraction of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why test an ATI of immunotherapy? To date, peg-IFN-α2 administered prior to an ATI or&#xD;
           ART and subsequently maintained throughout the ATI period has maintained viral&#xD;
           suppression. An effective curative strategy requires that all interventions be&#xD;
           discontinued.&#xD;
