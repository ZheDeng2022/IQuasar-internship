    <textblock>
      Fluid restriction is necessary among patients with chronic kidney disease. However, treatment&#xD;
      adherence remains a challenge. Hence, this study determined the effects of a fluid&#xD;
      distribution timetable on adherence to fluid restriction of patients with end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease undergoing hemodialysis. This study used a single-blind, randomized-controlled pilot&#xD;
      study design. Patients with end-stage renal disease were randomly-assigned using&#xD;
      computer-generated sequences of randomly permuted blocks stratified according to sex to&#xD;
      receive the fluid distribution timetable or standard care. Adherence to fluid restriction was&#xD;
      measured using two indicators - thirst and interdialytic weight gain - and were compared&#xD;
      using One-way RM-MANOVA and MANCOVA. Secondary outcomes included baseline patient demographic&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics and were compared according to treatment allocation. Both groups&#xD;
      were followed-up for four weeks, assessing outcome measures during the second hemodialysis&#xD;
      session for each week.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD), defined as a condition in which the kidneys are damaged or&#xD;
      cannot filter blood similar to a healthy kidney (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,&#xD;
      2017), is a rising global dilemma. In fact, it has been a leading cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide, afflicting approximately 8% - 16% of the global population (Jha et al.,&#xD;
      2013) and ranking eighth among the leading causes of death. It has also been acknowledged as&#xD;
      a troublesome disorder causing a myriad of health-related problems (Lowney et al., 2015),&#xD;
      financial burden (Bavanandan et al., 2016), and poor survival outcomes (Halle et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis, a form of renal replacement treatment, has been the mainstream management for&#xD;
      patients with kidney diseases (Smeltzer et al., 2010) despite several health complications&#xD;
      (Smeltzer et al., 2010; Lowney et al., 2015). However, dietary and fluid therapy are also&#xD;
      necessary components of the management for patient with ESRD. A common concern among patients&#xD;
      on hemodialysis is the non-adherence to fluid therapy. Although this management is simple, it&#xD;
      remains a challenge to patients on hemodialysis because of several physiologic changes&#xD;
      brought by ESRD. As a result, numerous problems such as fluid overload, electrolyte&#xD;
      imbalances, and acid-base imbalances occur which are detrimental to the patient's overall&#xD;
      health. Since patients on hemodialysis are the key players in promoting their health, it is,&#xD;
      therefore, imperative to develop individualized and empowering strategies what will promote&#xD;
      their adherence to fluid therapy. The proposed strategy in this study is the fluid&#xD;
      distribution timetable, a simple and health promotive intervention involving scheduled&#xD;
      distribution of pre-determined amounts of fluid intake on a daily basis. This intervention&#xD;
      consider the various sources and usage of fluids per day and allocates fluid intake according&#xD;
      to the patient's prescribed fluid restriction. Hence, this study determined the effects of a&#xD;
      fluid distribution timetable on adherence to fluid restriction of patients with end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-blind, single-center, randomized-controlled pilot study at the&#xD;
      dialysis unit of a tertiary level government-owned institution in Quezon City, Philippines.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly-allocated to receive fluid distribution timetable with standard care&#xD;
      (intervention) or standard care alone (control). Random allocation of respondents was&#xD;
      conducted using computer-generated sequences of randomly permuted blocks (sizes of three,&#xD;
      four, and five) at our office. Randomization was carried out by an independent statistician&#xD;
      and was stratified according to their sex. During the study period, treatment allocation was&#xD;
      masked from site personnel and patients. Post-hoc power analysis for two group means, using&#xD;
      GPower version 3.1, revealed that a sample size of 24 patients with a 1:1.20 group allocation&#xD;
      ratio yields a power of 99% at a significance of 5% (two-sided) and detects an effect size of&#xD;
      0.80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group received the standard care for patients on hemodialysis. The standard care&#xD;
      involves a 10 -15-minute face-to-face health teaching of their treatment regimen including&#xD;
      pharmacologic management, dialysis schedule, dietary and fluid restrictions or nutritional&#xD;
      therapy, care for vascular access, and other necessary lifestyle modifications. The treatment&#xD;
      group, on the other hand, received a combination of the standard care and the intervention,&#xD;
      the fluid distribution timetable. It is a scheduled distribution of pre-determined amounts of&#xD;
      fluid intake on a daily basis depicted via a 5x6 table. The timetable includes three major&#xD;
      columns. The first column has six timepoints of a day with a four-hour interval. The second&#xD;
      column, which was further divided into four sub-columns, reflects the percentage of fluid&#xD;
      allotment for food, activities, medication, and thirst encounters. The percentage of fluid&#xD;
      allocation was computed based on the patient's prescribed fluid restriction, usual time of&#xD;
      food intakes in a day, usual level of activity, time of medication intake, and common time&#xD;
      they encounter thirst in a day. Lastly, the third column indicates the converted percentages&#xD;
      of fluid allotment in milliliters. In designing the intervention, we selected three&#xD;
      behavior-specific cognitions from the Health Promotion Model by Nola J. Pender: perceived&#xD;
      benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy. These cognitions are modifiable determinants of&#xD;
      behavior that promote well-being. As such, the fluid distribution timetable enumerated the&#xD;
      advantages of adherence and the disadvantages of non-adherence to fluid restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to fluid restriction was measured using two indicators - thirst and interdialytic&#xD;
      weight gain - and were compared using One-way RM-MANOVA and MANCOVA. Thirst was measured&#xD;
      using a self-reported questionnaire the Dialysis Thirst Inventory, while interdialytic weight&#xD;
      gain computed using a calibrated calculator by subtracting post-dialysis weight at the end of&#xD;
      the previous hemodialysis session from the pre-dialysis weight during the current&#xD;
      hemodialysis session. Secondary outcomes included baseline patient demographic and clinical&#xD;
      characteristics and were compared according to treatment allocation. Both groups were&#xD;
      followed-up for four weeks, assessing outcome measures during the second hemodialysis session&#xD;
      for each week.&#xD;
