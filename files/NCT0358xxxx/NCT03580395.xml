  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To verify the role of apatinib in neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the investigators&#xD;
      designed a prospective, randomized, parallel-controlled phase II/III trial, to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with TP (paclitaxel + cisplatin) or TP regimen&#xD;
      alone as neoadjuvant therapy for stage II-III breast cancer treatment. 100 cases of eligible&#xD;
      patients were diagnosed by core needle biopsy and immunohistochemistry, with the molecular&#xD;
      subtypes of triple-negative, HER2+ or Luminal B, evaluated by pathological complete remission&#xD;
      (pCR), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events, disease free survival (DFS) and OS,&#xD;
      aiming at providing a new way for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer and anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      treatment of malignant tumors.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary endpoint is pathological complete remission (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>pCR was defined as no histological evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and draining nodes. The presence of residual ductal carcinoma-in situ was not included in the pCR category after neoadjuvant treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The second endpoint includes the objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of tumor response was performed by independent evaluators who were blinded to the arm assignment consisted of 2 oncologists and 2 pathologists. Tumor response status was defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Committee (RECIST). Specifically, the complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all the lesions both in breast specimen and draining nodes; The primary endpoint ORR composed of tumor response classifications of CR and partial response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AE) were monitored on an ongoing basis and classified according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 3.0. Patients were assessed for toxicities before each administration., and toxicity was graded accordingly.</description>
