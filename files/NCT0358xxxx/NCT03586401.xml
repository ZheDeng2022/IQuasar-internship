      The purpose of this study is to create a software product on the basis of the support&#xD;
      technologies for making decisions for the collaboration of the different specialists, the&#xD;
      family and the patient himself in the process of physical therapy of children treated for&#xD;
      cancer. The basic model of the technology is a qualification model of the state of health and&#xD;
      physical limitations, based on data from a survey of 1,000 children treated for cancer. The&#xD;
      software product is supposed to be created on the basis of the Splunk system, the key link is&#xD;
      a personal office with a two-way login system: for specialists and for patients. The patient&#xD;
      introduces the results of self-examination, monitoring and additional surveys in real time,&#xD;
      specialists - additional recommendations. To assess the effectiveness of the collaboration&#xD;
      based on the software product, a long-term follow-up (at least 3 years) is planned for the&#xD;
      participants of the study with repeated examinations at the Medical-Rehabilitation Scientific&#xD;
      Center &quot;Russe pole&quot; at least twice a year.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the oncological diseases are significantly destroyed the physical health of&#xD;
      the patients, negatively affecting the cardiovascular, respiratory and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      systems. In the absence of a targeted rehabilitation measures, the toxic effect of the&#xD;
      treatment increases with time and leads to the development of disabling diseases. Physical&#xD;
      therapy and motor activity are recognized as the most effective for the maximum&#xD;
      rehabilitation of people who have been through the oncological disease and the prevention of&#xD;
      chronic diseases and repeated tumors. Motor activity should be regular, controlled, adapted&#xD;
      to the needs and capabilities of a particular person. The main role in maintaining of the&#xD;
      level and quality of motor activity is assigned to the patient and his inner circle.&#xD;
      Specialists are assigned the role of consultants and supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods, means and intensity of the motor loads should be selected on the basis of a&#xD;
      detailed analysis of physical health and existing limitations. To do this, it is proposed to&#xD;
      create a qualification model of physical health, in which many indicators will be reduced to&#xD;
      a limited number of variables: the response of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems to&#xD;
      stress, vegetative and neuromuscular physical activity, the state of motor functions and&#xD;
      motor skills, the general resistance to physical loads, etc. To create a model, mathematical&#xD;
      modeling methods will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create personal program of physical activity, the rules for the selection and adaptation&#xD;
      of the methods and means and a database of methods and means that provide a choice&#xD;
      considering goals and existing limitations will be developed. The interactive forms for&#xD;
      self-analysis and monitoring of the patient's motor activity, available for viewing by&#xD;
      specialists will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software product, within which the interaction between patients and specialists will be&#xD;
      realized, is supposed to be created in the Splunk system. The system allows to search both&#xD;
      the real-time data and the archived data, based on the results of the search Splunk gives you&#xD;
      the opportunity to: analyze the results with the visualization tools, generate reports and&#xD;
      warnings, create a monitoring and notification systems in real time. These can be expanded -&#xD;
      you can create new applications using the specialized development platform that comes with&#xD;
      Splunk. The study will be attended by at least 1000 patients and their families who have&#xD;
      concluded an agreement with the Medical-Rehabilitation Scientific Center &quot;Russe pole&quot;, and&#xD;
      come to the examination at least 2 times a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a model of a detailed qualification of the health status and physical&#xD;
           limitations for children treated for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop the rules for choosing methods and means of physical therapy, dosing sessions&#xD;
           for duration and intensity, depending on the qualification of the health status and the&#xD;
           identified physical limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To create a bank of methods and means of physical therapy available for use both in a&#xD;
           rehabilitation organization and at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop a software product for Clinical Decision Expert System for corporate&#xD;
           management of physical therapy of children treated for cancer and evaluate its&#xD;
           effectiveness.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at least 12 studies with an interval of not more than 2 months, a total period of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Based on The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The patient or his parents fill out a special questionnaire, that contains questions about the motor activity in 4 areas: leisure, activity at home and in the garden, activities related to work and activities related to transport. The main indicator is the the MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) per week: MET level x minutes of activity x events per week.&#xD;
Three levels (categories) of physical activity are proposed. High - 7 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 3000 MET-minutes/week Moderate - 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-min/week.&#xD;
