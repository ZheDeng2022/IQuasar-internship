          -  Has a blood sample drawn and a type and cross-match ordered for transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a hemoglobin greater than or equal to10 g/dL before starting IV ribavirin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agrees to collection of required specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agrees to report any adverse events for the duration of the protocol&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Has hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL that cannot be corrected to 10 g/dL before&#xD;
                  initiation of IV ribavirin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has history of hemoglobinopathies (ie, sickle-cell anemia or thalassemia major).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has history of autoimmune hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;

        present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pregnancy test. The patient will be informed of the risk and benefit of&#xD;
             treatment with IV ribavirin versus no ribavirin treatment for CCHF (generally&#xD;
             associated with high mortality) and severe cases of Lassa fever (high mortality rates)&#xD;
             versus mild cases of Lassa fever (low mortality rates).&#xD;
&#xD;

             atherosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) and congestive heart failure (CHF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cardiac defects that may predispose the subject to bradyarrhythmias, such as&#xD;

             capability of pacemaker placement, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sinus bradycardia of 41-49 beats per minutes, if the individual is not known to have a&#xD;
             low resting heart rate related to physical conditioning.&#xD;

             channel blockers, digoxin, as well as clonidine, cholinesterase inhibitors, and&#xD;
