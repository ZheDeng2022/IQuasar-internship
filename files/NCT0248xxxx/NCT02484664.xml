      The investigators will perform a two-center phase I trial of celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor)&#xD;
      administered at 200mg by mouth daily for 6 months. Up to 12 adult women with LAM will be&#xD;
      recruited (between 4-8 at each site). The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate whether, in LAM patients, celecoxib is safe and well tolerated, and has&#xD;
      evidence of clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To investigate the potential value of a novel biomarker of LAM, quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of the number of TSC2 mutant LAM cells per ml of blood, to assess disease&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

      Background: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is characterized by cystic lung destruction,&#xD;
      kidney angiomyolipomas (AMLs), and LAM cell growth within the axial lymphatics and multiple&#xD;
      other organs and surfaces. LAM occurs both sporadically and in association with tuberous&#xD;
      sclerosis complex (TSC). Sirolimus (rapamycin), an mTORC1 inhibitor, has been shown to&#xD;
      stabilize lung function decline and decrease angiomyolipoma tumor size in both TSC and&#xD;
      sporadic LAM patients. However, cessation of rapamycin therapy results in recurrent decline&#xD;
      in lung function, and regrowth of angiomyolipoma, suggesting that continuous use may be&#xD;
      required to maintain its beneficial effects. Recently the investigators have discovered that&#xD;
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX) function is altered in cells lacking TSC2, including in a LAM&#xD;
      patient-derived angiomyolipoma cell line. COX-2 levels are increased, prostaglandin&#xD;
      metabolite levels are increased, and treatment with COX-2 inhibitors are effective in&#xD;
      reducing tumor size in two different Tsc mouse models, one a native tumor, and the other a&#xD;
      xenograft model. Furthermore, rapamycin does not affect these differences in COX-2 expression&#xD;
      or prostaglandin metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Hypothesis: Our preclinical studies indicate that celecoxib (a COX-2 specific&#xD;
      inhibitor) decreases the size of TSC2-deficient tumors in Tsc models. Hence the investigators&#xD;
      propose this Pilot Clinical Trial to test the safety and tolerability of celecoxib in&#xD;
      patients with LAM, with preliminary assessment of potential benefit using multiple&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The primary endpoint of this pilot trial is to test the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of treatment with celecoxib in patients with mild-to-moderate LAM, who are not&#xD;
      currently on sirolimus; and to assess the potential benefit of this treatment using the&#xD;
      following: 1. Spirometry, 2. MRI measurement of angiomyolipoma size, 3. St. George's&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire, 4. VEGF-D serum levels. The investigators will assess Exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate prostaglandin metabolites to confirm effects of celecoxib. The&#xD;
      investigators will also develop a novel biomarker of LAM to assess response, quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of the number of TSC2 mutant circulating LAM cells, by next generation&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The investigators will perform a pilot clinical trial to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of celecoxib therapy as a single agent for patients with LAM. LAM subjects&#xD;
      who are not taking everolimus or rapamycin will be treated with celecoxib at 200mg PO QD for&#xD;
      6 months. They will be monitored for respiratory function and angiomyolipoma size. At the end&#xD;
      of the 6 month period, celecoxib will be discontinued, and subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      another 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Impact: Sirolimus is the only medical therapy shown to reduce tumor size and&#xD;
      stabilize lung function in patients with LAM and TSC-LAM. Although sirolimus has clear&#xD;
      benefits, results from the MILES trial suggest that continuous therapy in some form is&#xD;
      required, as the rate of decline in lung function resumed when sirolimus was discontinued.&#xD;
      The investigators hope that celecoxib will show benefit with minimal toxicity in this trial,&#xD;
      and provide an alternative approach for the long term prophylactic/preventive treatment of&#xD;
      patients with mild-to-moderate LAM. Our study will include patients with TSC LAM, which often&#xD;
      appears to be more slowly progressive than sporadic LAM, and hence long term therapy with&#xD;
      celecoxib may have particular benefit in the TSC LAM population. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop a quantitative measure of circulating LAM cell levels as part of&#xD;
      this trial.&#xD;
