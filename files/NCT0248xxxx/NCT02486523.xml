      The objective of the research is to assess the effectiveness of adding a Household WASH&#xD;
      component to the standard outpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: outpatient management of children diagnosed for severe acute malnutrition&#xD;
           only&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group: outpatient management of children diagnosed for severe acute&#xD;
           malnutrition + &quot;household WASH package&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2000 children, aged between 6 and 59 months, admitted to 20 OTP (Outpatient Therapeutic&#xD;
      Program) centers for SAM will be included into the study and followed for 8 months (2 months&#xD;
      of treatment, and 6 months after successful discharge).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Action Contre la Faim (ACF) nutrition project in Kanem started in 2008, and now is set up&#xD;
      in 35 health facilities divided across 2 health districts: Mao and Mondo. The management of&#xD;
      severe acute malnutrition is done in both OTP (Outpatient Therapeutic Programme) and in TFC&#xD;
      (Therapeutic Feeding Center). Between the treatment of SAM in OTPs and TFCs, and the number&#xD;
      of curative consultations, the total number of beneficiaries is expected to be 45,065 in 2014&#xD;
      (without double counting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear evidence exists that some Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) interventions can&#xD;
      successfully prevent diarrhea. For instance, interventions aiming at improving water quality&#xD;
      at household level or at promoting hand washing with soap do reduce significantly diarrhea&#xD;
      incidence. Estimations showed that WASH interventions have a small but measurable benefit on&#xD;
      length growth, but not on weight or weight/height. Yet, to our knowledge, no impact of WASH&#xD;
      interventions has been assessed, neither during nutritional rehabilitation where children are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to infections, nor after discharge where immune recovery is still&#xD;
      incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of nutritional rehabilitation of SAM (Severe Acute Malnutrition), the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that improving water quality and hygiene-related care practices at&#xD;
      household level would decrease incidence of WASH-related infections, such as diarrhea,&#xD;
      nematode and environmental enteropathy. As such, it would improve weight gain, decrease&#xD;
      relapses after successful discharge, and overall, could decrease over time the incidence of&#xD;
      acute malnutrition in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed WASH intervention will be added to already existing nutritional activities and&#xD;
      it will include: i/ Household water treatment and hygiene kit (water container, water&#xD;
      disinfection consumables, soap, cup, hygiene promotion leaflet) provided at beginning of SAM&#xD;
      treatment; ii/ sessions of Hygiene promotion provided weekly at health center level iii/&#xD;
      Household visits and hygiene sessions made during the treatment; // group discussion on&#xD;
      hygiene and care practices made with mother at community level after successful discharge.&#xD;

    <measure>Difference in the proportion of post-recovery relapse cases</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 6 months after successful OTP discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a dichotomous variable based on whether a child discharged as cured from the OTP program has a new event of acute malnutrition during the 6 months following the discharge. The relapse proportion for each group = [Total number of relapsing children] / [total number of discharged children that have been followed up] Relative reduction of 42% (from 12% to 7%) is expected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the average weight gain at the OTP discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>an expected average is between 7 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The weight gain (g/kg/day) = [weight (g) at discharge - minimum weight (g)] / [Duration from minimum weight to discharge] * [minimum weight (kg)]. The average weight gain (g/kg/day) for each group = [Sum of weight gains of cured children] / [total number of cured children].&#xD;
Increase of 3 g/kg/day is expected.</description>

    <description>The OTP length of stay is the total number of days spent in the program, from admission of the child to the discharge of a cured child. The average length of stay for all children in each group = [total number of days of cured children] / [number of cured children].&#xD;
Reduction of 5 days is expected.</description>

    <description>Hygiene promotion sessions are provided weekly to the caretakers at the health center level. They contain 7 main messages this study is trying to get across: Allocate a protected space for children to play, limiting the likelihood of them ingesting soil or animal feces; Wash the child with soap (hand, face) when outside the protected area; Cleaning and rapid burial of children's stools; Key times for hand washing with soap for the child caretaker; Store drinking water in a closed container located in an elevated place out of reach of animals; Drinking water provided to the child should be treated with chlorine or boiled; Once weaned, avoid giving to the child leftover food, or only after warming it again.</description>
