    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) can cause respiratory infections. Some of these can be&#xD;
      life-threatening, especially in young children, the elderly, and people with weak immune&#xD;
      systems. Researchers want to study RSV infection in a hospital setting in healthy adults.&#xD;
      They want to use what they learn to test new treatments or vaccines in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the body responds to RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers ages 18-50&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG. Heart rhythm is measured with small sticky patches on the chest, arms, and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function tests. This measures how much air a person can move into and out of&#xD;
           the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasal washes and/or nasal swabs. For the wash, the nose will be rinsed with a sterile&#xD;
           liquid. For the swab, the inside of the nostril will be rubbed with a cotton swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two, possibly three, follow-up outpatient visits, approximately&#xD;
           1, 2 and 6 months after receiving the dose of RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the hospital under isolation for 7 or more days after getting&#xD;
           the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The average stay is 10 days. Participants cannot leave the isolation unit. They cannot&#xD;
           have visitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The virus should cause a mild to medium cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out a symptom card every day in the hospital and for 1 month&#xD;
           after.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 follow-up visits, 28 and 56 days after leaving the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female participants who are sexually active must remain abstinent or use an effective&#xD;
           form of birth control for 1 month before and after getting the virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection. RSV also causes lower respiratory tract disease in the elderly and&#xD;
      life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. An RSV monoclonal antibody (palivizumab)&#xD;
      is currently available for passive immunoprophylaxis in high-risk infants. Vaccines and&#xD;
      antiviral agents are under development for the treatment and prevention of RSV, but none are&#xD;
      licensed. The ability to challenge healthy volunteers with RSV could rapidly facilitate&#xD;
      efficacy studies of future antivirals and vaccines. In addition, challenge studies would&#xD;
      provide critical information on viral pathogenesis, including types of cells infected,&#xD;
      mucosal and systemic immune response, and alterations in respiratory microbiota. Clinical&#xD;
      trial material for human challenge studies has been prepared from live recombinant&#xD;
      (complementary DNA-derived) RSV of subgroup A (RSV A2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a phase 1 study in healthy adult male and non-pregnant female subjects 18&#xD;
      years to 50 years of age. The purpose of the trial is to define safety profiles and estimate&#xD;
      illness rates for subjects given 2 different doses of RSV A2 challenge virus. If RSV A2 is&#xD;
      found to be sufficiently infectious in adults, then it may be used as a challenge virus in&#xD;
      future studies evaluating the protective efficacy of RSV vaccines or antivirals and in&#xD;
      studies of pathogenesis of RSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and receive a single intranasal dose of&#xD;
      RSV A2 at either 10^5 or 10^6.3 PFU. Subjects will remain at the Clinical Center for&#xD;
      approximately 9-12 days for clinical evaluation. Research procedures conducted on blood and&#xD;
      nasal swab and wash samples will include lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokine analysis,&#xD;
      transcriptosome profiling, RSV-specific immunoglobin analysis (circulating IgG and nasal&#xD;
      secretory IgA), quantitative viral titers and viral culture, and nasal microbiome analysis.&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged when their NP wash RSV results are negative for two consecutive&#xD;
      days and they do not have any signs or symptoms suggestive of possible RSV-associated lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract disease. Subjects will return for followup evaluation 28 and 56 days after&#xD;
      viral challenge.&#xD;
