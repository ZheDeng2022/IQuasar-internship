    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study of BBI503 administered in combination&#xD;
      with selected anti-cancer therapeutics in adult patients with advanced cancer. The goal of&#xD;
      the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of BBI503 in combination with&#xD;
      each of the selected anti-cancer agents.&#xD;
