      This study aims to investigate if optimal personalized consultation by a dietician for a&#xD;
      healthy diet focused on food which contains sufficient vitamins and minerals improves&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms as determined by an improved score in the gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      of the NET specific EORTC QLQ-GINET21 at end of study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have a rare, slowly progressing disease.&#xD;
      Therefore they undergo many treatments such as surgery followed by long-lasting systemic&#xD;
      treatments with somatostatin analogues. These procedures can each result in increased&#xD;
      diarrhea and loss of critical food components in the stools such as fat. This can lead&#xD;
      amongst others, to major loss of fat-soluble vitamins. Those patients who in addition have an&#xD;
      ongoing serotonin production may experience shortage in the circulating essential amino acid&#xD;
      tryptophan. Serotonin is derived from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is a&#xD;
      precursor of niacin (vitamin B3) which is critical for normal cellular metabolism. In case of&#xD;
      high serotonin production in neuroendocrine tumor patients tryptophan and/or niacin can be&#xD;
      deficient leading to symptoms including pellagra. Suppletion of tryptophan might facilitate&#xD;
      serotonin production and therefore, is undesirable in patients with serotonin producing&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strikingly little is known about how NET patients should be best supported for the deficits&#xD;
      they develop during their long-lasting disease. Also the precise effect of diet advices for&#xD;
      diarrhea and fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B3, in this patient group is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NET are faced with a serious chronic disease. This makes this patients group&#xD;
      extremely motivated to be involved in their treatment and to &quot;self-manage&quot; their disease as&#xD;
      much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study aims to investigate if optimal personalized consultation by a dietician&#xD;
      for a healthy diet focused on food which contains sufficient vitamins and minerals improves&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms as determined by an improved score in the gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      of the NET specific EORTC QLQ-GINET21 at end of study. Secondary aims are decrease in&#xD;
      distress on the distress thermometer, improvement in quality of life as determined by the&#xD;
      cancer-specific EORTC QLQ-C30, and the other constructs of the EORTC QLQ-GINET21, empowerment&#xD;
      (subscales of the Construct Empowering Outcomes questionnaire) at end of study, an&#xD;
      improvement in nutrition state (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment PG/SGA) and&#xD;
      normalization of vitamins and tryptophan levels at end of study measured with quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of blood and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a single center 18 week open-label, non-comparative, single-arm,&#xD;
      experimental pilot study. In this pilot we want to examine the effect sizes of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms of the NET specific EORTC QLQ-GINET21 of the patients after the&#xD;
      dietary intervention. Four weeks after inclusion adult patients with metastasized NET and&#xD;
      chronic use (&gt;6 months) of a somatostatin analogue will start with the dietary intervention.&#xD;
      Effects of the intervention will be evaluated by questionnaires and vitamin values in blood&#xD;
      and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fill out these questionnaires at baseline, after four weeks, and after 18 weeks.&#xD;
      Furthermore at baseline, after four weeks, and after 18 weeks vitamin values in blood and&#xD;
      urine will be measured and at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients that are treated in the University Medical Center Groningen for&#xD;
      metastasized NET treated with a somatostatin analogue for more than 6 months will be&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
