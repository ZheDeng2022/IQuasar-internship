    <textblock>
      A vital question for society in general and primary health care in particular is early&#xD;
      identification of persons at risk of sickness absence due to work-related stress. Even though&#xD;
      both the individual and society can gain a lot from the prevention of absence, not the least&#xD;
      since return to work is costly once a person is sick-listed. There is, surprisingly enough,&#xD;
      no established method to do this. This project is a randomized controlled study of people&#xD;
      with mental disorders and physical complaints consulting primary care. The purpose is to&#xD;
      evaluate if a systematic use of early identification of work-related stress, combined with&#xD;
      feedback at consultation, at the primary health care centers can prevent sickness absence&#xD;
      among employed women and men with common mental disorders and subjective physical health&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no method or established practice in primary health care when it comes to the&#xD;
      important issue of early identification of people at risk of sickness absence due to&#xD;
      work-related stress. But work-related stress is common and can cause ill-health and&#xD;
      sick-listing. Therefore it is a vital question for society in general and primary health care&#xD;
      in particular finding methods to early identify persons at such risk. Both the individual and&#xD;
      society can gain a lot from the prevention of absence, not the least since return to work is&#xD;
      costly once a person is sick-listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both women and men see a doctor due to the symptoms, and a majority often goes to the primary&#xD;
      health care, and this long before sick-listing comes into question. It could very well be&#xD;
      that neither patient, nor doctor is aware that the symptoms the patient describes are caused&#xD;
      by work and the stress the patient is subject to there. There is, though, a questionnaire,&#xD;
      the Work Stress Questionnaire (WSQ), that has been developed to early identify people at&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if systematic use of the WSQ&#xD;
      can reduce the number of sick-days twelve months on in women and men consulting a primary&#xD;
      health care GP due to physical and mental complaints. The intervention consists of giving the&#xD;
      GPs the WSQ as a tool for systematic use to early identify people at risk, and then be able&#xD;
      to refer the patients to preventive health care and other measures within the primary health&#xD;
      care or the patient's occupational health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be carried out within the Region Västra Götaland and engage around 40&#xD;
      general practitioners, who will in all recruit 420 participants (210 to intervention group&#xD;
      and 210 to control group). A register follow-up on sick-leave, healthcare treatment and the&#xD;
      use of medicines will be made 12 months later. Three studies are planned to evaluate the&#xD;
      intervention. Yet another study, a focus group study, is planned to make process evaluation&#xD;
      of how the participating health care center staff perceive systematic use of the WSQ.&#xD;
