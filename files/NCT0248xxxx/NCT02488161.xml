      Coordinated multi-center project with several complementary goals in each one of the&#xD;
      sub-projects included. Objectives: 1.To determine risk factors of death, or major&#xD;
      complications in the short term; 2.To determine risk factors of death, tumor recurrence,&#xD;
      major complications, readmission or deterioration of quality of life in the mid term;&#xD;
      3.Evaluation of patient reported outcomes from before the intervention to the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up. 4.To study the role of immunohisto-chemistry markers in the prediction of similar&#xD;
      adverse results. This sub-project (coordinator) will approach the determination of risk&#xD;
      factors of death, tumor recurrence, major complications, readmission and deterioration of&#xD;
      quality of medium term life (1-2 years). Methodology. Design: prospective cohort study with 2&#xD;
      years follow-up after the surgical intervention. Participant centers: 18 hospitals of 6&#xD;
      Autonomous Communities of all Spain. Patients diagnosed of colorectal cancer surgically&#xD;
      intervened. Variables: pre-intervention, those of the hospital admission, sociodemographic,&#xD;
      immunohisto-chemistry and clinical parameters, that could be in relation to the outcomes to&#xD;
      study. Statistic analysis: a derivation sample will be created where the possible predicting&#xD;
      parameters will be identified, by cancer of colon or rectum. Predictive models will be&#xD;
      created with a good discriminative capacity. A validation of those models will be performed&#xD;
      in a validation sub-sample. Logistic and Cox regression models will be used. Simulation&#xD;
      models for the prediction of discreet events in the long term will be used.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study included patients drawn from 22 hospitals belonging to the&#xD;
      Spanish National Health Service (SNS), which covers the majority (99.8%) of the population of&#xD;
      Spain. All covered residents have free access to their primary care physician and to the&#xD;
      emergency departments of the hospitals. All of the hospitals have similar technological and&#xD;
      human resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of colon cancer attending the surgical services of any of these&#xD;
      hospitals to undergo surgery between June 2010 and December 2012 were informed of the goals&#xD;
      of the study and invited to voluntarily participate. In order to take part in the study, a&#xD;
      patient had to provide informed consent. All information was kept confidential. The&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards of the participating hospitals approved this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected Data collected upon hospital admission included information on&#xD;
      sociodemographic data, clinical data (including information about onset of symptoms, habits,&#xD;
      personal and family background, comorbidities, diagnostic tests, pre-intervention&#xD;
      treatments), preoperative data (including analytical, tumor markers and diagnostic tests),&#xD;
      data of the outpatient anesthesia data on the surgical intervention, pathology data, and data&#xD;
      related to the remaining days of admission (including the presence of complications, need for&#xD;
      reintervention or death). Subsequently, data were collected up to 30 days after surgery&#xD;
      (analytical, diagnostic tests, presence of complications, readmissions, reintervention or&#xD;
      death). Finally, information was collected through the year including need for radiation&#xD;
      therapy, chemotherapy (treatment schedule, cycles, complications of treatment, supportive&#xD;
      care), laboratory results and diagnostic tests performed, presence of complications, tumor&#xD;
      recurrence, readmission or reintervention and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completed the following questionnaires before surgery and one year after surgery:&#xD;
      EuroQol-5D, EORTC QLQ-C30 (The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire) and QLQ-CR29 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment&#xD;
      of Cancer questionnaire module for colorectal cancer), and HADS. The EuroQol-5D is a generic&#xD;
      HRQoL questionnaire which has demonstrated good psychometric properties and allow for&#xD;
      comparison with other populations. It has been translated and validated in Spanish. This&#xD;
      instrument consists of two parts: the first is a description of the state of health in five&#xD;
      dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety /&#xD;
      depression. Each of these dimensions is measured by three answer options that define&#xD;
      different levels of severity. The second is a visual analogue scale in which patients rate&#xD;
      their health on a scale displayed in the form of a thermometer (20 mm), whose ends are 0&#xD;
      (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best state imaginable health). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a&#xD;
      questionnaire for evaluating the HRQoL for cancer patients undergoing treatment, which has&#xD;
      shown good validity and reliability in its Spanish adaptation (Cronbach's alpha coefficient&#xD;
      of 0.7). It is one of the instruments measuring quality of life in cancer patients most&#xD;
      commonly used and allow the comparison of the results obtained in patients with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients with other cancers. It consists of 30 items, 28 of them with four possible&#xD;
      answers (in all, a little, a lot, a lot) and two items with seven Alternative (visual&#xD;
      analogue scale where one is &quot;very poor&quot; and seven &quot;excellent&quot;). The timeframe should refer to&#xD;
      the previous week. The scores on each scale are transformed so that the final values are&#xD;
      between 0 and 100. In addition to this overall score, the instrument consists of three&#xD;
      scales: Global health status: in which a high score represents a high performance in terms of&#xD;
      overall health; Functional -scale: consists of five subscales of operation: physical, role,&#xD;
      emotional, cognitive and social; Symptoms scale consisting of a number of symptoms: fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, decreased appetite, constipation, diarrhea and&#xD;
      financial difficulties. A high score on each of these symptoms represents a high level of&#xD;
      symptoms or problems in this area. The QLQ-CR29 was then developed after revising the&#xD;
      QLQ-CR38, and was demonstrated internationally to have both sufficient validity and&#xD;
      reliability to support its use as a supplement to the EORTC QLQ-C30 to assess&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes during treatment for colorectal cancer in clinical trials and other&#xD;
      settings. The QLQ-CR29 contains 29 items, and is described in detail elsewhere. Briefly,&#xD;
      there are 18 items addressing gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and problems with micturition,&#xD;
      and there are separate scales for the participants with or without a stoma and separate items&#xD;
      addressing sexual function for men and women. The response categories for each item are the&#xD;
      same as those used in the QLQ-C30.&#xD;
