    <textblock>
      This study is to compare intestinal Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity in 9-18 month post&#xD;
      weight loss surgery Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) versus control subjects who have not had&#xD;
      a weight loss surgery and are of similar age, gender, body mass index as the gastric bypass&#xD;
      group. For this purpose, we will compare post-bariatric surgery patients with control&#xD;
      subjects on alterations in systemic exposure of buspirone, a CYP3A4 substrate, when&#xD;
      administered with grapefruit juice, a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor.&#xD;

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to compare the relative difference between the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of buspirone alone (buspirone) with the AUC of buspirone in the presence of grapefruit juice (buspirone + GFJ) in patients who underwent RYGB 9-18 months prior versus a control group of participants who have not undergone bariatric surgery.</description>
