      Thirty patients will be treated: 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique plus&#xD;
      intramucosal verticals with AlloDerm® (test treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned&#xD;
      tunnel technique alone with AlloDerm® (control treatment). The surgical procedure for the&#xD;
      control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel preparation that is a&#xD;
      modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b).&#xD;
      This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of the soft tissue over an&#xD;
      allograft (E.P Allen). The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally&#xD;
      positioned tunnel preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal&#xD;
      verticals, a modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA)&#xD;
      approach (Zadeh H, 2011). Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class I or II facial&#xD;
      recession defect, ≥ 3 mm. Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to receive either&#xD;
      the test or control treatment. Three exams for measurements will be performed per patient on&#xD;
      total: preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4 months) postoperatively. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      compare the percent root coverage obtained with acellular dermal matrix using the coronally&#xD;
      positioned tunnel technique alone or with intramucosal verticals.&#xD;

      Thirty patients will be treated: 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique plus&#xD;
      intramucosal verticals with AlloDerm® (test treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned&#xD;
      tunnel technique alone with AlloDerm® (control treatment). The surgical procedure for the&#xD;
      control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel preparation that is a&#xD;
      modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b).&#xD;
      This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of the soft tissue over an&#xD;
      allograft (E.P Allen). The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally&#xD;
      positioned tunnel preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal&#xD;
      verticals, a modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA)&#xD;
      approach (Zadeh H, 2011). In both the test and control group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured&#xD;
      using a continuous sling suture technique with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the&#xD;
      tissue will be coronally positioned and sutured separately using a continuous sling suture&#xD;
      technique (line angle to line angle) with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. In the test&#xD;
      group, the intramucosal vertical incisions will be sutured using simple interrupted sutures&#xD;
      with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class&#xD;
      I or II facial recession defect, ≥ 3 mm. Each patient will initially receive a full&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up to include the periapical and bite-wing radiographs of the selected site&#xD;
      and adjacent teeth, study casts, intra-oral photographs, and full mouth clinical examination.&#xD;
      Pre-surgical preparation will include detailed oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root&#xD;
      planing under local anesthesia, and occlusal adjustment if indicated. Baseline data on test&#xD;
      and adjacent teeth will be recorded on the day of surgical treatment to include: Miller's&#xD;
      classification of recession defects, Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Bleeding on Probing Index,&#xD;
      Gingival Margin Levels (Recession), Keratinized Tissue, Clinical Attachment Level, Clinical&#xD;
      Tooth Mobility, Creeping Attachment, Tooth Vitality, Radiographic Examination, Patient&#xD;
      Models, and Clinical photos. Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to receive&#xD;
      either the test or control treatment. Mentor will toss the coin immediately prior to&#xD;
      beginning surgical procedure. Patients will be evaluated postoperatively for a period of 4&#xD;
      months. The examiner will be blinded and will not be aware of the patient treatment at any&#xD;
      time during the term of the study. Three exams for measurements will be performed per patient&#xD;
      on total: preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4 months) postoperatively. The primary aim is&#xD;
      to compare the percent root coverage obtained with acellular dermal matrix using the&#xD;
      coronally positioned tunnel technique alone or with intramucosal verticals. Means and&#xD;
      standard deviations will be calculated for all parameters. Statistical significance of the&#xD;
      mean residual recession data for each parameter will be analyzed using a paired t-test to&#xD;
      detect within group statistical differences and an unpaired t-test to detect between group&#xD;
      statistical differences. The sample size of 15 per group will afford 80% statistical power to&#xD;
      detect a difference of 1.0 mm coverage between groups. Sample size and power calculations are&#xD;
      based on data from previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures will be completed by one operator under the direction of one mentor.&#xD;
      First, presurgical measurements will be taken. Defect width will be measured horizontally at&#xD;
      the interproximal osseous crest level and 1.0 mm coronal to the defect base. Probing depths,&#xD;
      width of keratinized tissue, and gingival margin levels will also be measured. Next,&#xD;
      treatment modality will be determined and assigned to the defect. Local anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered, tissue elevated, and measurements of the level of the alveolar crest will be&#xD;
      made directly in reference to the CEJ. The alveolar crest will be measured vertically from&#xD;
      the mid-buccal, or greatest point of the defect, and proximal osseous crest levels. The soft&#xD;
      tissue recession defect will be measured horizontally and vertically for the osseous&#xD;
      measurements. Root surfaces will be meticulously root planed using hand instruments to obtain&#xD;
      a smooth, hard root surface, then the incisions will be made. No osseous recontouring will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure for the control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel&#xD;
      preparation that is a modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL&#xD;
      (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b). This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of&#xD;
      the soft tissue over an allograft (E.P Allen). Split-thickness dissection beyond the&#xD;
      mucogingival junction will be made to elevate the tissue and allow adequate coronal&#xD;
      positioning. The tunnel is dissected using a specialized microsurgical kit. The tunnel and&#xD;
      ADM will extend at least one tooth mesial and distal to the recession site. Papillae are&#xD;
      completely elevated off the osseous crest so that the whole tissue complex is mobile and can&#xD;
      be coronally positioned. In cases where access is difficult, an incision will be made to&#xD;
      release the papilla to prevent tearing the tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel&#xD;
      preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal verticals, a&#xD;
      modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA) approach (Zadeh&#xD;
      H, 2011). The procedure will begin with one or multiple (mesial and distal) intramucosal&#xD;
      vertical incisions, with the location of access depending on the sites being treated. The&#xD;
      intramucosal incision is made through the periosteum to elevate a subperiosteal tunnel,&#xD;
      exposing the facial osseous plate as well as root dehiscences. The tunnel and ADM will extend&#xD;
      at least one tooth mesial and distal to the recession site. The tunnel is dissected using a&#xD;
      specialized microsurgical kit. It is crucial to extend the tunnel elevation sufficiently&#xD;
      beyond the mucogingival margin as well as through the gingival sulci of the teeth being&#xD;
      augmented to allow for low-tension coronal repositioning of the gingiva. The tunnel is&#xD;
      extended interproximally under each papilla as far as the embrasure space permits, without&#xD;
      making any surface incisions through the papillae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both control and test groups, the Alloderm® is hydrated in two baths: first with sterile&#xD;
      saline for a minimum of five minutes or until the backing separates from the Alloderm®, the&#xD;
      second with sterile saline plus tetracycline at a ratio of 5 mg tetracycline / 1 mL saline&#xD;
      until the tissue is fully hydrated. Next, the AlloDerm® will be adjusted to completely cover&#xD;
      the defect, positioned against the root surface, at the CEJ, and the inferior and lateral&#xD;
      borders of the grafts will extend at least 3.0 mm beyond the osseous defect margins. In the&#xD;
      control group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured using a continuous sling suture technique with a&#xD;
      Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the tissue will be coronally positioned and sutured&#xD;
      separately using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with PTFE&#xD;
      4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. In the test group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured using a&#xD;
      continuous sling suture technique with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the tissue&#xD;
      will be coronally positioned and sutured separately using a continuous sling suture technique&#xD;
      (line angle to line angle) with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. The intramucosal&#xD;
      vertical incisions will be sutured using simple interrupted sutures with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle&#xD;
      13.1 mm needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative instructions will be given to the patients along with prescriptions, in&#xD;
      appropriate cases, for systemic doxycycline hyclate 100 mg once a day for 14 days; an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen 375 mg q12h for 7 days); an analgesic (Vicodin ES q6-8h prn&#xD;
      pain); a steroid, Medrol dose pack, 21 tablets of 4 mg methylprednisolone; 6 tablets on day&#xD;
      1, 5 on day 2, decrease by 1/day until last tablet dose on day 6, or dexamethazone 1mg, 18&#xD;
      tablets, 3 tablets/day for 1st 3 days, 2/day for the next 3 days, 1/day for the last 3 days&#xD;
      (always taken in the morning). The surgical procedures will be documented with clinical&#xD;
      photographs.&#xD;
