  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to find out if compression treatment can lower the incidens of&#xD;
      surgical wound complications, such as infection and wound rupture, in patients with ankle&#xD;
      fractures. The compression regime consists of a two-layered compression stocking applied&#xD;
      after surgery and a massage boot applied both before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest part of the study is the clinical trial, with which we aim to prove the&#xD;
      hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * That the compression regime reduces wound infections from 10-40% to 5% on patients with a&#xD;
      broken ankle (Either one side of the ankle, two or three sides (including the posterior part&#xD;
      of the ankle))&#xD;

      Malleolar fractures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment of patients with malleolar fractures imposes a special challenge for&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons. A typical ankle fracture results in haematoma, sometimes blistering and&#xD;
      almost always oedema formation. This postpones the optimal time for surgery. When operating&#xD;
      on a swollen ankle, it becomes obvious for the surgeon that the tissue elasticity and normal&#xD;
      structure is changed. This can complicate the surgical approach, procedure, the reduction of&#xD;
      the fracture and the closure of the incision. Quite often the skin is difficult to adapt,&#xD;
      resulting in excessive tension on the sutures. This can potentially lead to skin necrosis and&#xD;
      wound dehiscence. Blood and fluid imbibed tissue and prolonged operating time, increases the&#xD;
      risk of post-operative infection, and thereby give the patient painful and extended&#xD;
      post-operative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When striving to give the patient a good treatment and rehabilitation, it is paramount to&#xD;
      prevent surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression therapy, as part of the standard treatment of ankle fractures, is not yet&#xD;
      described in the literature and no previous study has tested its efficiency in this patient&#xD;
      group, in a systematic manner. It is a new, innovative way of helping the patients to faster&#xD;
      rehabilitation and to prevent surgical soft tissue complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study proves the expected effect on soft tissue complications, compression therapy&#xD;
      will probably also show an effect on other fracture types: knee-, wrist-, tibia- and femoral&#xD;
      fractures, making compression therapy an integrated part of the standard fracture regime in&#xD;
      all orthopaedic departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malleolar fractures in Denmark has an incidence of 107/100.000 person, making it one of the&#xD;
      most common fracture types in the country. In Denmark 6000 malleolar fractures are operated&#xD;
      each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown increased complication rates in the elderly, diabetics, smokers, patients&#xD;
      on immunomodulating medication, alcoholics, and patients with osteoporosis and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of malleolar fractures in Denmark shows great local variations, and standard&#xD;
      differs between hospitals, often with a low grade of clinical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nordsjællands Hospital has decided, to implement a standard regime of Flowtron Hydroven 3™&#xD;
      and Coban™ 2 lite, to prevent oedema formation and blistering. The decision came after&#xD;
      clinicians having observed a high incidence of oedema, blistering and wound healing problems&#xD;
      in this cohort of patients, often forcing surgeons to postpone surgery and prolonging&#xD;
      inpatient stay, resulting in a long and cumbersome rehabilitation for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent pneumatic compression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is used mainly in prevention of DVT. The use of IPC&#xD;
      in treatment of postoperative soft tissue care is only sporadically mentioned in the&#xD;
      literature. These studies define the mechanisms of action as either mechanical or chemical.&#xD;
      The mechanical effect is due to improved vascularity, redirection of blood flow and cyclic&#xD;
      loading. The chemical effect is caused by increased production of nitric oxide (NO),&#xD;
      producing vasodilation and the increase of inflammatory mediators, promoting heeling by&#xD;
      stimulating proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Some studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effect of IPC on the vascularity of bone and soft tissue (animal studies),&#xD;
      fracture related oedema and oedema related to venous disease and other medical conditions,&#xD;
      showing a convincing effect on all. Accumulating data from experimental animal studies&#xD;
      suggest that the use of IPC increases neurovascular ingrowth, the amount of newly organized&#xD;
      parallel collagen fibres, fibroblast proliferation and proliferative repair. Further IPC&#xD;
      counteract the negative influence immobilization has on tissue repair. Therefore,&#xD;
      theoretically one should expect that application of an IPC unit on a newly operated and&#xD;
      immobilized patients ankle, would prevent oedema formation, speed up tissue regeneration and&#xD;
      enhance arterial blood flow thereby preventing wound healing problems defined as infection,&#xD;
      wound dehiscence, prolonged healing, skin necrosis, exposed hardware, and maybe also&#xD;
      accelerate bone heeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COBAN 2 lite&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coban™ 2 lite is a compression bandage consisting of an inner comfort layer and an outer&#xD;
      stretch layer, designed to deliver therapeutic compression for the treatment of venous leg&#xD;
      ulcers and related conditions. The bandage is purposed for patients less tolerant of&#xD;
      compression, with mixed aetiology and a ABPI (ankle brachial pressure index) ≥ 0,5. Correctly&#xD;
      applied, the bandage take the form of a solid tube which reduces slippage and let the patient&#xD;
      wear it for up to several weeks without the need of re-application. The use of compression&#xD;
      stockings and bandages are well described in literature, and an integrated part of the&#xD;
      management of oedema end venous ulcers, but not addressed when it comes to fracture&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent pneumatic compression The IPC device is routinely employed in prevention of deep&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (DVT) and subsequently pulmonary embolism (PE) and in the management&#xD;
      of lymfoedema. It is considered a safe and efficient alternative to medical&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis and only few adverse effects have been described in literature, all&#xD;
      consisting of case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using IPC as DVT prophylaxis it is often applied during surgery and with the patient in&#xD;
      general anaesthesia, hindering the patient in reporting any discomfort. One author describes&#xD;
      a case, where application of IPC on a patient with cancer associated thrombosis and embolism,&#xD;
      results in a pulmonary embolism. The patient did not show signs of having a DVT prior to&#xD;
      surgery, and the author concludes that the PE might have taken place regardless of the&#xD;
      application of IPC devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two case reports describes peroneal nerve palsy as a possible adverse effect to IPC. The&#xD;
      first case concerns a woman with pancreatic cancer and weight loss, who develops peroneal&#xD;
      nerve palsy bilaterally under surgery, probably because there is no subcutaneous fat to&#xD;
      protect the nerve against the applied pressure between the fibular head and the compression&#xD;
      boot. The second case concerns an obese patient undergoing 10 hours intracranial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One author reports a case where an older woman with postoperative delirium and fragile skin&#xD;
      develops hemorrhagic bullae under the IPC-device. This could probably have been avoided, had&#xD;
      the patient not ben delirious an inept of reporting discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors have tried to associate the IPS unit to compartment syndrome, but the cases have&#xD;
      all been on patients whom have undergone prolonged operation in the lithotomy state, which is&#xD;
      known to increase the risk for compartment syndrome in the lower leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malfunctioning of the equipment is described in literature, but is rare. The IPC-device can&#xD;
      cause warmth and sweating under the inflatable textile and discomfort if it is placed&#xD;
      incorrectly or directly on top of a suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression bandage&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no descriptions in literature of major side effects to the compression bandage.&#xD;
      During the early implementation of compression treatment of malleolar fracture at the unit of&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Surgery, Nordsjællands Hospital, pressure-wounds have been observed, and in one&#xD;
      case with a visible Achilles tendon. Several minor pressure wounds have been noted, but these&#xD;
      have all successfully healed under conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coban™ 2 lite can cause discomfort such as tightness, if applied to firmly. The inner&#xD;
      comfortlayer can chafe bony prominences or tendons if applied to thick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautionary measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to prevent any side effects or discomfort, the project manager routinely and&#xD;
      frequently examines all patients included in the trial. This will take place both in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department, at the bedward 48-72 hours after admission, and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff will receive ongoing training in the application and observation of both Coban™ 2&#xD;
      lite and the Flowtron Hydroven 3™, in order to prevent any malfunctioning or misapplication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study1 - That the compression regime reduces wound infections from 10-40% to 5% on patients&#xD;
      with mono-, bi-, and trimalleolar fractures treated according to the ORIF-principles (open&#xD;
      reduction internal fixation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      - That the retrospective study will establish the historical incidence of infections, before&#xD;
      the compression regime was implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3 - That a systematic literature review will reveal the extent of infection and provide&#xD;
      the author with knowledge of regimes described in international literature, aiming at&#xD;
      lowering the incidence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;

      of oedema, blistering, smoking, diabetes, co-morbidity, age and sex)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Per-operative parameter: administration of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Postoperative compression/deflation management (elevation, Flowtron Hydroven™ og Coban2&#xD;
      lite™ ), oedema, blistering, infection, wound dehiscence, prolonged healing, skin necrosis,&#xD;
      exposed hardware, DVT, amputation and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study 3 To perform a literature study, enabling the author to describe, and establish the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 1: Patients are included in the Emergency Department (red) by the doctor on duty or&#xD;
      the project manager, if they are willing to participate and have given consent after written&#xD;
      and oral information about the study. As part of the standard treatment, X-rays are taken to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis. The fracture will be evaluated for the need of surgery, according to&#xD;
      the department standard:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unstable fractures (SU3+4, SA2, PA2+3, PU2+3+4). Particularly SU-fractures are important&#xD;
           to examine closely, in order to rule out ligamentous damage on the medial malleolar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dislocated fractures in the lateral malleolus, with maximum diastases of 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fracture of the medial malleolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard blood tests will be carried out, if deemed necessary, and the affected ankle will be&#xD;
      treated with a splint, according to the Emergency Department's standard procedures. The&#xD;
      patient will hereafter get randomized. Randomization, stratification, visualization of data,&#xD;
      and data storage will be managed using an IT system called Procordo (Procordo ApS Rugaardsvej&#xD;
      5 DK-8680 Ry Denmark). Patients will be block randomized into blocks of 6-10. This size is&#xD;
      chosen because of the stratification according to two variables, to make sure that an equal&#xD;
      distribution of stratae is obtained each block. Block size is blinded for the researcher. The&#xD;
      system will use a sequence of 300, and patients will be stratified according to diabetes,&#xD;
      smoking and need for closed reduction. The patient will be on-line randomized in the&#xD;
      emergency department, as close to the actual treatment as possible, in order to prevent&#xD;
      superfluous drop-out. Randomization is handled by either a doctor or a nurse using a computer&#xD;
      interface designed by Procordo. The person to include will open the computer, use the&#xD;
      shortcut symbol to the randomization interface, type the user name and code accessible to the&#xD;
      personnel in the emergency department. A sign with username and code will be hanging next to&#xD;
      the computer. The user will be asked to identify him/herself by name, and to type several&#xD;
      patient specific parameters: sex, CPR-number, fracture type, diabetes, smoking and others.&#xD;
      The computer will search in the 300-sequence and come up with the next available number&#xD;
      (either 1 or 2) to allocate the patient. The sequence is designed according to block-size,&#xD;
      p-value (0,5 or 0,5) and the total number of 300. The allocation process itself is hidden&#xD;
      from the investigator, and at no point in the process, will the system reveal if the patient&#xD;
      is in the treatment- or the control-arm. This makes it possible to blind the treatment later&#xD;
      on, when the patient visit the out-patient clinic. In theory the randomization interface is&#xD;
      accessible to all personnel in the emergency department, which is why every inclusion will be&#xD;
      checked by the project manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avert confounding treatments, a sign will be put on the patient bed during&#xD;
      hospitalization, communicating which group the patient belongs to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager will control that the intervention/non-intervention is applied according&#xD;
      to the study protocol. This is done by continuous visits to the bed ward, examining the&#xD;
      patients to see if the Coban2 lite™, Flowtron Hydroven™ and Braun frame are correctly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention group (pink): Will receive compression therapy in the form of a Flowtron&#xD;
      Hydroven™, 40-60 mmHg, ¾-1 hour, 3 times a day, when diagnosed and allocated in the emergency&#xD;
      department, either on top of the splint, or if no splint is administered, on top of the&#xD;
      dressing. This treatment will be continued, until the patient is fit for surgery according to&#xD;
      clinical priority and theatre availability. The surgical procedure will follow the standards&#xD;
      of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finished surgery, the doctor or nurse in the operating room (OR) will apply a dry,&#xD;
      non-adherent, wound dressing (Vliwasorb® Lohmann &amp; Rauscher, Gøngehusvej 252, DK-2950 Vedbæk,&#xD;
      Denmark) and Coban2 lite™. The patient will continue the Flowtron Hydroven™ treatment in the&#xD;
      bed ward (40-60 mmHg, ¾-1 hour 3 times a day) on top of the Coban2 lite™ bandage, until&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before discharge the patient is fitted with a Walker boot, unless there is bad compliance or&#xD;
      no pulse in arteria dorsalis pedis or tibialis anterior, in which case a CobraCast walking&#xD;
      bandage is applied. Both boot and bandage is applied at the bed ward, when the patient has&#xD;
      recovered from anaesthesia/analgesia, and worn during fysiotherapy and mobilization.&#xD;
      Observation and control of both Flowtron Hydroven™ and Coban2 lite™ in the ward are carried&#xD;
      out by the nurses with special training, according to standard procedures, and by the project&#xD;
      manager who will collect data between 48-72 hours after admission. On the day of discharge,&#xD;
      the Coban2 lite™ is removed, the wound dressing changed and a new Coban2 lite™ is re-applied.&#xD;
      According to standard treatment, x-rays are taken after 2 and 6 weeks, and the patient is&#xD;
      seen in the outpatient clinic accordingly. At both visits, clinical photos will be taken of&#xD;
      the surgical wound, in order to blind the clinical evaluation. Two senior doctors will later&#xD;
      be asked to evaluate the photos and determine if infection or wound dehiscence is present. At&#xD;
      the 2 weeks visit the Coban2 lite™ and stitches are removed, and a compression stocking is&#xD;
      fitted. The project manager will note any wound healing problems (infection, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Walker boot or CobraCast walking splint is re-applied. At the 6 weeks visit, x-rays will&#xD;
      be taken, and again the project manager will note any wound healing problems (infection,&#xD;
      wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material). If all parameters are&#xD;
      acceptable, the patient course, and follow up is concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group: In the Emergency Department the affected leg will be elevated on a Braun&#xD;
      Frame, and this treatment will continue in the bed ward, until the patient is fit for surgery&#xD;
      according to clinical priority and theatre availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will follow the standards of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, a Vliwasorb® wound dressing and TubiGrip™ bandage (Mölnlycke Health Care ApS,&#xD;
      Gydevang 33, DK-3450 Allerød, Denmark) is applied. Finally the ankle is stabilized in a&#xD;
      Walker boot, unless there is bad compliance or no pulse in arteria dorsalis pedis or tibialis&#xD;
      anterior, in which case a CobraCast walking bandage is applied. Both boot and bandage is&#xD;
      applied at the bed ward, when the patient has recovered from anaesthesia/analgesia, and worn&#xD;
      during fysiotherapy and mobilization. According to standard treatment, x-rays are taken after&#xD;
      2 and 6 weeks, and the patient is seen in the outpatient clinic accordingly. At both visits,&#xD;
      clinical photos will be taken of the surgical wound, in order to blind the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation. Two senior doctors will be asked to evaluate the photos and determine if&#xD;
      infection or wound dehiscence is present. At the 2 weeks visit, the TubiGrip™ and stitches&#xD;
      are removed. The project manager will note any wound healing problems (infection, wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material), and the TubiGrip™ and Walker&#xD;
      boot are re-applied. At the 6 weeks visit, X-rays will be taken, and again the project&#xD;
      manager will note any wound healing problems (infection, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis,&#xD;
      visible osteosynthesis material). If all parameters are acceptable, the patient course, and&#xD;
      follow up is concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 2: All treatments in this study have been closed, at the time of data collection.&#xD;
      So the project will have no influence on the course of the patients.&#xD;

      Sub study 1: Each year approximately 170 malleolar fractures are operated on at Nordsjællands&#xD;
      Hospital. Of these 78 are realistically to be included into the project, and studied&#xD;
      according to the study variables outlined below. The inclusion period runs for 24 months or&#xD;
      till (2x78) = 156 patients are included, and start 1/10/2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study 2: The 1/10/2013 the retrospective cohort study begins. 78 patient files will be&#xD;
      studied according to the study variables outlined below. The patient files must be dated from&#xD;
      before the department of orthopaedic surgery implemented the use of compression therapy as a&#xD;
      routine treatment for ankle fractures.&#xD;

      randomization will be entered into the log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Committee on Health Research Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An application has been forwarded to the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics, dated&#xD;
      7/12/2012. Application number: 36522&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Data Protection Agency: journal no. 2012-41-1331. Exempted from reporting on the&#xD;
      5th December 2012, as private medical research projects, which must be reported to the&#xD;
      National Committee on Health Research Ethics, are no longer required to report to the Danish&#xD;
      Data Protection Agency. The project manager is registered as private responsible for the data&#xD;
      (Danish: privat dataansvarlig) and undertakes to ensure that the applicable personal data&#xD;
      laws for medical research projects are followed by the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Danish Health and Medicines Authority, Pharmacovigilance and Medical Devices Case no.&#xD;
      2012113737. The study is assessed not to require notification according to the regulations&#xD;
      for medical equipment § 9, part 1 and therefore does not require reporting to the National&#xD;
      Board of Health or the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, Pharmacovigilance and Medical&#xD;
      Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decision to participate in the research project will be obtained from all patients&#xD;
      participating in the study. The decision is made upon due information on the nature,&#xD;
      significance, implications and risks of the project and upon receipt of suitable written&#xD;
      documentation. It is made voluntarily by a person who is capable of giving his or her&#xD;
      consent. The consent shall be in writing, dated and signed, and is obtained in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) The patient will be recruited in the ED as soon as the inclusion diagnosis is&#xD;
      made. The initial contact and inclusion will be handled by the doctor on duty or the project&#xD;
      manager. He or she will provide the above-mentioned written and oral information. The&#xD;
      patients in the ED are examined in small booths, separated by curtains. This provides the&#xD;
      necessary privacy to perform a physical examination, but preventing other patients from&#xD;
      overhearing conversation can be difficult. Therefor the patient should be offered the&#xD;
      possibility to continue the conversation in a quiet interview room. The patient is offered to&#xD;
      have an assessor participate in the conversation. All patients must be offered due&#xD;
      reconsideration time before making up their minds, this means enough time to talk to the&#xD;
      assessor or make a phone call. For practical reasons though, it will be difficult to offer&#xD;
      more than 60 minutes reconsideration time, due to the urgent nature of the trauma and the&#xD;
      urgent need for surgery. Furthermore the Flowtron Hydroven™ need to be applied relatively&#xD;
      quickly after the patient has been diagnosed with the ankle fracture, in order to obtain the&#xD;
      best effect. The nature of the intervention is considered non-invasive and with few adverse&#xD;
      effect, justifying the relatively short reconsideration time. The Informed consent form must&#xD;
      be signed before the patient leaves the ED and the patient can at any time decide to withdraw&#xD;
      from the project, without consequence to further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice The local GCP-committee (GCP region Hovedstaden) has been contacted&#xD;
      and report that the study is exempted from reporting to the GCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All personnel involved in the project are bound by professional confidentiality regarding all&#xD;
      private data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish law on &quot;behandling af personoplysninger&quot; (LOV nr. 429 af 31/05/2000) will be&#xD;
      adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data will be analysed in collaboration with statistician Tobias Wirenfeldt&#xD;
      Klausen. Data will be collected and partially analysed using SPSS (Statistical Product and&#xD;
      Service Solutions, 21, IBM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on literature, which shows a complication rate between 10% and 40%, P1 (representing&#xD;
      the expected complication rate in the control group), is set to 20% and P2 representing the&#xD;
      expected complication rate in the intervention group) to 5%. Using Lehr's formula for&#xD;
      calculating a power of 80% and a two-sided significance level at 0,05. The required sample&#xD;
      size in each group = 16/(Standard difference)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard difference= 0,454&#xD;
&#xD;
      (calcualtion details to obtain &quot;standard difference&quot; are difficult to show, due to&#xD;
      formatting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Quick formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the power is 80%, the required sample size in each group is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      16/Standard difference= 16/0,454= 77,6 = 78 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The (IPC)-unit used in this study is a Flowtron Hydroven 3™ (ArjoHuntleigh A/S Vassingerødvej&#xD;
      52 DK-3540 Lynge). It consists of an inflatable textile-boot connected to a pump providing an&#xD;
      intermittent pressure between 30-60mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compression bandage used in this study is Coban2 lite™ (3M a/s Hannemans Allé 53, 2300&#xD;
      KBH S, Denmark). It consists of an inner comfort layer and an outer stretch layer, designed&#xD;
      to give a resting pressure of more than 40mmHg. On standing it will produce a pressure of&#xD;
      more than 60mmHg which is the level accepted as the pressure required to counteract venous&#xD;
      hydrostatic pressure in the lower leg.&#xD;
