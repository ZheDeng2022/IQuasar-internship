      The main purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of repeated exposure to sleep&#xD;
      disruption (3 cycles of sleep disruption, each consisting of three days in a row where sleep&#xD;
      is shortened and disrupted, followed by a single night of recovery sleep) on inflammation,&#xD;
      mood, and pain processing (experiences/perceptions of pain). Purpose of this research project&#xD;
      is to understand the mechanisms of how sleep disruption may change mood and the experience of&#xD;
      pain. Understanding those mechanisms is important to develop interventions that may help to&#xD;
      reduce the effects of sleep disruption on mood and pain.&#xD;

      1. Screening Procedures: For this research study, the screening procedures include the&#xD;
           following activities. Participants will first complete questionnaires and have an&#xD;
           interview where they will be asked questions concerning general health status and&#xD;
           sleep-wake habits. Also during this visit, a study nurse will collect a small blood&#xD;
           sample that will be used to test for a number of markers of general health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If it appears that the participant may be eligible for participation, s/he will be&#xD;
           introduced to an electronic diary that will be emailed every morning and evening to&#xD;
           monitor sleep-wake patterns, mood, pain, and other health-related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following the medical screening (visit 2), the physician will determine if the&#xD;
           participant is eligible to proceed to the overnight sleep study. This consists of&#xD;
           sleeping overnight in the laboratory during the usual sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Seven days before participation in the in-hospital portion of the study, a member of the&#xD;
           study team will ask the participant to follow the study sleep-wake schedule. Sleep will&#xD;
           be monitored with an electronic sleep diary and the participant will wear an actigraphy&#xD;
           watch, which will help to evaluate sleep and measure the light level exposure before&#xD;
           starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization Procedures: Each participant will complete both parts of the study&#xD;
           protocol, i.e., the experimental condition (where participants will undergo repeated&#xD;
           cycles of sleep disruption, 18 days total in the Clinical Research Center) and the&#xD;
           control condition (where participants will have a sleep opportunity of 8 hours every&#xD;
           night; 18 days total in the Clinical Research Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Procedures: If a participant qualifies to take part in this research study,&#xD;
           s/he will be required to stay in the hospital for two 18 day long research protocols.&#xD;
           These protocols will take place at least 2-3 months apart. The experimental protocol&#xD;
           includes 3 nights of 8 hour-sleep per night followed by three 4-day cycles, each&#xD;
           consisting of 3 nights of shortened and disrupted sleep, followed by a single night of 8&#xD;
           hour recovery sleep. After the last cycle, the participant will have two more nights&#xD;
           with 8 hours of sleep per night. In the control protocol, these 18 days will be 8-hour&#xD;
           sleep nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the stay in the hospital, research staff will accompany the participant during&#xD;
           all waking times. The staff will help the participant to stay on the schedule, maintain&#xD;
           wakefulness, and make sure that equipment is recording properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both study protocols will begin with two adaptation nights. On the first day of the&#xD;
           protocol, the participant will be told the sleep condition to be assigned first: the&#xD;
           sleep disruption condition or the sleep control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the sleep disruption nights, sleep onset will be delayed by one hour (midnight&#xD;
           12am), and sleep offset (final wake up) will be advanced by one hour (6am). The sleep&#xD;
           period (12-6am) will be disrupted hourly by 20 minute long awakenings. During the&#xD;
           nighttime periods, the nurse will measure blood pressure and collect a small sample of&#xD;
           your saliva. The participant will also be asked to complete tests that assess well-being&#xD;
           and cognitive functioning (such as attention, learning).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the last day of the third cycle, the participant will have four nights with 8&#xD;
           hours of sleep per night. The participant will be able to leave the research center in&#xD;
           the morning after the 18th night.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each of the two 18-day stays in the hospital, participants will wear an&#xD;
           actigraphy watch on all study days, which will help to evaluate sleep and measure the&#xD;
           light level exposure. The participant will also have two blood draws obtained by a&#xD;
           simple needle stick on intermittent days. Additionally, during these 24-hour periods,&#xD;
           the study team will be collecting sleep recording data (using a polysomnography device&#xD;
           over a 24-hour period). Finally, the study team will collect urine samples over the&#xD;
           course of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood pressure will be measured at frequent intervals through the study. Computerized&#xD;
           performance tests will be conducted at frequent intervals through the study. One of the&#xD;
           tests involves measurement of reaction time by having participants press a button on a&#xD;
           little box. In another performance test the study team will ask the participant to press&#xD;
           the right or left mouse button depending on whether the word on the computer screen is&#xD;
           printed in the same color or in a different color; this should be done as quickly and as&#xD;
           accurately as possible. In addition, we will ask participants to rate well-being at&#xD;
           frequent intervals throughout the stay in the Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On several days during the stay in the Clinical Research Center, the investigators will&#xD;
           test the perception of pain. During pain testing, the participant will remain in a&#xD;
           comfortable chair throughout the testing session. The testing will consist of measures&#xD;
           of pain threshold (first feeling of the sensation of pain to a heat or mechanical&#xD;
           stimulus), pain tolerance (when the pain sensation feels intolerable), and pain&#xD;
           modulation (how the central nervous system can change the perception of pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures. For this research study, the monitoring/follow-up&#xD;
           procedures include meeting with one of the lead members of the study team on the last&#xD;
           day of each of the 18-day protocols. During this time, a study team member will discuss&#xD;
           the participant's study experience and will give the opportunity to ask any questions&#xD;
           concerning the study.&#xD;
