  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of a package of interventions including&#xD;
      production and distribution of locally produced complementary foods (via so-called&#xD;
      &quot;Grain-banks&quot;) and Micronutrient Powders (MNPs) supplementation, and optimized food based&#xD;
      Complementary Feeding Recommendation, on growth and micronutrient status of infants and young&#xD;
      children. The impact of the intervention package will be evaluated in a quasi-experimental&#xD;
      matched-control cluster design in infants and young children between 6 - 29 months of age.&#xD;
      The impact, outcome, and output indicators of infants/children will be assessed in&#xD;
      cross-sectional samples at baseline, after 9 and 18 months. A total of60 pair clusters are&#xD;
      selected in which 15 households per cluster will be identified from the eligible population.&#xD;
      A total of 1800 children from intervention and match-controlled clusters, will be sampled in&#xD;
      the target age groups. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to gather&#xD;
      information on Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP), Infant and Young Child Feeding&#xD;
      practices, anthropometry and anemia, following the impact pathway developed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions to be answered in this program evaluation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What impact does the extended pilot (implementation of local complementary food&#xD;
           production and MNP) have on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Growth in children 17-29 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Infant and Young Child Feeding practices in children (6-23m), and&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Anemia status in children 11-23 m?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are determining factors for the impact/no impact related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Immediate outcomes: skills and capacity; knowledge, attitude and practices; and&#xD;
                improved access&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Intermediate outcomes: utilization; provision, and ensuring enabling environment&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Program performance as measured by program monitoring data on output and&#xD;
                activities?&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to assess the impact/effectiveness of the improved interventions on&#xD;
      infant growth and micronutrient status so as to measure what would have happened in the&#xD;
      absence of interventions. The study will be conducted in the same four regions in Ethiopia&#xD;
      where the program intervention is taking place namely, Amhara, Tigray, Oromiya, and South&#xD;
      Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculations assume an expected difference of 0.2 Standard Deviation (SD) in&#xD;
           HAZ, and 5% difference in feeding practices, 80% power, and Î±-error of 5%; and a cluster&#xD;
           effect of approximately 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 1800 children will be sampled in both intervention and non-intervention&#xD;
           (control) villages. A total of 120 clusters are chosen for both groups. Each&#xD;
           intervention cluster will be matched with a control cluster selected to be similar in&#xD;
           geographical and ecological conditions, access to a health-care centre, status of food&#xD;
           security and the existence of Community Based Nutrition (CBN) programme. Within each&#xD;
           pair of clusters, households will be randomly selected after the complete listing of&#xD;
           eligible households. A total of 15 households will be identified in each 120 clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics and socio-economic status indicators will be collected using Demographic&#xD;
           Health Surveys (DHS) methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infant and Young Child feeding indicators will be assessed in all children 6-23 months&#xD;
           at baseline, mid- and endline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge attitude and practices concerning the intervention exposure indicators&#xD;
           including perceptions and utilization of complementary food, MNP, and the use and&#xD;
           perceptions on the grain banks will be assessed at baseline, mid- and endline in&#xD;
           caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For demographic and socio- economic characteristics of the study participants&#xD;
           descriptive statistics will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To calculate the nutritional status of children 6-23 months, Epi-Info/Emergency&#xD;
           Nutrition Action (ENA) for SMART software will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The median (min, max) of the weight or number of MNP consumed per day during the&#xD;
           intervention period will be calculated as measure of compliance; however analyses will&#xD;
           be done based on intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative data will be recorded in digital recorders which will be transcribed first&#xD;
           to local language then to English. Then specific themes will be identified and matrices&#xD;
           will be prepared and data will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The qualitative data will be analysed separately and triangulation will be made to&#xD;
           compare the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis, taking into account the&#xD;
           matched-controlled design. For continuous variables we will use linear mixed models that&#xD;
           include cluster, household and child as random effects to account for clustered&#xD;
           observations. Fixed effects to be included in the model are covariates such as child's&#xD;
           sex, age, household socio-economic status and relevant baseline values. Normality will&#xD;
           be examined by creating a Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot and subsequent visual inspection.&#xD;
           Equal variances will be assured with Levene's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For categorical variables mixed-effects logistic regression models will be used with&#xD;
           random effects for cluster and households.&#xD;
