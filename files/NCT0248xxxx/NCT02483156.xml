      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, open-label study in treatment naïve and treatment experienced adults with chronic&#xD;
      genotype 4 HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-naïve is defined as having never received treatment for HCV with any interferon&#xD;
      (IFN), RBV, or other approved or experimental HCV specific direct acting antivirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-experienced is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IFN Intolerant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non-response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relapse/Breakthrough&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that 40 + 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study such that an approximate&#xD;
      even number of treatment naïve and treatment experienced subjects will be enrolled across the&#xD;
      2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Sofosbuvir 400 mg once daily +RBV (1000 mg/day) for 12-24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 Single Dose (2 tablets) once daily each tablet containing SOF 200 mg, RBV 500 mg, and&#xD;
      Natural anti-hemolytic (AH) at 200 mg for 12-24 weeks Treatment assignments will be&#xD;
      stratified according to prior treatment experience and the presence or absence of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized design in subjects who completed treatment&#xD;
      in Part A of the study with SOF+RBV for 12-24 weeks or in Part B of the study with single&#xD;
      dose EHCV (2 Tablet) containing SOF/RBV/AH FDC for 12-24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Eligibility Criteria: HCV RNA &gt; 104 IU/mL or HCV RNA &gt; LLOQ and did not&#xD;
      achieve SVR 12 after completing prior treatment in this study with chronic genotype 4 HCV&#xD;
      infection. Treatment-naïve or treatment experienced adults, male and&#xD;
      non-pregnant/non-lactating female subjects, ages 18 years or older. See Section 1 and 1.2 of&#xD;
      the protocol for detailed Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures/&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency: Study visits for all subjects will occur at screening, Baseline/Day 1.&#xD;
      On-treatment visits will occur as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Part A, Arm 1 and 2 - at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 All&#xD;
      subjects will complete a 4-Week Post-treatment visit regardless of treatment duration.&#xD;
      Subjects with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ will continue to 12 Week and 24 Week Post treatment visits&#xD;
      unless confirmed viral relapse occurs at which time subjects will be early terminated from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments include safety laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, coagulation,&#xD;
      and urinalysis), 12 lead ECG, HCV RNA, serology (HBV, and HIV), hemoglobin A1c, urine drug&#xD;
      screen, liver imaging, serum B-hCG (for all female subjects of child-bearing potential),&#xD;
      physical examination (with height and bodyweight), vital signs, medical history, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, and adverse events. In addition, subjects being screened for Part A and Part B&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) will have HCV genotyping and IL28B genotyping performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-treatment assessments include safety laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and&#xD;
      coagulation), HCV RNA, urine pregnancy tests (for all female subjects of child-bearing&#xD;
      potential), physical examination, vital signs, concomitant medications, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment assessments include HCV RNA, urine pregnancy tests (for all female subjects of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential), vital signs, concomitant medications, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected at Baseline/Day 1 and every visit Plasma samples will be collected&#xD;
      during treatment visits for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of study drug (Part A only).&#xD;
      Untested samples will be archived for up to 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: SOF is manufactured as a 400 mg tablet for&#xD;
      oral administration. Subjects will take 1 tablet for a total dose of 400 mg orally once daily&#xD;
      in the morning with RBV (1000 mg) splitted on 2 doses daily 600 mg on morning and 400 mg on&#xD;
      evening and with food for 12-24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fixed dose EHCV combinations in Single Dose (2 tablets) once daily each tablet containing&#xD;
      SOF 200 mg, RBV 500 mg, and Natural anti-hemolytic (AH) at 200 mg. Subjects will take 2&#xD;
      tablet with food for 12-24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration: None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Adverse events will be collected from baseline through the 4 Week Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Visit and AEs related to study procedures, will be collected from when subjects sign the&#xD;
      consent form. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed during treatment through the 12&#xD;
      Week Post-Treatment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Efficacy will be evaluated using scheduled assessments of HCV RNA performed using&#xD;
      COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test, v2.0 for Use with the High Pure System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Part A only. A single PK blood sample will be collected at all study visits while on&#xD;
      Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy endpoint is SVR12 (ie, HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment) in all subjects who are randomized and treated. No statistical hypothesis&#xD;
      testing will be performed. For each of the two treatment groups, a 2-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval using the exact binomial distribution will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: With a sample size of 40 subjects in each arm, a two sided 95% exact confidence&#xD;
      interval will extend at most 29% in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: With a sample size of 40 subjects in each treatment group in Cohort 1, a 2-sided 95%&#xD;
      exact confidence interval will extend at most 32% in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints include the proportion of subjects with SVR4 and SVR24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All continuous endpoints will be summarized using an 8 number summary (n, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, and median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) by treatment duration. All categorical&#xD;
      endpoints will be summarized by number and percentage of subjects who meet the endpoint&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will be analyzed by the number and percent of subjects with events or&#xD;
      abnormalities for categorical values or using an 8 number summary (n, mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) for continuous data by treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from Part B will be analyzed separately from Part A and may be reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices&#xD;
      (GCPs) including archiving of essential documents.&#xD;
