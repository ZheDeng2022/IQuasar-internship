      Purpose and rationale: To define the role of IL-17 as a mediator of structural bone lesions&#xD;
      in psoriasis patients and patients with PsA. Primary Objective is the improvement of the&#xD;
      PsAMRIS synovitis score baseline vs. week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug tested is Secukinumab 300 mg administered weekly for 4 weeks, then 4 weekly s.c. with a&#xD;
      duration total of 24 weeks. Indication for this study is Psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis (PsA).&#xD;

                  anti-CD19)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, unwilling to use effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
                  for a minimum of 20 weeks after stopping treatment. Effective contraception is&#xD;
                  defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier method: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)&#xD;
                       with spermicide (where available). Spermicides alone are not a barrier&#xD;
                       method of contraception and should not be used alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following methods are considered more effective than the barrier method and are also&#xD;
        acceptable:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject [Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization: have had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In&#xD;
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of established oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). In case of use of oral&#xD;
             contraception women should have been stabile on the same pill for a minimum of 12&#xD;
             weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than PsA that might confound the&#xD;
                  evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Underlying metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic,&#xD;
                  endocrine, cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions which in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the investigator immunocompromises the subject and/or places the&#xD;
                  subject at unacceptable risk for participation in an immunomodulatory therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of clinically significant liver disease or liver injury as indicated by&#xD;
                  abnormal liver function tests such as SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline&#xD;
                  phosphatase, or serum bilirubin. The investigator should be guided by the&#xD;
                  following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A single&#xD;
             parameter elevated up to and including 2 x ULN should be re-checked once more as soon&#xD;
             as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to enrollment/randomization, to rule out&#xD;
             lab error&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 x ULN, total bilirubin&#xD;
             should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any case,&#xD;
             serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL (27 µmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Screening total WBC count &lt;3,000/µL, or platelets &lt;100,000/µL or neutrophils&#xD;
                  &lt;1,500/µL or hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL (85g/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception: common cold)&#xD;
                  prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease or evidence of&#xD;
                  tuberculosis infection as defined by either a positive PPD skin test (the size of&#xD;
                  induration will be measured after 48-72 hours, and a positive result is defined&#xD;
                  as an induration of ≥ 5mm or according to local practice/guidelines) or a&#xD;
                  positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test as indicated in the assessment schedule Table&#xD;
                  1: Assessment Schedule (Screening to week 24) . Subjects with a positive test may&#xD;
                  participate in the study if further work up (according to local&#xD;
                  practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of&#xD;
                  active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established then&#xD;
                  treatment according to local country guidelines must have been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C at screening or&#xD;
                  randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of&#xD;
                  malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years (except for basal cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma or actinic keratoses that have been treated with no evidence of&#xD;
                  recurrence in the past 3 months, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive&#xD;
                  malignant colon polyps that have been removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months&#xD;
                  before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6&#xD;
                  weeks preceding randomization.&#xD;
