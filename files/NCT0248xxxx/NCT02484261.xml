  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to monitor patients for relapse of the leukemia following allogeneic&#xD;
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) in order to identify patients early in&#xD;
      relapse, with a low burden of disease, when interventions may be more successful by&#xD;
      monitoring of peripheral blood lineage specific chimerism. Once disease has been confirmed,&#xD;
      patients will initiate a novel combination of bortezomib and pravastatin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled on this study at the time of transplantation. Following HSCT, CD34+&#xD;
      chimerism in peripheral blood will be monitored in real time at scheduled intervals. If&#xD;
      chimerism of CD34+ cells diminishes post-HSCT or clinical signs or symptoms of relapsed&#xD;
      leukemia, relapse in bone marrow will be confirmed, after which immunosuppression will be&#xD;
      withdrawn and treatment initiated with bortezomib and pravastatin. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      for disease response until 1 year post-HSCT or post-study therapy. Patients with confirmed&#xD;
      relapse post-HSCT will also be eligible to enroll and receive novel combination.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who have received a Stem cell transplant for Hematologic malignancies will be monitored for signs of relapse with blood tests for CD34+ chimerism. Patients with signs of relapse will have bone marrow aspirate and/or other appropriate tests to confirm presence of relapse.
