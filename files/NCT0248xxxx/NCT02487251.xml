    <textblock>
      Socioeconomic disparities in early childhood place low-income children at 1.5 to 2 times&#xD;
      higher risk for obesity compared to middle- to upper-income children. Obesity interventions&#xD;
      have turned toward the promotion of family mealtimes. Many families report barriers to&#xD;
      regular mealtimes but barriers in low-income families are intensified. While most prevention&#xD;
      efforts focus solely on nutrition education and knowledge, this project's approach is built&#xD;
      on the premises that: 1) enhancing parents' abilities to implement healthy family mealtimes&#xD;
      is critical to effective obesity prevention; and 2) inconsistent implementation of family&#xD;
      meals is not due only to a lack of nutrition education or knowledge, but to the adverse&#xD;
      effects of poverty on parents' capabilities to plan and execute mealtime. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to test the main, additive and interactive effects of 6 intervention components&#xD;
      reflecting differing levels of supports to increase the frequency of healthy family mealtimes&#xD;
      and ultimately reduce childhood obesity prevalence. The investigators will test 6&#xD;
      intervention components in a Screening Phase (N = 520), resulting in the implementation and&#xD;
      evaluation of a &quot;final&quot; intervention model in the Confirming (N = 250) reflecting the most&#xD;
      effective intervention components tested in the Screening Phase. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that providing low-income families with effective supports to enhance family&#xD;
      capability to plan and implement family mealtimes will lead to increased frequency of&#xD;
      mealtimes and to improvements in children's dietary quality and adiposity indices. Results&#xD;
      will inform policy (e.g. where limited resources may be allocated for maximum benefit) and&#xD;
      Extension efforts (e.g. supports most effective in promoting family meals).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Despite slight decreases in obesity prevalence in low-income children, nearly&#xD;
      25% of children under age 5 years are overweight or obese. Socioeconomic disparities in early&#xD;
      childhood place low-income children at 1.5 to 2 times higher risk for obesity compared to&#xD;
      middle- to upper-income children making obesity prevention targeting low-income children a&#xD;
      top public health priority. Recently, obesity interventions have turned toward the promotion&#xD;
      of family mealtimes as an obesity prevention strategy. Even among families with economic&#xD;
      resources, planning and implementing family mealtimes is challenging. Barriers to family&#xD;
      mealtimes among low-income families, however, are intensified. Further, low-income parents&#xD;
      facing the chronic stressors of poverty are more likely to experience compromised executive&#xD;
      functioning skills, impeding their abilities to plan and organize events such as mealtimes.&#xD;
      They are also more likely to encounter decision fatigue, the deteriorating quality of&#xD;
      decisions made after multiple decision making demands1 (e.g., continual daily decisions about&#xD;
      how to maximize limited financial, social, and emotional resources). In the context of&#xD;
      poverty, a parent's meal planning capacity is diminished and mealtime decisions may be made&#xD;
      impulsively. Most family mealtime intervention approaches have targeted meal planning skills&#xD;
      and knowledge and parental modeling of healthy eating, without significant regard to the&#xD;
      practical resources that would enable meal planning and implementation. There is a striking&#xD;
      lack of evidence about what level of resources low-income parents need to implement family&#xD;
      mealtimes. The investigators' approach is built on the premises that: 1) enhancing the&#xD;
      ability of parents to implement healthy family mealtimes is critical to effective obesity&#xD;
      prevention; and 2) when parents do not implement regular healthy family mealtimes, it is not&#xD;
      solely due to a lack of nutrition education or knowledge, but to the combined adverse effects&#xD;
      of poverty on the capability of parents to plan and execute healthy family mealtimes.&#xD;
      Identifying what resources are needed to aid low-income families in planning and implementing&#xD;
      family meals is crucial but unknown information. Without such information, effective&#xD;
      interventions cannot be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this integrated Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) application, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to test the main, additive and interactive effects of 6 intervention components&#xD;
      reflecting differing levels of practical resources to increase the frequency of healthy&#xD;
      family mealtimes, improve children's dietary quality and ultimately reduce childhood obesity&#xD;
      prevalence. Using the innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST; a cutting-edge&#xD;
      approach to maximizing resources in behavioral interventions by identifying the most&#xD;
      efficient intervention model possible), the investigators will test the 6 intervention&#xD;
      components in a Screening Phase (N = 520), resulting in the implementation and evaluation of&#xD;
      a &quot;final&quot; intervention model in the Confirming Phase (N = 250) that bundles the components&#xD;
      yielding the most robust effects. The 6 intervention components include: (1) Meal Delivery:&#xD;
      the home delivery of pre-made healthy family meals including recipes weekly for 8 weeks; (2)&#xD;
      Ingredient Delivery: the home delivery of ingredients and recipes to make healthy family&#xD;
      meals weekly for 8 weeks; (3) Community Kitchen: community kitchen sessions in which families&#xD;
      prepare healthy meals with recipes to take home weekly for 8 weeks; (4) Didactics: nutrition&#xD;
      education classes using the Preschool Obesity Prevention Series (POPS) curriculum, developed&#xD;
      and evaluated by the team with more 400 low-income Head Start parents 2 weekly for 8 weeks&#xD;
      (5) Cooking Lessons: cooking lessons/demonstrations with recipes weekly for 8 weeks; and (6)&#xD;
      Cookware/Flatware: delivery of flatware/ cookware to utilize for family meals delivered at&#xD;
      the beginning of the 8 week intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOST is a comprehensive, principled, engineering-inspired framework for optimizing and&#xD;
      evaluating multicomponent behavioral interventions. MOST includes a randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) for intervention evaluation, but unlike the standard approach to intervention&#xD;
      development, also includes key steps before the RCT. These steps are aimed at intervention&#xD;
      optimization by identifying what intervention components yield robust effects. MOST is&#xD;
      designed to be practical, and holds the possibility of achieving more rapid long-run&#xD;
      improvement of interventions without a dramatic increase in intervention research resources.&#xD;
      By testing 6 different intervention components simultaneously using the factorial design that&#xD;
      forms the basis of MOST, we will be able to identify the most cost-effective strategies for&#xD;
      achieving childhood obesity prevention through the Extension framework. Given the substantial&#xD;
      amount of resources dedicated to obesity prevention through Extension, the results will&#xD;
      inform the most appropriate resource allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The first phase of MOST, which the investigators will undertake in Years 1 to 2&#xD;
      of this proposal, is referred to as the &quot;Screening Phase&quot;, which refers to the systematic&#xD;
      testing of intervention components to ultimately build the most effective intervention. Using&#xD;
      a factorial design, the objective of implementing the MOST Screening Phase is to answer&#xD;
      questions such as: Which of the set of program components are active and contributing to&#xD;
      positive outcomes, and should be included in the intervention? Which program components are&#xD;
      inactive or counterproductive, and should be discarded? In the Screening Phase, 520&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled over four cohorts. After the indentification of the key&#xD;
      components for the packaged intervention, the critical interventions will be bundled in the&#xD;
      latter years of the study and evaluated as a standard 2-arm RCT, referred to in MOST&#xD;
      terminology as the &quot;Confirming Phase&quot;. The Confirming Phase will answer the question: Is this&#xD;
      intervention, as a package, efficacious and is the intervention effect large enough to&#xD;
      justify investment in community implementation? In the Confirming Phase, the final model of&#xD;
      the intervention will be delivered over the school year between October and April, beginning&#xD;
      in Fall 2017 and then in Fall 2018 in a randomized controlled trial (N = 250, half randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the bundled intervention and half receiving usual Head Start exposure). In the&#xD;
      Confirming Phase, the investigators hypothesize that the finalized intervention will lead to&#xD;
      children's improved dietary quality and, most importantly, to improved adiposity indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from a partnering Head Start program which serves mixed rural&#xD;
      and urban areas. Children and families represent a diverse group (race is 67% white, 28%&#xD;
      black; ethnicity 23% Hispanic; 12.6% English as second language) per year. Data will be&#xD;
      collected in the home prior to and at the conclusion of the interventions. Head Start&#xD;
      teachers will also complete behavioral ratings of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis- Screening Phase In the Screening Phase, the primary aim is to test on&#xD;
      an intent-to-treat basis using ANOVA models to test whether each factor (intervention) has a&#xD;
      significant effect on frequency of healthy, family mealtimes and dietary quality over an 8&#xD;
      week-period pre- to post-intervention. The investigators will also include two- and three-way&#xD;
      interactions between components to identify the effects of interactions between intervention&#xD;
      components on outcomes. The secondary primary aim is to make decisions about intervention&#xD;
      components and component levels based on the factorial experiment results. The investigators&#xD;
      will use a modified version of a decision making approach frequently used in engineering,&#xD;
      which emphasizes main effects, using interactions as additional valuable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis- Confirming Phase The primary objective is to determine whether the&#xD;
      bundled intervention vs. no intervention comparison group is more effective in reducing&#xD;
      children's adiposity indices. Baseline comparability of the 2 groups will be assessed using&#xD;
      t-test for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. To account for&#xD;
      clustering of children within a Head Start classroom, Proc Mixed in SAS with a random&#xD;
      intercept for the classroom will be used. The investigators will employ logistic regression&#xD;
      models using General Estimating Equations (GEE) techniques to account for classroom&#xD;
      clustering to compare changes in the prevalence of obesity and overweight across the 2&#xD;
      groups. Analyses will be conducted both with and without adjustment for baseline&#xD;
      characteristics such as age, sex, race, and baseline BMI or BMI z-score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Educational Objectives, Process and Fidelity Evaluation Maternal mealtime&#xD;
      self-efficacy, mealtime barriers, knowledge of obesity prevention behaviors, resources, and&#xD;
      perceptions of the mealtime climate will be compared pre-post in the intervention groups&#xD;
      using ANOVA models to determine change compared between groups. The investigators will&#xD;
      analyze data on recruitment, retention, participant and educator satisfaction, and also the&#xD;
      implementation fidelity data, using basic descriptive statistics. The investigators will use&#xD;
      qualitative approaches to analyze the interview data obtained from HS staff, Extension and&#xD;
      participating parents (i.e., identifying themes; segmenting responses into meaningful&#xD;
      categories). The process evaluation data will inform continued collaborations with HS and&#xD;
      Extension, and allow the investigators to more effectively disseminate our findings.&#xD;
      Likewise, results from descriptive analyses of the fidelity self-report (Extension) and&#xD;
      observational data will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>In Phase 1 of the study, participants receive one or more interventions intended to promote the frequency of family meals as an obesity prevention strategy. Supports range from the least to the most comprehensive. The interventions include: Meal Delivery, Ingredient Delivery, Community Kitchen, Healthy Eating Classes, Cooking Demonstrations and Provision of Cookware. The goal of this phase was to identify intervention components most robustly related to primary outcomes.&#xD;
The goal of Phase 2 is to test the finalized intervention in a randomized controlled trial. In Phase 2 of the study, participants are randomly assigned to a meal delivery/cookware provision intervention or to a usual exposure group. Participants in the intervention group receive two meals per week for 12 weeks and a set of cookware/dinnerware.</description>
