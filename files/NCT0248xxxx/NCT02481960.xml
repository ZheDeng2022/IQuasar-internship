    <textblock>
      A study to demonstrate safety, and feasibility for intraparenchymal injection of irinotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride drug-eluting beads in the treatment of recurrent high grade glioma (HGG).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CM-BC2, irinotecan hydrochloride drug-eluting bead, is an investigational product being&#xD;
      developed for direct injection in the tumor resection margin, in patients with recurrent high&#xD;
      grade glioma (HGG), in order to prevent or delay tumor progression or recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled and receive CM-BC2 following surgical resection of the recurrent&#xD;
      high grade glioma and will attend specified study visits until 6 months post surgery.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) (World Health&#xD;
             Organization grade III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient will be considered a good candidate for resection and will have estimated life&#xD;
             expectancy of at least 12 weeks as estimated by the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             designee. The decision to opt for resection of the recurrence must be independent of&#xD;
             study selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tumour characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Single unilateral and supratentorial lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  On clinician's assessment, must be operable under normal considerations of risk&#xD;
                  vs. benefit for condition and prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient will have received conventional treatment at the time of initial diagnosis,&#xD;
             including surgery (biopsy or de-bulking), and/or radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male or female; no racial exclusions; at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy must be excluded in female patients by beta- HCG (Human Chorionic&#xD;
             Gonadotropin); all patients agree to use adequate contraception for study duration,&#xD;
             not become pregnant or father children during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Karnofsky Performance Status of at least 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must be able to understand consent and study instructions as well as follow&#xD;
             prescribed instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient must have signed written informed consent prior to study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must not be enrolled in any other clinical trial for 30 days before or after&#xD;
             participation in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical make-up or&#xD;
             composition to CM-BC2, alginate or irinotecan; or has any other contraindications to&#xD;
             irinotecan therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Open communication between the ventricle CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) and tumour&#xD;
             resection cavity/site must be avoided. In the case of opening ventricles during&#xD;
             surgery, the surgeon must decide whether effective closure is possible by obstructing&#xD;
             the gap with Gelfoam/other appropriate materials&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor surgery, other than stereotactic biopsy of the high grade glioma, or other&#xD;
             neurosurgery within 30 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Irinotecan chemotherapy within 30 days prior to study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Radiotherapy or stereotactic (gamma knife) radiosurgery within 90 days prior to study&#xD;
             entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Loco-regional (intra-cranial) therapy for the treatment of high grade glioma,&#xD;
             including administration of biodegradable polymer wafers containing Carmustine and/or&#xD;
             brachytherapy, in the 6 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Significant liver function impairment: aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase&#xD;
             (ALT) greater than 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or total bilirubin greater&#xD;
             than 2 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant renal impairment: creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Coagulopathy Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of less than&#xD;
             1.5 x control, and/or platelet count of less than 100 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Hb less than 8 g/dL and/or neutrophil count (ANC - Absolute Neutrophil Count) of less&#xD;
             than 1 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes it in the patient's best&#xD;
             interest not to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Pre-existing cerebral oedema that, in the surgeon's opinion, poses unacceptable risk&#xD;
             of post-operative oedema. This decision may be at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Presence of concurrent malignancy, except for adequately controlled limited basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
