      The aim of this study is to get a clear view on current practice of surgical third molar&#xD;
      removal in Belgium and the association with morbidity and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this prospective cohort study, patients who visit the outpatient department of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospitals Leuven or hospitals affiliated with the&#xD;
      Flemish Hospital Network will be participating. All included patients are referred from&#xD;
      primary dental providers for the surgical removal of one or more third molars. Before&#xD;
      participating, written informed consent will be recorded from all eligible subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients consult one of the oral and maxillofacial surgeons or residents working on the&#xD;
      department of the University Hospitals Leuven for the removal of third molars. In the&#xD;
      standard procedure, patients are not routinely clinically monitored after one week at the&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative, operative and postoperative data will be collected through a questionnaire,&#xD;
      extracted data from the patient's medical file and panoramic radiography. The surgeon's&#xD;
      individual operation technique will be registered through a one-off questionnaire. The&#xD;
      questionnaires are taken at the same time of consultation and includes a maximum of 8&#xD;
      questions per time and are considered as non-invasive and a minimal burden for the patient.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients record their recovery status and ability to resume daily- and work&#xD;
      activities at day 3 and 10 by using a dairy system and, if necessary, revisit the outpatient&#xD;
      department of oral and maxillofacial surgery.&#xD;
