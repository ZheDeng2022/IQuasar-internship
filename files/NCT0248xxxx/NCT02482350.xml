  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemianopia refers to compromised vision in one half of the visual field, in either one or&#xD;
      both eyes. Hemianopic Alexia (HA) is a reading disorder related to such impairment, usually&#xD;
      caused by stroke or head injury. In order to read, participants have to move their eyes along&#xD;
      a line of text three to four times per second. Such eye movements are called saccades. One&#xD;
      makes use of peripheral visual information to the right (if reading from left to right, e.g.,&#xD;
      in English) or to the left (if reading from right to left, e.g., in Arabic) of words. HA&#xD;
      patients are deprived of much of this information. Patients with HA require far more&#xD;
      saccades, which slows their reading significantly and often prevents them from reading&#xD;
      efficiently for work or pleasure. It follows that the reading ability of those who read&#xD;
      left-to-right would be compromised more by right-sided HA, and in those who read&#xD;
      right-to-left by a left-sided HA. This study proposes to explore the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      left-sided HA following stroke, in Arabic readers. An online treatment package has been&#xD;
      developed in English (http://www.readright.ucl.ac.uk/). Currently, no assessment or treatment&#xD;
      resources exist for the condition in right-to-left readers. The aim is to develop novel&#xD;
      Arabic reading tests and rehabilitation material. The current project proposes to 1)&#xD;
      translate this package into Arabic, 2) develop new Arabic reading test materials and 3)&#xD;
      collect data from Arabic reading stroke patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial. The hope is to&#xD;
      develop an effective, novel, and empirically supported reading treatment package for Arabic&#xD;
      readers with HA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and Experimental Design Reading a line of text is usually achieved by planning a&#xD;
      series of saccades, which allow the eyes to jump from one word to another (reading&#xD;
      scan-path). Arabic readers use peripheral visual information to the left of the word in order&#xD;
      to plan their reading eye movements. Patients with HA are deprived of this information and&#xD;
      compensate by creating inefficient reading scan-paths with many additional saccades,&#xD;
      resulting in accurate but slow reading. Some patients abandon reading altogether, or lose&#xD;
      their jobs because they cannot read fast enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects read moving (scrolling) text faster than static text. This type of text,&#xD;
      also called &quot;Times Square&quot; presentation, induces a form of involuntary eye movement called&#xD;
      optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) in the reader and, when used as part of a rehabilitation program,&#xD;
      has been shown to improve subsequent reading performance of static text.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to adapt these techniques for scrolling Arabic text, and to test them in&#xD;
      Arabic-reading patients with left-sided HA. Rehabilitation material will be made available on&#xD;
      the Internet (via an iPhone and/or iPad Application ('app')) for suitable subjects, in order&#xD;
      to investigate whether patients benefit from using them outside of controlled trial&#xD;
      conditions. During pre- and post-therapeutic intervention the investigators will record the&#xD;
      following: reading speeds, visual field test scores, visual search test scores,&#xD;
      eye-movements, and Activities of Daily Living scores. Length of time for which patients&#xD;
      access rehabilitation material, will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help determine the efficacy of Internet-based behavioural rehabilitation. It&#xD;
      will also provide information as to: 1) how much improvement may be gained through this&#xD;
      program, and 2) how much practice patients will likely require in order to improve their&#xD;
      reading significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt and test reading rehabilitation techniques in patients with left-sided HA, using&#xD;
           scrolling Arabic text;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate whether patients benefit from using such material outside of controlled&#xD;
           trial conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will report a significant improvement in the speed at which they read static&#xD;
           text (newspaper, books, letters, etc.) as a function of quality activity of daily&#xD;
           living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will decrease the number of fixations (both progressive and regressive type&#xD;
           saccades) when reading static text.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Thirteen Arabic-reading patients with left-sided homonymous HA following stroke will&#xD;
      be studied over a period of three months. A single-subject baseline control design will be&#xD;
      employed. There will be a treatment-free interval before and after reading therapy. Baseline&#xD;
      assessments of visual fields, eye movement performance during text reading, text reading&#xD;
      speed, and visual search performance will be carried out pre-intervention. Behavioural&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated immediately following every five hours of therapy, and during&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients will determine how long to wait between testing points, as they will&#xD;
      differ in reading speeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the study criteria will be identified through Dr. Alex Leff's Alexia clinic&#xD;
      at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospital&#xD;
      (UCLH), as well as through formal collaboration with the neuropsychology department at&#xD;
      Wellington Hospital. In addition, patients will be given the option to join the study when&#xD;
      downloading the reading therapy app from the Apple iTunes store. An online consent form will&#xD;
      be included in the registration. The aim is to recruit at least thirteen patients to this&#xD;
      study over the following three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirteen healthy age-matched Arabic reading controls will be recruited from a variety of&#xD;
      sources, including relatives and friends of patients. Controls will undergo the same&#xD;
      assessment as patients, but will be assessed only once. They will not undergo the reading&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Initially, both the information sheet and consent forms will be delivered in hard&#xD;
      copy (written in both Arabic and English). When the application has been developed, pilot&#xD;
      study will be conducted. Participants will complete online consent forms, and will be&#xD;
      required to click certain key boxes to confirm that they have read or listened to, and&#xD;
      understood, the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, Burdens, and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits. App-delivered reading therapy has never before been available as a rehabilitation&#xD;
      package for Arabic reading patients with HA. The app may be used as stand-alone self-help&#xD;
      reading therapy, or as part of formal speech-language therapy. Additional benefits include&#xD;
      real-time activity monitoring, tracking of treatment progress, personalised feedback and&#xD;
      motivation support, portability and flexibility of use, and the potential to improve with&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Burdens. This will be the first study in patients with left-sided HA using scrolling&#xD;
      Arabic text. Thus there is little literature to guide the study. In order to maximize its&#xD;
      potential, the investigators will adapt the established English-reading treatment approach&#xD;
      used for patients with right-sided HA. There is no way of predicting how many patients will&#xD;
      use the application. Some participants may not meet the study criteria. In addition, the&#xD;
      patients themselves will manage their use of the application. There is therefore an inherent&#xD;
      risk of their not accessing the rehabilitation materials for the required period of time, and&#xD;
      not entering the data correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to enter the following data in order to gain full access to the&#xD;
      rehabilitation material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected on App-based patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A unique login, created by themselves. (This does not have to be their real name.) This&#xD;
           will ensure that each time they access the application; their data is collected under&#xD;
           their name.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Their email address (optional), for use only if they forget their login details.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The extent and side of their hemianopia. If they have not had this test performed by&#xD;
           their own doctor or optometrist, a section of this application provides self-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A test of their reading speed. This will be self-administered. Participants will time&#xD;
           themselves (a timer on the application will be activated by the touch screen) reading a&#xD;
           standard text aloud. Their text reading speed will be calculated and feedback to them.&#xD;
           Participants may check or recheck this at various times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A test of their performance on a visual search test. This will be self-administered.&#xD;
           Participants will be tested on their accuracy and speed when finding objects on a&#xD;
           section of the application. Their performance scores will be calculated and feedback to&#xD;
           them. Participants may check or recheck this at various times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants will rate themselves on their ability to perform activities of daily living&#xD;
           (ADLs) as a measure of their functional status in regards to their reading impairment.&#xD;
           Their scores will be calculated but not feedback to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other optional fields, which may prove useful in data analysis if enough subjects complete&#xD;
      them will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cause of their hemianopia. (This is usually stroke or head injury, but a free text&#xD;
           option will be provided.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How much reading they can manage with their hemianopia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether their hemianopia has caused them to change or loose their employment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will access the app and enter all personal data themselves. The only data we&#xD;
      will collect that is not directly controlled by the participants is the amount of time they&#xD;
      access the rehabilitation materials and their logon identification. The latter will ensure&#xD;
      that the same participant is not logging on to the application under multiple names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation materials used in the app-based reading training The rehabilitation materials&#xD;
      will consist simply of chapters of text, which scroll from left-to-right: that is, from the&#xD;
      blind visual field of the participants to their normal visual field. The texts will be&#xD;
      sourced from books out of copyright, freely available on the Internet. The aim is to provide&#xD;
      streaming text from other websites, such as news, current affairs etc. The participant may&#xD;
      control the speed at which the text scrolls. Participants will be advised to practice the&#xD;
      reading therapy on most days and to aim for 20 to 40 minutes per day. They will also be asked&#xD;
      to test their reading speeds every time they complete five hours of rehabilitation. Subjects&#xD;
      will be prompted to check their reading speeds after every five hours of exposure to therapy.&#xD;
      If they choose not to record any of this data, their access to the rehabilitation materials&#xD;
      will not be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected on Face-to-Face patients Patients with HA adopt an inefficient reading&#xD;
      strategy to compensate for their visual impairment on the hemianopic side. Therefore, we want&#xD;
      to compare the patients' reading scan-paths to those generated by healthy controls reading&#xD;
      the same static passages. We will be recording eye movements of participants as they read 10&#xD;
      passages using an eye-tracking device. A between groups statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
