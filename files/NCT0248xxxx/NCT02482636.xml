    <textblock>
      This multicentre, parallel group, block randomised clinical trial aims to investigate the&#xD;
      post booster antibody response in UK infants given a reduced priming schedule of&#xD;
      meningococcal serogroup B vaccine and 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. It will&#xD;
      provide information about how best to include the meningococcal B vaccine (likely to be&#xD;
      introduced late 2015) into the routine immunisation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK Department of Health provides a routine vaccination schedule for children in the UK&#xD;
      and are advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The Department&#xD;
      of Health have announced that the meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero) be introduced to the&#xD;
      routine schedule as a 2+1 schedule. Cost effectiveness could also be improved by removing the&#xD;
      current MenC conjugate vaccine dose given at 3 months of age. There is no published&#xD;
      immunogenicity data for Bexsero when given at 2, 4 and 12 months of age (2+1 schedule) and&#xD;
      with concomitant Infanrix/IPV/Hib which has now replaced Pediacel in the infant programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This change to the schedule would result in three injections at 2, 4 and 12 months, and given&#xD;
      previous reluctance among parents for three injections at one visit, an option to reduce&#xD;
      PCV13 to a 1+1 schedule (priming dose at 3 months and booster at 12 months) will be assessed&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's primary objective is to assess antibody response to the pneumococcal vaccine&#xD;
      after the final infant vaccinations at approximately 13 months of age, and secondary&#xD;
      objectives include antibody response following meningococcal B and C vaccines, tetanus,&#xD;
      diphtheria and pertussis vaccines. In addition, the effect of maternal pertussis vaccination&#xD;
      in pregnancy on infant immune response to vaccines, the prevalence of carriage of&#xD;
      pneumococcal serotypes at 12 and 18 months of age and reactogenecity following each vaccine&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 healthy children who have not yet received their routine infant immunisations will be&#xD;
      enrolled between 8 and 12 weeks old. Participants will be randomised into one of two groups&#xD;
      with differing vaccine schedules. Children in both groups will receive their routine&#xD;
      immunisations with the following changes: the addition of 3 doses of a meningococcal B&#xD;
      vaccine at 2, 4 and 12 months and a meningococcal C vaccine at 12 months only (instead of a&#xD;
      dose at 3 and 12 months). The 2 groups will differ by the number of doses of the 13-valent&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13); to be given either at 2, 4, and 12 months of age (as currently&#xD;
      given in the routine schedule) or at 3 and 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have 2 blood tests: at 5 and 13 months of age, and 2 nose swabs: at 12&#xD;
      and 18 months of age to address the objectives of the study. Parents will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a health diary to record any adverse events in the 7 days following vaccinations and&#xD;
      a continuous thermometer (ibutton) will be used to record the temperature for 24 hours after&#xD;
      each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the blood samples at 13 months reveal antibody titres that are below the level indicative&#xD;
      of protection, a recommendation will be made for booster vaccinations.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Confirmed anaphylactic reaction to any constituent or excipient of the vaccine(s).&#xD;

          -  A confirmed anaphylactic reaction to neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B (which may&#xD;
             be present in trace amounts in the tetanus vaccine) and/or kanamycin, histidine,&#xD;
             sodium chloride or sucrose (which may be present in trace amounts in the MenB&#xD;
             vaccine).&#xD;
