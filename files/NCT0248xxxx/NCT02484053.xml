  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab is frequently used in adult and pediatric cancers, blood disorders, lymphoma (a&#xD;
      cancerous growth made up of lymphoid tissue), graft-versus-host-disease (complication that&#xD;
      can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant), diseases of the immune system (the&#xD;
      cells and substances that protect the body from infection) and rheumatologic conditions.&#xD;
      Rituximab works by decreasing or temporarily eliminating a specific type of white blood cell,&#xD;
      the B-lymphocyte. Overall, rituximab is generally well tolerated. The likelihood of an&#xD;
      infusion-related reaction, or symptoms such as fever, chills, hives, low blood pressure or&#xD;
      swelling, is very low, but highest during a patient's first infusion of rituximab and&#xD;
      decreases with each additional dose. Adults commonly receive rituximab at a faster rate if&#xD;
      they have done well with the first infusion, this study will help determine if the same&#xD;
      approach is well tolerated in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are testing a new method of administering rituximab which&#xD;
      may reduce the time it takes to receive the medication. The initial ordered amount of&#xD;
      rituximab will not change from the current standard of care (meaning what is usually done by&#xD;
      doctors, and would likely be done if you were not on this study). The period of time over&#xD;
      which rituximab is given is what is being studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care in patients receiving rituximab is to give the dose slowly and gradually&#xD;
      increase the rate of rituximab until the full dose is given, which may take several hours.&#xD;
      This is done in order to prevent a side effect of rituximab called an infusion reaction.&#xD;
      Infusion reactions are similar to allergic reactions and may cause symptoms such as low blood&#xD;
      pressure, wheezing, chest tightness, fever, itching, bad cough, blue skin color, seizures, or&#xD;
      swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are testing the method of giving rituximab over a shorter&#xD;
      period of time. Administering rituximab at this faster rate is done commonly and safely in&#xD;
      the adult population with very few side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug rituximab will be given as an infusion in the outpatient clinic. Infusion means the&#xD;
      drug is given using a needle or tubing inserted into a vein (also called an IV) over a period&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have a cancer or blood disorder, they will receive rituximab administration over&#xD;
      90 minutes, 20% of the dose will be given over the first 30 minutes and the remaining 80% of&#xD;
      the dose will be given over 60 minutes. This is the standard method of infusing doses of&#xD;
      rituximab in adults who have a cancer or blood disorder, and have done well with a first dose&#xD;
      of rituximab at the standard infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have a rheumatologic disease, they will receive rituximab administration over 120&#xD;
      minutes, 12.5% of the dose will be given over the first 30 minutes and the remaining 87.5% of&#xD;
      the dose will be given over 90 minutes. This is the standard method of infusing doses of&#xD;
      rituximab in adults who have a rheumatologic disorder, and have done well with a first dose&#xD;
      of rituximab at the standard infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this time, the investigator will also assess to see if patients have any side effects&#xD;
      from receiving the faster infusion and for 15 minutes following the end of the infusion.&#xD;
      Patients will also be followed up by phone or in clinic one week after the rapid infusion of&#xD;
      rituximab to see if they have any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before patients receive rituximab, they will receive acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. These&#xD;
      medications are given to help prevent an infusion reaction from occurring. These medications&#xD;
      are always given no matter how quickly rituximab is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an infusion reaction occurs, the rituximab infusion will stop and patients will receive&#xD;
      medications to help reverse the reaction. Once the reaction has gone away, the patient's&#xD;
      doctor will determine if and how they will receive the rest of their rituximab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one rapid infusion of rituximab as part of their participation in this&#xD;
      study. If patients did not have an infusion-related reaction they are eligible to receive&#xD;
      subsequent infusions off protocol at the discretion of the provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to allow us to view and collect information from their medical records&#xD;
      prior to their infusion to ensure eligibility and obtain baseline data, as needed on the day&#xD;
      of their infusion and through the next clinical follow up to monitor for side effects from&#xD;
      the infusion. Data collected from the medical records includes but is not limited to,&#xD;
      demographic information (age, race/ethnicity, weight, diagnoses, and indication for&#xD;
      rituximab).&#xD;
