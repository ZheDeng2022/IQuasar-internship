      This is a single-center, randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled phase-2 study of&#xD;
      subjects 8 years of age and older with Common Warts (Verruca vulgaris) who desire treatment.&#xD;
      A total of four visits are planned including one baseline and three follow-ups. Screening&#xD;
      will be done at Visit 1 (Baseline) and all safety and efficacy measurements will be made at&#xD;
      all subsequent visits (Visits 2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of twice daily-applied ALC-919 vs. vehicle&#xD;
      in male and female subjects 8 years of age and older with Common Warts (Verruca vulgaris).&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is complete resolution of lesions at the 12 week visit. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures will include the change in lesion count at the 12 week visit, improvement in&#xD;
      the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale score at the 12 week visit and the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability profile of the treatment arm compared to the vehicle arm at each study visit.&#xD;
      The safety will be assessed using clinical cutaneous safety exams that will report scaling,&#xD;
      dryness and erythema on a scale of 0-3 (0= absent, 1=mild. 2=moderate, 3=severe).&#xD;
      Tolerability will be assessed by having subjects answer the treatment tolerability questions&#xD;
      at each visit during the treatment period. The tolerability question will be assessed using a&#xD;
      0-3 scale for itching, burning, and stinging.&#xD;
