      The OCT-FORMIDABLE register will include with a retrospective fashion all consecutive&#xD;
      patients that perform OCT on culprit and not culprit plaque in any subset in patients with&#xD;
      ACS. Clinical and OCT data will be included in the register according to the dataset.The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the correlation of OCT characteristics with incidence of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs defined as the composite of death from cardiac causes,&#xD;
      non- fatal MI, clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), or re-hospitalization&#xD;
      due to unstable or progressive angina according to Braunwald Unstable Angina Classification)&#xD;
      and clinical baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular subanalysis will be performed in the following subgroups: culprit plaque, not&#xD;
      culprit plaque in culprit vessel, not culprit plaque in different vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point will be to evaluate how OCT analysis changed interventional cardiology&#xD;
      approach in culprit plaque definition and coronary stenting respect the coronary angiography&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION. Pathophysiology of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) deeply differs from those of&#xD;
      stable patients, mainly due to peculiar features of plaque. Interestingly, most of the&#xD;
      lesions triggering an acute ischemic event, usually defined &quot;culprit lesions&quot; are not&#xD;
      angiographically severe, but present with mild stenosis. However, when evaluated at autopsy&#xD;
      or with intracoronary imaging, they show often a pro-thrombotic pattern, with thin cap&#xD;
      fibroatheroma, soft plaques and thrombus, prone to rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without culprit plaque rupture (CPR) exhibit different mechanisms of instability&#xD;
      including thrombus at the site of plaque erosion, or intense vasoconstriction of epicardial&#xD;
      arteries or coronary microcirculation disfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this setting, in the last years Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has emerged as the most&#xD;
      accurate instrument for intracoronary evaluation. Due to a resolution of approximately 10-20&#xD;
      µm it has been largely exploited in the evaluation and characterization of plaque features,&#xD;
      both in stable and acute coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, despite recent evidences, characteristics of culprit plaque in different&#xD;
      subset of patients are not well defined. Moreover clinical significance of plaque&#xD;
      characteristics is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The OCT-FORMIDABLE register will include with a retrospective fashion all consecutive&#xD;
      patients that perform OCT on culprit and not culprit plaque in any subset in patients with&#xD;
      ACS. Clinical and OCT data will be included in the register according to the dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: the recent paper of Niccoli et al showed a percentages of plaque rupture of 60%&#xD;
      in ACS. According to the paper by Pedruzzi et al, at least 100 patients are needed to&#xD;
      evaluate independent predictive power of clinical presentation (STEMI vs NSTEMI vs UA),&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, previous use of aspirin, of statin and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT ANALYSIS Different OCT system analysis and technique (different pullback velocity 75 mm&#xD;
      vs 54 mm, contrast mediated or ringer lactate injection) will be reported. Each center will&#xD;
      evaluate the OCT image by internal committee composed by at least two people. In case of&#xD;
      discordance an external opinion will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque rupture will be defined as the presence of fibrous cap discontinuity leading to a&#xD;
      communication between the inner (necrotic) core of the plaque and the lumen. Plaque rupture&#xD;
      included also fibrous cap disruption detected over a calcified plaque characterized by&#xD;
      protruding calcification, superficial calcium, and the presence of substantive calcium&#xD;
      proximal or distal to the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thin cap fibro atheroma will be defined as cap thickness &lt; 65 nm. Thin cap fibro atheroma at&#xD;
      rupture site will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrocalcific, fibrotic plaque, lipid component or macrophage infiltration will be defined&#xD;
      according to the recent proposed criteria and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be divided according the clinical significance of the studied plaque, in particular&#xD;
      culprit plaque, not culprit plaque in culprit vessel and not culprit plaque in other vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover will be recoded if OCT analysis changed the interventional cardiologist approach in&#xD;
      deciding the culprit lesion to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP AND ENDPOINT DEFINITION A clinical follow-up at least of 12 months after&#xD;
      discharge will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the correlation of OCT characteristics with incidence of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs defined as the composite of death from cardiac causes,&#xD;
      non- fatal MI, clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), or re-hospitalization&#xD;
      due to unstable or progressive angina according to Braunwald Unstable Angina Classification)&#xD;
      and clinical baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular subanalysis will be performed in the following subgroups: culprit plaque, not&#xD;
      culprit plaque in culprit vessel, not culprit plaque in different vessel.&#xD;
