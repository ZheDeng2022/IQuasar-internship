    <textblock>
      This multi-centre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted over 12-weeks to evaluate&#xD;
      whether lower appetite is associated with weight loss maintenance success. The effect of a&#xD;
      healthy diet supplemented with products that could enhance feelings of satiety and reduce&#xD;
      food intake after an initial weight loss period to assess weight maintenance. Participants&#xD;
      will either receive the active SATIN product or a matched control product. The products&#xD;
      contain ingredients which have been shown to positively affect satiety, satiation and/or body&#xD;
      weight and are all accepted food ingredients approved for human consumption in Europe. They&#xD;
      will be incorporated into different food matrices, e.g. drinks, shakes and cheeses.&#xD;
      Corresponding control products without the active ingredients will be provided to&#xD;
      participants allocated to the control group. The participants will be instructed in detail on&#xD;
      how and when to consume the test products. Participants will be 300 adults (BMI &gt;27kg/m2;&#xD;
      Age&gt;18years) who will be tested at three research sites (University of Liverpool, United&#xD;
      Kingdom; University of Copenhagen, Denmark and University Rovira I Virgili, Spain).&#xD;
      Recruitment will be divided between sites. Participants will attend assessments at one of the&#xD;
      three research sites continually throughout the study period. The primary outcome is to&#xD;
      assess potential associations between changes in appetite (ad libitum energy intake, acute as&#xD;
      well as sustained) and change in body weight during the 12-week follow-up period. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include assessing waist circumference, body composition (DXA), subjective appetite,&#xD;
      biomarkers of health outcomes (blood and urine indices), changes in physical activity as well&#xD;
      as consumer benefits of the trial (assessed in a range of questionnaires) to determine diet&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double blinded parallel randomized multicentre study, with six arms. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted simultaneously in Denmark, Spain and United Kingdom, at the study sites&#xD;
      specified on page 3. A total of 300 participants with an initial BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m2 and a&#xD;
      fat mass of no less than 23% will be enrolled in the study. An initial weight loss of a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 % will be needed for inclusion in the randomized part of the study. The weight&#xD;
      loss will be achieved by administration of a low calorie diet (LCD) for 8 weeks managed by&#xD;
      dietician supervised group sessions. Failure to reach at least 8% weight reduction during the&#xD;
      LCD will result in exclusion from the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants reaching the pre-defined weight loss of no less than 8% will enter a 7-10 days&#xD;
      run-in period for diet stabilization before entering the 12-week randomized part of the&#xD;
      study. In the randomized part of the study all participants will be advised to follow a&#xD;
      general healthy weight loss maintenance diet in accordance with national dietary guidelines.&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following&#xD;
      intervention groups; 1) including an active satiety enhancing product (active intervention&#xD;
      group) or 2) including a similar control product without satiety enhancing properties&#xD;
      (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the participants will be instructed to consume the intervention products&#xD;
      daily. Primary study visits for the assessment of body weight, waist circumference, hip&#xD;
      circumference, sagittal diameter and blood pressure will be performed at the beginning, and&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention period. At least every four weeks during the intervention, the&#xD;
      participants will be requested to pick up the study products, and during these visits&#xD;
      bodyweight and waist and hip circumference will be recorded. The participants will&#xD;
      furthermore meet individually with a dietician three times during the 12 weeks intervention&#xD;
      period to enhance compliance with the weight loss maintenance diet and to ensure&#xD;
      incorporation of the study specific products into their diet as instructed. Adverse events&#xD;
      and concomitant medicine will be registered continuously throughout the study. For each&#xD;
      participant, the total study duration is 24 weeks, and includes 17 visits at the study site&#xD;
      in total (14+3 appetite probe days)&#xD;

The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. It contains both positively and negatively phrased items, with positively phrased items being reverse scored</description>
