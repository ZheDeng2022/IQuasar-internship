      Diabetes is associated with a substantially increased risk of heart failure, which is&#xD;
      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control, recent clinical data from the saxagliptin&#xD;
      assessment of vascular outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus-thrombolysis in&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (SAVOR-TIMI) 53 study observed an unexpected finding of an excess of&#xD;
      adjudicated heart failure hospitalizations. This excess occurred in the setting of&#xD;
      pre-existing heart failure (HF) hospitalization and in those with elevated biomarkers for&#xD;
      heart failure such as N terminal pro Brain type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP). A wealth of&#xD;
      preclinical data did not suggest a mechanistic basis for an excess of heart failure events,&#xD;
      however these preclinical studies primarily focused upon prevention based strategies as&#xD;
      opposed to regression studies once established heart failure was present. This proposal seeks&#xD;
      to understand if and how dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i,specifically saxagliptin)&#xD;
      may influence the development of heart failure, by evaluating changes in cardiac structure&#xD;
      and function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

      The cardiovascular safety and potential cardioprotective effects of diabetes drugs have been&#xD;
      the focus of recent research. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all&#xD;
      new anti-diabetic drugs to demonstrate no important increase in cardiovascular adverse events&#xD;
      before approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are oral incretin-based agents that&#xD;
      increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, with proven anti-hyperglycemic effects and&#xD;
      are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes. In a rat model of diabetes and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, sitagliptin treatment improved passive left ventricular compliance,&#xD;
      increased endothelial cell density, reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen abundance. GLP-1&#xD;
      and DDP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin improve cardiac function, cardiac remodeling, and&#xD;
      survival in animal models of pressure-overload and chronic heart failure. However, in another&#xD;
      study of post-MI cardiac remodeling in mice, vildagliptin failed to show any early or late&#xD;
      protective effects on cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some clinical studies suggest that GLP-1 infusion is associated with an absolute increase in&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure, although data are&#xD;
      conflicting. The GLP-1 receptor analog, exenatide may reduce infarct size in patients with&#xD;
      myocardial infarction but does not improve LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute&#xD;
      Coronary Syndrome EXAMINE trial randomized assigned 5340 patients with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      recent acute coronary syndrome to alogliptin or placebo, and found no increase in adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in the alogliptin group. In SAVOR-TIMI 53, 16,492 patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events were randomized to&#xD;
      receive saxagliptin or placebo. Over a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the primary composite&#xD;
      endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke did not differ&#xD;
      significantly between the 2 groups (P=0.99 for superiority; P&lt;0.001 for noninferiority).&#xD;
      However, patients in the saxagliptin group were more likely to be hospitalized for heart&#xD;
      failure, which was not ascertained in the EXAMINE trial. Furthermore, the Sitagliptin&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Outcome Study (TECOS), which examined the DPP4i sitagliptin versus placebo in&#xD;
      high risk patients for a cardiovascular event demonstrated cardiovascular safety (P&lt;0.001 for&#xD;
      non inferiority), and there was no signal for excess heart failure hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for measuring LV&#xD;
      volume, mass, and ejection fraction. LV volume measurements by cardiac MRI do not rely on&#xD;
      geometric assumptions. CMR measurements have excellent intra-observer, inter-observer, and&#xD;
      inter-study variability, which were superior to other imaging techniques. The high&#xD;
      inter-study reproducibility of CMR affords a substantial reduction in the required sample&#xD;
      size to demonstrate even small changes in LV volume, LV mass or LVEF, or conversely, to&#xD;
      reliably exclude clinically important changes. Furthermore, CMR tagging allows detailed and&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of regional LV diastolic and systolic function. For example, in the&#xD;
      Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), CMR can detect subtle alterations in global and&#xD;
      regional LV functions in patients with traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
      Although prior studies have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects of improved glycemic&#xD;
      control on myocardial function, CMR promises to be a more sensitive and accurate technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators propose to use CMR to examine the cardiac structure, global&#xD;
      and regional function among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with saxagliptin.&#xD;
