      Introduction: physical therapy is essential in preventing motor and functional complications&#xD;
      after breast cancer surgery. However, there is no prospective randomized study of different&#xD;
      physiotherapy approaches in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction. Objectives: to evaluate two physical therapy protocols in patients after&#xD;
      breast cancer surgery with immediate reconstruction. A group with shoulder exercises with&#xD;
      limited range of motion (ROM) at 90 degrees up to a month after surgery and a group with&#xD;
      limited ROM only up to 15 days after surgery. Specific objectives: to evaluate shoulder ROM&#xD;
      and pain one week before the surgery on average, and 07, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after&#xD;
      surgery; assess motor function one week before the surgery on average, and 30 and 90 days&#xD;
      after surgery; evaluate dehiscence and seroma 07, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery;&#xD;
      associate incidence of seroma and dehiscence with preoperative risk factors and compare all&#xD;
      variables (shoulder ROM, pain, motor function, seroma and dehiscence) between the two groups.&#xD;
      Methods: women with breast cancer, who will be submitted to breast surgery (radical or&#xD;
      conservative), followed by immediate reconstruction: alloplastic (tissue expander or breast&#xD;
      implant) or oncoplastic (breast reduction or contralateral symmetrization) will be included.&#xD;
      Patients that will be submitted to bilateral oncology surgery, reconstruction with autologous&#xD;
      tissue or breast surgery without reconstruction will not be included. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited just after surgery scheduling and will undergo preoperative evaluation. At this&#xD;
      moment, preoperative analysis will be conducted with personal data and medical history.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo new assessments 07, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after surgery. All&#xD;
      patients will receive standard physiotherapy treatment for women undergoing breast&#xD;
      reconstruction from Physical Therapy Sector. The protocol consists of early exercise, limited&#xD;
      to 90° of shoulder ROM, starting the day after the surgery and repeated 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
      After 15 days of surgery, the patients will be randomized into two treatment protocols. One&#xD;
      group will start to perform exercises with free shoulder ROM. Patients will be told only to&#xD;
      limit the movement if they feel pain. The other group will keep shoulder exercises limited to&#xD;
      90° up to 30 days after surgery. At that moment (one month after surgery), they will also be&#xD;
      allowed to move the shoulder with no restriction. The evaluation of the presence of&#xD;
      dehiscence and seroma will occur by inspection and palpation. Shoulder ROM will be&#xD;
      investigated through active goniometry of flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, internal&#xD;
      rotation and external rotation. The pain will be assessed with the Verbal Numerical Scale&#xD;
      from 0 to10 and upper limb function through the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and&#xD;
      Hand Questionnaire) questionnaire.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited just after surgery scheduling. They will undergo preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation one week before the surgery on average. At this moment, preoperative analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted with personal data and medical history. Patients will undergo new assessments&#xD;
      07, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after surgery, periods that will be described as PO 07, PO&#xD;
      15, PO 30, PO 60, PO 90 and PO 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard physiotherapy treatment for women undergoing breast&#xD;
      reconstruction from Physical Therapy Sector of Mastology Discipline of the Department of&#xD;
      Gynecology of Federal University of São Paulo. The protocol consists of early exercise,&#xD;
      limited to 90° of shoulder range of motion (ROM), starting the day after the surgery and&#xD;
      repeated 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 15 days of surgery, the patients will be randomized into two treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because of the existence of different types of reconstructive surgery, randomization&#xD;
      will performed from two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alloplastic group: patients who will undergo reconstruction with tissue expander or&#xD;
           breast implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oncoplastic Group: patients who will undergo mammaplasty and / or contralateral&#xD;
           symmetrization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer random sequence will be used for randomization, in which each group will be&#xD;
      randomized to Group A or Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup A: Patients will start to perform exercises with free shoulder ROM. Patients&#xD;
           will be told only to limit the movement if they feel pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup B: Patient will keep shoulder exercises limited to 90° up to 30 days after&#xD;
           surgery. At that moment (one month after surgery), then patients will also be allowed to&#xD;
           move the shoulder with no restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of randomization there will be four subgroups: alloplastic A, alloplastic B,&#xD;
      oncoplastic A and oncoplastic B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shoulder range of motion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The shoulder ROM will be assessed with a goniometer for flexion, extension, adduction,&#xD;
           abduction, internal rotation and external rotation. The movements will be performed&#xD;
           actively. The patient will be positioned in the sitting position. To assess shoulder&#xD;
           flexion, the upper limb will be in neutral position with elbow extension. Patient will&#xD;
           be asked to raise the arm forward, close to the body. To assess extension, the arm will&#xD;
           be positioned with 90° of elbow flexion and the patient will be asked to take the arm&#xD;
           back. For adduction, the patient will be with 90° of shoulder flexion with the palm down&#xD;
           and patient will be told to move the arm medially. For the study of the upper limb&#xD;
           abduction, the limb will be in supination and elbow extension and the patient will be&#xD;
           asked to raise the arm to the side, along the trunk line toward the ear. For the&#xD;
           evaluation of internal rotation and external rotation the upper limb will be placed in&#xD;
           90° of shoulder abduction and 90° of elbow flexion. The patient will be asked to rotate&#xD;
           the shoulder internally and externally, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pain will be evaluated with the Verbal Scale of Pain from zero to ten, where zero is&#xD;
           no pain and ten is unbearable pain. The patient will be asked if there is pain at the&#xD;
           moment of evaluation , and to describe the place and the degree of the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Upper limbs function:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To investigate the motor shoulder function DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and&#xD;
           Hand Questionnaire) questionnaire will be used. It assesses the functional capacity in&#xD;
           upper limb diseases and measures the skills to do certain activities, as well as the&#xD;
           symptoms. It consists of 30 self-administered questions and two optional modules, for&#xD;
           sports or musical activities and work activities. The 30 items evaluate the degree of&#xD;
           difficulty in the performance of activities; the intensity of the symptoms of pain,&#xD;
           weakness, stiffness and numbness; the commitment of social activities; the difficulty to&#xD;
           sleep and psychological commitment by reference to the week preceding the instrument&#xD;
           application. The final score ranges from zero to one hundred, and the higher the score,&#xD;
           the higher the upper limb dysfunction (arm, shoulder or hand).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dehiscence:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dehiscence wil be assessed by inspection and palpation. It will be described &quot;presence&quot;&#xD;
           or &quot;absence&quot; of dehiscence and its location. The wound conditions will be described,&#xD;
           with observation of necrosis and infection. Signs of infection such as redness,&#xD;
           hyperthermia and secretion will be reported. The size of dehiscence will be described:&#xD;
           in relation to the amount of opening points, in case of several opened points; or in&#xD;
           centimeters (assessed per tape). Photographic record of dehiscence will be done, for&#xD;
           better analysis and comparison of evolution. A Nikon Coolpix S3000 camera will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Seroma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seroma evaluation will be performed by inspection and palpation. There will be&#xD;
      description of &quot;presence&quot; or &quot;absence&quot; of seroma, location and the number of punctures made&#xD;
      by the medical team and drained quantity, when necessary.&#xD;
