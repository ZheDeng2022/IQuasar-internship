  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized, multi-center safety and feasibility trial of Aneufix ACP-T5 to&#xD;
      treat patients with Isolated type II endoleak in the presence of a non-shrinking AAA sac&#xD;
      following an EVAR procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called Aneufix, more specifically the model ACP-T5, which is a&#xD;
      product treating the endoleak by blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the&#xD;
      'endoleak void and nidus of feeding artery and exit of existing draining arteries'.&#xD;
