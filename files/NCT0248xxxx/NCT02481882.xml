    <textblock>
      This study will provide information on cortical haemodynamics in MS patients to address the&#xD;
      discrepancies reported in previous literature, allowing further insight into the role of&#xD;
      haemodynamics in the disease. It will also instruct us as to the most effective scanning&#xD;
      protocols for future research. Developing a suitable protocol for studying perfusion&#xD;
      longitudinally may also enable identification of new therapeutic interventions to normalise&#xD;
      any perfusion abnormalities in MS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to characterise the underlying cortical haemodynamics in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We&#xD;
      will assess two techniques for measuring blood flow in the brain: arterial spin labelling&#xD;
      (ASL) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) magnetic resonance imaging in the MS patient&#xD;
      group. ASL is a non-invasive technique whilst DSC-MR requires the administration of a tracer&#xD;
      intravenously. Previous studies have shown conflicting results from these measurements.&#xD;
      Reproducibility of ASL and disease activity will also be assessed through repeated scan&#xD;
      sessions. Global perfusion in the MS patient group will be compared to a matched healthy&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to measuring blood flow using both methods, we will investigate whether&#xD;
      differences in perfusion between the MS patient group and the healthy controls can be&#xD;
      observed using ASL, and also assess the reproducibility of ASL measurements via repeated&#xD;
      scans. These repeated scanning sessions also provide a window to study disease activity in&#xD;
      the patient cohort, and patients may be invited to return for up to a total of 4 scanning&#xD;
      sessions (with only one involving the use of DSC) to better assess the usefulness of ASL in&#xD;
      tracking haemodynamic changes in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 20 MS patients and 20 healthy age-matched controls for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS Patient Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to attend two initial scanning sessions. MS Scan Session 1 will&#xD;
      involve the use of the Prohance contrast agent, taking of blood samples and an MRI scan. MS&#xD;
      Scan Session 2 will only involve the use of a non-invasive MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS Scan Session 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This session will require the administration of a gadolinium contrast agent. Prior to&#xD;
      entering the scanner, a cannula is inserted into the patient's arm (cannula A). A small blood&#xD;
      sample (5ml) will be taken from all MS patients in order to assess the haematocrit and&#xD;
      creatinine content which will be used to determine if they are eligible for gadolinium&#xD;
      administration (via use of the POCT i-Stat). This will provide a measure of eGFR which will&#xD;
      provide information on the patient's renal function. This will only be performed once per&#xD;
      patient and results will be recorded in the CRF. Provided the patient's eGFR is adequate for&#xD;
      the study, a second cannula will be inserted into the patient's other arm (cannula B). The&#xD;
      patient will enter the scanner with lines attached to both cannulae. The gadolinium bolus&#xD;
      will be administered by a clinician in the scan room between scans via cannula A*. During the&#xD;
      remainder of the visit, three subsequent blood samples will be taken (up to 5ml each), via&#xD;
      cannula B, which will be used to measure gadolinium concentration. Gadolinium administration&#xD;
      and blood work will be performed by physicians who are part of the research team with ALS&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Gadolinium contrast agents allow for the accurate quantification of blood flow from MR&#xD;
      imaging. Prohance (Gadoteridol) is a gadolinium-based fluid administered intravenously to the&#xD;
      participant. The contrast agent will be administered by physician with advanced life support&#xD;
      (ALS) training. The physician will remain present throughout the duration of the scan and at&#xD;
      all times whilst the participant is present at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre. In the&#xD;
      event of an emergency, a resuscitation kit is readily available. Also, the University's&#xD;
      internal emergency phone number is contacted to readily direct emergency services to the&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS Scan Session 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to return for MS Scan Session 2 two weeks after completing MS Scan&#xD;
      Session 1. Before each scanning session, the patient will be asked to complete and MR safety&#xD;
      questionnaire to ensure that no contraindications have arisen between scans. Explanations of&#xD;
      what to expect in the MRI scanner environment will be given prior to being asked to sign a&#xD;
      consent form. Provided there are no contraindications for the volunteer to enter the scanner,&#xD;
      the volunteer will undergo a non-invasive MRI scan lasting approximately 1 hour. No other&#xD;
      interventions are to be used. All scanning will be performed using a 7 Tesla Philips Achieva&#xD;
      scanner with multi-transit capability (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands). The&#xD;
      participants will be scanned with a 32-channel receive coil. The subjects will wear-ear&#xD;
      plugs, ear defenders and a pulse oximeter (to monitor the pulse) throughout contrast agent&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of MS Scan Sessions 1 and 2, their scans will be analysed and&#xD;
      interpreted by a member of the patient's clinical care team. If a patient presents any&#xD;
      morphological changes relating to the disease between MS Scan Sessions 1 and 2, the patient&#xD;
      will be invited back for an additional 2 scans, labelled as MS Scan Session 3 and 4. If there&#xD;
      is no presentation of additional lesions between scans, this will be the end of the patient's&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS Scan Sessions 3 and 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be identical to MS Scan Session 2 (non-invasive MRI scan only). MS Scan Session 3&#xD;
      will take place at 6 weeks and MS Scan Session 4 will take place at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthy volunteers will be asked to attend two scanning sessions (labelled as HV Scan&#xD;
      Session 1 and HV Scan Session 2 in the flow chart). Both HV Scan Session 1 and 2 will only&#xD;
      involve the use of a non-invasive MRI scan. No gadolinium contrast agent is to be given to&#xD;
      the healthy volunteers during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both HV Scan Session 1 and 2 will be identical to MS Scan Sessions 2, 3 and 4. Upon&#xD;
      completing HV Scan Session 1, the healthy volunteer will be invited back for HV Scan Session&#xD;
      2 two weeks later. After completing HV Scan Session 2, the healthy volunteer's participation&#xD;
      will be finished.&#xD;
