  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol seeks to build on the favorable results of the investigators' phase I trial&#xD;
      (Pro00015617) by extending the findings to a larger cohort of subjects.In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that 21Gy (Gray) as a single fraction can be delivered&#xD;
      preoperatively to a larger group of subjects (n100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine physician reported rates of good/excellent cosmesis at&#xD;
      baseline and 6 months, 1, 2, and 3 years post-treatment as measured by the NRG cosmesis scale&#xD;

      The study team hypothesizes that a single fraction of 21Gy can be delivered preoperatively to&#xD;
      the intact breast tumor with acceptable cosmetic outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that pre- and post-radiation breast tumor samples will provide an avenue for&#xD;
      understanding breast cancer radiation response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for single-fraction preoperative technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is proposed to build on the favorable results of the investigators' phase I trial&#xD;
      by extending the findings to a larger cohort of subjects. The preoperative approach has&#xD;
      several advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a small intact breast tumor results in significantly less uninvolved breast tissue&#xD;
           receiving high radiation doses which likely decreases toxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. more accurate targeting of the high-risk areas of subclinical disease surrounding the&#xD;
           tumor is possible,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. smaller treatment volumes are amenable to dose escalation which can further accelerate&#xD;
           treatment and improve accessibility for subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. this technical approach is widely utilized in other tumor sites and can be delivered at&#xD;
           most radiation facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the pre-operative approach provides a novel opportunity to study breast cancer radiation&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
