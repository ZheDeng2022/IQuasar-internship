    <textblock>
      This protocol seeks to utilize a novel method of tumor bed boost delivery and to better&#xD;
      understand breast cancer radiation response through the analysis of pre-and post-radiation&#xD;
      breast tumor samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study team proposes in this trial to build on the favorable results of the intraoperative&#xD;
      boost trials but using a preoperative delivery approach. The PI has demonstrated the&#xD;
      feasibility of the preoperative approach and successfully completed a Phase I dose-finding&#xD;
      partial breast trial. The preoperative approach has several advantages: 1) expensive&#xD;
      intra-operative equipment is unnecessary, 2) a small intact breast tumor results in&#xD;
      significantly less uninvolved breast tissue receiving high radiation doses which likely&#xD;
      decreases toxicity; 3) more accurate targeting of the high-risk areas of subclinical disease&#xD;
      surrounding the tumor is possible, 4) smaller treatment volumes are amenable to dose&#xD;
      escalation which can further accelerate treatment and improve accessibility for subjects, and&#xD;
      5) the pre-operative approach provides a novel opportunity to study breast cancer radiation&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy to the intact tumor is a relatively rare event in breast cancer irradiation,&#xD;
      particularly in the setting of early stage breast cancer. Tumor and normal tissue radiation&#xD;
      response remain relatively poorly understood. Markers capable of predicting radiation&#xD;
      response are rare indeed. Therefore, paired pre- and post-radiation tissue will be examined&#xD;
      for FAS gene expression and compared among the breast cancer subtypes. FAS is the name of a&#xD;
      gene ( not an acronym) that is known to play a critical role in the induction of programmed&#xD;
      cell death and is an established prognostic marker in breast cancer. Previous study team&#xD;
      findings that FAS induction appears to be breast cancer subtype-specific has not been&#xD;
      previously observed and provides a possible explanation for the differential rates of tumor&#xD;
      response observed clinically in distinct breast tumor subtypes. The study team's preclinical&#xD;
      work with FAS suggests a potential role as a radiation response biomarker. The study goal is&#xD;
      to validate those findings in this large cohort of diverse breast cancer subjects. However,&#xD;
      because preoperative delivery of the boost to the intact tumor is unique, this study will&#xD;
      include a secondary cosmetic outcome that includes predefined stopping boundaries for early&#xD;
      indications of suboptimal cosmetic outcomes with this novel approach&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women with a biopsy proven diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma&#xD;
             of the breast. Biopsy tissue (either slides or block) from outside institutions will&#xD;
             be reviewed to confirm diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Breast preservation candidates (no prior breast or nodal radiotherapy, no imaging&#xD;
             evidence of multicentric disease preventing resection through a single incision, no&#xD;
             pregnant women, and no comorbid conditions precluding surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. cTis-T3 cancer judged to benefit (by treating radiation oncologist) from a tumor bed&#xD;
             boost&#xD;
