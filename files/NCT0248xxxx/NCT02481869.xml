    <textblock>
      Patients who sustain broken ankles have a very high risk of developing arthritis soon after&#xD;
      injury (within 2 years). This arthritis can cause increased pain and a decrease level of&#xD;
      function, especially if the injury occurs at an early age. During and shortly after ankle&#xD;
      injury, there is an inflammatory chemical process that takes place in the ankle that can&#xD;
      cause damage to the cartilage in the ankle joint. The investigators want to use what is&#xD;
      called Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), which is produced from a small amount of the patient's own&#xD;
      blood, to inject into the injured ankle to see if they can decrease the inflammation that&#xD;
      happens after the injury and to see if they can decrease arthritis.&#xD;

      Patients who sustain broken ankles have a very high risk of developing arthritis soon after&#xD;
      their injury (within 2 years). This arthritis can cause increased pain and decreased level of&#xD;
      function, especially if the injury occurs at an early age. During and shortly after the ankle&#xD;
      injury, there is an inflammatory chemical processes that take place in the ankle that can&#xD;
      cause damage to the cartilage in the ankle joint. Currently the treatment for this injury is&#xD;
      doing surgery is a two step process. When the patient has an ankle fracture, surgeons will&#xD;
      stabilize the fracture with an external fixation device to allow ankle swelling to decrease&#xD;
      which has been shown improve outcomes within a few hours. After about 10 days the patient&#xD;
      will come back for their final surgery in which surgeons will open the ankle joint and make&#xD;
      sure that the joint lines up and fix it with plates and screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no intervention that is done with regards to the physiologic process that goes on&#xD;
      inside the ankle joint when the ankle is injured. This is what the investigators intend to&#xD;
      study. There is a very large destructive process that may contribute with the early&#xD;
      development to arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to see the effect of this inflammatory response with the&#xD;
      addition of platelet rich plasma (PRP) which is produced from a small vial of the patient's&#xD;
      own blood. PRP has been used safely in patients with osteoarthritis and has been shown to&#xD;
      slow the progression and improve pain scores. PRP is made by spinning the patient's blood in&#xD;
      a centrifuge which separates the blood cells from each other. The bloods cells that are&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory in nature are taken and placed in another syringe. This is a blinded&#xD;
      randomized control study. There will be two groups in which the patients will randomize into:&#xD;
      PRP group, or Normal Saline Group. In both groups, the investigator's plan is to withdraw&#xD;
      joint fluid from both the injured and uninjured ankle at the time of the first surgery as to&#xD;
      analyze the joint fluid from both ankles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized into the PRP group will receive PRP in the injured ankle at&#xD;
      the time of the first surgery when the external fixator is placed. Participants who are&#xD;
      randomized into the Normal Saline group will receive Normal Saline in the injured ankle at&#xD;
      the time of the first surgery when the external fixator is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 7-14 days the participant will return and have their second surgery for definitive&#xD;
      fixation. At the time of surgery, joint fluid will again be taken out of the joint for&#xD;
      analysis to see if the PRP decreased the anti-inflammatory cells decreased inflammation.&#xD;
      After the second surgery the participant will be followed up in the clinic in a regular&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks after ORIF</time_frame>
    <description>The AOFAS is a standardized evaluation of the clinical status of the ankle-hindfoot. In uses both subjective &amp; objective information. Patients report their pain (40 possible points), physicians assess alignment (10 possible points) &amp; the patient and physician work together to complete the function portion (50 possible points). Total scores range from 0-100, with healthy ankles receiving 100.&#xD;
The SF-12 assesses the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. The 2 scores are reported from the SF12 - a mental componet score (MCS) and a physical component score (PCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations (SD). The US average PCS-12 and MCS are both 50 points. The US population SD is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 point or above or below 50, corresponds to 1 SD away from the average.&#xD;
VAS measures the amount of pain a patient feels on a continuum from 0=no pain to 100=worst pain.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs): Ankle-Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS), Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>The AOFAS is a standardized evaluation of the clinical status of the ankle-hindfoot. In uses both subjective &amp; objective information. Patients report their pain (40 possible points), physicians assess alignment (10 possible points) &amp; the patient and physician work together to complete the function portion (50 possible points). Total scores range from 0-100, with healthy ankles receiving 100.&#xD;
The SF-12 assesses the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. The 2 scores are reported from the SF12 - a mental componet score (MCS) and a physical component score (PCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations (SD). The US average PCS-12 and MCS are both 50 points. The US population SD is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 point or above or below 50, corresponds to 1 SD away from the average.&#xD;
VAS measures the amount of pain a patient feels on a continuum from 0=no pain to 100=worst pain.</description>

        <description>The AOFAS is a standardized evaluation of the clinical status of the ankle-hindfoot. In uses both subjective &amp; objective information. Patients report their pain (40 possible points), physicians assess alignment (10 possible points) &amp; the patient and physician work together to complete the function portion (50 possible points). Total scores range from 0-100, with healthy ankles receiving 100.&#xD;
The SF-12 assesses the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. The 2 scores are reported from the SF12 - a mental componet score (MCS) and a physical component score (PCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations (SD). The US average PCS-12 and MCS are both 50 points. The US population SD is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 point or above or below 50, corresponds to 1 SD away from the average.&#xD;
VAS measures the amount of pain a patient feels on a continuum from 0=no pain to 100=worst pain.</description>

Patients report their pain (40 possible points), physicians assess alignment (10 possible points) &amp; the patient and physician work together to complete the function portion (50 possible points). Total scores range from 0-100, with healthy ankles receiving 100.&#xD;
The SF-12 assesses the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. The 2 scores are reported from the SF12 - a mental componet score (MCS) and a physical component score (PCS). The scores may be reported as Z-scores (difference compared to the population average, measured in standard deviations (SD). The US average PCS-12 and MCS are both 50 points. The US population SD is 10 points. So each 10 increment of 10 point or above or below 50, corresponds to 1 SD away from the average.&#xD;
