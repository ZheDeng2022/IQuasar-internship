  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with the majority receiving an&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (ET) in the adjuvant setting. ETs dramatically reduce recurrence and&#xD;
      improve survival but given the aging population and increased survivorship, there are growing&#xD;
      concerns regarding the cognitive effects of ETs since estrogen is neuroprotective. A critical&#xD;
      unanswered question is whether there are differences in cognitive decline between the two&#xD;
      classes of ETs, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs - tamoxifen) and aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), in older women at greater risk of hormone receptor&#xD;
      breast cancer and cognitive decline. Before a large multicentre observational study can be&#xD;
      undertaken the investigators are proposing a feasibility study to establish metrics on&#xD;
      participation, retention and adherence rates and parameter estimates to inform sample size&#xD;
      calculation required to detect cognitive differences between the two ET classes. A&#xD;
      convenience sample of chemotherapy-naïve patients, aged 65 and older, with early stage&#xD;
      disease, 25 on a SERM and 50 on an aromatase inhibitor, will be assessed cognitively at&#xD;
      baseline and after one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The convenience sample will consist of chemotherapy-naïve women 65 and older with a first&#xD;
      diagnosis of early stage HR+ BC, post surgical resection, who are prescribed either TAM&#xD;
      (n=25) or an AI, anastrozole or letrozole (n=50). Based on a survey of medical oncologist&#xD;
      prescribing practices at Sunnybrook, the investigators will be able to obtain sufficient&#xD;
      numbers for the convenience sample from the pool of 220 older women with BC referred annually&#xD;
      to medical and radiation oncology at the Louise Temerty Breast Cancer Clinic and the Odette&#xD;
      Cancer Centre . The investigators will recruit consecutively seen eligible patients before&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Experienced clinical trial staff will identify eligible patients from the&#xD;
      clinic list of each medical and radiation oncologist, who will then introduce the study&#xD;
      during the visit. The Research Coordinator (RC) will meet with interested patients for&#xD;
      consent to conduct the screening assessment for signs of cognitive impairment using the&#xD;
      Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), a sensitive and reliable tool. The MIS will take no more than&#xD;
      5 minutes and will be conducted in a private room at either the Louise Temerty Breast Cancer&#xD;
      Centre or the Odette Cancer Centre depending on the location of the patient's appointment.&#xD;
      The RC will then obtain consent from all those who pass the MIS to participate in the study&#xD;
      and arrange for testing. The RC will administer the assessment battery at a time convenient&#xD;
      to the patient, before radiotherapy. Drug adherence rates will be obtained using monthly&#xD;
      telephone self-reports. After 1 year, participants will undergo the same testing protocol as&#xD;
      at baseline using alternate forms where possible. The RC will document how many continue to&#xD;
      meet study criteria including changes in health status, medications, etc. The investigators&#xD;
      do not expect any major selection biases between our groups. While exclusion of women&#xD;
      co-administered chemotherapy due to its confounding effects on cognition may bias the sample&#xD;
      by including more women with co-morbidities, this potential bias should be reduced by our&#xD;
      exclusion of previous cancers, life expectancy &lt;2 years, and central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      disorders. To determine bias in attrition of women at year 1 due to cognitive impairment, the&#xD;
      investigators will contact all participants and caregivers who do not return to determine the&#xD;
      reason.&#xD;
