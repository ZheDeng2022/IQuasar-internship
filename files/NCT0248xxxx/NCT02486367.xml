  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study is that TAVR leads to platelet deposition and&#xD;
      inflammatory cell activation that can be attenuated by the potent anti-platelet and/or&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center, prospective randomized trial addresses the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether high-potency ADP receptor blockade reduces measures of platelet&#xD;
           activation in patients after TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether high-potency ADP receptor blockade mitigates the pro-thrombotic&#xD;
           inflammatory response observed after TAVR.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an important alternative to&#xD;
      surgical aortic valve replacement. While this technology represents an important advance over&#xD;
      medical therapy or surgical AVR in poor operative candidates, the absolute mortality rates&#xD;
      remain high, even in the great majority in whom an optimal hemodynamic result is achieved. In&#xD;
      the randomized literature, the majority of these patients die within two years and two thirds&#xD;
      of these deaths are due to cardiovascular (CV) events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for this limited survival are unclear from the clinical trials&#xD;
      completed to date. While persistent valve disease undoubtedly plays a role in a subset of&#xD;
      patients, particularly in patients with significant aortic regurgitation, the majority of&#xD;
      events are due to non-valve related co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that TAVR results in at least three simultaneous CV insults:&#xD;
      1) the abrupt release of severely elevated left ventricular pressure into a non-compliant&#xD;
      systemic vasculature leads to generalized endothelial cell activation, 2) the exposure of the&#xD;
      pro-thrombotic and neo-antigenic contents of a degenerated aortic valve (known to&#xD;
      histologically resemble atherosclerosis), and 3) the exposure of the replacement valve&#xD;
      (bovine valve, stainless steel frame, polyester wrap). The investigators propose that these&#xD;
      proximate events lead to platelet activation. Given the important link between thrombosis and&#xD;
      inflammation governed by platelet-derived mediators and leukocyte-platelet interactions, they&#xD;
      further hypothesize that monocyte activation is mediated, at least in part, by&#xD;
      platelet-monocyte interactions, which has been shown to induce the expansion of inflammatory&#xD;
      monocytes. Given the pro-thrombotic nature of inflammatory monocytes, they suspect a positive&#xD;
      feedback loop may exist via the interplay of these thrombotic -inflammatory mechanisms, which&#xD;
      may be abrogated via high potency ADP-receptor blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN Primary Objective of the Study This trial is designed to determine whether&#xD;
      high-potency ADP-receptor blockade with ticagrelor, compared to standard care with&#xD;
      clopidogrel, affects platelet responsiveness and the pattern of prothrombotic monocyte&#xD;
      activation seen early after TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Outcomes The primary endpoint will be platelet responsiveness: platelet&#xD;
      function will be measured one day after TAVR using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, and expressed&#xD;
      in platelet reactivity units. The key secondary outcome measure will be the percentage of&#xD;
      inflammatory monocytes, measured one day after TAVR. Inflammatory monocytes will be&#xD;
      determined by flow cytometry, and expressed as a percentage of total monocytes.&#xD;
