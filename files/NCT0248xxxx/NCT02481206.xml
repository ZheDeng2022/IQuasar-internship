    <textblock>
      A multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial with 1:1 assignment of&#xD;
      treatment and control. This study will evaluate the impact of wearable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator use on sudden cardiac death in incident hemodialysis patients. The study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 2,600 subjects. A maximum of 200 sites in the USA will be used for enrollment.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the impact of wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) use on sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be patients beginning hemodialysis (&lt;2 months from initiation) who are ≥ 50&#xD;
      years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A WCD will be used for protection against sudden cardiac death (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with 1:1&#xD;
      assignment of treatment and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 2,600 subjects. A maximum of 200 sites will be used for&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Mortality as Assessed by Intention-to-Treat Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an intention to treat analysis of SCD, with subjects analyzed by randomization assignment regardless of treatment crossovers or noncompliance. For witnessed deaths, SCD will be defined as an unexpected, non-traumatic, non-self-inflicted fatality in otherwise stable subjects who die within one hour of the onset of the terminal symptoms (dialysis noncompliance or withdrawal subjects excluded). Subjects dying more than one hour after a sudden cardiac arrest from a ventricular arrhythmia will be designated as non-sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia. For unwitnessed deaths, if the subject is found dead within 24 hours of being well the death will be designated as SCD. If more than 24 hours has passed the death will be designated as indeterminate.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Status of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) Survivors</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after SCA</time_frame>
    <description>This is an intention to treat analysis of the clinical status of participants who experience an SCA and survive at least 48 hours, as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale (numeric scale is 3 to 14, higher is better).</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator arm, determine the incidence of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias while the device was worn. Life-threatening arrhythmias are defined as ventricular tachycardia over 150 beats per minute and ventricular fibrillation (VTVF).</description>

    <description>A self completed questionnaire, the KDQOL-36 has five scales scored from 0 to 100, with higher numbers considered better (i.e., better health related quality of life). For reporting the total score, the 5 scales were averaged for each subject, creating a 0 to 100 range with higher scores considered better.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment for the study began on 30-Jun-2015 and ended 15-Feb-2017. Subjects beginning or anticipated to begin dialysis were recruited from kidney clinics and dialysis centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Since the sudden death rate is highest early after initiating hemodialysis, subjects could be enrolled from 1 month before starting dialysis to 2 months after. All subjects had to have a left ventricular ejection fraction over 50%. Subjects were shown a wearable defibrillator and were anticipated to be able to use it prior to enrollment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>This is an intention to treat analysis of SCD, with subjects analyzed by randomization assignment regardless of treatment crossovers or noncompliance. For witnessed deaths, SCD will be defined as an unexpected, non-traumatic, non-self-inflicted fatality in otherwise stable subjects who die within one hour of the onset of the terminal symptoms (dialysis noncompliance or withdrawal subjects excluded). Subjects dying more than one hour after a sudden cardiac arrest from a ventricular arrhythmia will be designated as non-sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia. For unwitnessed deaths, if the subject is found dead within 24 hours of being well the death will be designated as SCD. If more than 24 hours has passed the death will be designated as indeterminate.</description>

        <title>Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) Mortality Assessed by As-treated Analysis</title>
        <description>This is an as-treated analysis of SCD. For witnessed deaths, SCD will be defined as an unexpected, non-traumatic, non-self-inflicted fatality in otherwise stable subjects who die within one hour of the onset of the terminal symptoms (dialysis noncompliance or withdrawal subjects excluded). Subjects dying more than one hour after a sudden cardiac arrest from a ventricular arrhythmia will be designated as non-sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia. For unwitnessed deaths, if the subject is found dead within 24 hours of being well the death will be designated as SCD. If more than 24 hours has passed the death will be designated as indeterminate.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
        <population>To allow for crossovers, the analysis unit is patient months. Note: There were crossover months in the treatment group that were included in the control group for this as-treated analysis. That is, since all WCD users had months during which they did not use a WCD, they are also counted in the WCD not used group.</population>
