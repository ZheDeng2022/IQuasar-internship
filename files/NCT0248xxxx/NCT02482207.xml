  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators recently demonstrated that coronary flow reserve (CFR) significantly improved&#xD;
      after rosuvastatin therapy in hypertensive patients with average levels of serum cholesterol&#xD;
      by measuring the change in CFR after 1 year treatment with rosuvastatin in the RESERVE&#xD;
      (Rosuvastatin Effect on Coronary Flow Reserve in Hypertensive Patients) I trial. However, the&#xD;
      absence of a placebo group made it difficult to exclude the possibility that lifestyle&#xD;
      modification and antihypertensive medication also played a role in improving CFR in our&#xD;
      previous study. In a double-blind, randomized trial, investigators try to examine the&#xD;
      hypothesis that rosuvastatin added to lifestyle modification will be superior to lifestyle&#xD;
      modification alone in improving CFR in hypertensive patients .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statin therapy improves coronary flow reserve (CFR) and decreases cardiac morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypercholesterolemia via&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects of statins, including regression of atheroma, stabilization of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques. Lipid lowering with a statin also provided beneficial effects in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with average levels of serum total cholesterol in the&#xD;
      Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA). Improvements in&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and CFR may be related to the beneficial effects of statins in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients without hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously CFR could be invasively measured using a Doppler guide wire in a cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory, but recent advances in echocardiographic imaging techniques have&#xD;
      made it feasible to measure CFR noninvasively in patients without CAD, which highly&#xD;
      correlates with the CFR measured by invasive means.Accordingly, investigators recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that CFR significantly improved after rosuvastatin therapy in hypertensive&#xD;
      patients with average levels of serum cholesterol by measuring the change in CFR after 1 year&#xD;
      treatment with rosuvastatin and also found a weak correlation between the change of CFR and&#xD;
      the change of LDL cholesterol in the RESERVE (Rosuvastatin Effect on Coronary Flow Reserve in&#xD;
      Hypertensive Patients) I trial. However, this trial could not include placebo-control group&#xD;
      due to the limited study budget. Although CFR was measured by blinded, batch reading of&#xD;
      stored echocardiographic images, bias in measurement might affect the result. In our previous&#xD;
      study, study patients continued taking their antihypertensive medications and were educated&#xD;
      to follow lifestyle modification during the study period, which may have influenced the&#xD;
      change in CFR during follow-up, and the absence of a placebo group made it difficult to&#xD;
      exclude the possibility that lifestyle modification and antihypertensive medication also&#xD;
      played a role in improving CFR. Investigators hypothesize that rosuvastatin added to&#xD;
      lifestyle modification will be superior to lifestyle modification alone in improving CFR in&#xD;
      controlled hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk, and try to examine this hypothesis&#xD;
      in a double-blind, randomized comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;
