    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II multicentre open label study of bemcentinib (BGB324) as a single agent in&#xD;
      participants with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or in a&#xD;
      combination with cytarabine or decitabine in AML participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bemcentinib is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of Axl, a surface membrane protein&#xD;
      kinase receptor which is overexpressed in up to half of AML cases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a dose-escalation of bemcentinib (BGB324), a selective Axl kinase inhibitor, in&#xD;
      participants with AML and MDS, followed by a cohort expansion study of bemcentinib either as&#xD;
      a single agent in participants with AML or MDS, or in combination with cytarabine (cytosine&#xD;
      arabinoside, Ara-C) or decitabine in participants with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in Germany, Norway, Italy and the US and may enrol up to approximately 90&#xD;
      participants with AML or MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose)&#xD;
      and/or recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) of bemcentinib in participants with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory AML or MDS (Part A) followed by a cohort expansion phase in up to four&#xD;
      disease-specific cohorts (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bemcentinib will be administered orally according to a daily schedule, with the first three&#xD;
      doses of Cycle 1 serving as a 'loading' dose. Each 21-day (three week) period will constitute&#xD;
      1 cycle of treatment.&#xD;
