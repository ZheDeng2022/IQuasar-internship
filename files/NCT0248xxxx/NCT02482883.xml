  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) secondary to ruptured aneurysm represents 5 to 15% of all&#xD;
      cases of stroke. The mortality rate of SAH is 40% and the risk of serious neurological&#xD;
      sequelae among survivors is 10 to 20%.The causes of morbidity and mortality are mainly&#xD;
      related to the initial damage induced by SAH and delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI), which is&#xD;
      generally secondary to cerebral vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral vasospasm is one of the main factors of poor prognosis after SAH, as it is&#xD;
      associated with a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in the mortality rate during the 2 weeks following&#xD;
      SAH in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a significant improvement in the time to management of this disease and the fact that&#xD;
      the ruptured aneurysm is very often rapidly excluded by surgical or endovascular&#xD;
      intervention, patients who survive the initial SAH remain at risk of severe complications&#xD;
      over the following 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular stenosis of an arterial segment, called cerebral vasospasm, is observed in more than&#xD;
      70 to 95% of cases on digital subtraction angiography between the 7th and 14th days after&#xD;
      ruptured aneurysm. This angiographic vasospasm can be responsible for cerebral infarction in&#xD;
      52 to 81% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite 50 years of research, no clearly demonstrated effective treatment for vasospasm is&#xD;
      currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, randomized, comparative study, including 364 patients during the acute&#xD;
      phase following ruptured aneurysm, in whom management is very often limited to control of&#xD;
      complications, after exclusion of the aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to validate the efficacy of transcutaneous trigeminal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation for the prevention of vasospasm and limitation of the consequences of delayed&#xD;
      cerebral ischaemia after SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an innovative project, as it comprises intervention in these patients prior to the&#xD;
      development of complications and could limit the development of these complications. The&#xD;
      prevention tool, based on external facial nerve stimulation, is a totally innovative,&#xD;
      reversible and noninvasive technique. Use of nerve stimulation in this indication has never&#xD;
      been previously reported and could radically modify the intensive care management of this&#xD;
      disease over the years to come.&#xD;
