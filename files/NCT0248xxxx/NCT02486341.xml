  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basal insulin is widely used in older patients with diabetes. Human insulin Neutral Protamine&#xD;
      Hagedorn (NPH) has been proposed as basal insulin in older (75 years or older) frail and&#xD;
      dependent patients due to its shorter action. However, no study has analysed the glycaemic&#xD;
      profile in elderly subjects according to the basal insulin used, particularly in frail or&#xD;
      disabled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to measure intra-day glycaemic variability according basal insulin&#xD;
      (human NPH or long acting analogues) in older (75 and older) frail or disabled patients with&#xD;
      diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus is in large part related to ageing: in France in&#xD;
      2009, 26% of patients with diabetes were 75 older or over. Moreover, diabetes prevalence is&#xD;
      particularly high among institutionalized subjects with more than half of them treated with&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is source of activities limitations and participation restriction from the early&#xD;
      stages of the disease and is responsible for 10% of direct health costs, with higher costs&#xD;
      for older patients or insulin treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older patients with diabetes may be robust (fully independent), frail or disabled. Studies&#xD;
      with patients of 75 years or older included mainly robust subjects. Nevertheless older&#xD;
      patients with diabetes are more frequently frail and a large proportion have a different&#xD;
      metabolic profile than younger ones: they are leaner and present more often with&#xD;
      beta-cellular insufficiency. Frail or dependent patients may also have different nutritional&#xD;
      status than robust ones. Thus, this is difficult to extrapolate what is known about glycaemic&#xD;
      profile in robust and young older (65-74 years old) insulin-treated patients to frail and&#xD;
      dependent older ones (&gt;74 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous blood glucose monitoring systems give the opportunity to measure around the day&#xD;
      the blood glucose variations in real-life and particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia for these&#xD;
      patients treated with various types of basal insulins.&#xD;
