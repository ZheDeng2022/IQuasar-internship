  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well two supportive programs work for improving&#xD;
      fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with GI undergoing chemotherapy. Possible&#xD;
      mediators such as psychological stress, circadian disruption, and inflammation, will also be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the yoga skills training (YST) versus a&#xD;
      caring attention control (AC) group among adults with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy to determine preliminary efficacy for the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary&#xD;
      outcome of depressive symptoms, and possible mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian&#xD;
      disruption, inflammation) as assessed by standard measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily assessments of fatigue, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore relationships among daily and&#xD;
      standard assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the YST and AC and acceptability of new&#xD;
      methodology through semi-structured interviews in a subset of 20-40 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (YST): Patients participate in YST consisting of four 30 minute in-person yoga&#xD;
      sessions at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 that instructs skills to enhance mindfulness and promote&#xD;
      relaxation, through instruction of awareness, movement, breathing practices, and meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (AC): Patients participate in four 30 minute in-person sessions of supportive&#xD;
      conversation at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Fatigue Assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 8 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with the 7-item measure of Fatigue from the PROMIS-cancer specifically designed for use in cancer patients. These tests will be evaluated using mixed-effects (or multilevel) generalized linear modeling procedures. Score range 1 - never, 2 - rarely, 3 - sometimes, 4 - often and 5 - always. Total scores can range from 24 to 86, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circadian Disruption (Daily)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0-2 weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Circadian disruption will be assessed with actigraphy. Circadian disruption is defined as a ratio of nighttime activity to daytime activity with higher scores indicating greater circadian disruptions. Summaries of the proportion and frequency of missing daily assessments will inform the feasibility of collecting this type of data.</description>

    <measure>Circadian Disruption (Recalled)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 8 weeks, 10 weeks and 14 weeks after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Circadian disruption will be assessed with measures of activity and rest. Activity will be measured using the 3-item Godin's leisure score index (LSI), previously used with colorectal cancer patients during chemotherapy. Rest will be assessed with the 8-item PROMIS sleep disturbance short-form. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range in score from 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of sleep disturbance.</description>

The higher the score the more depressive the symptoms. Scores on the short form range from 10 to 81.3; 10-55 is &quot;normal&quot;, 55.1-59.9 &quot;mild&quot;, 60-64.25 &quot;moderate&quot;, and over 64.26 &quot;severe&quot; depression.</description>

        <title>Regulation of Psychological Stress Assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form (Daily)</title>
        <description>Regulation of psychological stress will be assessed daily with the 3-item serenity subscale (calm, relaxed, at ease) from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert Scale, ranging from 1 = Very Slightly or Not at all to 5 = Extremely. Positive Affect Score: Scores can range from 10 - 50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect and lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

        <title>Regulation of Psychological Stress Assessed Using the Cancer Behavior Inventory</title>
        <description>Regulation of psychological stress will be determined by ratings on four of the seven factors of the Cancer Behavior Inventory, which assess self-efficacy for stress management, coping with treatment-related side-effects, accepting cancer/maintaining positive attitude, and affective regulation. Scale ranged from 1-9 (1 - 3 not at all confident; 4-6 moderately confident and 7-9 totally confident). 4 of the 7 items from the Cancer Behavior Inventory (V2.0) were used with each item's score ranges from 0-50 with higher scores indicating more confidence in the item.</description>
