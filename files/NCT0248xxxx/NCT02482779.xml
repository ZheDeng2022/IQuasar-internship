    <textblock>
      Health-related applications for smartphones represent a new and popular market for consumer&#xD;
      oriented products. These applications are generally not considered medical devices and, as&#xD;
      such, are not under the purview of the Federal Drug Administration. Some of these&#xD;
      applications purport to measure vital signs, but do not have any published data to confirm&#xD;
      accuracy of such measurements and their developers have not been willing to divulge the&#xD;
      methods by which vital sign readings are produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of unvalidated application derived data may contribute to patient harm as patients may&#xD;
      make healthcare decisions based on the results these applications provide. This study aims to&#xD;
      assess the accuracy of several such applications by comparing their findings to those of&#xD;
      clinical vital sign monitors commonly used in the perioperative setting.&#xD;

      Recruitment of volunteers take place via announcement at the Anesthesiology Departmental&#xD;
      Grand Rounds as well as by flyers posted in the UT Southwestern Department of Anesthesiology&#xD;
      &amp; Pain Management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verbal consent is obtained, each volunteer will be placed in the seated position.&#xD;
      Upper-arm non-invasive blood pressure will be measured using WelchAllyn Propaq CS via a&#xD;
      standard size cuff placed in the standard fashion between the elbow and shoulder. Pulse&#xD;
      oximetry measurement will be obtained using the WelchAllyn Propaq CS via the 4th digit of the&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smart phone applications are Instant Blood Pressure, Instant Blood Pressure Pro, Pulse&#xD;
      Oximeter and Pulse Oximeter Pro and purchased by the principal investigator and downloaded&#xD;
      via the iTunes App Store onto an iPhone 5S with iOS 7.1.2 owned by the principal&#xD;
      investigator. The application-based measurements will be performed by the volunteer according&#xD;
      to the instructions from the application to the user without explanation from the&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse (P) and peripheral&#xD;
      capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be collected from 100 volunteers. Serial measurements&#xD;
      will be taken in the following fashion: right upper extremity, smartphone application&#xD;
      measurements, left upper extremity and repeat smartphone application measurements. Thus, for&#xD;
      each volunteer each data point referenced above will be recorded six times: two times using&#xD;
      standard equipment readings (one per extremity) and four times with application-based&#xD;
      readings (two times per application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two applications to measure blood pressure (Instant Blood Pressure and Instant Blood&#xD;
      Pressure Pro) both utilize the camera and flashlight on the iPhone. In addition, the Instant&#xD;
      Blood Pressure application also utilizes the microphone and instructs the user to hold the&#xD;
      iPhone against the chest in a specific fashion to complete its measurement. Both applications&#xD;
      also request the user to input certain demographic data: Gender, Age, Height and Weight. In&#xD;
      addition, one application (Instant Blood Pressure Pro) also instructs the user to input data&#xD;
      on &quot;Body Condition&quot; and provides the following options: Poor, Below Average, Average, Above&#xD;
      Average, Good, Excellent and Athlete. The application does not provide any direction on how&#xD;
      one is to distinguish between these options. If these applications measure data based on some&#xD;
      yet unexplained function using the iPhone's onboard technology, then changing the demographic&#xD;
      data should not alter the result of the measurement. In the same way, a sphygmomanometer or&#xD;
      pulse oximeter does not need to know one's gender, height, weight or age to accurately&#xD;
      measure blood pressure or pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application based vital sign readings may change in concert with changes to demographic&#xD;
      variables even though clinical vital sign monitors remain relatively consistent. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, in a subgroup (n=20), serial measurements using both clinical vital sign and&#xD;
      application based vital sign readings will be evaluated by changing demographic variables in&#xD;
      the application based vital sign monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this subgroup the volunteer will perform serial measurements with the following changes&#xD;
      in demographic data for each application: Correct data, Age + 10, Age + 20, Age - 10, Age -&#xD;
      20, Weight - 10%, Weight - 25%, Weight + 10% and Weight +25%. Additionally, for the Instant&#xD;
      Blood Pressure Pro application additional readings will be taken changing the &quot;Body&#xD;
      Condition&quot; demographic as follows: Poor, Average, Good and Athlete. For each measurement&#xD;
      taken using the applications another will be taken using the clinical monitor, or thirteen&#xD;
      total readings per volunteer.&#xD;
