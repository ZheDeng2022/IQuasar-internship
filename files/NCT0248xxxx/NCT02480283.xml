      I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With changing legislation, the landscape of cannabis use is shifting; data demonstrates that&#xD;
      public perception of marijuana's &quot;safety&quot; has contributed to increasing usage most commonly&#xD;
      via the inhaled route (smoking). The effects of habitual cannabis smoking on lung health,&#xD;
      however, remains unclear. Spirometric data has been inconclusive regarding risk of airflow&#xD;
      limitation and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a finding that may be&#xD;
      attributable to inaccurate reporting due to its former illegal nature. It seems clear,&#xD;
      however, that these patients suffer from an increased incidence of bronchitis symptoms from&#xD;
      an uncertain pathophysiologic mechanism. Animal data from the 1990s demonstrates that&#xD;
      cannabinoid exposure (of which Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an example) results in increased&#xD;
      intra-pulmonary oxidative stress indices and immunomodulatory effects resulting in abnormal&#xD;
      macrophage function; a finding that may be related the aforementioned symptoms. However, this&#xD;
      data is likely now outmoded given the markedly increased (THC) content of today's cannabis&#xD;
      for sale (12 percent Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) compared to 3 percent in the 1990s).&#xD;
      Furthermore, most of these findings have not been validated in human subjects. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that habitually smoked cannabis increases intrapulmonary oxidative&#xD;
      stress resulting in impaired alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis, elicits an attenuated AM&#xD;
      response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and promotes AM apoptosis thereby&#xD;
      increasing risk of upper and lower airway infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis use in the United States is rising since legalization for medical and, more&#xD;
      recently, recreational purposes. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that&#xD;
      in 2012, when cannabis was legal for medical purposes in 17 states, but illegal for&#xD;
      recreational consumption nationally, cannabis use among the American population increased&#xD;
      from 11.5% to 12.1%. Over the past 2 years, an additional seven states have legalized medical&#xD;
      cannabis, and Colorado and Washington have recently legalized its sale for recreational use.&#xD;
      Since January 2014, publicly available Colorado data indicate increasing tax revenue from&#xD;
      cannabis sales (both medical and recreational), suggesting a rise in state-wide consumption&#xD;
      in a relatively short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of modern inhaled cannabis on lung health are not established. Published&#xD;
      epidemiologic data collected prior to the widespread legalization of cannabis and&#xD;
      commercialization of the cannabis industry demonstrate consistent associations between&#xD;
      &quot;regular&quot; (e.g. near daily) and &quot;heavy&quot; (e.g. for multiple years) cannabis use with poorer&#xD;
      lung health. Clinically, regular inhaled cannabis users complain of increased chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis symptoms (eg. wheeze, chronic cough) compared to non-smokers; an increased use of&#xD;
      medical services for respiratory infections due to immunosuppressive effects of the drug has&#xD;
      also been reported. However, characterization of cannabis use in these investigations varies&#xD;
      widely, ranging from 7 joint-years (1 joint per day for 1 year) 12 to 117 joint-years in&#xD;
      cohorts examined. These studies were also potentially confounded by under-reporting of&#xD;
      cannabis use due to the drug's illegal status, and concomitant use of inhaled tobacco in some&#xD;
      study populations. Moreover, the quantity of THC in modern cannabis products has been&#xD;
      increasing over the past two decades. Therefore, it remains unclear what use patterns of&#xD;
      modern inhaled cannabis are harmful to lung health, although more cannabis is being consumed&#xD;
      now than ever before, both for medical and recreational purposes. Today, due to the&#xD;
      decriminalization of cannabis sale and purchase, the accuracy of self-reported cannabis use&#xD;
      is likely much greater than in prior investigations, providing a novel opportunity to more&#xD;
      accurately establish patterns of use associated with ill effects on health. Importantly, no&#xD;
      study to date has utilized time series analyses, such as the time line follow-back (TLFB), to&#xD;
      quantitate the effects of regular cannabis consumption in association with lung health. TLFB&#xD;
      techniques are used extensively to quantitate substance use among chronic users of alcohol,&#xD;
      tobacco, and more recently, cannabis. TLFB are calendar-assisted, structured interviews that&#xD;
      cue memory to enhance accurate recall, and have been determined to be both reliable and valid&#xD;
      in quantitating current substance use in detail. TLFB interviews to characterize past 30 day&#xD;
      cannabis use have been routinely conducted in research subjects by Dr. Corsi's (co-mentor to&#xD;
      Dr. Biehl) research group since 2010, and longer term joint-year data has been collected as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled cannabis use adversely affects function of alveolar macrophages (AMs), critical&#xD;
      pulmonary innate immune effectors. AMs express cannabinoid (CB) receptors, primarily CB2, on&#xD;
      their surface, whose ligand is THC15 (a cannabinoid). AMs represent the first line of defense&#xD;
      against invading pathogens in the lower airways, and function to keep the lungs sterile.&#xD;
      Published investigations using AMs isolated via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from small&#xD;
      numbers (n&lt;20) of habitual inhaled cannabis users have reported an inappropriately diminished&#xD;
      response to S. aureus, an important lung pathogen. When AMs were exposed to S. aureus, they&#xD;
      exhibited decreased bacterial phagocytosis and killing; hampered production of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-Î±, IL-6, and granulocyte monocyte colony&#xD;
      stimulating factor; and decreased production of nitric oxide. Preclinical data has suggested&#xD;
      that AM viability and apoptosis may also be adversely influenced by THC in a dose- and&#xD;
      time-dependent manner through the CB2 receptor, further impairing the AM's ability to respond&#xD;
      to pathogens. As mentioned, cannabis use is increasing on a per capita basis, and continues&#xD;
      to be used via an inhaled route, while its THC quantity is increasing. Collectively, this&#xD;
      suggests the possibility that individuals who regularly use small doses of inhaled cannabis,&#xD;
      or have used cannabis for a shorter length of time, may still be at risk for AM dysfunction,&#xD;
      clinically manifested by increased respiratory symptoms and an increased risk for pulmonary&#xD;
      infections, particularly since pre-clinical data has consistently reported adverse effects of&#xD;
      cannabis exposure on infectious disease resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis exposure in vitro leads to oxidative stress that in turn affects pulmonary cellular&#xD;
      viability. Murine lung epithelial cells exposed to cannabis smoke extract in vitro&#xD;
      demonstrate a dose-related increase in oxidative stress, while human lung BEAS-2B cells&#xD;
      exposed to cannabis smoke extract in vitro display an increase in reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      production. Enhanced oxidative stress in each investigation was further associated with&#xD;
      evidence of cytotoxicity, characterized by cellular apoptosis and DNA damage. It seems&#xD;
      possible, then, that enhanced oxidative stress due to habitual inhaled cannabis may&#xD;
      additionally influence the viability and function of AMs in the lower airways. However, the&#xD;
      effect of inhaled cannabis on oxidative stress and its relationship to AMs has never been&#xD;
      specifically explored with primary cells from human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, our collaboration will utilize validated methods to characterize regular and&#xD;
      chronic cannabis use patterns among exclusive medical and/or recreational cannabis users, in&#xD;
      order to examine their impact on cells critical to the maintenance of lung health.&#xD;
      Information the investigators derive may be used to counsel active and contemplating cannabis&#xD;
      users, and inform medical providers and researchers.&#xD;
