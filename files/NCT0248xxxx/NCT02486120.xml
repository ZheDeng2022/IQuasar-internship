      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Suicide is one of the main causes of death for adolescents in the U.S. The most effective&#xD;
      way to decrease suicide is by training doctors to recognize the risk factors in their&#xD;
      clients. One risk factor for suicide is chronic illness. So pediatric genetic counselors come&#xD;
      across high-risk clients. But the suicide risk assessment (SRA) practices of these counselors&#xD;
      are not well known. Researchers want to study learn more about this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To describe the practices, attitudes, and beliefs of genetic counselors about SRA of&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Genetic counselors who see adolescents ages 10 21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study will be open to a listserv for genetic counselors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take a survey on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will be online on a secure website.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give data about themselves. This can include age, gender, job, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will be about 60 questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will take around 20 25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questions are about participants experiences, practices, attitudes, and beliefs&#xD;
           about SRA.&#xD;

      This study proposes to describe the practices, attitudes, and beliefs of genetic counselors&#xD;
      in relation to suicide risk assessment (SRA) of their adolescent clients. Suicide is a major&#xD;
      public health issue and one of the leading causes of death for adolescents in the U.S.&#xD;
      Analysis of suicide prevention campaigns has shown that the most effective way to decrease&#xD;
      suicide is by training physicians to recognize suicide risk factors in their patients .&#xD;
      However, pediatricians do not consistently screen youth for suicide risk during routine&#xD;
      check-ups. As chronic illness is an additional risk factor for suicide, pediatric genetic&#xD;
      counselors encounter particularly high-risk clients and are well-positioned to assess for&#xD;
      suicide risk due to the psychosocial nature of their work. However, the SRA practices of&#xD;
      genetic counselors are largely unknown. In this study, the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior&#xD;
      Change is used as a framework to describe how genetic counselors SRA self-efficacy and&#xD;
      perceptions of the pros and cons of SRA relate to stages of readiness and practices of&#xD;
      assessing clients for suicide risk. Specifically, we will be surveying genetic counselors&#xD;
      about their practices, attitudes and beliefs concerning SRA of adolescent clients. First, we&#xD;
      will determine genetic counselors frequency of SRA and their stage of readiness for routine&#xD;
      screening. Second, we will measure genetic counselors SRA self-efficacy and their perceptions&#xD;
      of the pros and cons of screening their clients. We will examine whether self-efficacy and&#xD;
      perceptions of pros and cons are predictors of genetic counselors stage of readiness for&#xD;
      routine suicide screening. Finally, we will qualitatively assess genetic counselors&#xD;
      perceptions of the usability of a validated suicide screening tool (the ASQ) in genetic&#xD;
      counseling sessions and their interest in receiving suicide screening training. We will use a&#xD;
      cross-sectional, mixed-methods design in which counselors will complete an online&#xD;
      questionnaire with quantitative components and open-ended responses. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited through the National Society of Genetic Counselors Student Research Survey&#xD;
      listserv.&#xD;
