      The investigators plan to evaluate H.E.G. (Hematoencephalography) modality in brain&#xD;
      modulation of appetite and food craving in a randomized controlled study. The H.E.G. will&#xD;
      serve as the neurofeedback modality while the functional brain imaging will enable assessment&#xD;
      and hopefully validation of changes brain activity related to food craving and self-control.&#xD;
      H.E.G. is a relatively new neurofeedback technique which similar to fMRI, is based on changes&#xD;
      in blood oxygenation level as a result of regional brain activation. The unique advantage of&#xD;
      this technology regarding our enterprise is that it inheritably samples the two brain areas&#xD;
      that are in our focus of interest: the superior orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) which Involved in&#xD;
      self-control and reward processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which processes&#xD;
      cognitive and emotional information. The investigators will combine HRV (Heart rate&#xD;
      variability) biofeedback, which is a well-established treatment form in the investigators&#xD;
      therapeutic sessions and will correlate functional neuroimaging with behavioral,&#xD;
      anthropometric and laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention name is: Measurements of blood flow changes within the brain and online&#xD;
      visual feedback to the participant by a H.E.R. (Hematoencephalography) N.I,R (Near Infra Red&#xD;
      sensor) sensor made by MindMedia, The Netherlands and a NEXUX4 Hardware, Bluetooth unit, Bio&#xD;
      Trace Plus software made by MindMedia, The Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The neurofeedback practice sessions are expected to facilitate improved control&#xD;
      of blood flow to frontal brain areas, as a marker of brain activity in these areas&#xD;

      CNS Modification of Food Craving by Neurofeedback Study Protocol Research Plan and&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators's goal is to modulate food craving and eating behavior among overweight and&#xD;
      obese participants using and interventional neurofeedback program. During the study period,&#xD;
      each participant will go through 10 neurofeedback sessions, two sessions per week, over a&#xD;
      five-week period. In addition, each participant will go through two functional MRI sessions,&#xD;
      the first session, before the neurofeedback intervention, to document baseline neurocognitive&#xD;
      response to food stimuli using a specified paradigm and the second - after completion of the&#xD;
      neurofeedback series, in order to evaluate changes in C.N.S. response to food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 6 overweight and obese participants will be participate in our pilot study and will&#xD;
      go through 2 fMRI sessions, 10 H.E.G. sessions and 3 anthropometric and metabolic evaluations&#xD;
      during one year intervention and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: In the investigators's single arm pilot study participants will go through a&#xD;
      series of neurofeedback sessions with psychological, anthropomorphic, and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation taken before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline questioners: Baseline assessment will include completion of a combined questionnaire&#xD;
      that will address a spectrum eating behavior traits, including hunger and craving, addiction,&#xD;
      impulsivity, binge eating, addiction, impulsivity, hedonic eating and externally driven&#xD;
      eating14-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropomorphic measurements: Height, weight, waist circumference and BMI will be measured&#xD;
      before intervention. Weight and calculated BMI will be documented twice more: at week 7-8,&#xD;
      soon after accomplishing the Neurofeedback sessions series and at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to call participants 6 and 12 months after study start and ask for&#xD;
      their current weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Gut peptides and hormones that are known to parallel weight changes will be&#xD;
      measured in the first and last visits including: leptin, morning cortisol, TSH, Ft4 and TT3.&#xD;
      In addition, before each fMRI session we will evaluate &quot;satiety profile&quot; by documenting&#xD;
      levels of Ghrelin, PYY, c-peptide and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional MRI sessions Experimental Paradigm Based on current knowledge regarding brain&#xD;
      areas involved in food craving, the investigators defined two ROIs (regions of interest) that&#xD;
      correspond with the introspective tasks in the H.E.G. neurofeedback sessions, one area in the&#xD;
      superior orbitofrontal cortex (sOFC.) bilaterally and the second: the anterior cingulated&#xD;
      cortex (ACC) bilaterally. Each ROI will be mapped in a block design paradigm (7:22 min) in&#xD;
      which visual food stimuli will be shown alternately with neutral visual stimuli (neutral&#xD;
      objects) and fixation (8 cycles, 54sec each including 3 blocks, 18s each of fixation, neutral&#xD;
      objects, and food stimuli).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the investigator's specific modulation goal, the suitable in-scanner satiety status is&#xD;
      &quot;half satiated&quot;. On one hand, hunger activates brain circuits involved in homeostatic&#xD;
      appetite while, on the other hand complete satiety will shut down any food craving. For that&#xD;
      purpose, participants will be asked to time their meals in order to start the session 1-2&#xD;
      hours after a medium-large meal. The investigators will document in detail the last meal&#xD;
      (timing, content, estimated caloric value) and explore correlative parameters in the hormonal&#xD;
      profile. Participants will be asked to rate their hunger, satiety, fullness and prospective&#xD;
      eating in visual analogue scales: graphic questioners that are commonly used and well&#xD;
      validated in eating behavior research field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI data acquisition: Functional scanning will be performed using a 3 Tesla whole body MRI&#xD;
      system (GE EXITE HDxt, most updated version 14 M5) equipped with 8-channel head coil. Each&#xD;
      scan will be acquired using a standard gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence. After&#xD;
      each volume is acquired, it will be automatically transferred in DICOM format from the MRI&#xD;
      scanner computer to a separate computer for in-scan processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI data processing: Online RT-fMRI processing will be made possible via a fast connection&#xD;
      between the MRI scanner and the analysis/display computer. Turbo-Brain Voyager (TBV) 2.0&#xD;
      software (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, the Netherlands) will be used to perform real-time&#xD;
      in-scan processing. TBV is capable of incrementally computing statistical maps based on&#xD;
      General Linear Model (GLM) and event-related averages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-line fMRI analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-line analysis will be conducted to all data collected. Off-line analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software 8 (SPM8. The Welcome Department of&#xD;
      Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). While MarsBar toolbox (the Marseille region of interest&#xD;
      toolbox for SPM) will be used for ROI analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurofeedback sessions Participants will undergo 10 H.E.G. sessions, twice weekly, over 5&#xD;
      weeks of intervention. They will be instructed to come to sessions in a &quot;half-satiated&quot;&#xD;
      condition in order to focus on hedonic/emotional brain circuits involved in eating behavior&#xD;
      rather than physiological circuits, based on the &quot;real&quot;, physiological hunger. Participants&#xD;
      will be given introspective tasks of mindfulness, increased sense of self-control and reduced&#xD;
      food craving and will be instructed to attempts augmentation for visual feedback. These tasks&#xD;
      correlate with modulation of our ROIs: Increase self-control - is adjusted to increase&#xD;
      activity in the superior orbitofrontal cortex (sOFC) whereas suppressing food craving is&#xD;
      adjusted to modification of neural activity in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC)&#xD;
      bilaterally. Successive feedback regarding changes in activity in this region will be given&#xD;
      analogically with a thermometer with bars above baseline level of activation colored in red&#xD;
      while those below baseline colored blue. Thermometer bars are constantly updated with a&#xD;
      minimal inherent delay.&#xD;
