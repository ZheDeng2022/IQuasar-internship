      This study aims to compare the efficacy of afatinib maintenance with pemetrexed maintenance&#xD;
      following induction therapy with platinum/ pemetrexed in patients with metastatic epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progressing after&#xD;
      first-line treatment with afatinib with respect to progression-free survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study of maintaining pan-ERBB blockade following&#xD;
      platinum-based induction chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutated, metastatic NSCLC&#xD;
      progressing after first-line treatment with afatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with afatinib will be screened while&#xD;
      receiving an induction phase which consists of at least three but not more than four cycles&#xD;
      of cisplatin/carboplatin plus pemetrexed given in 21-day cycles. Patients who do not progress&#xD;
      (i.e. complete or partial response, or stable disease - CR, PR or SD) after completion of&#xD;
      three or four cycles induction chemotherapy will then be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with either afatinib (40 mg/d, or last dose if reduced during first-line&#xD;
      treatment) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m² every 21 days, or 375 mg/m² if dose was reduced during&#xD;
      induction therapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient consent&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;
