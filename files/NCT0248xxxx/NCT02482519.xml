  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marrow adipocytes have been identified as a component of the bone marrow micro-environment.&#xD;
      Evidence exists suggesting that marrow fat plays an important physiologic role in both bone&#xD;
      mineral and energy metabolism in humans. The investigators will study the effects of acute&#xD;
      weight gain and acute nutritional deprivation on energy homeostasis and bone mineral&#xD;
      metabolism by examining marrow adiposity, peripheral fat depots and bone microarchitecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include two ten day inpatient study visits. Participants will eat a high&#xD;
      calorie diet for 10 days, followed by a 13-18 day stabilization period at home, and then&#xD;
      return for a ten day fast.&#xD;

      Marrow adipocytes have been identified as a component of the bone marrow micro-environment.&#xD;
      Evidence exists suggesting that marrow fat plays an important physiologic role in both bone&#xD;
      mineral and energy metabolism in humans. Studies have shown that nutritional status,&#xD;
      particularly body fat distribution, may be important in marrow fat. For example, anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa, a state of low body fat, is associated with elevated marrow adiposity and low bone&#xD;
      mineral density. However, it is not known whether this is in direct response to nutritional&#xD;
      deprivation or other hormonal changes that occur in anorexia nervosa. Drugs known to cause&#xD;
      adipose redistribution and associated with low bone mass, such as the thiazolidinediones and&#xD;
      glucocorticoids, have also been shown to stimulate the accumulation of marrow adipocytes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the relationship between bone marrow fat, bone mass, body fat depots and their&#xD;
      hormone regulators is a dynamic one and not yet well understood. Although studies have shown&#xD;
      an inverse relationship between high marrow adiposity and low bone mineral density (BMD), the&#xD;
      physiologic role of marrow adipose tissue has not been defined nor its relationship to&#xD;
      hormonal factors in humans. A role for marrow adipose tissue (MAT) in mineral and energy&#xD;
      metabolism is further supported by the fact that a number of pathologic states are associated&#xD;
      with increased marrow adiposity. Visceral adipose tissue, intramyocellular lipids (IMCL),&#xD;
      intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and serum triglycerides, all of which are elevated in obesity, are&#xD;
      also positive predictors of MAT, but whether acute weight gain in humans results in elevated&#xD;
      marrow adiposity is unknown. Therefore observing changes in marrow fat during acute weight&#xD;
      gain and acute nutritional deprivation will further the understanding of the role of marrow&#xD;
      adiposity in energy homeostasis. While it is known that markers of bone formation&#xD;
      dramatically decrease after only 4 days of fasting, it is not known how quickly marrow fat&#xD;
      can change in response to physiologic cues. In a rat model, increases in marrow fat were&#xD;
      observed after 14 days in space suggesting that changes in marrow adiposity may occur acutely&#xD;
      in the human model as well.&#xD;
