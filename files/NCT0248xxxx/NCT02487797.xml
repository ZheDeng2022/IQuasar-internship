  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is a medication that is often used to strengthen contractions to overcome delayed&#xD;
      labor progress. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether receiving a higher dose&#xD;
      of oxytocin lowers the chance of needing a cesarean section when compared to a lower dose of&#xD;
      oxytocin. Other aims include examining the relationship between dose of oxytocin regimen and&#xD;
      length of labor, postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine infection, umbilical cord gas, neonatal&#xD;
      Apgar score &lt;5 at 5 minutes, and need for neonatal intensive care.&#xD;

      This randomized double blind clinical trial of consenting nulliparous women in spontaneous&#xD;
      labor who require oxytocin for labor augmentation seeks to determine whether use of a high&#xD;
      dose oxytocin regimen improves obstetric outcomes when compared with a low dose oxytocin&#xD;
      regimen, in a manner that is safe for both mother and neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will include 1002 women recruited from the obstetrical service at Prentice&#xD;
      Women's Hospital. Women will be included if they are at least 36 weeks gestation, have a&#xD;
      singleton pregnancy, and have been diagnosed with spontaneous labor or spontaneous rupture of&#xD;
      membranes. Women will be exposed to oxytocin for the indication of labor augmentation at the&#xD;
      discretion of their obstetric provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be randomized with equal probability to intervention group using a fixed&#xD;
      allocation procedure. To maintain a double blind design, the Prentice Women's Hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy will carry out the randomization of oxytocin solutions according to the random&#xD;
      assignment so that neither the women or their care providers nor the investigators will know&#xD;
      the identity of the intervention assignment. The low-dose oxytocin regimen group will receive&#xD;
      a starting oxytocin regimen concentration rate of 2 milliunits/minute that can be increased&#xD;
      at increments of 2 milliunits/minute, as per the discretion of their obstetric provider. The&#xD;
      high-dose oxytocin regimen group will receive a starting oxytocin regimen concentration rate&#xD;
      of 6 milliunits/minute that can be increased at increments of 6 milliunits/minute, as per the&#xD;
      discretion of their obstetric provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the women are enrolled, randomized, and in receipt of their assigned interventions,&#xD;
      further clinical management will be left to the discretion of each woman's obstetric&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to discharge from the hospital, baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained&#xD;
      via chart review.&#xD;
