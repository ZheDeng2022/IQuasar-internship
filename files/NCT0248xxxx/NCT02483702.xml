  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusions are required for patients undergoing a craniosynostosis repair due to the&#xD;
      significant amount of blood loss. Irradiated or non-irradiated transfusions have many risks&#xD;
      involved including elevated potassium levels and graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD).&#xD;
      Irradiated blood is able to destroy the leukocytes responsible for TA-GVHD, but it adversely&#xD;
      causes elevated extracellular potassium due to hemolysis of the RBC's. When this blood is&#xD;
      transfused, it may introduce too much extracellular potassium (&gt; 6.5 meq/L) into the patient&#xD;
      causing interference with the heart's conduction system significantly increasing the risk for&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia from rapid&#xD;
      transfusions occurs much more frequently than TA-GVHD; however, both complications are&#xD;
      under-reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the risk of irradiated versus non-irradiated blood in patients&#xD;
      under the age of 6 months undergoing a craniosynostosis repair. This will be done by&#xD;
      comparing the levels of extracellular potassium pre-transfusion, during transfusion,&#xD;
      immediately after transfusion, and 30 minutes after the completion of transfusion. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the patients who receive irradiated blood will have an&#xD;
      increased extracellular potassium level compared to those who receive non-irradiated blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients between the ages of 2 to 6 months of age and undergo a sagittal synostosis repair&#xD;
      will split into two groups to participate in a prospective pilot study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the extracellular potassium levels in patients who receive irradiated&#xD;
      blood versus non-irradiated blood. Enrollment will occur over a 24 month period or until 20&#xD;
      patients are enrolled. The patient names, medical record numbers and any other identifiers&#xD;
      will be kept strictly confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive irradiated or non-irradiated blood based on their age. Patients under 4&#xD;
      months of age will receive irradiated blood products, as per hospital protocol, while&#xD;
      patients over 4 months of age will receive non-irradiated blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard surgical practice for their craniosynostosis repair and will&#xD;
      receive the blood transfusion at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and surgeon. All the&#xD;
      blood that is transfused will be analyzed prior to transfusion. The patient's extracellular&#xD;
      potassium levels will be recorded pre-transfusion, at 30 minute intervals during the&#xD;
      transfusion, and post-transfusion. The collected data will be compared to test for&#xD;
      correlation between extracellular potassium levels, the type of blood transfused, and the&#xD;
      amount of calcium that is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is minimal risk of harm associated with the study. All surgical procedures run their&#xD;
      typical risk of infection, bleeding or any other complication that could occur during or&#xD;
      after the operation. The blood transfusions may also increase patient's risk of graft versus&#xD;
      host disease, hyperkalemia, or cardiac anomalies. These cases will be documented and&#xD;
      responded to according to anesthesiologist and surgeon's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and information necessary to carry out this experiment include: patient age, sex,&#xD;
      weight, type of blood transfused (ABO and non-irradiated/irradiated), vital signs, operating&#xD;
      time, amount of blood lost, adverse events, and length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who decline participation in the study will have no change in their anesthetic or&#xD;
      post-operative care.&#xD;
