      The study purpose is to determine whether two different hemodialysis blood flow rates each&#xD;
      meet national dialysis standards for urea clearance. Urea is used as the primary marker of&#xD;
      dialysis adequacy. It is an experimental study with a crossover design of minimum 38&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be selected from the accessible pool of end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease clients at the Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit. The participants will dialyse at&#xD;
      each pre-determined blood flow rate (320 mL/min and 380 mL/min) for two weeks each. Two forms&#xD;
      of urea clearance data will be collected: one value that is routinely calculated by the&#xD;
      dialysis machine and recorded on client treatment logs, and another that is calculated in a&#xD;
      lab from blood samples.&#xD;

      Design This quasi-experimental study involves the independent variable of blood flow rate&#xD;
      (Qb), measured in mL/min, and the dependent variable of dialysis clearance, measured by Kt/V&#xD;
      and URR (urea reduction ratio). Control and randomization will be manifested in a crossover&#xD;
      design, which provides the benefit of separating treatment effects from period effects&#xD;
      (Wellek &amp; Blettner, 2012). Participants will be randomly assigned - by way of selecting names&#xD;
      from an envelope - to one of two groups: A, which dialyses first at 320 mL/min; or B, at 380&#xD;
      mL/min. Each study period will consist of two weeks (6 sessions, 24 hours of dialysis) at&#xD;
      each Qb. Because urea clearance is immediate, six treatments at each Qb will reflect accurate&#xD;
      data on Kt/V and URR (Dr. John Duncan, 2014, personal communication). Although carryover&#xD;
      effects are not of concern to this study as participants routinely dialyse three times per&#xD;
      week, wherein urea levels naturally rise between routine treatments, a washout phase of one&#xD;
      week between study periods will occur, as is recommended for an effective crossover design&#xD;
      (Wellek &amp; Blettner, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target and sample population are end-stage renal disease patients dialysing with an&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit. Power analysis was&#xD;
      conducted by the Centre for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences (CHEOS). To ensure a Kt/V&#xD;
      of 1.3 and URR of 70% can be estimated with a confidence interval of 95%, a minimum sample&#xD;
      size of 34 participants is required. An additional 10% is necessary to account for attrition.&#xD;
      Because randomization will occur with study period assignment, purposive sampling will be&#xD;
      used to select participants from the accessible pool (estimated at 60 patients), until 38&#xD;
      participants are identified. The inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysing for greater than six months to ensure access patency, viability, and stability;&#xD;
      Undergoing thrice weekly, four-hour dialysis sessions for uniform dialysis duration;&#xD;
      Dialysing with an AVF, either brachio-cephalic or radio-cephalic; no central venous&#xD;
      catheters, arteriovenous grafts, or femoral AVFs due to differences in access flows and&#xD;
      vessel quality; BLOOD FLOW RATE 5 Dialysing with 15g needles as organization policy restricts&#xD;
      greater flow rates with smaller needle gauge; Dialysing with a dialysate flow (Qd) of 500&#xD;
      mL/min to reduce the possibility of clearance being attributable to differences in Qd;&#xD;
      Maintaining transonic vascular access flows of &gt;600 mL/min for the past 6 months, per KDOQI&#xD;
      (NKF, 2006) minimum flow guidelines, to ensure access patency; Not part of any other research&#xD;
      study that would interfere with dialysis treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Hourly documentation of Qb is routine protocol in the HD (hemodialysis) unit,&#xD;
      along with Kt/V at each treatment termination. URR is routinely drawn every 6 weeks, however&#xD;
      during this study it will be drawn weekly, on each third treatment. Standard URR blood draw&#xD;
      protocol will be followed: a pre- and post- dialysis blood specimen will be collected and&#xD;
      sent, along with the corresponding requisition, for analysis and calculation. A research&#xD;
      account will be opened with LifeLabs (local laboratory service) and all research requisitions&#xD;
      and blood will be coded and billed to the research study. Per unit protocol, blood draws will&#xD;
      be written in the unit diary for nurse awareness, and blood collection tubes and requisition&#xD;
      placed in participants' charts the night prior to treatment. Once weekly, the researchers&#xD;
      will photocopy the participants' treatment run logs, along with the urea lab report, and data&#xD;
      will be inputted into a CHEOS-approved excel spreadsheet. Along with Qb and Kt/V, collected&#xD;
      data will include participants' blood pressure, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration,&#xD;
      needle gauge and cannulation, and occurrence of any intradialytic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data analysis will be conducted by CHEOS.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be selected from the Vancouver Community Dialysis Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for participant selection will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Dialysing for greater than six months to ensure access patency, viability, and&#xD;
             stability;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Undergoing thrice weekly, four-hour dialysis sessions for uniform dialysis duration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Dialysing with an arteriovenous fistula, either brachio-cephalic or radio-cephalic, to&#xD;
             control variances in blood flow rates related to vascular access;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Dialysing with 15g needles as organization policy restricts greater flow rates with&#xD;
             smaller needle gauge;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Dialysing with a dialysate flow (Qd) of 500 mL/min to reduce the possibility of&#xD;
             clearance being attributable to differences in Qd;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Maintaining transonic vascular access flows of &gt;600 mL/min for the past 6 months, per&#xD;
             Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) (NKF, 2006) minimum flow&#xD;
             guidelines, to ensure access patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who speak a language other than English, Cantonese, Mandarin, or Punjabi will be&#xD;
        excluded due to funding constraints for providing translated informed consent documents.&#xD;
        Informed consent documents will only be available in the languages listed above, which are&#xD;
        the most common languages spoken/read at the dialysis unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who dialyse with a central venous catheter, arteriovenous graft, or femoral&#xD;
        arteriovenous fistula will not be invited to participate due to potential confounding from&#xD;
        known differences in access flows and vessel quality that may impact clearance values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are involved in any other research study that would interfere with their&#xD;
        dialysis treatment would be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are hemodynamically unstable (e.g.: frequent 'crashing' due to severe&#xD;
        hypotension) will be excluded due to the instability this would pose on achieving their&#xD;
        prescribed dialysis time (e.g.: if they crash, they may be taken off dialysis early) and&#xD;
        resulting data.&#xD;
