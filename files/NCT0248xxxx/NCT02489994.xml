  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 healthy adult volunteers seeking cellulite treatment, females of 25 to 60 years of&#xD;
      age, from multiple investigational sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-center study. Subjects in this study will receive a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous treatment with the ePrime device in one treatment session according to the study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatments, tissue to be treated will be injected with tumescence or local dermal&#xD;
      infiltration solution according to the protocol. Subjects will return for follow-up (FU)&#xD;
      visits at: 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months following the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
