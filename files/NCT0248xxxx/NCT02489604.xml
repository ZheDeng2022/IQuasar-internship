    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II non-comparative study. Patients with gastroenteropancreatic&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine tumour (GEP-NET) G1-G2 with progressive disease, SSR positive and FDG negative&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study and will be randomly assigned to 2 different dosages (total&#xD;
      activity of 25.9 GBq and total activity of 18.5 GBq).&#xD;

      This is a randomized phase II non-comparative study. Patients with GEP-NET G1-G2 with&#xD;
      progressive disease, somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive and FDG negative will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study and will be randomly assigned to 2 different dosages (total activity of 25.9 GBq&#xD;
      and total activity of 18.5 GBq). The two levels of dosages are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total activity of 25.9 GBq 100 mCi for 7 cycles at 6 ± 2 weeks (700 mCi)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total activity of 18.5 GBq 100 mCi for 5 cycles at 6 ± 2 weeks (500 mCi) The randomized&#xD;
           study design allows for two active treatments to be evaluated in a comparable patient&#xD;
           population. The estimates of primary objectives can be evaluated for each regimen&#xD;
           separately by a Bryant and Day design. While the sample size is not powered for&#xD;
           statistical test of a specific hypothesis for comparison between groups, this study&#xD;
           design allows the unbiased collection of activity and safety in these two regimens in&#xD;
           the same population, which will be useful for planning future studies.&#xD;
