  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1/2 study (190-201) evaluated the efficacy and safety of doses up to 300 mg/every&#xD;
      other week (qow) BMN 190 in patients with CLN2. The dose and regimen for this study (190-202)&#xD;
      are based on the results of the 190-201 study. The rationale for this phase 2 extension study&#xD;
      is to provide patients who complete the 190-201 study with the option to continue to receive&#xD;
      continued BMN 190 treatment. The 190-202 study is an open label extension protocol to assess&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient&#xD;
      in patients with CLN2 disease (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or&#xD;
      Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to reduce the&#xD;
      progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material, and improve the symptoms&#xD;
      of disease. The Phase 1/2 study (190-201) evaluated the efficacy and safety of doses up to&#xD;
      300 mg/every other week (qow) BMN 190 in patients with CLN2. The dose and regimen for this&#xD;
      study (190-202) are based on the results of the 190-201 study. The rationale for this phase 2&#xD;
      extension study is to provide patients who complete the 190-201 study with the option to&#xD;
      continue BMN 190 treatment. The 190-202 study is an open label extension protocol to assess&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a score of 0 points on the combined motor and language components of the Hamburg&#xD;
             CLN2 rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, at Baseline, or planning to become pregnant (self or&#xD;
             partner) at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has used any investigational product (other than BMN 190 in 190-201), or&#xD;
             investigational medical device, within 30 days prior to Baseline; or is required to&#xD;
             use any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation,&#xD;
             or pose a safety risk, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high&#xD;
             risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.&#xD;
