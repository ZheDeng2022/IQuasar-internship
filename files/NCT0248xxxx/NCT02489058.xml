  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational and sample collection study involving patients (alive or deceased)&#xD;
      from several clinical trials who had received the investigational drug, olaparib in other&#xD;
      research studies. There is no intervention given for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done to understand of the mechanisms involved in patients whose cancer&#xD;
      responds well and whose cancer does not respond well to investigational drug, olaparib, to&#xD;
      help better understand how olaparib works and to better identify patients who may benefit&#xD;
      from this therapy.&#xD;

      This is study will compare biomarker research with response in patients who have received&#xD;
      olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had a durable response to olaparib for at least 2 years will be approached&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to this study will then have their medical history collected and will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a questionnaire. Archival tumor tissue will also be collected for biomarker&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A waiver of consent is requested to access the medical records and archival tumor tissue of&#xD;
      patients who are deceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are still taking olaparib, they will be asked to provide blood samples for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and circulating tumor DNA, and the results of CT scans taken as part of&#xD;
      their standard of care or as a part of another research study. If participants' disease&#xD;
      worsens while still on olaparib, they will then be asked to provide a blood sample for&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics and BRCA testing (if not known). An optional tumor biopsy will also be&#xD;
      requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to be followed by telephone for survival and any new treatments&#xD;
      they are receiving.&#xD;
