  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer and the third cause of death in male.&#xD;
      Majority of patients had local disease that is cured by local treatment. Metastases are rare&#xD;
      at the time of diagnosis but may occur after failure of local treatment (SEER).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended treatment for non castrate metastatic prostate cancer (NCMPC) is castration by&#xD;
      orchiectomy or medical castration by LH-RH (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) agonists&#xD;
      alone and or combined androgen blockage with LH-RH agonists and anti androgen. Immediate&#xD;
      treatment versus deferred treatment improve specific survival for advanced prostatic cancer :&#xD;
      initial results of the Medical Research Council trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous castration is superior to intermittent one with a median survival of 49 months.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy combined with castration demonstrate a survival improvement compared to&#xD;
      castration alone for high volume disease defined by visceral involvement and or 4 or more&#xD;
      bone metastatis with almost one apendicular metastasis. For low volume disease or non&#xD;
      selected metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer, Docetaxel demonstrated no survival&#xD;
      benefit evaluated in a recent phase III trial (Sweeney C et al abs ASCO 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, most patients showing an initial response to hormonal therapy for advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer will progress to a castration-resistant phase of the disease with a much poorer&#xD;
      prognosis. Median duration to androgen deprivation is 24 to 36 months, after patients become&#xD;
      castrate resistant and docetaxel and other hormonal therapy like abiraterone and enzalutamide&#xD;
      demonstrate survival improvement in castrate resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the considerable progress made with new agents such as abiraterone acetate or MDV3100&#xD;
      in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), new therapies are critical to&#xD;
      improve castration sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to AR and identifying directed new therapies is a&#xD;
      real challenge in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is characterized by its dependence on AR and its frequent activation of the&#xD;
      Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Besides the resistance mediated by the mutation&#xD;
      in the AR, among the non-steroid alternative pathways two major pathways have been associated&#xD;
      with AR activation and CRPC, namely Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT. More specifically a genomic&#xD;
      profiling of human prostate cancer was recently reported where 42% of primary and 100% of the&#xD;
      metastatic lesions studied had upregulated PI3K signaling mostly via loss of phosphatase&#xD;
      activity such as PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) or INPP4B (inositol polyphosphate&#xD;
      4-phosphatase type II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulation of the PI3K/PTEN pathway has also been associated with resistance to&#xD;
      conventional antiandrogen therapies. Preclinical data support the potential for a reciprocal&#xD;
      negative feedback between the AR and PI3K pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of castration resistance is multifactorel including weak antagonist binding affi&#xD;
      nity to AR, up-regulation of AR co-stimulatory pathways and increased intratumoural androgen&#xD;
      levels as a result of intracrine androgen, as well as partial agonists properties of&#xD;
      antiandrogens when AR is overexpressed.&#xD;
