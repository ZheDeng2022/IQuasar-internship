  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated implantation failure (RIF) is determined when failure of implantation occurred&#xD;
      during at least three consecutive IVF attempts while at least one high-grade embryo was&#xD;
      transferred in each cycle. Several methods have been suggested to improve the implantation&#xD;
      rate in RIF patients. One of the most promising methods is local injury to the endometrium.&#xD;
      It has been reported that the rates of implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth reach&#xD;
      more than double in RIF patients with local endometrial injury than patients without it. The&#xD;
      population of this study included all infertile couples attending the Royan Institute, who&#xD;
      have at least three consecutive cycles of ART failure. Also this study is phase 3 randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. Based on the average menstrual cycle 30-28 days, endometrial and blood&#xD;
      samples were collected from two groups of patients on day 21 of luteal phase of their&#xD;
      spontaneous menstrual cycle. The intervention, but not the control group underwent prior&#xD;
      biopsy treatment in follicular phase on days 8 or/and 11 to 13 of that same cycle but in&#xD;
      these days blood sample in both groups were collected. To investigate the impact of local&#xD;
      endometrial injury in increasing the rate of pregnancy in ART - treated RIF patients, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the changes of immunological factors involved in the implantation&#xD;
      including some cytokines, growth factors ( in serum and endometrial biopsies) and the&#xD;
      expression of TLRs and HOX genes ( in endometrial biopsies) obtained from both groups.&#xD;

      This study is phase 3 randomized clinical trial that the 20 infertile women with the&#xD;
      following conditions will be studied in 2 groups. In the intervention group, Endometrial&#xD;
      sampling is obtained twice by Pipelle [one in the follicular phase (during 8-9 or 11- 13 day&#xD;
      in the beginning of buserelin cycle) and the last in the luteal phase (during 19-21 or 20-23&#xD;
      day) preceding the embryo transfer cycle preceding the embryo transfer cycle]. In the control&#xD;
      group endometrial sampling will be done only in the luteal phase of the cycle preceding the&#xD;
      embryo transfer cycle. Blood samples (5- 10 cc) are taken in the both groups twice (one on&#xD;
      the 9-8 or 11- 13 day and 19-21 or 20-23 day preceding the embryo transfer cycle).&#xD;
