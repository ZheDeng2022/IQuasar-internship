      Adherence is an active process wherein the patient acts in collaboration with the medical and&#xD;
      paramedical staff in order to improve his/her health. Adherence to medication comprises of&#xD;
      implementation and persistence and it is estimated to be around 50% in various chronic&#xD;
      illnesses, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS patients who fail to properly adhere to&#xD;
      their DMTs regimen may be at increased risk for the development of new central nervous system&#xD;
      lesions, exacerbations, increased disabilities and poorer quality of life. Plausible reasons&#xD;
      for the low adherence rates in MS mentioned in the literature include patients' attributes,&#xD;
      condition attributes and therapy related factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop a personal profile of adherence based in the&#xD;
      factors mentioned above. In the first part of the study patients will be followed up and the&#xD;
      profile My Multiple Sclerosis Perception Adherence Scoring System (MyMS_PASS) will be created&#xD;
      and tested. In the second part, patients with non-optimal rates of adherence will receive&#xD;
      tailored intervention in order to improve therapy to treatment. This work may serve as a&#xD;
      model for the study of adherence to therapy and the development of interventions in MS as&#xD;
      well as in other chronic diseases.&#xD;

      Background Adherence is an active process wherein the patient acts in collaboration with the&#xD;
      medical and paramedical staff in order to improve his/her health. Adherence to medication&#xD;
      comprises of implementation and persistence and it is estimated to be around 50% in various&#xD;
      chronic illnesses. Lack of persistence is the greater impediment to adherence in most cases&#xD;
      (drops to approximately 60% over the course of a year). Non-adherence to prescribed treatment&#xD;
      increases the frustration of both the patient and provider and can increase health care&#xD;
      costs, including unnecessary hospitalizations and illness exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the World Health Organization (WHO) on adherence to therapy reveals a dynamic and&#xD;
      complex issue associated simultaneously with several factors: social and economic factors,&#xD;
      factors related to the health care team/system, characteristics of the disease,&#xD;
      characteristics of the disease therapies and patient-related factors. In this latter category&#xD;
      of patient-related issues this review identifies the following as major barriers: lack of&#xD;
      information and skills, low motivation and self-efficacy, and lack of support for behavioral&#xD;
      changes. Other patient related issues that influence adherence include patients' attributes:&#xD;
      affective attributes (depression and anxiety) and cognitive attributes (illness- relevant&#xD;
      cognition, perceptions of disease factors, and beliefs about treatment). The review&#xD;
      emphasizes that low adherence is not a given fact and because of its vast significance, the&#xD;
      WHO targeted it as &quot;the best investment for tackling chronic conditions effectively&quot; .&#xD;
      Phillips, Leventhal &amp; Leventhal propose to add two processes that occur after behavior&#xD;
      initiation that are theorized to contribute to prediction of long term medication adherence:&#xD;
      'coherence' of patients' beliefs from experiences with treatment and habit development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurologic disease affecting young adults and can&#xD;
      lead to severe physical disability and handicap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on adherence in MS indicates adherence rates similar to those of other chronic&#xD;
      illnesses, namely hovering around 50% two years after beginning of treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      fail to properly adhere to their Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) regimen may be at&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of new central nervous system lesions, exacerbation, and&#xD;
      poorer quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plausible reasons for the low adherence rates in MS mentioned in the literature include&#xD;
      patients' attributes, condition attributes and therapy related factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients' attributes, the research indicates 2 affective attributes that can be related&#xD;
      to low adherence in MS: high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Research on cognitive&#xD;
      attributes indicates an association between illness' perception, perceptions of medication&#xD;
      and adherence in general, but to our knowledge, there's no research directly addressing this&#xD;
      issue. To our knowledge, there's no research on habit strength and adherence, although habit&#xD;
      strength was found predictive of low adherence in asthma patients and in patients with&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the condition-related factors that should be considered in MS adherence are the&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting nature of the disease (medicines sometimes prescribed when the patient&#xD;
      feels well). There is evidence that patients with few observable symptoms are typically less&#xD;
      likely to adhere to complex medication regimens. Hancock and co-researchers found that&#xD;
      patients with relatively stable disease were more likely to demonstrate poor medication&#xD;
      adherence and poor appointment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the therapy related factors, 32% of non-adherence can be explained by the injection&#xD;
      mode of delivery. Until recently the only available DMTs in MS included three preparations of&#xD;
      beta interferon and glatiramer acetate. These therapies are all injected on a regular basis&#xD;
      and associated with immediate undesirable results: painful site reactions, flu-like symptoms,&#xD;
      increased spasticity, depression, and fatigue in a significant percentage of patients. In&#xD;
      addition, the non-direct effect of the agents (unlike painkillers) might be one of the&#xD;
      explanations for poor adherence. Recently, the FDA approved new DMTs for MS that are taken&#xD;
      orally. Although it is plausible that adherence rates would improve with medications taken&#xD;
      orally as opposed to injected medicines, there is some evidence to the contrary: for&#xD;
      instance, Mohr and co-researchers found that soreness at injection site was related to&#xD;
      continuing therapy; and Cramer found that patients with diabetes tend to be more adherent to&#xD;
      injected therapy than to oral drugs. Thus, adherence factors may be different in injected and&#xD;
      oral therapy, and it is important to study adherence in these two modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose adherence to medication as a mediating variable between adjustment to MS and&#xD;
      health outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no research addressing directly the issue of&#xD;
      psychological interventions to promote adherence in MS. Significance This study will examine&#xD;
      factors known in the literature as affecting adherence to therapy in MS or in other chronic&#xD;
      illnesses in order to create a personal profile of adherence. This profile will allow the&#xD;
      development of interventions tailored to the personal needs and barriers of patients&#xD;
      regarding adherence. Improved adherence is expected to ensure treatment efficacy and may&#xD;
      prevent irreversible tissue damage, resulting in prevention of accumulating functional&#xD;
      disability. This work may serve as a model for the study of adherence to therapy and the&#xD;
      development of interventions in other chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design 400 patients treated with or planned to begin treatment with injected or oral therapy&#xD;
      approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health for the treatment of MS will be recruited in&#xD;
      &quot;Carmel&quot; MS Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will consist of 4 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personal profile - In order to better understand therapy adherence in patients with MS,&#xD;
           a personal profile of patient's attributes, condition and history of therapy, which&#xD;
           takes into account the factors related to adherence mentioned above, will be gathered&#xD;
           through questionnaires. This profile will be called MyMS_PASS (My Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
           Perception Adherence Scoring System).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation and persistence -This phase includes tracking for 9 to 12 months the&#xD;
           patients' personal profiles, habits and coherence between expectations and reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention - According to the profiles assigned in phase 1 and the rates of adherence&#xD;
           to therapy assessed in phase 2, all patients with the lowest adherence rates to therapy&#xD;
           will be offered an intervention in the modality of Motivational Interviewing (MI) with a&#xD;
           small psycho-educational component. The intervention will be tailored to the person's&#xD;
           factors found as barriers to adherence. All non-adherent patients will be enrolled in an&#xD;
           intervention, and their adherence - pre and post intervention - will be compared. The&#xD;
           intervention will be applied by a health psychologist. The content of 5-10% of the&#xD;
           meetings will be recorded in order to afford fidelity analysis (i.e., that the&#xD;
           intervention delivered was as intended).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation of the intervention- Interventions will be evaluated by determining adherence&#xD;
           to therapy and other relevant variables at baseline and at the end of the study for all&#xD;
           participants in the study. Adherence to therapy before and after the intervention in the&#xD;
           study and the control groups will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits for data collection: Visit 1: Baseline- evaluation of illness and medication&#xD;
      perception, adherence and habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: About 6 months after beginning of follow-up- evaluation of illness and medication&#xD;
      perception, adherence, habits and experiences with psychological interventions Visit 3: About&#xD;
      9 to 12 months after beginning of follow-up- Evaluation of adherence to therapy and of the&#xD;
      factors related to adherence. By the end of this period intervention will be offered to&#xD;
      patients that exhibit low adherence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: About 12 months after initiation of the intervention. Evaluation of adherence,&#xD;
      habits, depression and anxiety and quality of life, for all participants in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personal Information Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Experience Questionnaire (MS-TEQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Questions about psychological intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (ADHS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The World Health Organization Quality Of Life (WHOQOL-BREF)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Clinical questionnaire (EDSS) (for clinician)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Clinical follow-up questionnaire (EDSS) (for clinician)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Probabilistic Medication Adherence Scale (ProMAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population MS patients visiting the MS center clinic at the Carmel Medical Center,&#xD;
      treated or planned to begin treatment with injected or oral DMT for MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Patients Recruitment MS patients visiting the MS center clinic at the Carmel Medical Center&#xD;
      and responding to the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Participants will receive an explanation from Prof. Miller, or the attending neurologist&#xD;
      authorized by Prof Miller to do so, on the study aims and protocol. Patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate will sign an informed consent. Information regarding their personal and family&#xD;
      medical history, including data such as education and occupation, demographic and ethnicity&#xD;
      data will be collected via questionnaires. In addition, several questionnaires related to&#xD;
      adherence to treatment and patient's perception of treatment, disease and health will also be&#xD;
      filled by the participants during the study visits, as described in the table &quot;Proposed&#xD;
      questionnaires&quot; above. Medical staff will fill clinical questionnaires detailing patient&#xD;
      clinical status including adverse events at each study visit. Data will also be collected&#xD;
      from medical records, as necessary. Data collected through participants and physician filled&#xD;
      forms and from medical records will be stored coded in an Excel data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues Data collection and handling will be coded to assure privacy of participants&#xD;
      and will be handled by Prof. Ariel Miller and his authorized staff only. All the keys to the&#xD;
      codes will be locked. Participants' follow-up and visits to the clinic will continue as&#xD;
      usual. Patients' treatment will not be influenced by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention to promote adherence to therapy will be managed by a M.Sc. health therapist.&#xD;
      Ethical issues of the profession will be strictly kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data collected through participants and physician filled forms and from&#xD;
      medical records will be stored coded in a data base. The database is password protected. Prof&#xD;
      Ariel Miller and his authorized staffs are responsible for its update and data verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical package version 22.0&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Comparisons of continuous characteristics of adherent&#xD;
      and non-adherent patients will be performed by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test,&#xD;
      according to data distribution. Categorical variables will compared using Chi square test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test for small sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine initiation and persistence of adherence to medication among patients, McNemar test&#xD;
      or Paired T test or Wilcoxon signed ranks test will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable Logistic regression model will be used to examine the association between&#xD;
      illness perception and medication perception to adherence, controlling for background&#xD;
      variables such as depression, anxiety, time since diagnosis and medical condition. Odd Ratio&#xD;
      and 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated from the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the variables in MyMS_PASS and the rates of adherence will be&#xD;
      assessed by multiple logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable Logistic regression model will be used to assess the influence of interventions&#xD;
      on adherence, controlling for other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between the intervention and other continuous study parameters such as&#xD;
      motivation, goals, habit formation, and quality of life will be tested with T-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures tests will be employed to examine the effect of intervention on illness and&#xD;
      medication perception over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All p values will be two-sided, and statistical significance is defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
