    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the effect of an adjuvant semi-individualized Chinese medicine&#xD;
      treatment plan on type 2 diabetic patients with stages 2 to 3 chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
      macroalbuminuria. This study will collect preliminary data on treatment effect, variance,&#xD;
      recruitment rate and attrition rate for the planning of a subsequent clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label randomised parallel pilot clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification The sample size is calculated based on the target control of&#xD;
      inflation factor. In order to be 95% confident (two-sided) that the subsequent main study&#xD;
      actually achieves a power of 80% with nominal power set at 90% (i.e., a 10% power forfeit),&#xD;
      the inflation factor should be less than 1.15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At IF = 1.15, a sample size of 80 is therefore needed to have 95% one-sided confidence that&#xD;
      the main study will achieve at least the nominal power to test the hypothesis that an add-on&#xD;
      of the whole Chinese medicine treatment plan could be more effective in stabilising the&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate among diabetic nephropathy patients when compared to having just&#xD;
      routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subgroup analysis, a sample size of 25 patients per each subgroup could achieve 80%&#xD;
      one-sided confidence that the effect of stabilising glomerular filtration rate is different&#xD;
      within subgroups of similar CM clinical pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 5 subgroups, a sample size of 148 patients is needed in this pilot trial to allow a 15%&#xD;
      attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management A trial management committee (TMC) formed by Principal Investigator,&#xD;
      Co-Investigator and Research Assistant will centralise all the data of the trial. Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine Practitioner and Research Assistant will collect, clean and send the data of&#xD;
      patients to TMC on a daily basis. Questionnaires on clinical presentation and Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine diagnosis will be sent, collected and cleaned by TMC directly daily by Research&#xD;
      Assistant. If there is no response from the patients after 30 days of the last contact,&#xD;
      Research Assistant will follow up and call the patients. All data will be double entered to&#xD;
      computer and cleaned before analysis to prevent data entry errors. All transfer of data will&#xD;
      include encryption and follow the guidelines by European Directive on Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      and adhere to Data Protection Act to protect the patients' confidentiality. TMC will have&#xD;
      regular meetings monthly with experts to discuss the progress of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Missing values, if any, will be imputed with regression. Patient without a&#xD;
      postrandomisation assessment for a particular efficacy endpoint will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis of that endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression analyses will be used to compare the adjusted mean of estimated GFR, UACR, HbA1c,&#xD;
      FBG, FGF-23, MCP-1 and Cystatin C at week 48 between 1) the combination of all intervention&#xD;
      groups and combination of all control groups, 2) individual treatment subgroup and its&#xD;
      matching control group , and 3) different control groups with the corresponding baseline&#xD;
      values as covariates. Change score analysis will be supplemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimise Type I error inflation, the analysis will follow a hierarchical approach in the&#xD;
      order of 1) individual treatment subgroup versus its control subgroup, 2) combination of all&#xD;
      intervention groups versus the combination of all control groups as to avoid Type I error&#xD;
      inflation. The primary outcomes are the change of GFR and UACR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis will be performed for CKD stage 2 and 3 separately. Sensitivity analyses&#xD;
      will be performed for 1) missing data imputed with regression, 2) missing data imputed with&#xD;
      last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) and 3) per protocol drop out of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse events will be analysed in a narrative manner. The percentage of all adverse&#xD;
      events and the rate of attrition due to adverse events will be compared between intervention&#xD;
      groups and control groups.&#xD;
