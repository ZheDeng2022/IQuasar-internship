  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will test the FamTechCare intervention that uses multidisciplinary&#xD;
      professional guidance based on in-home video monitoring to support family caregivers in&#xD;
      managing challenging behaviors of persons with dementia (PWD). Families provide the majority&#xD;
      of care for PWD at home. However the stress of caregiving is so significant that it increases&#xD;
      caregiver morbidity and mortality. Stress is magnified by disruptive behaviors in PWD that&#xD;
      frequently lead to nursing home placement. In-home video monitoring allows experts to assess&#xD;
      behaviors of PWD and to identify antecedents, recommend specific interventions. FamTechCare&#xD;
      uses new technology to link family caregivers to experts for guidance in managing disruptive&#xD;
      behaviors, supporting continued care at home while reducing the negative effects of&#xD;
      caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiver-PWD dyads (N=88) will be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Both&#xD;
      groups will record behaviors during daily care for 3 months using a home monitoring unit.&#xD;
      Notably, this new technology captures 3-5 minutes prior to the behavior, thus recording&#xD;
      behavior triggers and precursors. Caregivers record care situations they select and upload&#xD;
      videos to a secure site. The expert team will review intervention group videos weekly and&#xD;
      will provide individualized feedback for improving care to caregivers in the home. The&#xD;
      control group caregivers will receive a weekly phone call and advice from a nurse, but their&#xD;
      recorded videos will be held for review and individualized feedback provided after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are to use observation to assist caregivers in behavior management. Effects on&#xD;
      disruptive behaviors and caregiver burden and other negative outcomes will be compared.&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate ease of use and satisfaction, cost-efficiency, and factors&#xD;
      influencing likelihood of translation into practice. This is the first study to test new&#xD;
      technology for direct observation and immediate feedback to empower families to manage PWD&#xD;
      behaviors at home while reducing caregiver stress and morbidity. Technology links caregivers&#xD;
      to individualized expert guidance, acknowledging the importance and burden of their role.&#xD;
      This study addresses NIH missions and the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      goals, integrating strategies to promote adoption and use of aging services technologies in&#xD;
      interventions that will reduce negative caregiver outcomes, a growing public health problem.&#xD;

      This clinical trial will test the FamTechCare intervention that uses multidisciplinary&#xD;
      professional guidance based on in-home video monitoring to support family caregivers in&#xD;
      managing behaviors of persons with dementia (PWD). Families provide the majority of care for&#xD;
      PWD at home. However the stress of caregiving is so significant that it increases caregiver&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Stress is magnified by disruptive behaviors that frequently lead to&#xD;
      nursing home placement. In-home video monitoring allows experts to assess behaviors of PWD&#xD;
      and to identify antecedents, recommend specific interventions, and subsequently evaluate&#xD;
      caregiver outcomes. FamTechCare uses new technology to link family caregivers to experts for&#xD;
      guidance in managing disruptive behaviors, supporting continued care at home while reducing&#xD;
      the negative effects of caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregiver-PWD dyads (N=88) will be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Both&#xD;
      groups will record behaviors during daily care for 3 months using a home monitoring unit.&#xD;
      Notably, this new technology captures 3-5 minutes prior to the behavior, thus recording&#xD;
      behavior triggers and precursors. Intervention group videos will be auto-uploaded to a Health&#xD;
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) secure Internet site for weekly team&#xD;
      review with in-home feedback to caregivers in behavior management. The time and attention&#xD;
      equivalent control group will receive a weekly phone call from a nurse, but their recorded&#xD;
      videos will be held for review and feedback after 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims are to identify interventions, based on in-home observations, to assist caregivers&#xD;
      in behavior management. Between-group effects on outcomes, including PWD disruptive behaviors&#xD;
      and caregiver burden and other negative outcomes will be compared using linear mixed&#xD;
      modeling. Ease of use and satisfaction, cost-efficiency, and factors influencing likelihood&#xD;
      of translation into practice will be evaluated. This tests new technology for direct&#xD;
      observation and immediate feedback to empower families to manage PWD behaviors at home while&#xD;
      reducing caregiver stress and morbidity. Technology links caregivers to individualized expert&#xD;
      guidance, acknowledging the importance and burden of their role. This study addresses NIH&#xD;
      missions and the 2012 National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease goals, integrating&#xD;
      strategies to promote adoption and use of aging services technologies in interventions that&#xD;
      will reduce negative caregiver outcomes, a growing public health problem.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Stress - Reaction to Memory Symptoms (Bother)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver reaction to behavioral symptoms of the Person with Dementia (PWD) was measured by the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist (RMPBC). The RMPBC contains 24 items, each with two parts. Each item represents a behavior; if the behavior has been exhibited by the PWD in the past week, the caregiver reports the behavior as present. If the behavior is present, the caregiver then reports &quot;how much it bothered you?&quot; on a five-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely). If the behavior was not present, no &quot;bother&quot; score is provided, and the item is scored 0. The items are summed for a total score (range = 0-96) and for three subscales representing bother due to memory-related problems (range = 0-28), depressive symptoms (range = 0-36), and disruptive symptoms (range = 0-32). A higher score indicates a greater negative reaction to behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Stress - Desire to Instituionalize</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Desire to institutionalize was measured using a modified Desire to Institutionalize Scale. The modified Desire to Institutionalize Scale contains six items rated as dichotomous yes or no (1 = yes; 0 = no). A higher score indicates a greater desire to institutionalize (range = 0-6). Internal consistency for the Desire to Institutionalize scale is adequate (α = .69-.77) and has shown adequate construct validity through factor analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden was measured using the Modified Zarit Burden Scale that contains 12 items with a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 4 = nearly always) adapted from the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview. A higher score indicates greater caregiver burden (range = 0-48). The Modified Zarit Burden Scale has shown adequate internal consistency (α = .88) and excellent concurrent validity (r = .92- .97) with the full Zarit Burden Interview.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Health and Wellbeing - Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The CES-D contains 20 items with a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = rarely or none of the time (i.e., less than 1 day in past week) to 3 = most or all of the time (i.e., 5-7 days in past week). A higher score indicates greater depression (range = 0-60). The CES-D shows adequate internal consistency (α = .84-.90), moderate convergent validity with other depression scales (r = .44-.75), and has been shown to effectively measure change in psychoeducational interventions for dementia caregivers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Health and Wellbeing - Competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver sense of competence was measured using the Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SSCQ).37 The SSCQ contains seven negatively worded items (e.g., &quot;I feel strained in my interaction with...&quot;). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale and dichotomized to agree (i.e., agree very strongly, agree, neutral) or disagree (i.e., disagree or strongly disagree). The items where the caregiver disagreed are summed for the total score. A higher score indicates a higher sense of competence (range = 0-7). The SSCQ shows adequate internal consistency (α = .76) and concurrent validity with the original Sense of Competence Questionnaire (r = .88).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Health and Wellbeing - Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver sleep disturbance was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI contains 19 items with a 4-point Likert scale across seven domains: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep ef- ficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. A higher global score indicates worse sleep quality (range = 0-21). The PSQI shows adequate internal consistency (α = .83) and adequate validity in differentiating patients with and without sleep disorders.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Health and Wellbeing - Confidence in Managing BPSD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers reported their three priority care challenges at baseline using the Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire (Teri, McCurry, Logsdon, &amp; Gibbons, 2005). The Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire was adapted and used to identify caregiver priority care challenges for frequency, severity, and confidence at baseline and 3-months (Teri et al., 2005). Prior to group allocation, caregivers identified three priority care challenges and rated them on 5-point Likert scales: frequency of the challenge (0 = None to 4 = Daily or more often), severity of the challenge (0 = Trivial to 4 = Severe), and confidence in managing the challenge (0 = Unable to manage to 4 = Very confident). At the end of the 3-month trial, caregivers repeated their ratings of the baseline care challenges. Improvement was indicated increase in confidence from baseline to 3-months.</description>

        <title>Change in Caregiver Stress - Reaction to Memory Symptoms (Bother)</title>
        <description>Caregiver reaction to behavioral symptoms of the Person with Dementia (PWD) was measured by the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist (RMPBC). The RMPBC contains 24 items, each with two parts. Each item represents a behavior; if the behavior has been exhibited by the PWD in the past week, the caregiver reports the behavior as present. If the behavior is present, the caregiver then reports &quot;how much it bothered you?&quot; on a five-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely). If the behavior was not present, no &quot;bother&quot; score is provided, and the item is scored 0. The items are summed for a total score (range = 0-96) and for three subscales representing bother due to memory-related problems (range = 0-28), depressive symptoms (range = 0-36), and disruptive symptoms (range = 0-32). A higher score indicates a greater negative reaction to behaviors.</description>

The modified Desire to Institutionalize Scale contains six items rated as dichotomous yes or no (1 = yes; 0 = no). A higher score indicates a greater desire to institutionalize (range = 0-6). Internal consistency for the Desire to Institutionalize scale is adequate (α = .69-.77) and has shown adequate construct validity through factor analysis.</description>

The CES-D contains 20 items with a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = rarely or none of the time (i.e., less than 1 day in past week) to 3 = most or all of the time (i.e., 5-7 days in past week). A higher score indicates greater depression (range = 0-60). The CES-D shows adequate internal consistency (α = .84-.90), moderate convergent validity with other depression scales (r = .44-.75), and has been shown to effectively measure change in psychoeducational interventions for dementia caregivers.</description>

        <description>Caregiver sense of competence was measured using the Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire (SSCQ).37 The SSCQ contains seven negatively worded items (e.g., &quot;I feel strained in my interaction with...&quot;). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale and dichotomized to agree (i.e., agree very strongly, agree, neutral) or disagree (i.e., disagree or strongly disagree). The items where the caregiver disagreed are summed for the total score. A higher score indicates a higher sense of competence (range = 0-7). The SSCQ shows adequate internal consistency (α = .76) and concurrent validity with the original Sense of Competence Questionnaire (r = .88).</description>

The PSQI contains 19 items with a 4-point Likert scale across seven domains: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep ef- ficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. A higher global score indicates worse sleep quality (range = 0-21). The PSQI shows adequate internal consistency (α = .83) and adequate validity in differentiating patients with and without sleep disorders.</description>

        <description>Caregivers reported their three priority care challenges at baseline using the Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire (Teri, McCurry, Logsdon, &amp; Gibbons, 2005). The Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire was adapted and used to identify caregiver priority care challenges for frequency, severity, and confidence at baseline and 3-months (Teri et al., 2005). Prior to group allocation, caregivers identified three priority care challenges and rated them on 5-point Likert scales: frequency of the challenge (0 = None to 4 = Daily or more often), severity of the challenge (0 = Trivial to 4 = Severe), and confidence in managing the challenge (0 = Unable to manage to 4 = Very confident). At the end of the 3-month trial, caregivers repeated their ratings of the baseline care challenges. Improvement was indicated increase in confidence from baseline to 3-months.</description>

        <title>Change in Caregiver Health and Wellbeing - Confidence in Managing Disease Expectations</title>
        <description>Caregivers reported their three priority care challenges at baseline using the Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire (Teri, McCurry, Logsdon, &amp; Gibbons, 2005). The Caregiver Target Problems Questionnaire was adapted and used to identify caregiver priority care challenges for frequency, severity, and confidence at baseline and 3-months (Teri et al., 2005). Prior to group allocation, caregivers identified three priority care challenges and rated them on 5-point Likert scales: frequency of the challenge (0 = None to 4 = Daily or more often), severity of the challenge (0 = Trivial to 4 = Severe), and confidence in managing the challenge (0 = Unable to manage to 4 = Very confident). At the end of the 3-month trial, caregivers repeated their ratings of the baseline care challenges. Improvement was indicated increase in confidence from baseline to 3-months.</description>

        <description>Caregiver reaction to behavioral symptoms of the PLWD was measured by the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist (RMPBC). The RMPBC contains 24 items, each with two parts. Each item represents a behavior; if the behavior has been exhibited by the PLWD in the past week, the caregiver reports the behavior as present. If the behavior is present, the caregiver then reports &quot;how much it bothered you?&quot; on a five-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extremely). If the behavior was not present, no &quot;bother&quot; score is provided, and the item is scored 0. The items are summed for a total score (range = 0-96) and for three subscales representing bother due to memory-related problems (range = 0-28), depressive symptoms (range = 0-36), and disruptive symptoms (range = 0-32). A higher score indicates a greater negative reaction to behaviors.</description>
