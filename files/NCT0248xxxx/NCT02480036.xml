      The primary objective is to evaluate the tolerability (side effects) of the intraoperative&#xD;
      radio therapy (IORT) (e.g., wound healing, infections, bone necrosis, nerve, spinal cord&#xD;
      damage, and pathological fracture), and the secondary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of IORT (i.e., pain relief, quality of life, narcotic use, and tumor response).&#xD;

      Disease Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone metastases are the third most common site of metastatic spread, affecting 10% - 30% of&#xD;
      all cancer patients. The spine remains the most common site of bone metastases, with&#xD;
      incidence ranging from 30-70% depending on the primary tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal metastases can be a significant cause of morbidity for cancer patients: severe pain,&#xD;
      bone fracture, nerve root or spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, and limited mobility.&#xD;
      Symptomatic spinal metastases are most frequently located in the thoracic spine (70%),&#xD;
      followed by lumbar spine (20%) and cervical spine (10%). Up to 15% of all cancer patients&#xD;
      with bone metastasis will suffer compression fracture leading to loss of function and the&#xD;
      impairment of mobility, while more than 70% of the patients will experience severe&#xD;
      cancer-related pain affecting quality of life. Newer systemic agents targeting specific&#xD;
      pathway or molecule within the tumor milieu has led to a dramatic improvement in life&#xD;
      expectancy for metastatic patients. Hence, effective palliative treatment options for spinal&#xD;
      metastases is an important clinical issue in today's oncologic practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients with spinal metastases are initially managed medically with&#xD;
      combination of analgesic medication, bisphosphonates, or biologic/chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When these patients develop severe pain refractory to medical options or there is a concern&#xD;
      for neurologic dysfunction (i.e. vertebrate fracture, nerve root compression), they will be&#xD;
      referred for palliative radiotherapy or surgical treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past decade, minimally invasive interventional therapies have become more popular to&#xD;
      treat severe pain from spinal metastases, especially in patients with evidence of compression&#xD;
      fracture. Vertebroplasty involves the percutaneous injection of cement into the vertebral&#xD;
      body with the goals of pain alleviation and preventing further loss of vertebral body height.&#xD;
      Similarly, in kyphoplasty (KYPHO), an inflatable balloon is used to create a cavity for the&#xD;
      cement deposition, which restores height as well as provides pain relief. However, the&#xD;
      immediate goal for both procedures is to achieve stabilization of the vertebral body and&#xD;
      prevent further compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators assessed the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for pain&#xD;
      palliation in cancer patients. They performed ninety-seven procedures in fifty-six patients.&#xD;
      The median age was 62 years. The procedure was well-tolerated and no post-operative&#xD;
      complications or death were noted. There was a significant reduction in visual analog pain&#xD;
      score (VAS): median pre-and postoperative VAS score was 7 and 2, respectively (P=0.001,&#xD;
      student paired t-test). However, there concern for use of kyphoplasty alone in treatment of&#xD;
      spinal metastases: the rate of re-treatment and variable duration of pain palliation. The&#xD;
      rate of new compression fracture after balloon kyphoplasty in patients with malignant spinal&#xD;
      fracture can be as high as 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-surgical option to treat spinal metastases usually involves the use of external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The goals of radiation therapy are to alleviate pain, stabilize affected bone,&#xD;
      and decrease tumor cells within the treated site. Radiotherapy is very effective in pain&#xD;
      reduction, as 50-80% of all patients receiving palliative radiation will experience pain&#xD;
      reduction. Pain reduction from ionizing radiation, in theory, is due to the direct analgesic&#xD;
      effect on the nociceptors in the periosteum and electrolyte shift, which can convert&#xD;
      pain-inducing tissue acidosis to tissue alkalosis. Furthermore, stabilization of the&#xD;
      vertebral bodies can be achieved by decreasing number of tumor cells and hence, thereby&#xD;
      changing the imbalance of osteoclast and osteoblast activity. The latter effect can increase&#xD;
      re-mineralization. These effects will occur in 40-50% of patients after radiation therapy,&#xD;
      but can take 4-6 weeks after external beam radiation therapy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several issues arise with use of external beam radiation therapy. First, an optimal dose&#xD;
      fraction schedule has not been well- established. The most common prescribed dose is 30 grays&#xD;
      (Gy) in ten fractions. However, in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9714,&#xD;
      investigators found no difference between 8Gy in single fraction versus extended 30Gy in 10&#xD;
      fraction schedule in terms of pain relief and narcotic medication usage at three months.&#xD;
      Furthermore, an extended radiotherapy course can lead to patient inconvenience, longer&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increased toxicity. In the RTOG 9714 trial, patients in the 30-Gy arm&#xD;
      had more grade 2-4 toxicities than 8-Gy arm. Furthermore, there is a risk of vertebral&#xD;
      fracture for patients treated with radiation therapy for spinal metastases. Researchers&#xD;
      reported 31% of their patients with spinal cord compression treated with radiotherapy alone&#xD;
      had vertebral collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, to achieve an optimal treatment option for symptomatic cancer patients with spinal&#xD;
      metastases, the next logical step would be to combine stabilization (kyphoplasty) technique&#xD;
      with direct tumor cell destruction in order to achieve maximum and durable pain palliation,&#xD;
      prevent potential neurological dysfunction, and improve quality of life. By combining&#xD;
      kyphoplasty with intraoperative radiation, one can achieve the above mentioned goals in a&#xD;
      single outpatient procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of Kyphoplasty and Intraoperative Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a surgical procedure, the tumor bed and/or the tumor itself can be irradiated with a&#xD;
      single dose of radiation. Intraoperative radiation therapy [IORT] is the delivery of&#xD;
      radiation during a surgical intervention. The advantages of the IORT consist of the high&#xD;
      precision combined with optimal protection of the surrounding organs at risk. Hence, a higher&#xD;
      dose of radiation can be applied to the target (as compared to external beam), while&#xD;
      minimizing the adverse side effects to normal tissue. Furthermore, the single dose&#xD;
      corresponds to at least two to three time times higher biological effective dose than&#xD;
      conventional fractionated external beam radiotherapy. Another potential advantage is the&#xD;
      prevention of tumor cell proliferation during the post-operative period prior to start of&#xD;
      adjuvant radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use low energy x-rays (photons) to treat spine lesions&#xD;
      during kyphoplasty. The IORT device used will be the Intrabeam®, which is a miniature X-ray&#xD;
      generator that produces low-energy X-rays: electrons are accelerated with a voltage of 30-50&#xD;
      kilovolts (kV) and hit a gold target at the tip of the drift tube. At this point the&#xD;
      low-energy radiation is generated and emitted isotropically, similar to a point source. Due&#xD;
      to its sharp dose fall off, minimal radiation protection is required in the operating room.&#xD;
      The ultimate goal is to treat tumor cells with optimal sparing of spinal cord. (Please refer&#xD;
      to Section 2.4 for more information on Intrabeam®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at the University Medical Center in Mannheim, Germany completed a phase I trial&#xD;
      assessing the tolerability of the Kypho-IORT procedure. Investigators reported their&#xD;
      experience on performing the Kypho-IORT procedure in 18 patients (twenty-one vertebral&#xD;
      lesions) with unstable or painful spinal metastases. The researchers used Intrabeam® to&#xD;
      deliver 8Gy at 5mm distance from the spinal applicator surface using 50kV x-rays. The median&#xD;
      age was 63 years and median follow up was 4.5 months (range, 1-10 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure was well-tolerated. The median surgical time was 70 minutes (range, 53-173&#xD;
      minutes), which included radiation delivery time of approximately two minutes. Of the 21&#xD;
      vertebral lesions, 18 were treated successfully (86%). During the procedure, 78% of patients&#xD;
      were noted to have asymptomatic paravertebral para-methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) cement&#xD;
      leakage. None of the treated patients had delayed wound healing, spinal or nerve root&#xD;
      compression, paresthesia, new neurological deficit, or skin toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of pain relief, the median visual analog pain score (VAS) was 5 prior to procedure.&#xD;
      The VAS decreased to 2.5 on the first post-procedure day. At six weeks, 12 of the 18 patients&#xD;
      were available to be evaluated and reported a median VAS score of 0/10. 67% of the patients&#xD;
      required analgesic medication for pain relief prior to procedure, but decreased to just 30%&#xD;
      at six weeks. Furthermore, imaging studies were available for 15 of the 18 patients,&#xD;
      revealing 93% (14/15) patients had stable disease. Only one patient had progressive disease&#xD;
      based on radiographic evidence, but this patient did not require any additional intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRABEAM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intrabeam® machine delivers low energy 50-kV photons directly to a target volume. The&#xD;
      device generates electrons and then, accelerates them in a sealed vacuum probe (drift tube,&#xD;
      measures 10 cm long and 3.2 mm in outer diameter). This drift tube, located within the x-ray&#xD;
      spectrometer (XRS) unit, incorporates a gold target on the inside surface of its tip. When&#xD;
      the accelerated electrons collide with the gold target at the end of the drift tube, photons&#xD;
      are generated and dispersed in an isotropic dose distribution. The X-ray source itself is&#xD;
      mounted on a balanced floor stand with six degrees of freedom to provide various treatment&#xD;
      positions. The Intrabeam® system is calibrated for quality assurance prior to each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Kypho-IORT procedure, specially designed spinal applicator tip is used. This sterile&#xD;
      applicator tip consists of a plastic head, which attaches to the drift tube and is then,&#xD;
      placed inside a stainless steel tube (metallic sleeve). The applicator tip protects the drift&#xD;
      tube from bending. The applicator is made of plastic in order to minimize the absorption and&#xD;
      attenuation of the photons. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the applicator tip is guided though&#xD;
      the metallic sleeves to the placed in mid-point/mid-plane of the vertebral lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the steep dose fall-off, a high dose to the vertebral lesion can be delivered, with&#xD;
      maximum sparing of spinal cord. A radiation dose of 8 Gy at a distance of 5 mm from the&#xD;
      applicator surface will be prescribed. This correlates to an approximate dose of 91 Gy at the&#xD;
      applicator surface, 45 Gy at a distance of 1mm (from the applicator surface), 27Gy at 2mm,&#xD;
      and 8Gy at 5mm. Further dose fall off is approximated: 2.4Gy at 10mm, 0.8Gy at 15mm, and&#xD;
      0.4Gy at 20mm. Assuming minimal distance of 15mm to the spinal cord, then, the spinal cord&#xD;
      would receive less than 1Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of intraoperative radiotherapy with kyphoplasty will provide immediate&#xD;
      vertebra stabilization, durable pain relief, and sterilization of tumor cells in a single&#xD;
      outpatient procedure. To this date, this procedure has not been performed in the United&#xD;
      States. The investigators plan to conduct a phase I trial of Kypho-IORT at the Loyola&#xD;
      University Medical Center.&#xD;
