    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method which enables noninvasive&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the cortex via electrodes placed on the subject's skull. High&#xD;
      definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) allows for precise generation of electrical fields over selected&#xD;
      cortical areas using multiple electrodes. The purpose of this pilot trial is to study&#xD;
      feasibility, tolerability, and safety of HD-tDCS administered daily for a total of 20&#xD;
      sessions in healthy adults and 5-10 year old children with Down syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I: To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up&#xD;
      to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in healthy adult subjects; Part II: After&#xD;
      review of the safety data for Part I is completed and reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee and IRB, Part II will be initiated. To assess feasibility and tolerability of&#xD;
      HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in adult subjects with&#xD;
      Down Syndrome.&#xD;

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method which enables noninvasive&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the cortex via electrodes placed on the subject's skull. tDCS has&#xD;
      been shown to improve motor learning, visuomotor coordination, probabilistic classification,&#xD;
      boost memory in humans and was found to be well tolerated in children with early onset&#xD;
      schizophrenia, continuous spike-wave in sleep (CSWS), refractory epilepsy and dystonia. The&#xD;
      method has been approved for investigational purposes by the FDA. High definition tDCS&#xD;
      (HD-tDCS) allows for precise generation of electrical fields over selected cortical areas&#xD;
      using multiple electrodes. Positioning of the stimulating electrodes is determined with the&#xD;
      help of MR brain images and appropriate modeling. The purpose of this pilot trial is to study&#xD;
      feasibility, tolerability, and safety of HD-tDCS administered daily for a total of 20&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I: To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up&#xD;
      to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in healthy adult subjects; Part I will be&#xD;
      defined to be positive if 5 healthy adults are accrued within the study period (12 months)&#xD;
      and at least 4 of 5 participants have successful completion. Tolerability will be measured as&#xD;
      the proportion of subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: After review of the safety data for Part I is completed and reviewed by the Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB, Part II will be initiated. To assess feasibility and&#xD;
      tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with Down Syndrome; Part II will be defined to be positive if 5 children&#xD;
      with Down Syndrome are accrued within the study period (24 months) and at least 4 of 5&#xD;
      participants have successful completion. Tolerability will be measured as the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Part I: - Collect pilot data on safety of HD-tDCS in healthy adults,&#xD;
      where safety is defined by incidents of adverse events. Safety outcomes will include vital&#xD;
      signs, physical/neurologic exam findings, weight, electrocardiograms and&#xD;
      electroencephalograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Collect pilot data on feasibility of efficacy endpoints. These will include assessment of&#xD;
      impact of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions, on EEG&#xD;
      amplitudes and coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and higher (&gt;9Hz) frequency ranges and&#xD;
      coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: - Collect pilot data on safety of HD-tDCS in children (5-10 years) with Down&#xD;
      Syndrome, where safety is defined by incidents of adverse events. Procedures to monitor&#xD;
      subject safety include vital sign measurements, physical/neurologic examinations,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Clinically significant changes in the safety&#xD;
      measures will be documented as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect pilot data on feasibility of efficacy endpoints. These will include assessment of&#xD;
      impact of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions, on EEG&#xD;
      amplitudes and coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and higher (&gt;9Hz) frequency ranges and&#xD;
      coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges in children with Down&#xD;
      Syndrome.&#xD;
