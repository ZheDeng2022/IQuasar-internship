      This prospective outcome study is designed to assess the safety of rivaroxaban in the&#xD;
      pre-diagnosis phase of DVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International guidelines suggest the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) if the&#xD;
      diagnostic process is expected to be delayed for more than 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban is a new DOAC that in clinical trials has proven to be non-inferior to LMWH and&#xD;
      warfarin for the treatment of DVT with the added benefit of causing less major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its rapid onset of action and oral administration, rivaroxaban could be used&#xD;
      instead of LMWH in the pre-diagnosis phase pending the results of the diagnostic test.&#xD;
      However, the safety of a such proposed indication has to be proven before it can be adopted&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the safety and feasibility of pre-diagnostic treatment with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban. The primary outcome of this study &quot;safety&quot; is a composite endpoint of serious&#xD;
      bleedings encountered within 48 hours after administration of rivaroxaban.&#xD;
