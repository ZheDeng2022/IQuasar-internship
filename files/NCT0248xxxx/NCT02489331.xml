      the following matters under the condition that the investigational product is in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serious adverse event and adverse drug reaction profile&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Death or a life-threatening condition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other medically significant events&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unexpected adverse event/adverse drug reaction profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Known adverse drug reaction profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-serious adverse drug reaction profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other information related to the product safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Efficacy evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study of extended follow-up Surveillance of the safety and efficacy of the subjects who&#xD;
           received Cholib® for long-term use at least 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Study of special patient Analysis of specific patients such as elderly patients (65&#xD;

    <description>Any adverse events occurred after Cholib® dosing will be recorded. Description of adverse event(s) including type of adverse event(s), onset/end date, severity, action taken, causal relationship to the drug and investigator's view on the adverse event(s) will be captured, whether it is related to the drug or not and until follow up visit more than 1 time during the surveillance period.&#xD;
Lab abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.</description>
