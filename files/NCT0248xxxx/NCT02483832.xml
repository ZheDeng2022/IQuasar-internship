  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among&#xD;
      individuals who have never been screened, with these individuals being members of a panel who&#xD;
      participant in online studies. The primary study goals are to test effects of the matching&#xD;
      between level of comparative risk feedback for colorectal cancer (CDC), that is, how one's&#xD;
      risk compares to others, and message framing (Gain vs. loss frame) on CRC screening&#xD;
      intentions and screening as well as mediators of effects in the context of people who obtain&#xD;
      CRC risk feedback and framing messages online (i.e., Internet).&#xD;

      1. Purpose and objective: The investigators propose an online intervention to increase&#xD;
           colorectal cancer screening among men and women ages 50 to 75 who have never been&#xD;
           screened for this disease. The intervention consists of giving study participants&#xD;
           information about their estimated risk of getting colorectal cancer followed by either a&#xD;
           message emphasizing the benefits of getting screened (i.e., gain frame messages) or the&#xD;
           disadvantages of not getting screened (loss frame messages). Before conducting the&#xD;
           online intervention, the investigators will conduct a pilot study to validate the gain&#xD;
           and loss frame messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study activities and population group: The pilot study activities involve recruiting 20&#xD;
           participants, screening for eligibility and conducting informed consent over the phone,&#xD;
           randomizing them to receive either gain or loss frame messages, and instructing them to&#xD;
           complete a survey with questions covering comprehension and framing manipulation checks.&#xD;
           Data entry and survey activities will all be conducted through a secure REDCap project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main study activities involve a pilot conducted by GfK involving 40 participants, 20&#xD;
           randomized to gain and 20 to the loss conditions, completing an online baseline survey&#xD;
           and a post-intervention online survey. In addition, participants are to review: 1)&#xD;
           educational materials on colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening, 2) review&#xD;
           and respond to questions about their estimated risk of getting colorectal cancer, and 3)&#xD;
           review and respond to questions about gain- or loss-framed messages. After the pilot,&#xD;
           the full study will begin. Study activities will be the same as in the pilot, with the&#xD;
           addition of a six month post-intervention online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analyses and risk/safety issues: Analyses will include descriptive statistics and&#xD;
           use of linear and logistic regression analyses. Every effort will be made to ensure the&#xD;
           confidentiality of the information collected. During the pilot study, the only PHI&#xD;
           recorded is an email address for the purposes of conducting the online surveys, a&#xD;
           physical address so that the study team can send a copy of the consent form, and&#xD;
           information for payment. Demographic information and email address will be recorded&#xD;
           during phone screening and entered into a secure REDCap database after the participant&#xD;
           has given informed consent, and an internal record ID will be generated for the&#xD;
           participant in REDCap that will be used to identify them throughout the study. Physical&#xD;
           address and payment information will be recorded after informed consent. All paper data&#xD;
           will be destroyed as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the main study run by GfK, all data received by the key personnel from Gfk will be&#xD;
      de-identified per GfK policy. There are no foreseeable physical risks; although some&#xD;
      participants in the main study may be surprised by their risk estimate and react negatively&#xD;
      (e.g., experience some anxiety) if the estimate is very high.&#xD;
