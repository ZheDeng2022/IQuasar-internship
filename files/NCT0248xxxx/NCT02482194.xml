  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved&#xD;
      emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even&#xD;
      restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged&#xD;
      disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise&#xD;
      debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of&#xD;
      stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging&#xD;
      results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be&#xD;
      safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue.&#xD;
      Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative&#xD;
      therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance&#xD;
      and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage&#xD;
      cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via&#xD;
      lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate&#xD;
      towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional&#xD;
      recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a&#xD;
      therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these&#xD;
      conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in&#xD;
      sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and&#xD;
      possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized,&#xD;
      single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for&#xD;
      treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery&#xD;
      (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI&#xD;
      in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of&#xD;
      any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary&#xD;
      clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal&#xD;
      cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI&#xD;
      patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status&#xD;
      of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care&#xD;
      facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional&#xD;
      recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and&#xD;
      remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble&#xD;
      factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair.&#xD;
      MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be&#xD;
      easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for&#xD;
      autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients&#xD;
      suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score.&#xD;
      Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for&#xD;
      electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done.&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured&#xD;
      in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture.&#xD;
      Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs&#xD;
      will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular&#xD;
      preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two&#xD;
      independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment&#xD;
      scale and NCV/EMG.&#xD;
