      The purpose of this study is to show that the Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM) procedure is&#xD;
      an effective treatment for people with achalasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the most commonly performed definitive treatment for symptomatic esophago-gastric&#xD;
      junction outflow obstruction is a laparoscopic esophageal myotomy (LEM). In this procedure&#xD;
      the outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle fibers of the distal esophagus and proximal&#xD;
      stomach are divided, releasing the spasm and resulting in an open lumen. Although this&#xD;
      procedure is effective in relieving troubles swallowing and in improving esophageal emptying,&#xD;
      it is often accompanied by the development of GERD (as the muscle division results in&#xD;
      incompetence of the antireflux barrier, the lower esophageal sphincter). For this reason a&#xD;
      laparoscopic esophageal myotomy is most often accompanied by a fundoplication, in which part&#xD;
      of the fundus of the stomach is folded around the distal esophagus and sutured in place,&#xD;
      recreating a flap-valve mechanism. (It is best to perform this at the time of the&#xD;
      laparoscopic myotomy as reoperation in that area is difficult). The fundoplication however&#xD;
      may be imperfect, and may result in some degree of outflow obstruction itself or fail to&#xD;
      control reflux. LEM results in 80% to 90% global patient satisfaction; but 10-20% continue to&#xD;
      experience moderate dysphagia and 10-35% will have GERD by esophageal pH testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others have evaluated the possibility of surgically dividing the muscle fibers from within&#xD;
      the esophagus, using an endoscope rather than a laparoscope, in an animal model. The first&#xD;
      human experience was reported in Japan using a per-oral endoscope to (a) incise the mucosa in&#xD;
      the proximal esophagus as an entry point, (b) create a submucosal tunnel downwards, (c)&#xD;
      perform an esophageal myotomy of the distal esophageal circular muscle, and (d) close the&#xD;
      mucosal entry site with clips. The creation of the submucosal tunnel for some distance before&#xD;
      the myotomy is a safety measure, so that should the mucosal closure fail, native tissues will&#xD;
      appose and help seal any leak (rather like the Z-entry for a thoracentesis). Subsequent to&#xD;
      this initial report, multiple single-arm studies have reported that the technique is safe and&#xD;
      is associated with excellent medium-term relief of dysphagia..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the POEM technique no fundoplication is performed. By the endoscopic creation of an&#xD;
      esophageal submucosal tunnel the inner circular muscle layer could be easily visualized and&#xD;
      in contrast to conventional laparoscopic esophageal myotomy, the authors described the&#xD;
      division of only this inner circular esophageal muscle layer leaving the outer longitudinal&#xD;
      muscle layer intact. The distal esophagus is exposed in LEM, hence disrupting the attachments&#xD;
      to the diaphragm. These attachments contribute to the overall antireflux mechanism. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that by only dividing the inner circular muscle, and not disrupting the&#xD;
      contribution of the outer longitudinal muscle or the diaphragmatic attachments to the&#xD;
      antireflux mechanism, POEM may not have the same potential for reflux as a LEM. If this is&#xD;
      the case then an antireflux procedure may not be needed after the POEM procedure.&#xD;
