  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AVERT is a randomized controlled trial comparing video-oculography (VOG)-guided care to&#xD;
      standard care to assess accuracy of diagnoses and initial management decisions for emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) patients with a chief symptom of vertigo or dizziness suspected to be of&#xD;
      vestibular cause. The trial will test the hypothesis that VOG-guided rapid triage (VRT) will&#xD;
      accurately, safely, and efficiently differentiate peripheral from central vestibular&#xD;
      disorders in ED patients presenting acute vertigo or dizziness, and that doing so has the&#xD;
      potential to improve post-treatment clinical outcomes for these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AVERT is a multicenter, Phase II clinical trial comparing a novel diagnostic strategy (VRT)&#xD;
      to standard ED diagnostic care at three performance sites. The Specific Aims are to assess&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic workup costs, and estimate the short-term impact of correct&#xD;
      diagnosis in anticipation of a larger, definitive Phase III trial. Adult ED patients with a&#xD;
      chief symptom of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness, new or clearly worse in the previous 30&#xD;
      days, will undergo on-site vestibular function tests by trained research personnel using a&#xD;
      portable, quantitative VOG recording device. Research personnel will also record a focused&#xD;
      symptom history and bedside hearing tests. Eligible patients with at least one pathologic&#xD;
      vestibular eye movement finding or pathologic ataxia will be randomized to VRT or standard ED&#xD;
      care. Patients eligible for pre-randomization testing but excluded from randomization will be&#xD;
      slated for the Observational Arm of the study and will undergo limited 1 and 6 month phone&#xD;
      follow-up. The VRT arm relies on an automated algorithm to interpret VOG results, thereby&#xD;
      determining a patient-specific clinical care pathway. For safety, all VRT-arm study subjects&#xD;
      will undergo stroke protocol MRI before release. All randomized subjects will undergo&#xD;
      confirmatory testing at one week, including vestibular specialist exam and 1.5 or 3-Tesla&#xD;
      research MRI combining stroke and internal auditory canal protocols. All randomized patients&#xD;
      will also undergo 1 month and 6 month phone follow-up and medical record review to confirm&#xD;
      diagnoses. Clinical findings, ED diagnoses, diagnostic resource utilization, treatments&#xD;
      applied, and clinical events during follow-up will be recorded. A multidisciplinary, masked,&#xD;
      expert panel will adjudicate final diagnoses.&#xD;

    <measure>Six-Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non-diagnosis). We will use &quot;Index VRT Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;ED Physician Diagnosis&quot; compared to the &quot;Adjudicated Final Diagnosis&quot; based on ED index visit and 30-day follow-up clinical assessments. Also analyzed for each diagnosis category will be sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Index Visit Total Diagnostic Utilization Costs (all, VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total dollar costs VRT vs. SOC for diagnostic tests and consultations obtained during the ED index visit and hospital admission (for those admitted at the index visit). For the VRT arm, this does not include costs of protocol safety MRIs or any tests ordered off-protocol by ED physicians. It does include tests ordered on-protocol by consultants or ED physicians in the VRT 'equivocal' pathway. Total costs will be calculated by multiplying fixed cost estimates (most recent year available average Medicare reimbursement in US dollars) by utilization rates for each ED index visit service tracked.</description>

    <measure>Odds of Short-Term Serious Medical Events (SMEs) after Misdiagnosis (SOC arm only, correct vs. incorrect diagnoses)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>We will use 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible categories to determine &quot;correct&quot; vs. &quot;incorrect&quot; diagnoses. We will consider SMEs occurring between the time of ED index visit disposition and 1-week research follow-up visit. Events diagnosed at the ED index visit will not be counted. Events newly diagnosed at the 1-week follow-up or in the interval prior to follow-up will be counted, regardless of their relatedness to the ED index dizziness symptoms, with the exception of test or treatment complications. Diagnostic test or treatment complications must be related directly or indirectly to the dizziness symptoms. To avoid 'double counting' misdiagnoses as SMEs that are pursuant to misdiagnosis, 1-week stroke diagnoses not rendered at the ED index visit will not be counted as SMEs unless neurologic or vestibular symptoms/signs worsen after ED index discharge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Central-Peripheral Diagnosis Accuracy (all, VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized as central (stroke, posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, demyelinating disease, etc.) vs. non-central (peripheral vestibular, medical, psychiatric, non-diagnoses, etc.). Also analyzed for each diagnosis category will be sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke-No Stroke Diagnosis Accuracy (all, VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized as stroke vs. no stroke (posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, etc.). Also analyzed for the stroke diagnosis category will be sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preventable Six-Category Diagnosis Error (all, VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis inaccuracy (error) VRT vs. SOC using adjudicated index diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non-diagnosis). Adjudicated index diagnoses will be determined using only ED index visit data that 'would have been' available clinically (i.e., excluding safety MRI, index hospital admission data, and all follow-up data).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VRT vs. MRI Stroke-No Stroke Diagnosis Accuracy (VRT arm only, VRT vs. MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. index imaging using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized as stroke vs. no stroke (posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, etc.). The VRT arm is chosen here because all VRT arm patients will undergo MRI at the index visit (protocol, clinical, or safety), eliminating diagnostic ascertainment bias that may be present in the SOC arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Algorithm-Only VRT Six-Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, initial VRT output vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy &quot;as computed in real time,&quot; algorithm-only VRT diagnosis vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non-diagnosis). We will use &quot;Index VRT Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;ED Physician Diagnosis&quot; compared to the &quot;Adjudicated Final Diagnosis&quot; based on ED index visit and 30-day follow-up clinical assessments. This outcome measure reflects the weighted average diagnostic accuracy of the various versions of the automated algorithm as it would have been absent human double-check during the course of the trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimized Six-Category Within-Subject Accuracy (SOC arm only, optimized VRT vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy optimized VRT vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non-diagnosis). We will use &quot;Optimized VRT Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;ED Physician Diagnosis&quot; compared to the &quot;Adjudicated Final Diagnosis&quot; based on ED index visit and 30-day follow-up clinical assessments. Optimized VRT diagnoses are re-run using the final (end-of-trial) version of the VRT algorithm. Only SOC-arm subjects are used for this outcome. VRT diagnoses in the SOC arm (algorithm not run during the trial), will be assigned based on the final, optimized algorithm; for this purpose, the ED SOC diagnosis will be assigned as the VRT diagnosis for algorithm results in the VRT-E group. Also analyzed for each diagnosis category will be sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expert VOG Six-Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, expert VOG vs. SOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after last patient/last visit</time_frame>
    <description>Total diagnosis accuracy adjudicated expert VOG diagnosis vs. SOC using 30-day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non-diagnosis). We will use &quot;Index VOG Diagnosis&quot; and &quot;ED Physician Diagnosis&quot; compared to the &quot;Adjudicated Final Diagnosis&quot; based on ED index visit and 30-day follow-up clinical assessments. This outcome measure reflects the theoretical maximum diagnostic accuracy performance (i.e., expert level) of any future algorithms.</description>
