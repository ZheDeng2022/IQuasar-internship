    <textblock>
      The urine flow rate (UFR)-guided and the left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure&#xD;
      (LVEDP)-guided hydration regimens have been proposed to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney&#xD;
      injury (CI-AKI). The REnal Insufficiency Following Contrast MEDIA Administration TriaL III&#xD;
      (REMEDIAL III) trial is a randomized, multicenter, investigator-sponsored trial aiming to&#xD;
      compare these 2 hydration strategies in high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or a high risk for&#xD;
      CI-AKI (as defined according to both Mehran's score ≥11 and/or Gurm's score &gt;7) will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be divided in high (&gt;12 mm Hg) and normal LVEDP, non-invasively&#xD;
      estimated by transmitral flow velocity to annular velocity ratio (E/E' index). Patients in&#xD;
      each group will be randomly assigned to 1) LVEDP-guided hydration with normal saline&#xD;
      (LVEDP-guided group). The fluid infusion rate will be adjusted according to the LVEDP as&#xD;
      follows: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP &lt;12 mmHg; 3 mL/kg/hr for 13-18 mmHg; and 1.5 mL/kg/hr for &gt;18&#xD;
      mmHg. 2) UFR-rate guided hydration (RenalGuard group). In this group, hydration with normal&#xD;
      saline plus low-dose of furosemide is controlled by the RenalGuard system, in order to reach&#xD;
      and maintain a high (&gt;300 mL/h) UFR. In all cases iobitridol (an low-osmolar, non ionic&#xD;
      contrast agent) will be administered. The primary endpoint is the composite of CI-AKI (i.e.,&#xD;
      serum creatinine increase ≥ 25% and ≥ 0.5 mg/dl from the baseline value at 48 hours after&#xD;
      contrast media exposure) and/or acute pulmonary edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a powerful predictor of unfavorable early&#xD;
      and late outcome. Hydration represents the cornerstone in CI-AKI prevention1. However, at&#xD;
      present there is no consensus on how hydration should be carried out. The most recommended&#xD;
      hydration regimen is normal saline infusion at 1 mL/kg/h 12 hours before and 12 hours after&#xD;
      CM exposure. Limitations of this hydration regimen include 1) preclusion in urgent/emergent&#xD;
      settings, and 2) suboptimal efficacy in high- and very high risk patients. Indeed, in high&#xD;
      and very-high risk patients the rate of CI-AKI may be still high, whereas a forced hydration&#xD;
      regimen may increase the risk of pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to clarify how to carry out optimal hydration, 2 regimens have been recently&#xD;
      proposed: 1) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration and 2) urine&#xD;
      flow rate (UFR)-guided hydration. The POSEIDON trial demonstrated that the left ventricular&#xD;
      end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration is superior to the conventional hydration&#xD;
      regimen in preventing CI-AKI. In the LVEDP-guided hydration, the fluid infusion rate was&#xD;
      adjusted according to the LVEDP as follows: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP &lt;12 mmHg; 3 mL/kg/hr for&#xD;
      13-18 mmHg; and 1.5 mL/kg/hr for &gt;18 mmHg. The reported rate of pulmonary edema was 1.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another theory for CI-AKI prophylaxis suggests to induction and maintenance of a high UFR.&#xD;
      This high UFR should allow the body to rapidly eliminate contrast media, reducing contact&#xD;
      time within nephron. The RenalGuard™ System (PLC Medical Systems, Inc.) in combination with&#xD;
      limited (0.25 mg/kg) dose of furosemide induces an maintains a high UFR (&gt;300 mL/h) safely by&#xD;
      maintaining the intravascular blood volume and minimizing the risk of over or&#xD;
      under-hydration. Furthermore, the reported rate of pulmonary edema was &lt;1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to compare the LVEDP-guided hydration and the UFR-guided&#xD;
      hydration in patients at high risk for CI-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:&#xD;
      1) LVEDP-guided group, and 2) RenalGuard group. Enrolled patients will be stratified,&#xD;
      according to the estimated LVEDP value, into high LVEDP and normal LVEDP group. LVEDP will be&#xD;
      non-invasively estimated by the transmitral flow velocity to annular velocity ratio (E/E'&#xD;
      index). Estimated LVEDP pressure &gt;12 mm Hg will be considered high. Patients allocated in&#xD;
      both groups will receive intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride for at least one hour prior to&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization. In both groups the fluid rate will be adjusted according to the&#xD;
      non-invasive LVEDP estimate as follows: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP ≤12 mmHg; 3 mL/kg/hr for 13-18&#xD;
      mmHg; and 1.5 mL/kg/h for &gt;18 mmHg, as suggested in the POSEIDON trial. Invasive LVEDP&#xD;
      measurement will be also estimated in all patients by placing an angled 5 or 6-French pigtail&#xD;
      catheter in the mid-cavity of the left ventricle at the beginning of the procedure and before&#xD;
      contrast media injection in order to confirm the non-invasive estimated value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to demonstrate the superiority of the RenalGuard therapy over&#xD;
      the LVEDP-guided hydration regimen. The investigators expect a reduction in the primary&#xD;
      composite endpoint from 9% in the LVEDP-guided group to 5% in the RenalGuard group. Using a&#xD;
      two-sided Chi-square test with a significance level of 0.05, a total of at least 750&#xD;
      randomized patients (350 in each arm) afforded the study 80% power. The endpoints will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the global population and also in the subgroups stratified according to the LVEDP&#xD;
      value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine, cystatin C, blood urea nitrogen, sodium and potassium will be measured the&#xD;
      day before, 12, 24, 48 hours and 1 week after administration of the contrast agent;&#xD;
      additional measurements will be performed in all cases of deterioration of baseline renal&#xD;
      function. CI-AKI is defined as an increase of serum creatinine &gt;=0.3 mg/dl at 48 hours after&#xD;
      contrast media exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographic details, medical history, current medication, eGFR, risk score for&#xD;
      CI-AKI, and left ventricular ejection fraction are recorded at baseline. Total hydration&#xD;
      volume administered according to the prophylaxis and during the 24 and 48 hours following the&#xD;
      procedure as well as the total urine volume will be recorded. The pre-procedure sCr level is&#xD;
      considered as the sCr concentration before the initiation of any prophylaxis. End-point data&#xD;
      and adverse events are collected during the in-hospital stay and at 1-month. Six-month and&#xD;
      12-month MAE will be also collected. All adverse events are recorded in the case report form&#xD;
      and the data coordinating center will be informed by facsimile within 72 hours of any events.&#xD;
      Serious events and any other safety issues will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      and Safety Committee. All events will be adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC),&#xD;
      who is blinded to treatment assignment. At least 2 members of the CEC review clinical data&#xD;
      and relevant documentation and determine whether end points have occurred according to the&#xD;
      study definitions. In case of disagreement between reviewers, a third member of the CEC will&#xD;
      adjudicate and the data will be considered by the entire committee if 2 of the 3 reviewers do&#xD;
      not agree.&#xD;

Therefore, furosemide (0.25 mg/kg) will be administered in order to achieve the optimal urine flow rate (≥300 mL/h).
