      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate agreement between cardiac MR parameters and&#xD;
      well-established clinical and catheterization parameters of poor prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. The identification of noninvasive cardiac MR techniques to evaluate&#xD;
      myocardial disease in patients with pulmonary hypertension would be beneficial to society due&#xD;
      to the potential to replace serial invasive cardiac catheterization procedures with a&#xD;
      noninvasive imaging test.&#xD;

      1 BACKGROUND Currently the gold standard for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension is right&#xD;
      heart pressure as measured by cardiac catheterization. Thus the method for stratifying&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary hypertension in terms of risk and response to treatment is&#xD;
      suboptimal, requiring multiple invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have suggested that cardiac MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      myocardial disease and may be related to patient prognosis in both ischemic and non-ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. Patients with pulmonary hypertension demonstrate post gadolinium delayed&#xD;
      enhancement at the points of insertion of the right ventricle onto the inter-ventricular&#xD;
      septum, and the presence of this finding has been shown to be inversely correlated with right&#xD;
      ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation of extracellular volume by post-gadolinium T1 relaxation time mapping&#xD;
      (T1 mapping) and extracellular volume (ECV) mapping is used to quantify the extent of&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis, can detect fibrosis earlier than delayed enhancement imaging, and is&#xD;
      particularly useful in non-ischemic or diffuse myocardial diseases. In addition, Displacement&#xD;
      Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) is a technique that allows quantification of tissue&#xD;
      motion and myocardial strain, which can identify early myocardial dysfunction in patients&#xD;
      with preserved ejection fraction, and therefore may be useful in the evaluation of myocardial&#xD;
      function in pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilization of novel cardiac MR techniques for quantitative assessment of the extent of&#xD;
      subclinical myocardial disease in patients with pulmonary hypertension may therefore serve as&#xD;
      a non-invasive tool to inform prognosis and surrogate biomarker to evaluate effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatment strategies, with the potential to replace serial cardiac catheterization in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that utilization of novel cardiac MR techniques for quantitative assessment&#xD;
      of the extent of subclinical myocardial disease in patients with pulmonary hypertension may&#xD;
      serve as a non-invasive tool to inform prognosis and surrogate biomarker to evaluate&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment strategies, with the potential to replace serial cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with pulmonary hypertension under clinical care at the UCSF pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension clinic who are referred for right heart catheterization will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in our study. Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered&#xD;
      into the study. Each participant will undergo cardiac MR examination during a single one-hour&#xD;
      study visit.&#xD;
