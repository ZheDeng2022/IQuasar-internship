  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to characterize the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of AG-120&#xD;
      using radiolabeled drug in healthy adult male subjects to support its further development and&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, open-label, study in healthy adult males. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up&#xD;
      period. Subjects who have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at&#xD;
      screening will return to the clinical site on Day -1 for baseline assessments. Following a 10&#xD;
      hour overnight fast, subjects will receive a single 500mg dose of AG-120 suspension&#xD;
      containing a microtracer of [14C] AG-120 (~ 200 μCi) under fasted conditions. The study drug&#xD;
      will be administered as an oral suspension with approximately 240 mL of room temperature,&#xD;
      non-carbonated water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and fecal samples (and vomitus, if applicable) will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      study for pharmacokinetic (PK), mass balance, and/or clinical laboratory assessments. Safety&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout the study. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical site&#xD;
      from Day 22 to Day 29, depending on the recovery of eliminated radioactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and fecal samples will be collected each day until Day 29 (or the point of discharge if&#xD;
      earlier) for measurement of total [14C] radioactivity. Blood samples for radioanalysis and PK&#xD;
      assessment, inclusive of metabolite profiling/characterization, will be collected at pre-dose&#xD;
      and at specified intervals through Day 29. Total [14C]-radioactivity in whole blood, plasma,&#xD;
      urine, and feces (and vomitus, if applicable ) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 8 subjects will enroll in the study. One to two additional subjects who have been&#xD;
      confirmed as having poor metabolizer (PM) CYP2D6 genotype may be enrolled.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition, including the presence of clinically significant laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate&#xD;
             in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding&#xD;
             dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever&#xD;
