    <textblock>
      Patients with at least two risk factors for incisional hernia undergoing abdominal surgery&#xD;
      are eligible for inclusion. After accepting informed consent, patients are randomized into&#xD;
      either closing the abdominal wall in a regular way with fascial sutures, or closing with&#xD;
      fascial sutures together with placing a TIGR mesh as described. All patients are then&#xD;
      monitored for signs of infection, wound rupture, incisional hernias, subcutaneous seroma as&#xD;
      well as postoperative symptoms. All patients will be followed for at least 5 years. One year&#xD;
      postoperatively, a computer scan is performed to detect asymptomatic incisional hernias.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound dehiscence (WD), i.e. the rupturing of the wound along sutures, and incisional hernias&#xD;
      (IH), i.e. protrusion of the peritoneum with its contents through the incompletely healed&#xD;
      abdominal wall, are common and potentially serious complications after abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Various medical reports indicate that 10-35% of all laparotomy patients suffer from wound&#xD;
      complications, leading to extended hospital stay and severe patient morbidity. One approach&#xD;
      to mitigate this problem is to use prophylactic surgical mesh at surgery in order to&#xD;
      reinforce the suture line. Conventional surgical meshes commonly composed of polypropylene&#xD;
      have been successfully demonstrated to reduce the incidence of IH by approximately 70%.&#xD;
      However, a synthetic polypropylene mesh is a permanent implant, which may cause chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, seroma, pain and infection. Furthermore, if additional surgery is necessary,&#xD;
      the implanted polypropylene mesh complicates the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A solution to the problem of suture reinforcement is the use of a resorbable (biologically&#xD;
      degradable) non-permanent mesh that provides structural support during the healing phase,&#xD;
      while gradually being absorbed. The TIGR Matrix Surgical Mesh is a completely synthetic&#xD;
      resorbable mesh that has the desired properties for use in non-permanent wound reinforcement.&#xD;
      The patented TIGR mesh is a weave of two different types of fibers, one fast and one slowly&#xD;
      resorb able. This allows for resorbtion to take place in two distinct stages. The fast fiber&#xD;
      is a copolymer of glycotide, lactide and trimethylene carbonate, while the slow fiber is a&#xD;
      copolymer of lactide and trimethylene carbonate. The two-stage resorbtion of the matrix&#xD;
      provides for initial high strength wound support, with gradual loss of mechanical strength as&#xD;
      the fibers are degraded. The fast fibers lose mechanical strength after two weeks, with full&#xD;
      resorbtion in approximately four months; the slow fibers lose mechanical strength after 9&#xD;
      months, with full resorbtion following 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh has been evaluated in animal models and has been included in&#xD;
      clinical studies for abdominal wall repair and breast surgery. A pilot study with the use of&#xD;
      the TIGR® mesh has successfully demonstrated its safety in prevention of IH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to extend the clinical use of the TIGR mesh for prophylactic management of WD and&#xD;
      IH, we intend to carry out a multicenter randomized clinical study to further evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of the TIGR® mesh in patients with increased risk of developing&#xD;
      post-surgical wound complications. The intended study will have the impact of widespread&#xD;
      prophylactic use of the TIGR mesh in surgery worldwide, resulting in significantly decreased&#xD;
      hospital costs and improved quality of life for patients.&#xD;

      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Patients with at least two risk factors (Table 1) for incisional hernia undergoing&#xD;
      laparotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Reinforcement of the suture line with TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh in order to&#xD;
      prevent incisional hernia and wound dehiscence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Abdominal closure with PDS 2/0, with a wound to suture ratio of 1:4, without mesh&#xD;
      reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Primary outcome: postoperative incisional hernia, diagnosed at clinical controls 1,2&#xD;
      and 5 years postoperatively or at computer tomography 1 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design (according to the CONSORT checklist)&#xD;
&#xD;
      3a Trial design Single-blind randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      4b Study settings Ten surgical units participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 Interventions Patients randomized to suture line reinforcement undergo the abdominal&#xD;
      surgery as planned. After closing the aponeurosis with PDS 2/0, a 7 cm wide TIGR® Matrix&#xD;
      Surgical Mesh is applied on the aponeurosis for patients randomised to suture line&#xD;
      reinforcement. The mesh is sutured to the aponeurosis with continuous PDS 2/0, with a wound&#xD;
      to suture ratio of 1:4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6a Outcomes Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Incisional hernia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative wound dehiscence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative seroma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incisional hernia (including date confirmed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life assessed with Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire (VHPQ) 7a&#xD;
           Sample size Patients with at least two risk factors are expected to have a risk of at&#xD;
           least 10 % to develop an incisional hernia after one year if no prophylactic mesh is&#xD;
           used.7 If a prophylactic mesh reduces this risk to 1.5% one year after surgery, 90&#xD;
           patients in each group with complete data are required to achieve a chance of 80% to&#xD;
           detect a difference at the p&lt;0.05 level. In order to compensate for drop-outs and death&#xD;
           before end of follow-up, a total of 100 patients would be required in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8a Randomisation: sequence generation The random allocation sequence will be generated&#xD;
           by computer. No blocking will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9 Randomisation: allocation concealment mechanism The surgeon responsible for the&#xD;
           procedure will be informed about the allocation, but not the personnel responsible for&#xD;
           the postoperative care of the patient. The intervention, i.e. the application of the&#xD;
           mesh, will be performed during the procedure and documented separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10 Randomisation: implementation The patients will be performed about the study prior to&#xD;
           the procedure by the surgeon responsible for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11a Blinding The patient, the crew responsible for postoperative care and the surgeon&#xD;
           who does the follow-up are blinded to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12a Statistical methods The risk of postoperative wound dehiscence within thirty days&#xD;
           after surgery will be analysed with chi-two test. The risk of incisional hernia will be&#xD;
           tested with Kaplan-Meier statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12b Additional analyses Subgroup analyses will be performed for patients who undergo&#xD;
           abdominal surgery through other approaches than midline incision and based on the risk&#xD;
           factors listed in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance If the study shows a significant reduction in the incidence of WD and IH without&#xD;
      a substantial increase in the risk of would complications, it may have a very great impact on&#xD;
      how wound closure is practiced. Applying an onlay mesh requires little efforts in terms of&#xD;
      technical skills and time and the mesh can be produced at very low cost if the market becomes&#xD;
      large enough. If the risk of developing IH and WD can be reduced with resorbable mesh to the&#xD;
      same extent as with a permanent mesh,1 health care costs may be reduced substantially8 and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life improved for a large group.&#xD;
