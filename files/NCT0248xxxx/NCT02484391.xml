      This pilot phase II trial studies how well CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid),&#xD;
      cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in treating patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia or granulocytic sarcoma (a malignant, green-colored tumor of myeloid cells [a type&#xD;
      of immature white blood cell]) that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid is thought to kill cancer cells by&#xD;
      turning off their mitochondria. Mitochondria are used by cancer cells to produce energy and&#xD;
      are the building blocks needed to make more cancer cells. By shutting off these mitochondria,&#xD;
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid deprives the cancer cells of energy and other supplies that&#xD;
      they need to survive and grow in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone&#xD;
      hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of CPI-613 when administered with high dose cytarabine, and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) in all three phases of salvage therapy (induction,&#xD;
      consolidation and maintenance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe the response rate (complete remission [CR], and CR with incomplete recovery&#xD;
      [CRi]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high&#xD;
      dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To monitor toxicities experienced by patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with&#xD;
      high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 1: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 3&#xD;
      for 5 doses, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first, third, and&#xD;
      fifth doses of cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 2 (OPTIONAL, AT DISCRETION OF TREATING PHYSICIAN): Patients receive&#xD;
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride as in course 1&#xD;
      or an abbreviated second course at the discretion of the treating physician. In the&#xD;
      abbreviated course, patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days&#xD;
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 2 for 3 doses, and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first and third cytarabine doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SALVAGE CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response receive up to 2 courses of the abbreviated&#xD;
      course of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone&#xD;
      hydrochloride. Patients achieving response may undergo stem cell transplant at the discretion&#xD;
      of the treating physician. Patients may proceed to maintenance after 1, 2 or no courses of&#xD;
      consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving response receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV&#xD;
      over 2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
