    <textblock>
      Consumption of carbohydrate containing foods or sugary drinks brings about changes to the&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. After a meal or drink, blood glucose rises until it reaches a peak&#xD;
      concentration usually after 30 minutes. When the body senses the increase in blood glucose, a&#xD;
      hormonal process involving insulin takes place to ensure that the glucose is taken up from&#xD;
      the blood for storage and where it is needed for energy in the body. This process then brings&#xD;
      about a decrease in the concentration of glucose until it reaches approximately the starting&#xD;
      concentration. The original concentration of glucose is attained approximately 2 hours after&#xD;
      eating or drinking a carbohydrate food or sugary drink respectively in healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different carbohydrates and sugary drinks have different effects on blood glucose response&#xD;
      depending on the amount as well as the type of carbohydrate. Those that give rise to a high&#xD;
      glucose response compared to a reference carbohydrate (usually glucose) are said to be high&#xD;
      glycaemic index (GI) foods and those with a lower glucose response compared to a reference&#xD;
      carbohydrate (usually glucose) are said to be low glycaemic index (GI) foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that diets that give rise to a high glucose response are associated with a&#xD;
      number of abnormalities like increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome mostly&#xD;
      comprises of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance which gives an increased risk of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. It also gives rise to other conditions like high blood pressure (arterial&#xD;
      hypertension), elevated blood insulin levels (hyper-insulinemia), elevated amounts of fat in&#xD;
      the liver (fatty hepatosis) and elevated amounts of lipids in the blood (dyslipidemia). After&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes become clinically apparent, the risk of cardiovascular disease also rises.&#xD;
      Research has also shown that foods/drinks which raise blood glucose levels gradually (low GI)&#xD;
      rather than rapidly (high GI) have health benefits which include reducing the risk of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. Laboratory studies have shown that polyphenols found in fruits,&#xD;
      vegetables and plant based foods have a positive effect on carbohydrate metabolism and can&#xD;
      lower the blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will determine whether the presence of polyphenols in the diet has any lowering&#xD;
      effect on the blood glucose levels and hence the glycaemic index of foods. This will be&#xD;
      determined by asking volunteers to consume commercially available food supplements together&#xD;
      with white bread and then determining the glycaemic response. The blood glucose response of&#xD;
      bread will be determined initially as a control reference. All will be consumed in random&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done by measuring blood glucose response after consumption of the control&#xD;
      reference meal and the test meal containing polyphenols and then determining the incremental&#xD;
      area under the glucose curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POMEGRANATE AND OLIVE STUDIES WILL BE TREATED SEPARATELY FOR PURPOSES OF PUBLISHING RESULTS.&#xD;
      EACH STUDY WILL AIM TO HAVE AT LEAST 16 PARTICIPANTS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The world health organisation has reported that over 220 million people suffer from diabetes&#xD;
      worldwide and that by the year 2030, this number will be doubled. The WHO also reports that&#xD;
      in 2004, about 3.4 million people died from high blood sugar. About 90% of all diabetes cases&#xD;
      is due to type II diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is largely due to overweight and lack of physical&#xD;
      activity characterised by high glucose levels (hyperglycaemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the human diet, the source of blood glucose is carbohydrates. Dietary carbohydrate is&#xD;
      important to maintain glycaemic homeostasis and provides the most of the energy in the diets&#xD;
      of most people. The control of blood glucose is a hormonal process and it is very important&#xD;
      to human physiology. Hormonal processes involve the release of insulin from the β- cells of&#xD;
      the pancreatic cells which stimulates the uptake of glucose after a meal, to other tissues&#xD;
      either for utilisation (glycolysis) or to be stored in the liver as glycogen (glycogenesis).&#xD;
      When blood glucose falls below normal, glucagon is secreted from the pancreatic α-cells and&#xD;
      it promotes liver glucose production by inducing the generation of glucose from&#xD;
      non-carbohydrate substrates such as amino and fatty acids (gluconeogenesis) and the&#xD;
      generation of glucose from glycogen (glycogenolysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the glucose homeostasis hormonal control fails, it entails high blood glucose levels&#xD;
      (postprandial hyperglycaemia) which can lead to metabolic syndrome which includes obesity,&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hypertension and dyslipidemia. Disturbance of glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis can also lead to other symptoms such as inflammation and oxidative stress at the&#xD;
      whole body level as well as disturbances of the functionality in several organs as well as&#xD;
      diabetes . Therefore, as much as carbohydrates are required in the human body as a major&#xD;
      source of energy, too much in the diet can have adverse health effects especially the one&#xD;
      with high glycaemic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed mechanism adapted from Aston, 2006 of how carbohydrates may affect human health&#xD;
      is that when there is a continual presence of high glycaemic index foods in the diet, this&#xD;
      gives rise to postprandial glucose rise as well as high insulin demand to act on the high&#xD;
      blood glucose levels in the blood. Postprandial glucose rise and high insulin demand may lead&#xD;
      to insulin resistance which is the major component of metabolic syndrome. High insulin demand&#xD;
      may also lead to β-cell failure which may also result in hyperglycaemia which is also a cause&#xD;
      of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia are risk factors for metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and diabetes type 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific evidence suggest that postprandial hyperglycaemia in humans has a major role to&#xD;
      play in health priorities like type 2 diabetes and blood glucose control. It has been&#xD;
      reported that about 90% of all diabetes cases consist of type 2 diabetes. Apart from type I&#xD;
      and type 2 diabetes, there are other related conditions which include pre-diabetes (impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as well as metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (obesity, hypertension and insulin resistance). It has been reported that pre-diabetes and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. The glycaemic index was originally proposed with the aim of managing diabetes.&#xD;
      However, recent studies have shown that the GI has potential in the prevention of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes as well as in the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Research has shown that high GI&#xD;
      diets are associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes . More research has&#xD;
      shown that high GI diet is associated with a number of abnormalities like increased metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and insulin resistance. In the same way, a low GI diet is said to improve insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity but more research is needed to support this. A few studies have shown this to be&#xD;
      the case. However it was observed that it was difficult to know whether this was as a result&#xD;
      of improved insulin sensitivity, or improved insulin secretion or due to reduced rate of&#xD;
      glucose absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential solution Having anything in the diet that can either slow down the digestion and&#xD;
      absorption of carbohydrates can help reduce the risk . Among others, two potential solutions&#xD;
      are that of consumption of low glycaemic index foods or having ingredients in the diet that&#xD;
      can reduce the glycaemic index of foods as well as postprandial blood glucose levels. The&#xD;
      presence of inhibiting components in the diet that can reduce postprandial glucose can also&#xD;
      be a solution to reducing the risk. Drugs like acarbose are currently used in some countries&#xD;
      for the management of type 2 diabetes which act by inhibiting carbohydrate digestive enzymes.&#xD;
      However, the use of acarbose has side effects such as nausea, flatulence and diarrhoea. It&#xD;
      has been reported that polyphenols also have the potential to inhibit the rise in blood&#xD;
      glucose by hindering the rapid absorption of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review has reported that research using animal models as well as a limited number of&#xD;
      human studies, have shown that polyphenols and polyphenol rich foods or beverages have the&#xD;
      potential to affect postprandial glycaemic responses and fasting glycaemia as well as an&#xD;
      improvement of acute insulin secretion and sensitivity. Other possible mechanisms as reported&#xD;
      in the review include pancreatic β- cells stimulation to secrete insulin as well as&#xD;
      activation of insulin receptors, modulation of the release of glucose from the liver as well&#xD;
      as of intracellular signalling pathways and gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent review concluded that it is very possible that the effects of polyphenols in&#xD;
      the diet will affect glycaemic index of foods as well as postprandial glucose responses in&#xD;
      humans. The two mechanisms highlighted by which this can be achieved being the inhibition of&#xD;
      sugar metabolising enzymes as well as transporters. This potential action of polyphenols can&#xD;
      thus be compared to that of acarbose which acts by the same mechanism and research in chronic&#xD;
      intervention studies has shown that it reduces diabetes risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will involve the use of pomegranate and olive supplements as a source of&#xD;
      polyphenols. The study was approved by the University of Leeds Mathematical and Physical&#xD;
      Sciences (MAPs) ethical committee with application number MEEC14-029. At least 16 volunteers&#xD;
      will be recruited for each supplement (pomegranate or olive). The volunteers will be screened&#xD;
      for their fasting blood glucose level. They will need to be healthy and their fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose levels should fall within the healthy range of 4.3-5.9mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers are scheduled to attend 3 visits. During each visit, the volunteer comes&#xD;
      fasted in the morning and the fasting blood glucose is measured by the use of a glucometer.&#xD;
      The volunteer is then given a test meal which will be randomized and blood glucose will be&#xD;
      measured at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120,150 and 180 minutes after the first bite of the test&#xD;
      meal. The results will be used to plot the area under the curve and results obtained after&#xD;
      consuming test meals will be compared to those obtained after consumption of control meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POMEGRANATE AND OLIVE STUDIES WILL BE TREATED SEPARATELY FOR PURPOSES OF PUBLISHING RESULTS.&#xD;
      EACH STUDY WILL AIM TO HAVE AT LEAST 16 PARTICIPANTS.&#xD;
