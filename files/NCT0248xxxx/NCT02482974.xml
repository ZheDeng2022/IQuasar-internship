    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of conversion of sirolimus to everolimus&#xD;
      in the maintenance treatment of LT recipients. Patients will be monitored every 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the switch of treatment for 48 weeks. The laboratory tests including hematological,&#xD;
      renal, hepatic, and metabolic parameters will be performed at each visit. Twenty-four-hour&#xD;
      urine creatinine clearance and proteinuria will be determined from a 24-hour urine collection&#xD;
      at baseline and week 48.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus (EVL) and sirolimus (SRL), an antagonist of mammalian target of rapamycin, has&#xD;
      been introduced into solid organ transplantation to either replace or reduce the dose of&#xD;
      potentially nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors. Although not approved for liver&#xD;
      transplantation (LT), SRL has still been used in several LT centers. After EVL was approved&#xD;
      by FDA and the Ministry of Health in Turkey for use in LT recipients, SRL was converted to&#xD;
      EVL in our institution. This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of conversion of&#xD;
      SRL to EVL in the maintenance treatment of LT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who switch from SRL to EVL will be monitored every 12 weeks after the switch of&#xD;
      treatment for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measure will be included any observation in terms of biopsy-proven acute/chronic&#xD;
      rejection and graft or patient loss due to rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will be included discontinuation of EVL and analyses of adverse events and&#xD;
      grading laboratory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluations will be included hematological (CBC), renal (serum creatinine,&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and&#xD;
      Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)], and electrolytes), hepatic&#xD;
      (serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, and albumin),&#xD;
      and metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride) at each visit.&#xD;
      Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine clearance and proteinuria will be determined from a 24-hour&#xD;
      urine collection at baseline and week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who were on additional immunosuppressive treatments, those medications will also&#xD;
      be continued.&#xD;
