      The overall goal of this research proposal is the early prediction of the emergence of CVI&#xD;
      and its characteristics on the basis of neuroimaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different steps that will be taken to achieve this goal will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize CVI deficits in children;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate the CVI characteristics with their motor profiles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize brain lesions in children with CVI;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To link the motor profile, CVI profile and brain metrics of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years, 488 children with and without CP have consulted at the CVI clinic in&#xD;
      Leuven. All these children had a comprehensive visual perceptual assessment, cognitive&#xD;
      evaluation and an ophthalmological assessment. Summarizing these data results in a&#xD;
      quantitative visual perceptual profile for each individual patient. The goal is to&#xD;
      prospectively extend this database to a number of 600 children. The project's primary&#xD;
      objective is to relate the presence of CVI to the motor profiles of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of these 488 children, 300 have an MRI available. The goal is to analyze the retrospective&#xD;
      MRI data of this clinical group and to prospectively extend this database by reassuring newly&#xD;
      registered children will receive MRI with DTI. This will allow the investigation of the&#xD;
      correlation between the brain metrics and the CVI characteristics in a large cohort.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective 1 &amp;2: to investigate the relationship between the presence of CVI and the motor&#xD;
      profiles of children diagnosed with CVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Retrospective data A database, registering all children diagnosed with or at risk for&#xD;
      CVI, is available through the Centre For Developmental Disabilities, Leuven. All these&#xD;
      children have consulted at the CVI clinic. Their developmental age ranges between 3 and 6&#xD;
      years. All these children have had a thorough work-up, so that information is available&#xD;
      regarding the diagnosis of CVI (L94 visual perceptual battery test score10 and CVI&#xD;
      questionnaire11), the cognitive abilities of the child (performance and verbal IQ using&#xD;
      WISC-II, SON-R or WPPSI-III-NL) together with the test results regarding motor functioning:&#xD;
      visuospatial functioning (VMI12 and TVPS13), motor coherence tasks and gross motor function&#xD;
      (movement ABC14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children standardly received a complete ophthalmological assessment. The consensus eye&#xD;
      protocol, as introduced by the Flemish working group on CVI, was performed in each child,&#xD;
      evaluating fixation of eyes, position and motility, acuity, refraction, contrast sensitivity,&#xD;
      visual field, visual attention and viewing distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Prospective data The database will continuously be updated and therefore, data from&#xD;
      all new consulting children will be added consecutively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively, a new test for the diagnosis of CVI will be applied. It concerns a newly&#xD;
      developed tool for diagnosis of CVI, based on the L-POST and developed in collaboration with&#xD;
      the research group of J. Wagemans. Normative data have been gathered for the age ranges 3 to&#xD;
      6 years. The diagnosis of CVI is made by comparing the results of the visual perceptual tests&#xD;
      to the developmental age of the child, with a result &lt;Pc 5 necessary for CVI to be&#xD;
      confirmed.15 These tests are standardly performed during the consultations and do not require&#xD;
      any additional time nor tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As in the retrospective cohort, cognitive and motor assessments will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective and prospective data together will allow us to relate the CVI&#xD;
      characteristics to the motor profiles of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3&amp;4: To build a prediction model based on the correlations found between brain&#xD;
      metrics and CVI characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Retrospective data If clinically mandatory, children had an MRI of the brain performed&#xD;
      either around the time of their CVI diagnosis or earlier in case they had a pre-existing&#xD;
      condition. We will correlate quantified CVI measures to the location and extent of the&#xD;
      underlying brain lesions, if present, and the (lack of) white matter tract integrity using&#xD;
      structural MRI and DTI. Our neuromotor research team (FABER-UZ Leuven, CP reference centre)&#xD;
      already developed a specific standardized imaging protocol for CP, mainly directed at&#xD;
      detection of white matter damage. This protocol includes at least FLAIR, MPRAGE, and DTI&#xD;
      sequences. First of all, the qualitative classification of the SCPE will be used to classify&#xD;
      conventional MRI.16 In children with dyskinetic CP, the classification of K. Himmelmann can&#xD;
      additionally be performed.17 To perform a more comprehensive qualitative and&#xD;
      semi-quantitative evaluation of brain lesions visible on conventional MRI, the FIORI&#xD;
      classification scale, recently developed in collaboration with our group, will be used.18&#xD;
      Additionally, quantitative evaluations of microstructural brain lesions will be realized&#xD;
      through the reconstruction of white matter tracts (e.g. inferior longitudinal fasciculus)&#xD;
      using DTI. In this way, we will be able to link a set of neural parameters to measures of&#xD;
      visual perceptual deficits. The goal of this study is to identify MRI- and DTI-parameters&#xD;
      that are able to discriminate between children with and without CVI on the one hand and&#xD;
      between different CVI patterns on the other hand. We expect that combinations and&#xD;
      interactions of different MRI- and DTI-parameters, instead of single parameters, will be&#xD;
      better suited for prognosis of the presence of CVI and of its characteristics. If possible,&#xD;
      supplementary volumetric data will be gathered using the same scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years, we have already collected a large dataset of children with and&#xD;
      without CP, seen at the CVI clinic in Leuven. Of these 400 children, 300 have an MRI&#xD;
      available. The diagnosis of CVI was made when results on the visual perceptual tests were at&#xD;
      a level &lt;Pc 5 for the developmental age. The retrospective MRI data of this clinical group&#xD;
      will be thoroughly analyzed in the various ways described above and subsequently correlated&#xD;
      to the visual perceptual data. In this way, we will obtain a clearer insight in the relation&#xD;
      between metrics of brain lesions and CVI characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Prospective data Prospective data will be gathered in a similar way as the&#xD;
      retrospective data collection. Children will preferably receive an MRI with DTI around the&#xD;
      age of 5 years. Around this age, with the help of a child-friendly scanning protocol&#xD;
      (developed by PhD student Marjolein Verly), anaesthesia can be avoided. In all children&#xD;
      demonstrating clinical relevant CVI features, an MRI with DTI will be performed.&#xD;
      Subsequently, data will be analyzed in a similar way as the retrospective MRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study is designed as a retrospective cohort study. Data is collected&#xD;
      from the standardized tests that are routinely performed during the CVI consultations.&#xD;
      Trained staff members of the Centre for Developmental Disabilities performed the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background information:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information regarding the age, the birth history and the school system the child is&#xD;
           enrolled in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CVI diagnostic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ophthalmological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CVI Flemish questionnaire for parents is a standardized questionnaire, developed by&#xD;
                the Flemish working group on CVI to give an overall idea of the visual functioning&#xD;
                of the child.11&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The L94 visual perceptual battery is an object recognition test, comprising 8&#xD;
                visual perceptual tasks for which normative data are available for children aged&#xD;
                between 2,75 and 6,5 years. In 5 computer tasks, the child is asked to identify&#xD;
                everyday objects and thus is tested for semantic and perceptual categorization.10&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Motion coherence tasks: specific tests evaluating motion coherence, motion speed,&#xD;
                biological motion and form from motion tasks will be performed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive functioning is evaluated using standardized testing by means of the WISC-II,&#xD;
           SON-R or WPPSI-III-NL respectively. The exact test is selected based on the age, the&#xD;
           mental and physical capacities of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visuospatial functioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Beery-Buktenica developmental test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI)12 is&#xD;
                widely used to assess visual perceptual abilities. The VMI consists of three&#xD;
                subtests. First, in the copy task, the individual is asked to copy geometric forms,&#xD;
                arranged in order of increasing difficulty. Second, the visual perception task uses&#xD;
                the same geometric forms but now asks the subject to search a specific form in a&#xD;
                series of similar forms. Third, in the Motor Coordination Task the subject is asked&#xD;
                to copy these drawings in a frame. The copy task predominantly relies on visuomotor&#xD;
                abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Test of Visual Perceptual skills (TVPS)13 is a motor-free task assessing&#xD;
                different categories of visual perceptual skills: Visual Discrimination, Visual&#xD;
                Memory Visual-Spatial Relations, Visual Form Consistence, Visual Sequential Memory,&#xD;
                Visual Figure Ground and Visual Closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Motor functioning is evaluated using the Movement ABC-214, that contains 8 tasks for&#xD;
           each age range in three areas: Manual Dexterity, Ball Skills and Static and Dynamic&#xD;
           Balance. A profile of a child's performance over the different sections of the test can&#xD;
           be examined. The assessment is paralleled by an observational approach with&#xD;
           item-specific observations designed to help the examiner focus on the perceptual-motor&#xD;
           aspects and overall evaluation to pinpoint emotional and motivational difficulties the&#xD;
           child may have in relation to motor tasks. The Movement ABC-2 Checklist takes assessment&#xD;
           into the everyday situations in which the child has to function. It provides an&#xD;
           economical means of assessing groups of children through classroom assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neurological assessment: a standardized clinical examination is routinely performed to&#xD;
           evaluate neurological signs such as abnormal muscle tone and pathological reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Brain imaging using structural MRI and DTI is evaluated using a specific standardized&#xD;
           imaging protocol, mainly directed at detection of white matter damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study is the prospective continuation of the retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study. As during the retrospective part of the study, the same standardized tests are&#xD;
      routinely performed during the CVI consultations and performed by the trained staff members&#xD;
      of the Centre for Developmental Disabilities. However, prospectively, some additional tests&#xD;
      will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An assessment battery based on the L-POST15 will complement the diagnosis of the L94.&#xD;
           The L-POST is a tool for visual perceptual assessment in adults. The subtests can be&#xD;
           classified in 5 visual domains: (1) object recognition in a scene, (2) degraded object&#xD;
           recognition , (3) motion perception, (4) global and local processing, and (5) visual&#xD;
           memory. The test is computer based and does not require motor actions. Normative data&#xD;
           are currently being gathered for the age ranges 3 to 6 years. The diagnosis of CVI is&#xD;
           made by comparing the results of the visual perceptual tests to the developmental age of&#xD;
           the child, with a result &lt;Pc 5 necessary for CVI to be confirmed.15&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The MRI and DTI will be performed whenever clinically relevant.&#xD;
