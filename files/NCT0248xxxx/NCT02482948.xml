      The purpose of this study is to compare how well two products, Active Leptospermum Honey&#xD;
      (ALH) (MEDIHONEY® Gel) and Collagenase (Santyl®), in removing the nonviable (non living)&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important aspect of wound bed preparation for healing or grafting is the recognition that&#xD;
      wounds often have underlying pathogenic abnormalities that cause necrotic tissue to&#xD;
      accumulate. Therefore, in order to facilitate wound progression, repeated removal of necrotic&#xD;
      tissue may be necessary as long as the wound is chronic. Debridement is defined as the&#xD;
      removal of nonviable material, foreign bodies, and poorly healing tissue from a wound.&#xD;
      Although surgeons recognize the importance of debridement, few data have been generated in&#xD;
      randomized trials to support its use. Traditionally, debridement has been undertaken as a&#xD;
      single therapeutic step within defined time frames. The most direct form of debridement is&#xD;
      surgical excision. Although this may be applicable for acute wounds, it is unlikely to remove&#xD;
      the necrotic burden that may continually accumulate in a chronic wound. Although there are&#xD;
      other forms of debridement including enzymatic and biologic; in the case of non-healing&#xD;
      wounds, the form of debridement with the most compelling evidence of healing efficacy is&#xD;
      autolytic debridement , Therefore, for patients who are poor candidates for surgical&#xD;
      debridement or have limited access to a surgeon, autolytic debridement may be considered an&#xD;
      effective form of continuous debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of MEDIHONEY® Gel&#xD;
      (Active Leptospermum Honey-ALH Gel) compared to (Santyl) Collagenase, two FDA&#xD;
      cleared/approved treatments, with respect to the percent reduction of necrotic (including&#xD;
      slough and eschar) tissue in the wound at the end of 14 days +/- 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to compare the two treatment groups with respect to&#xD;
      the percent reduction from randomization for necrotic tissue (including slough and eschar) at&#xD;
      weeks 1, 3 and 4 +/- 2 days.&#xD;
