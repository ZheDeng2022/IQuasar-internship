  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The USP8 gene and its downstream target, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is a&#xD;
      potential therapeutic target of Cushing disease. The EGFR inhibitor, Gefitinib, has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the production of ACTH both in vitro and in vivo, especially in USP8-mutated&#xD;
      corticotrophin adenomas. The investigators hypothesize that Gefitinib will suppress pituitary&#xD;
      corticotroph tumor ACTH production and normalize urinary free cortisol levels in patients&#xD;
      with USP8-mutated Cushing's disease. Gefitinib is an FDA approved drug used to treat&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. However, in this study, the drug will be used to treat&#xD;
      corticotrophin adenoma.&#xD;
