  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) occurs when the veins in the lower limbs can no longer&#xD;
      sufficiently pump enough blood back to the heart. Symptoms may include: dull aching,&#xD;
      cramping, itching or tingling in the calves, swelling, redness or any colour changes as well&#xD;
      as thickening of the skin in the lower limbs. The most common indication of CVI is dilated&#xD;
      veins known as varicose veins. CVI is a disorder found more commonly in females. Conventional&#xD;
      treatments for CVI include vein ligation or stripping, elastic compression, valve&#xD;
      reconstruction and sclerotherapy venous bypass. Amongst other treatment, exercise has also&#xD;
      proven to be effective in improving CVI as it increases circulation, by increasing blood&#xD;
      returning to the heart. A variety of herbal supplements have been proven to be safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of CVI. Red vine leaf extract has also been proven to be useful in&#xD;
      the treatment of CVI. Previous studies on the red vine leaf extract have shown that it is an&#xD;
      effective and safe treatment of CVI. Studies done on horse chestnut extract have stated that&#xD;
      the extract increases venous tone and decreases capillary permeability. Butcher's broom&#xD;
      extract has been proven to be effective in the treatment of CVI. There are currently no&#xD;
      studies done on the combination of red vine leaf extract, butcher's broom extract, horse&#xD;
      chestnut extract and vitamin B6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of a combination of red vine leaf extract&#xD;
      (360mg), horse chestnut extract (60mg), butcher's broom extract (35mg) and pyridoxine&#xD;
      (vitamin B6) (3.2mg) in the treatment of symptoms associated with CVI, using a Venous&#xD;
      Clinical Severity Score questionnaire (VCSS) .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 90 day, match paired, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving&#xD;
      forty females participants between the ages of 30 and 55. Participants will be recruited via&#xD;
      advertisements placed at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Health Centre and on the campus.&#xD;
      This sample group will be shared with another Homoeopathy Masters student, Xoliswa Mazibuko,&#xD;
      who will be evaluating the changes in the quality of life using combination of red vine leaf&#xD;
      extract, butcher's broom, horse chestnut extract and vitamin B6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consultations will take place at the UJ Health Centre, Doornfontein campus. The initial&#xD;
      consultation will consist of signing of the Participant Information and Consent form as well&#xD;
      as a Photograph Consent Form, followed by a screening test to confirm if participants qualify&#xD;
      to participate in the study. All symptoms will be evaluated according to the Venous Clinical&#xD;
      Severity Score (VCSS) questionnaire. Photographs of physical symptoms will also be taken,&#xD;
      with the consent of the participant, in the initial consultation. Participants will be&#xD;
      matched according to their age and severity of their symptoms. The bottles containing the&#xD;
      placebo capsules will be placed in one box and the bottles containing the experimental&#xD;
      capsules will be placed in another box. The boxes will be labelled X and Y. Each bottle will&#xD;
      contain either 30 placebo capsules or 30 experimental capsules, as per their box group. The&#xD;
      participants will then select a bottle from one of the boxes , thereby allocating themselves&#xD;
      to either the experimental group or the control group. The participants will be requested to&#xD;
      ingest one capsule from their selected bottle, every morning after breakfast for 30&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up consultations will take place on days thirty, sixty and ninety. At each follow up&#xD;
      consultation, the participants will be asked to complete the VCSS questionnaire, with the&#xD;
      help of the researcher, and photographs of the same anatomical landmarks as taken in the&#xD;
      initial consultation, will be taken. All photographs will be analysed by the Digimizer&#xD;
      programme, which will calculate any changes in surface area from week one to week twelve.&#xD;
      Photographs will be taken in such a way that the dignity and privacy of the participant is&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given medication for the next thirty days at each follow-up consultation&#xD;
      excluding the final consultation (day 90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any other treatment or intervention is used during the duration of the study, they will be&#xD;
      requested to notify the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from the questionnaire and analysed statistically with the assistance&#xD;
      of a statistician at Statkon. Differences between the Inter-group will be analysed using the&#xD;
      Friedman test with Wilcoxon post hoc test. To compare the different sets of data between the&#xD;
      Intra-group, the Mann-Whitney test will be used. All photographs will be analysed by&#xD;
      Digimizer programme.&#xD;
