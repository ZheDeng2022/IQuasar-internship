    <textblock>
      Providing patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) access to remote monitoring, for example&#xD;
      by telephone or telemonitoring using wireless technology, reduces deaths and hospitalisations&#xD;
      and may provide benefits on health care costs and quality of life. Remote monitoring of&#xD;
      patients with chronic heart failure can reduce pressure on resources, particularly for&#xD;
      conditions like chronic heart failure, which exert a large burden on health services. These&#xD;
      are conclusions of the Cochrane Systematic Review from 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Norway the costs for treatment of chronic heart failure are vast, both concerning hospital&#xD;
      treatment, daily use of medication over years, and loss of quality of life for patients and&#xD;
      their family caregivers. Generally there is little knowledge about what is gained for the&#xD;
      billions used. In Norway no telemonitoring services are established and hence no&#xD;
      investigations have yet been published. Thus it seems that current evidence of effectiveness&#xD;
      and quality is insufficient to recommend usage. The structure and funding streams in&#xD;
      Norwegian health services are different from other countries and the conventional services&#xD;
      that the intervention has been compared to in previous studies, are most likely&#xD;
      heterogeneous. It is thus important to investigate Norwegian conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced telemonitoring technology with electronic transfer of physiological data such as&#xD;
      blood pressure and weight is currently being used in research and established routine&#xD;
      services in several countries in Europe, amongst them the Netherlands, Germany and the United&#xD;
      Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project intends to introduce such a strategy as an avenue for exploring&#xD;
      promising new services that would not otherwise be available in Norway. The service consists&#xD;
      of daily monitoring the patients' weight and blood pressure directly from their home;&#xD;
      automatically and securely transmit the values to a server at the University Hospital of&#xD;
      North Norway (UNN); and monitor the values by a trained nurse at the Heart polyclinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is thus to explore whether, as compared to current care&#xD;
      from the Heart Polyclinic, the introduction of home telemonitoring will reduce hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and will, in addition, be cost-effective. This is in line with current&#xD;
      directions of European telemonitoring programmes for patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
      This result may define if the telemonitoring of heart failure patients is feasible for Norway&#xD;
      or not at all.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All data collected by the equipment placed at the patient's home will be directly and&#xD;
      securely transferred to the Heart polyclinic of the University Hospital of North Norway&#xD;
      (UNN). All data is anonymous as explained below, only the weight and the codes with the&#xD;
      answers to the questionnaire are send.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day a nurse is assigned as responsible for the heart remote monitoring system. The nurse&#xD;
      in charge must read the heart remote monitoring email in the morning every day, seven days a&#xD;
      week. If an alert email has been received, then the nurse logs into the system's dashboard&#xD;
      and reads the data displayed there for that patient. Then the nurse will try to phone the&#xD;
      patient to clarify the situation. Until this moment the procedure protocol differs from the&#xD;
      ordinary routines as the notification of a case is usually raised by a phone call from the&#xD;
      patient or a hospitalisation. But from this moment on, the procedure protocol is the same as&#xD;
      for all patients treated by the Heart polyclinic, i.e. if the nurse evaluates the situation&#xD;
      to need a further follow-up, then the nurse contacts the patient's general practitioner (GP)&#xD;
      by phone (as said this is procedure as usual). The hospital's Heart polyclinic has the same&#xD;
      responsibility for the treatment of the patients, both in the intervention arm and the&#xD;
      control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each one of the patients assigned to the intervention arm will be following this procedure&#xD;
      during 6 months. For the patients assigned to the control arm they will receive treatment as&#xD;
      usual also during a period of 6 months. Data stored in the system is anonymised. All patients&#xD;
      are uniquely identified by a number, the Unique Identifier (UID), in the system, the&#xD;
      connection between the UID and the real identity being only stored in a file in a secured&#xD;
      personal computer unconnected from any network, staying in an office at the heart polyclinic.&#xD;
      Once a week, the UIDs' file stored in the study personal computer at the Heart polyclinic is&#xD;
      transferred to a hardware protected pen drive. The pen drive in then placed in another&#xD;
      building at the UNN. This procedure is of the responsibility of the UNN's department for&#xD;
      &quot;E-health and information and communications technology (ICT)&quot;. In this way only two copies&#xD;
      of the file are stored in separate buildings. No reference to the study name is mentioned in&#xD;
      this file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a pilot study, a prototype of the platform was built. It consisted of a wireless weight&#xD;
      scale and also a blood pressure meter prepared to send the values through the home Wi-Fi&#xD;
      network to a connected portable computer. The portable computer could then send the encrypted&#xD;
      measurements to a server at UNN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first two months of pilot testing, the patient was satisfied with the usability of&#xD;
      the solution and the reliability of the service was proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform deployed and tested in the pilot study has been extended to include&#xD;
      functionalities for multiple patients. A dashboard showing all the measurements received&#xD;
      (unidentified) has been developed for the polyclinic and used by the responsible clinician&#xD;
      (the nurse on daily duty). This data is unidentified and consists of a registration of blood&#xD;
      pressure and weight, the encoded answers to the questionnaire attached (example: Q3A2 means&#xD;
      that question 3 got the answer 2 in the questionnaire). The responsible nurse at the Heart&#xD;
      Polyclinic has access to the dashboard. When a situation requiring the nurse intervention&#xD;
      arises, the system sends an alerting email to a pre-defined address (usually the nurse's&#xD;
      email account as it will be done in this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) Power analysis The inclusion of 40&#xD;
      patients is based upon the total number of new patients served by the polyclinic per year&#xD;
      during the 2 last years. For this study a sample size was calculated based on a readmission&#xD;
      rate of 70% of the patients per year on average with a standard deviation of 20pp (percentage&#xD;
      points). The values are adequate, based on patients who have received treatment within the&#xD;
      Heart Polyclinic and also replicating the study by Antonicelli, published in the Journal of&#xD;
      telemedicine and Telecare &quot;Impact of telemonitoring at home on the management of elderly&#xD;
      patients with congestive heart failure&quot; in 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was assumed by the clinical team that a 1/3 reduction on the rate of readmissions (down to&#xD;
      47%) would be clinically relevant as the margin of superiority for the intervention. To have&#xD;
      95% certainty (power) that a test at 0.05 level of significance would find a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the means, the study would include a minimum of 20 patients in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned RCT The telemonitoring service will be offered to all patients admitted at UNN's&#xD;
      Heart Polyclinic, satisfying the inclusion criteria. The study comprises an intervention arm&#xD;
      testing the proposed telemonitoring service and a control arm with the current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the intervention arm receive a home telemonitoring kit consisting of a&#xD;
      tablet, a wireless weight scale and a portable blood pressure meter. The patient is asked to&#xD;
      weigh him- or herself every day and the monitoring procedure happens as previously described.&#xD;
      In addition a measurement of the blood pressure is also made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the control arm receive treatment as usual, consisting of a&#xD;
      recommendation to weigh themselves at home, using their own weight scale, and to report by&#xD;
      phone to the polyclinic if there is a significant change in weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study calendar is shown below. Recruiting period: 14 months Follow-up period: 6 months&#xD;
      Number of patients: 40&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: will be performed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: independent outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to which group the&#xD;
      patient has been assigned to (patients are not blinded due to the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges and opportunities Qualitative research with semi structured interviews. Patients&#xD;
      in the intervention group and health care professionals will be asked to state their opinion&#xD;
      of the service. The research team will also observe patients' interactions with the system&#xD;
      after the 6 months of the study. A qualitative summary and thematic analysis of significant&#xD;
      features of opinions and actions will be connected to best practices. The purpose is to be&#xD;
      able to understand how best practices can be developed in the Northern Norwegian context, and&#xD;
      describe their mechanisms. The innovation intention is to adjust the services as they&#xD;
      develop, by considering the identified additional conditions for future development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and privacy With recent events and advances in information technology and the&#xD;
      Internet, confidentiality regarding handling of patient private data has become a critical&#xD;
      aspect of a study design as privacy is a fundamental right in the public healthcare domain.&#xD;
      In this project confidentiality of private health information will be ensured according to&#xD;
      the Health Personnel Act § 21, helsepersonelloven § 21, and described in LOV2001-05-18 nr.24&#xD;
      (Helse- og omsorgsdepartementet, 2001). All private personal data will be de-identified:&#xD;
      every unique identifying number, characteristic, or code identifiers of the individual or of&#xD;
      relatives, employers, or household members of the individual will be removed so that the&#xD;
      information can be used alone or in combination with other information. The resulting data&#xD;
      will be analysed by a statistician to ensure that no individually identifiable health&#xD;
      information remains. The consent of participants will be required by means of providing a&#xD;
      letter of informed consent to be signed.&#xD;
