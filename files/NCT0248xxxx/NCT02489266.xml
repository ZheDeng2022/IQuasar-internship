      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, changing them in a lab,&#xD;
      and then giving the cells back to the person. These cells are called tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TIL). Researchers want to grow some of the TIL cells with the drug Akti to see&#xD;
      if they live longer than those grown without it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if TIL cells grown with Akti live longer than those grown without it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 70 with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be screened with tests including scans, x-rays, heart and lung tests, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, and a &lt;TAB&gt;possible colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have tumor surgery or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a large catheter inserted into a vein in the upper chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive leukapheresis for 4 5 hours. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm. White&#xD;
           blood cells &lt;TAB&gt;are removed. The rest of the blood is returned by needle in the other&#xD;
           arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will check into the hospital and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 5 days, get 1 2 chemotherapy drugs by catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 1 3 days, get the changed cells by catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For several days, get 2 drugs to stimulate cells, one by injection, the other by&#xD;
           catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 7 12 days, recover in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After treatment, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return to NIH for several 2-day visits for a few years. At each visit, participants will&#xD;
           have lab tests, imaging studies, and a physical exam. At some visits, they may have&#xD;
           leukapheresis or blood tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
           (TIL) can mediate regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered with&#xD;
           high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy&#xD;
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regression of tumor in mouse models and humans strongly correlates with anti-tumor T&#xD;
           cells that exhibit features of immunologic memory and have a capacity to persist for&#xD;
           long periods after adoptive-transfer into tumor-bearing hosts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In our preclinical work with TIL, we have identified a pharmacologic inhibitor of AKT&#xD;
           that promotes features of immunologic memory in TIL (as evidenced by transcriptomic,&#xD;
           proteomic, metabolomic, and functional assays described in the Background section).&#xD;
           Consistently, AKT inhibition of human TIL significantly enhances persistence after&#xD;
           adoptive-transfer into an immunodeficient mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We therefore aim to evaluate whether pharmacologic inhibition of AKT in TIL may enhance&#xD;
           persistence after adoptive-transfer into patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether ACT using TIL cultured in a pharmacologic inhibitor of AKT&#xD;
                (during ex vivo expansion) results in enhanced in vivo persistence of TIL after&#xD;
                adoptive transfer into autologous patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine whether ACT using a combination of AKTi-treated and conventional TIL can&#xD;
                mediate tumor regression by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)&#xD;
                guidelines in patients with advanced melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will undergo ACT in conventional manner, with the&#xD;
           exception that half of tumor fragments from which TIL are isolated will be cultured in&#xD;
           the presence of a pharmacologic AKT inhibitor. Prior to infusion of TIL, the AKT&#xD;
           inhibitor (hereafter AKTi) will be washed from the therapeutic TIL product and will not&#xD;
           be systemically administered. Each patient will receive a 1:1 mixture of conventional&#xD;
           TIL and AKTi-treated TIL. To evaluate persistence of AKTi-treated and conventional TIL&#xD;
           after adoptive co-transfer, we will perform high-throughput deep sequencing of the TCR&#xD;
           V-beta CDR3 region of TIL from the infusion-bag and from peripheral blood when&#xD;
           sufficient lymphocyte reconstitution (&gt;200 lymphocytes/microliter) has occurred and&#xD;
           approximately 4-6 weeks after infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 20 patients may be enrolled over 20-24 months.&#xD;
