  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal abrasions are associated with significant discomfort during a 24-48 hrs healing&#xD;
      phase. Current practice guidelines discourage the use of topical anesthetics in treating&#xD;
      these patients due to concerns that these medications may prevent proper corneal epithelial&#xD;
      healing. These concerns are based primarily on decades old animal based research. However,&#xD;
      recent evidence suggests topical anaesthetics are a safe and effective way of managing&#xD;
      patient pain in the short term. This study will investigate the effect of topical 0.5%&#xD;
      tetracaine on corneal healing and pain management in patients with corneal abrasions in the&#xD;
      first 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled study of 260 adults with&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute corneal injuries presenting to the tertiary acute care settings in&#xD;
      Kingston. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% tetracaine or saline in&#xD;
      addition to usual care as outpatients. They will be followed through the ophthalmology&#xD;
      emergency eye clinic to assess healing at 36-48hrs. after the acute care visit. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be an assessment of pain as measured every 4 hours for 48 hrs. using a 10mm&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes will include assessments of corneal healing,&#xD;
      use of adjunct pain medications, time lost from work/usual activities, quality of sleep,&#xD;
      ability to read and the SF12 quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will better inform the safety and effectiveness of short-term tetracaine usage in&#xD;
      patients with simple corneal abrasions for optimal treatment of patients in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered eye injuries presenting to acute care settings and&#xD;
      account for over 10% of new ophthalmological presentations at eye accident departments,&#xD;
      primary care offices, and emergency departments. Patients complain of severe eye pain,&#xD;
      foreign body sensation, pain with blinking, and photophobia. Corneal abrasions are defects in&#xD;
      the epithelial layer that occur secondary to mechanical ocular surface trauma. Common causes&#xD;
      of corneal abrasions include fingernail injuries, tree branches, and projectile pieces of&#xD;
      metal, wood, or glass that injure or become embedded in the cornea. . Though associated with&#xD;
      significant discomfort, the prognosis for simple corneal abrasions is usually excellent, with&#xD;
      full recovery within 24-48 hours. Untreated abrasions, particularly those associated with a&#xD;
      retained foreign body, can lead to complications such as corneal ulcers, prolonged pain, and&#xD;
      visual acuity loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the standard approach to treating corneal abrasions includes removal of the&#xD;
      foreign body if present, oral analgesics for pain control, and topical antibiotics.&#xD;
      Traditional guidelines by ophthalmologists have advocated against the use of topical&#xD;
      anesthetics due to concerns with corneal epithelial healing the potential for patients to&#xD;
      miss important clinical clues that indicate the rare development of secondary corneal&#xD;
      infection, as well as the potential for longer term misuse leading to severe corneal&#xD;
      ulceration and perforation. Previous studies, primarily using animal models, have found a&#xD;
      delay in corneal epithelial healing with topical anaesthetics, particularly with repeated and&#xD;
      prolonged usage. Several case studies have described impaired corneal epithelial healing and&#xD;
      ulceration with the prolonged use and abuse of topical anesthetic drops (0.05% proparacaine&#xD;
      HCl). There have been reports of topical anesthetic (TA) induced corneal damage including&#xD;
      punctate epitheliopathy, corneal lysis, perforation, persistent epithelial defects, and&#xD;
      ocular inflammation. It is thought that local anesthetics inhibit mitosis and cellular&#xD;
      migration, preventing proper re-epithelialization of the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in recent years a number of randomized clinical trials and case studies of human&#xD;
      subjects have shown that with appropriate application and restricted short term usage,&#xD;
      topical anesthetics did not delay wound healing or increase risks of corneal ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent prospective, randomized, double-blind trial looked at the effect of topical&#xD;
      anesthetics on epithelial healing and pain management for patients with uncomplicated corneal&#xD;
      abrasion. The study included 116 patients presenting to the emergency department who were&#xD;
      given either 1% tetracaine HCl or control artificial tears. The study found no change in&#xD;
      corneal healing rate or persistent symptoms but little benefit in pain relief as measured at&#xD;
      48 hrs. A previous prospective randomized study comparing 0.05% proparacaine and placebo has&#xD;
      shown a significant decrease in reported pain with topical anesthetic use compared to control&#xD;
      with no change in corneal healing. Another study evaluating the effect of 1% tetracaine for&#xD;
      pain management after photorefractive keratectomy also reported significant pain reduction&#xD;
      with topical anesthetic use with no delays in epithelial healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversy continues to exist over the utility of topical anesthetics in managing pain and&#xD;
      their safety in affecting corneal healing. Contemporary studies of short term topical&#xD;
      anesthetic use, noted above, have not shown adverse effects on healing. Differential effects&#xD;
      on pain management have been found. Yet the investigators believe the Waldman study measured&#xD;
      pain at a delayed time when the abrasion would be expected to have healed. Clinicians in&#xD;
      Queen's Department of Emergency Medicine do not generally prescribe topical anesthetics for&#xD;
      corneal abrasions and believe that evidence demonstrating their efficacy and safety would&#xD;
      change practice patterns for the benefit of patients with these injuries and those in other&#xD;
      centres. The investigators also hope that this study will better address problems of&#xD;
      inadequate participant enrollment and retention that previous studies have encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 - Research Question In adult emergency department patients with acute corneal abrasions,&#xD;
      is the application of 0.5% tetracaine effective in the short-term management of pain while&#xD;
      not being associated with adverse effects on healing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 - Hypothesis Based on the review of existing literature on the effects of topical&#xD;
      anesthetics, the investigators hypothesize that short-term and controlled usage of tetracaine&#xD;
      will be an effective way in managing patient pain and will not affect corneal healing.&#xD;
