    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system. It is known that your etiology has genetic and environmental causes. Several viruses&#xD;
      have been implicated as triggers as well as perpetrators of this disease. Several studies&#xD;
      make the correlation between Endogenous Retrovirus Type W (HERV-W) and the family&#xD;
      Herpesviridae and activity in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. The most important&#xD;
      characteristics of the virus implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease is the fact that&#xD;
      they have latency periods of exacerbation and they have, as their main biological&#xD;
      environment, the central nervous system. The HERV-W, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus, herpes virus type 6 and type 7 herpesvirus members are the most studied as&#xD;
      causes of multiple sclerosis. It was found that these viruses are closely involved in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of MS, but it is believed that aren't the only responsible for its beginning. It&#xD;
      is likely that this disease presents numerous triggers and more studies are needed to&#xD;
      determine these interactions. In addition, a study comparing the activity of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis with the presence of these viruses was never realized.&#xD;

      Background/Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the spinal cord&#xD;
      (especially in posterior cords). The clinical heterogeneity of MS is well described, but&#xD;
      currently it is known that lesions of MS and mechanisms underlying involved in the&#xD;
      pathological destruction of the central nervous system (CNS) are also heterogeneous. It is a&#xD;
      multifactorial disease in which one immunopathogenic mechanism is suggested as responsible&#xD;
      for the destruction of the sheath myelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the pathology of inflammatory joint lesions of MS suggests that specific autoimmune&#xD;
      responses against components of CNS myelin may have a crucial role in the destruction of&#xD;
      myelin. This concept is supported by the high level of oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) in&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid by linkage with the locus of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),&#xD;
      expansion of B and T cells reactive to myelin in MS lesions and the fact that immunization&#xD;
      with myelin proteins induces an MS-like disease in animals, experimental autoimmune&#xD;
      encephalomyelitis (EAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autoreactivity for various myelin proteins, including myelin basic protein, proteolipid&#xD;
      protein, and myelin-associated glycoprotein in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), has&#xD;
      been observed in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is noted however, that T cells of patients with MS show a predominant activity against MOG&#xD;
      in relation to other myelin proteins, and anti-MOG antibodies were identified connected to&#xD;
      the myelin's disintegration around axons in acute lesions of MS. In addition, sensitization&#xD;
      with MOG reproduces the clinical and demyelinating degenerative pathology of MS in rodent&#xD;
      models and primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infectious etiology of MS has also been postulated, and over several years, a number of&#xD;
      different viruses have been suggested to trigger immunopathology. Increased titles of&#xD;
      antibody were detected, for EBV, varicella zoster virus and rubella virus, while specific&#xD;
      proteins human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), in particular of the HERV-W family were&#xD;
      detected in the blood and brain lesions in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HERV arose from ancient infections of host cells of the germline by exogenous retroviruses&#xD;
      and today constitute about 8% of the human genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrovirus multiple sclerosis-associated (MRSV), is an enveloped virus with reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase activity, which represents the prototype of the HERV-W family human genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRSV was isolated in leptomeninges, in choroid plexus and in cultures of&#xD;
      monocytes/macrophages of MS patients and their origin is still under investigation. Has been&#xD;
      suggested that particles are originated from MSRV provirus HERV-W modified, or transmitted&#xD;
      from a member of the same exogenous family. MSRV virions has properties such as&#xD;
      superantigens, they induce the production of cytokines by mononuclear cells in peripheral&#xD;
      human blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HERV particles associated with reverse transcriptase activity (RT) were confirmed to be a&#xD;
      hallmark of expression from MSRV. A protocol for detection of MSRV virion by RT PCR was&#xD;
      designed to detect their presence in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent studies in patients with MS and control populations showed correlations between&#xD;
      the MS and MSRV and its prognosis, including the conversion of relapsing-remitting MS in its&#xD;
      secondary progressive form (SP-MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel studies showed the immunopathogenesis of MSRV virions and identified the envelope&#xD;
      protein (Env) of MSRV as being responsible for the pro-inflammatory and superantigenicity&#xD;
      immune. The Env antigen was detected on MS patients in studies of brain postmortem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trans-activation of the HERV-W promoters by environmental virus associated with MS has&#xD;
      also been shown to induce an epigenetic dysregulation in HERV-W, when present in the host&#xD;
      genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certainly the most important herpes virus associated with MS is EBV, the ratio between EBV&#xD;
      serology and the development of MS has been extensively studied. Furthermore, the interaction&#xD;
      between EBV and the immune system are undeniable leading to a persistent immune response and&#xD;
      immortalization of lymphocytes. There are also studies that correlate the expression of EBV&#xD;
      with greater activity of MS. Finally, the interaction between EBV and endogenous retroviruses&#xD;
      are a recent and fascinating field of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV was the first member of the Herpesviridae family to be implicated as a potential cause of&#xD;
      MS in 1971. EBV is a possible candidate due to several factors: it is widespread in nature,&#xD;
      requires a long quiescent viral infection that has continuous production due periods of&#xD;
      reactivation and modulate the human immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulty in associating MS to prove that EBV is the virus infection occurred before the&#xD;
      onset of autoimmune disease. Pohl et al. showed that the EBV-seropositivity in patients with&#xD;
      MS in Europe (children) - was 99% higher when compared with the control group, which virus&#xD;
      antibodies were found in 72%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levin et al. estimated the time of viral infection by serum antibody titers before the MS and&#xD;
      compared with a control group. This study had access to the medical records of approximately&#xD;
      8 million employees of the US Army who had stored blood samples. Of this group, the&#xD;
      case-control study where 305 people came to later develop MS and 610 control subjects&#xD;
      selected were paired; 10 cases who developed MS and 32 controls were initially EBV&#xD;
      seronegative. All cases had become positive EBV before the MS, compared to only 35.7% of&#xD;
      controls who seroconverted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have also attempted to assess the relationship between antibody titers against&#xD;
      EBV and the onset of MS. According to the work of De Lorenze et al., patients with MS had a&#xD;
      significant increase in antibodies 20 years before the first symptoms of MS. This fact can be&#xD;
      explained in two ways: the existence of a prior infection altering the balance of the EBV&#xD;
      receptor cells (memory T cells) or reinfection with a different strain of EBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV infects B lymphocytes and persistently highly immunogenic. The antigen specific cytotoxic&#xD;
      T lymphocytes are produced continuously and increased in number in response to primary&#xD;
      infection and high viremia. This immune control is essential to prevent EBV-related&#xD;
      malignancies. In its modulating action, manages to rescue infected B lymphocytes via&#xD;
      expression of latent antigens and helps them to differentiate into memory B cells, where the&#xD;
      virus persists. However, it is not established whether the increased T cells specific for EBV&#xD;
      is a response to increased stimulation by specific recognition of myelin antigens. EBV viral&#xD;
      load is not very high in MS, in addition, T cells specific for this virus does not seem to be&#xD;
      distinguished from the same cells in hosts without MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another investigator states that during periods of MS reactivation there is an increased&#xD;
      activity of virus replication in relation to periods of remission. Patients with antibody&#xD;
      response to early antigen of EBV are more likely to show disease activity as measured by MRI&#xD;
      with gadolinium, when compared to patients without humoral response. These data led us to&#xD;
      believe that the activity of the disease may be related to latent EBV infection as well as&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies correlating levels of antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and MS are&#xD;
      controversial. Although most of the results show high rates of CMV infection in patients with&#xD;
      MS, on the other hand, a milder presentation of the disease is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some investigators looked for the presence of anti-CMV antibodies in MS and healthy&#xD;
      individuals. They found positive in 98% of MS patients compared with 52% in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another investigators showed that patients who had antibody against CMV were: later age of&#xD;
      disease onset, lower rates of reactivation of the disease, and fewer signs of cerebral&#xD;
      atrophy on MRI. Those who had higher titers of these antibodies had less brain atrophy and&#xD;
      fewer lesions on imaging tests, compared with patients who had lower titers. An animal model&#xD;
      with mimic the patterns of MS demonstrated that animals with CMV infections demyelinating&#xD;
      frame before clinical presentations were weaker than those not infected. These studies&#xD;
      suggest a beneficial modulating effect of CMV infection on the immune response in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The herpesvirus (HHV-6 and HHV-7) are closely related and have a similar biological pattern.&#xD;
      These viruses are able to infect cells of the immune system and modulate their functions. The&#xD;
      work described by Krukle-Nora et al. attempted to investigate associations between HHV-6 and&#xD;
      HHV-7 in MS by analyzing the peripheral blood of patients. Patients were randomly selected&#xD;
      and divided into 02 groups: 14 patients with relapsing remitting MS (RR-MS) and 14 with&#xD;
      secondary progressive MS (SP-MS). All study patients were at least 3 months without use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs. Of the 28 patients, 25 had latent HHV-6 infection and/or HHV-7.&#xD;
      HHV-6 has been found in 9 patients with RR-MS and 9 with the SP-MS. HHV-7 were found in 10&#xD;
      patients with RR-MS and 14 with the SP-MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two investigators using the technique of fluorescent in situ hybridization, human cadaveric&#xD;
      tissues examined to evaluate the expression of early and late viral genes at white matter in&#xD;
      the affected tissue of patients with MS and in brain samples without disease. The gene of&#xD;
      HHV-6 was found in all samples and was restricted to oligodendrocytes. Quantitative analysis&#xD;
      of the expression of viral RNA showed that in both groups of MS patients (brain tissue with&#xD;
      and without change of white matter) samples had significantly higher levels of expression of&#xD;
      this virus. Furthermore, they showed that the injured tissues were correlated with higher&#xD;
      viral expression, a fact that contributes to the theory of HHV-6 is implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using all these methods for virus were observed conflicting results. In fact when the&#xD;
      technologies used were not capable of distinguishing active from latent infection by HHV-6&#xD;
      (by analysis of leukocytes from the blood, of cerebrospinal fluid containing cells and of&#xD;
      tissue of the CNS), no difference is found among the samples patients and the control group.&#xD;
      However, when diagnostic technologies are used specifically for detection of activity of the&#xD;
      HHV-6, a strong correlation between HHV-6 and the pathogenesis of MS is observed. Our group&#xD;
      has recently investigated the level of similarity between the envelope protein of HERV-W and&#xD;
      MOG. A comparison of the envelope MOG identified five IgG-like domain of MOG-like extending&#xD;
      the idea of the HERV-W may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS, perhaps to facilitate&#xD;
      recognition by the immune system MOG retroviral regions. We have also shown that most&#xD;
      patients showed expression of the HERV-W envelope at some level. Nine of the ten tested&#xD;
      samples had medium to high levels of HERV-W envelope expression against very low expression&#xD;
      levels or no activity in healthy controls, confirming the association between MS activity and&#xD;
      HERV-W in our population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in Italy showed that EBV stimulates the expression of HERV-W in cells from&#xD;
      blood and brain in vitro. They suggest that the pathogenesis of MS, a possible model could&#xD;
      include EBV as the initial trigger of MS, years later, and shows the HERV-W as real to&#xD;
      pathogenicity of MS, in striking parallel with the behavior of the disease in their remitting&#xD;
      form contributor the appellant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: correlate clinical and imaging of MS activity with quantitative assessment&#xD;
      of HERV-W and viruses of the Herpesviridae family in the blood of patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess expression of HERV-W and Herpesvirus and compare the viruses expression among patients&#xD;
      with MS and healthy controls with and without other neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a multifactorial disease, with genetic and environmental etiology. It is great the&#xD;
      interest the researchers in associated factors to establish a causal relationship. Several&#xD;
      viruses have been linked to the pathogenesis and disease activity. Although herpesvirus and&#xD;
      HERV-W viruses are the most important in the attempt to establish a causal relationship and&#xD;
      with activity of MS, until now there are many questions that remain open about the role of&#xD;
      these viruses in the etiology and development of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this work it is expected to find more possible answers on the etiopathogenesis and&#xD;
      inflammatory activity related to MS, and thus, provide more consistent data that will help&#xD;
      the formulation of increasingly specific and effective therapies directed to this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, all samples will be analyzed by ELISA immunoassay for the detection of IgG and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-EBV and CMV antibodies in the serum of the participants, using&#xD;
      commercial kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nucleic acid extraction will be performed (DNA and RNA), according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. All protocols to ensure the purity of the RNA and absence of DNA in the samples&#xD;
      will be adopted in the analyze of expression (and thus detection of transcripts). Thus, the&#xD;
      nucleic acids are subjected to treatment with DNAse and verification by RT-PCR HERV-W. Only&#xD;
      samples containing RNA will be transcribed and subjected to further analysis. RNA&#xD;
      quantification of the HERV-W will be made on mononuclear cells (PBMC) by a quantitative&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) specific for the subtype MSRV of the HERV-W family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of herpesvirus DNA will initially be made by a PCR, using two sets of primers&#xD;
      (HSVPAN and VZVPAN). After amplification is carried out an enzymatic digestion with BamHI and&#xD;
      BstUI for typing the herpesvirus eight types including human herpesvirus 6 (6A and 6B). For&#xD;
      samples that prove positive, a qRT-PCR will be held for specific viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, longitudinal study that collected biological material and the presence of a&#xD;
      control group will be held. This project will be analyzed by the individuals, through the&#xD;
      term of free and informed consent. Only by signing the consent form the patient will be able&#xD;
      to participate in this survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples of patients from the neurology outpatient clinic (CATEM and other specialties)&#xD;
      will be done during routine visit by a qualified professional. The blood of the patients from&#xD;
      the Blood Bank will be collected in conjunction with the examination routinely performed. All&#xD;
      materials collected will be sent to the virology laboratory at the Institute of Tropical&#xD;
      Medicine, University of São Paulo, where laboratory tests are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for degree of clinical and imaging disease activity by analyzing&#xD;
      annualized rate of relapses, EDSS-scale increases and increased cranial lesions on MRI and&#xD;
      disease activity classified as MILD, MODERATE and SEVERE according to the proposed criteria&#xD;
      by Freedman et al. The cranial MRI will be performed only for groups with MS and with other&#xD;
      neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After laboratory test results, data will be analyzed and receive necessary treatment for its&#xD;
      statistical interpretation and comparison with the activity of disease using parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric tools. The Student-t and Mann-Whitney tests will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      associations between clinical, demographic and laboratory parameters. The significance level&#xD;
      of alpha = 0.05 or 5% to reject the null hypothesis will be fixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined based on the percentage of the population with and without MS&#xD;
      showing detectable expression of HERV-W in PBMC. Although the number of patients with MS that&#xD;
      exhibits activity retrovirus envelope is close to 95%, we assume more conservative values for&#xD;
      the sample calculation. Therefore, assuming expression by 50% and 10% for cases and controls,&#xD;
      respectively, a sample size of 28 cases and 28 controls is necessary, based on a confidence&#xD;
      level = 95% power to detect 80%, according to the Kelsey-method. Thus, as the investigators&#xD;
      will analyze three groups (with MS, without MS and other neurological diseases) the total N&#xD;
      is 84 subjects, 28 per group.&#xD;
