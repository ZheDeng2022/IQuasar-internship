      Objectives of the study are: To estimate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a&#xD;
      cohort of women with suspected ovarian cancer and evaluate changes in the coagulation system&#xD;
      in case of benign or malignant disease. The impact of changes in the coagulation system on&#xD;
      disease prognosis will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication after surgery. Deep-vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) constitute VTE. PE is often a consequence of DVT and it is&#xD;
      a feared complication and the most common preventable cause of hospital death. VTE can be&#xD;
      asymptomatic and can be detected by a compression ultrasound scan (CUS) of the legs and a&#xD;
      Computer Tomography (CT) of the lungs. It is wellknown that cancer patients are at higher&#xD;
      risk of developing VTE, the risk is approximately seven times higher than in the background&#xD;
      population. A Danish study showed a significantly higher risk of death when VTE was diagnosed&#xD;
      at the same time as the cancer diagnosis with a 12 % one year survival compared to 36 % in&#xD;
      cancer patients without a history of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 600 women in Denmark are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year and it is the&#xD;
      forth most common cause of cancer death among Danish women. Earlier studies have found that&#xD;
      up to 31 % of ovarian cancer women develop VTE as a consequence of the disease and/or the&#xD;
      treatment. Very few studies have examined the incidence of VTE before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A Pulmonary CT-angiography is included in the routinely performed Fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography - Computer Tomography (FDG PET-CT) to reveal pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      at time of first referral. Compressive ultrasound scan including Doppler flow of the lower&#xD;
      extremities is performed four times from first referral and during a one-year follow up&#xD;
      period to detect clinical or subclinical deep vein thrombosis (DVT) before and after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tissue samples are taken, prepared and stored at -80 degrees in the Danish&#xD;
      Cancer-Biobank for later analyzes of coagulation markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune histochemical techniques will be use to demonstrate tissue factor (TF) in tumor&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In a prospective study at Aalborg University Hospital to estimate the incidence of&#xD;
           clinical and subclinical venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with suspected ovarian&#xD;
           cancer before and after initiation of treatment. The impact of VTE on survival will be&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the same prospective cohort the correlation between markers of coagulation and&#xD;
           fibrinolysis and subclinical VTE, tumour burden and overall survival will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the correlation between immunohistochemical demonstrated tissue factor (TF) in&#xD;
           tumour tissue and circulating TF in peripheral blood and the relation to VTE and tumour&#xD;
           burden.&#xD;
