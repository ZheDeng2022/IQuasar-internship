  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the number one cause of disability in the United Nations with about 1 million new&#xD;
      cases each year. Following stroke, patients with perceptual and cognitive impairments have&#xD;
      the worst prognostic outcomes. There is evidence to suggest that perceptual and cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms can be alleviated by multisensory integration, which has the effect of enhancing&#xD;
      motor, perceptual and cognitive processes. This research project will investigate for the&#xD;
      first time the functional benefits that stem from multisensory stimulation of attention in&#xD;
      stroke patients with perceptual and cognitive impairments. The research project will involve&#xD;
      multisensory learning paradigms with stimulus and environmental parameters that optimally&#xD;
      enhance perceptual learning and cognitive function. Multisensory learning paradigms will be&#xD;
      tailored for patients with stroke to determine the perceptual and cognitive symptoms that can&#xD;
      be alleviated, and fMRI will be used to evaluate the underlying neural substrates of the&#xD;
      effects. The project will show whether multisensory stimulation provides an effective means&#xD;
      of attentional rehabilitation after stroke and whether the effects generalize to everyday&#xD;
      life, with long-term outcomes that improve functional independence in patients with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major causes of death worldwide, second only to coronary disease, and it&#xD;
      is the leading cause of disability with patients needing long hospitalisation and long-term&#xD;
      community care (Mackay, Mensah, Mendin, &amp; Greenlund, 2004). Stroke patients with perceptual&#xD;
      and cognitive impairments such as unilateral neglect are of particular concern as they have&#xD;
      among the worst prognostic outcomes (Di Monaco et al., 2011; Narasimhalu et al., 2011).&#xD;
      Unilateral neglect, commonly observed after brain damage of the right posterior parietal&#xD;
      cortex, is most often associated with reduced awareness of visual or auditory stimuli&#xD;
      presented to the contralesional (left) side of space (Humphreys &amp; Riddoch, 2001),&#xD;
      particularly in the presence of competing stimuli on the ipsilesional (right) side (i.e.,&#xD;
      extinction) (Humphreys, Romani, Olson, Riddoch, &amp; Duncan, 1994). This can manifest as a&#xD;
      failure to cancel lines on one side of a page ('neglect'). In milder cases the patient can&#xD;
      detect a single stimulus on the contralesional side but fails to detect the same item when&#xD;
      another item is presented simultaneously on the ipsilesional side ('extinction'). Currently&#xD;
      there is no consensus about optimal training strategies to alleviate neglect and extinction,&#xD;
      therefore, it remains important to attempt to develop new procedures that are effective in&#xD;
      the medium to long-term, that generalise outside the clinic and that are clinically&#xD;
      applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multisensory integration is a potentially important vehicle for neurorehabilitation because&#xD;
      it is known to generate large facilitative effects on information processing across a wide&#xD;
      range of individuals. For example, motor reaction times (RTs) are significantly faster&#xD;
      (Barutchu, Crewther, &amp; Crewther, 2009; Barutchu, Freestone, Innes-Brown, Crewther, &amp;&#xD;
      Crewther, 2013), and perceptual sensitivities (Stein, London, Wilkinson, &amp; Price, 1996),&#xD;
      working memory and learning (e.g., Shams &amp; Seitz, 2008), are enhanced in response to&#xD;
      spatially and temporally synchronous multisensory stimuli when compared with stimuli&#xD;
      presented in a single sensory modality. In addition, multisensory integration can be used to&#xD;
      compensate for unisensory decline in the elderly by restoring motor function to levels&#xD;
      generally observed in younger adults (e.g., Laurienti, Burdette, Maldjian, &amp; Wallace, 2006).&#xD;
      Critically, recent evidence suggests that some stroke patients in general may benefit from&#xD;
      early post-stroke rehabilitation (Bai et al., 2012), and that some stroke patients with&#xD;
      heminopia can benefit from multisensory integration (e.g., Passamonti, Bertini, &amp; Ladavas,&#xD;
      2009). These studies have also demonstrated that multisensory rehabilitation strategies can&#xD;
      have long lasting effects up to 1 year after initial training, and that improvements can&#xD;
      generalize to other daily activities, such as reading. However, it is unknown whether these&#xD;
      findings can be generalized to other types of perceptual and cognitive impairments. This&#xD;
      study will be the first to investigate the combined long-term effects of multisensory signals&#xD;
      and establish when is it more effective to intervene during the acute or chronic stage of the&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a novel approach to the remediation of neglect and&#xD;
      extinction by comparing multisensory integration with unisensory integration, and determining&#xD;
      whether it is best to intervene during the acute or chronic stage of the disorder. In&#xD;
      addition, the project will investigate the neural underpinning of functional recovery in&#xD;
      neglect patients, using fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this research project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if perception can be improved in stroke patients with unilateral&#xD;
           neglect/extinction as a result of multi- or uni-sensory integration, how well training&#xD;
           effects generalize to other tasks and their longevity when the rehabilitation is&#xD;
           delivered in the acute stage vs. the chronic stage of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), adaptive changes and&#xD;
           plasticity in brain networks following multisensory learning in patients with&#xD;
           neglect/extinction, so that an understanding is gained of the neural mechanisms linked&#xD;
           to functional recovery in neglect/extinction patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised control design, comparing individuals who will receive visual unisensory&#xD;
      stimulation alone (i.e., the control rehabilitation) and those who receive multisensory&#xD;
      stimulation (i.e., the experimental rehabilitation), will be used to assess the effects of&#xD;
      multisensory rehabilitation on learning, performance accuracy and speed in participants with&#xD;
      neglect/extinction. Participants with neglect/extinction will be recruited between 2 days - 2&#xD;
      months post stroke and randomly allocated into one of 4 groups: 2 stages post-stroke (acute&#xD;
      vs. chronic) x 2 rehabilitation types (unisensory vs. multisensory) (~20 participants per&#xD;
      group). Search and memory tasks will be developed where participants are presented with only&#xD;
      visual stimuli (e.g., objects - unisensory stimulation groups) or both visual stimuli and&#xD;
      sounds (multisensory stimulation groups). Participants will be presented with the stimuli and&#xD;
      asked to detect or remember the objects or their locations. Participant will have the option&#xD;
      of responding verbally or by pressing a button. Task will begin at an easy level (e.g., one&#xD;
      object being presented at a time) and gradually increase in difficulty as participant&#xD;
      performance improves (e.g., by increasing the number objects to be detected or remembered).&#xD;
      All participants will be subjected to 2 weeks of unisensory or multisensory rehabilitation (6&#xD;
      sessions approximately every second day). The rate of improvement across sessions will be&#xD;
      measured in order to judge the best training 'dose' to use in future clinical settings. To&#xD;
      gauge recovery, and its generalisation across other cognitive processes, and its long-term&#xD;
      carry over effects, participants will be assessed using the Birmingham Cognitive Screen&#xD;
      (BCoS) and the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS)(Humphreys, Bickerton, Samson, &amp; Riddoch, 2012)&#xD;
      before and at 1- and 6-months post rehabilitation. The investigators will also include&#xD;
      measures of functional outcome (e.g., Stroke Impact Scale - SIS, and the Nottingham Extended&#xD;
      ADL test) and measures of quality of life QoL (for the participant and carer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study (screening phase), all participants will be screened to assess&#xD;
      their eligibility for the study and fMRI. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the rehabilitation program (study phase). Only participants who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria for fMRI will be invited to have their brain scanned in study&#xD;
      phase before the rehabilitation and 1-month post rehabilitation. For the fMRI scan, T1, Flair&#xD;
      and DTI will be recorded and a simple detection task with auditory and visual stimuli will be&#xD;
      used to measure functional activity to unilateral and bilateral stimulus presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known potential risks of the study, other than the well known contra-indication&#xD;
      for MRI for participants who are invited to have their brain scanned, and the inconvenience&#xD;
      of attending up to nine sessions: one at screening phase, six during the study phase, and two&#xD;
      follow-up sessions at 1 month and 6 months following the completion of the 6th session in the&#xD;
      study phase.&#xD;
