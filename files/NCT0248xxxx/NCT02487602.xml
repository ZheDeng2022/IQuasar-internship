  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the gastrointestinal behaviour of a novel weight loss&#xD;
      device in vivo to further understand the device's mechanism of action in aiding weight loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gelesis100 is a new, experimental medical device which has been developed by Gelesis, Inc. to&#xD;
      aid weight loss in overweight/obese patients by reducing the amount of food required to make&#xD;
      them feel full. The device is contained in a capsule which is swallowed with water before a&#xD;
      meal. Once swallowed, the capsule dissolves and the capsule contents hydrate and mix with the&#xD;
      food in the stomach, creating a feeling of fullness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different treatments of up to 5 capsules each will be given to participants during this&#xD;
      study. These will be a mixture of the Gelesis100 capsules and capsules which do not contain&#xD;
      the device i.e., they are placebo (will contain sucrose [sugar])&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to look at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time it takes for the stomach to empty once receiving each treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time it takes for food and Gelesis100 to travel through the intestine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of Gelesis100 on the feeling of satiety (how full participants feel)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to monitor gastrointestinal behavior, either a small amount of radioactive material&#xD;
      will be added to a component of a standard lunch or to the water given with the treatment.&#xD;
      The radiation emitted will then be detected as it travels through the GI tract by taking&#xD;
      images using a device known as a gamma camera. The procedure is relatively easy and non-&#xD;
      invasive.&#xD;
