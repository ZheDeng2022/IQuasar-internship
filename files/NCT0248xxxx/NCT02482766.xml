      The primary hypothesis of this study is reduction in need of mechanical ventilation in the&#xD;
      first 72 hours of life (excluding the transient tracheal intubation performed for surfactant&#xD;
      administration and the mechanical ventilation for lung recruitment) in spontaneously&#xD;
      breathing infants born at 24+0-27+6 weeks' gestation and failing nCPAP during the first 24&#xD;
      hours of life who received an HFOV recruitment maneuver (IN-REC-SUR-E) compared to no&#xD;
      recruitment maneuver (IN-SUR-E) just prior to surfactant administration followed by prompt&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;

      EFFICACY OF A NEW TECHNIQUE -&quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot;- IN PRETERM NEONATES WITH RESPIRATORY DISTRESS&#xD;
      SYNDROME DURING NON INVASIVE VENTILATION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND The initial stabilization on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and&#xD;
      provision of rescue surfactant only when necessary is at least as beneficial and quite&#xD;
      possibly preferred over the standard therapy of intubation of all infants at risk in the&#xD;
      delivery room and subsequent support with mechanical ventilation (2-4). The percentage of&#xD;
      CPAP failure in the newborns of 25-28 weeks' gestation is 45 % (30/66) in the Australian&#xD;
      experience (5), higher than that reported by Ammari et al. (25 %) (6) and similar to that&#xD;
      reported by De Jaegere et al. (50 %) (7) and in the COIN trial (46 %) (2). As a potential&#xD;
      alternative, the INSURE (INtubate, SURfactant, Extubate) approach (8) is very attractive.&#xD;
      Recently, several studies have investigated the effectiveness of the association between&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation and surfactant, administered by transient intubation (INSURE),&#xD;
      showing that it is effective in preventing the need for mechanical ventilation. Although&#xD;
      beneficial in clinical practice, the INSURE method cannot be universally applied to all&#xD;
      preterm neonates with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and is unsuccessful in a particular&#xD;
      section of this population. The INSURE failure rate recently reported in preterm infants of&#xD;
      different gestational age widely ranges from 19 % to 69 % (10, 11). Unfortunately, no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have directly evaluated the efficacy of INSURE in extremely&#xD;
      preterm neonates (&lt;28 weeks gestation) (8). Nevertheless, the data of the &quot;Sustained Lung&#xD;
      Inflation (SLI) study&quot; (14) recently conducted on infants with GA 25+0- 28+6 weeks showed&#xD;
      that nasal CPAP failure and need for Mechanical Ventilation (MV) at 72 hours of life was 53 %&#xD;
      in the SLI group and 65 % in the control group (only nasal CPAP). In this study surfactant&#xD;
      was preferably administered with the INSURE approach at a Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2)&#xD;
      threshold of 0.40 and then it could be reasonably argued that at least 50 % of 25-28 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation infants, even if receiving a SLI maneuver and the INSURE treatment for CPAP&#xD;
      failure, undergoes mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours of life for unsuccessful&#xD;
      INSURE. One of the possible mechanisms responsible for the unsuccessful INSURE, requiring&#xD;
      subsequent re-intubation and mechanical ventilation is the inability of the preterm lung with&#xD;
      RDS of achieving and maintaining an &quot;optimal&quot; Functional Residual Capacity (FRC).&#xD;
      Prophylactic or early rescue surfactant administration before alveolar recruitment probably&#xD;
      results in an uneven surfactant distribution to already open alveoli thus resulting in poor&#xD;
      clinical response to the first surfactant treatment. We, therefore, seek to compare the&#xD;
      application of a recruitment manoeuver - in High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation (HFOV)&#xD;
      modality - just before the surfactant administration, followed by rapid extubation&#xD;
      (INtubate-RECruited-SURfactant-Extubation: IN-REC-SUR-E) with INSURE alone in spontaneously&#xD;
      breathing preterm infants requiring nasal CPAP as initial respiratory support and reaching&#xD;
      pre-defined CPAP failure criteria, for evaluating its effectiveness in decreasing the need of&#xD;
      MV and improving respiratory outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This will be an unblinded multi-center randomized trial of IN-REC-SUR-E vs.&#xD;
      IN-SUR-E in infants born at 24+0-27+6 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The investigators hypothesized that a recruitment manoeuver (in HFOV modality)&#xD;
      before surfactant administration might decrease of the need of subsequent mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation during the first 72 hours of life from 50 % (2, 5, 7) to 30 %. The investigators&#xD;
      calculated that 103 newborns must be enrolled in each group to detect this difference as&#xD;
      statistically significant with 80 % power at 0.05 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Infants at each unit will be block (1st block: gestational age from 24+0 to&#xD;
      25+6 weeks; 2nd block: gestational age from 26+0 to 27+6 weeks) randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      treatment group using automatically generated sealed envelopes which will be prepared at&#xD;
      Policlinico A. Gemelli Hospital in Rome and then distributed to participating centers.&#xD;
      Permutated block randomization with 1:1 randomization between the two arms will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The study will not be blinded, and the staff performing the study also will take&#xD;
      care of the infants later on. However, the decision to start mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      made by clinicians other than the investigators and, moreover, parents, nurses involved in&#xD;
      patient care and researchers assessing study end-points will be blinded to the nature of the&#xD;
      study treatments. To minimize bias, strict criteria and definitions will be maintained during&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management in the Delivery Room Positive pressure with a neonatal mask and a T-piece system&#xD;
      (Neopuff Infant Resuscitator, Fisher and Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand) will be used to&#xD;
      stabilize newborns after birth. All the neonates will receive one (or two) SLI manoeuver(s)&#xD;
      (25 cmH2O for 10-15 seconds) (14) and will be transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (NICU) in nasal CPAP (6 cmH2O). Infants will start mechanical ventilation in agreement with&#xD;
      the American Academy of Paediatrics guidelines on neonatal resuscitation (16). In this latter&#xD;
      case the babies will be excluded from the study (see exclusion criteria section, page 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP Failure Criteria In the NICU, nasal CPAP will be given through nasal prongs/mask using&#xD;
      the standard method of the single centre (ventilator, flow-dependent system) with an initial&#xD;
      pressure of 6 to 7 cmH2O, in all infants. CPAP failure is defined if they met any of the&#xD;
      following criteria: FiO2 ≥ 0.30 on nasal CPAP (17) to maintain pulse oximetry (SpO2) 87-94&#xD;
      %(18) for at least 30 minutes unless rapid clinical deterioration occurred, respiratory&#xD;
      acidosis defined as pCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg (8.5 kPa) and pH &lt; 7.20 on arterial or capillary blood gas&#xD;
      sample, apnea defined as &gt;4 episodes of apnea per hour or &gt;2 episodes of apnea per hour when&#xD;
      ventilation with bag and mask will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFOV Recruitment manoeuver Infants in the IN-REC-SUR-E group will undergo the following&#xD;
      approach: after intubation, HFOV will be delivered with the ventilator available in each&#xD;
      NICU. The following initial ventilator setting will be advocated: Continuous Distending&#xD;
      Pressure (CDP): 8cmH2O; Frequency: 10-15 Hz; Delta P: 15 cmH2O or Amplitude 30 % eventually&#xD;
      increased - chest to be &quot;visibly vibrating &quot;-; I:E 1:2. Delta P (or amplitude) first and/or&#xD;
      frequency subsequently will be adjusted to achieve a Tidal Volume (VT) of 1,5-2 ml/kg and/or&#xD;
      to maintain the transcutaneous partial carbon dioxide pressure (TcPCO2) between 40 and 60&#xD;
      mmHg (5.3 and 8.0 kPa). The infants will be subjected to an open lung ventilation strategy&#xD;
      aiming to recruit and stabilize the majority of collapsed alveoli/sacculi, using oxygenation&#xD;
      as an indirect parameter for lung volume. Optimal recruitment is defined as adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation using a FiO2 of 0.25 or less. Starting at 8 cmH2O, the CDP will be increased&#xD;
      stepwise (2 cmH2O every 2-3 minutes) as long as SpO2 improves. The FiO2 will be reduced&#xD;
      stepwise, keeping SpO2 within the target range (87-94 %). The recruitment procedure will be&#xD;
      stopped if oxygenation no longer improves or if the FiO2 is equal to or less than 0.25. The&#xD;
      corresponding CDP will be called the opening pressure (CDPO). Next, the CDP will be reduced&#xD;
      stepwise (1-2 cmH2O every 2-3 minutes) until the SpO2 deteriorates (of at least 2-3 points).&#xD;
      The corresponding CDP will be called the closing pressure (CDPC). After a second recruitment&#xD;
      manoeuver at CDPO for 2 minutes, the optimal CDP (CDPOPT) will be set 2 cmH2O above the CDPC&#xD;
      for at least 3 minutes (19). A chest radiograph at this point is advised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surfactant Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the IN-REC-SUR-E arm will undergo the following approach: as soon as possible&#xD;
      after the recruitment manoeuver (at CDPOPT) a dose of poractant alfa (Curosurf [Chiesi&#xD;
      Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy]) of 200 mg/kg will be administered via a closed administration&#xD;
      system in one-two aliquots (1-2 minutes). The tube position will be confirmed by&#xD;
      auscultation. A temporary reduction of frequency may be necessary to increase the VT up to&#xD;
      2.5 ml/kg for improving the surfactant spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the IN-SUR-E arm will undergo the following approach: after intubation, a dose of&#xD;
      poractant alfa (Curosurf [Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy]) of 200 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      administered via a closed administration system in one-two aliquots (1-2 minutes). The tube&#xD;
      position will be confirmed by auscultation. During surfactant administration, infants will be&#xD;
      manually ventilated to facilitate surfactant distribution. If necessary, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20-22 cmH2O, a Positive End-Expiratory&#xD;
      Pressure (PEEP) of 5-6 cmH2O and a respiratory rate of 30-40 breaths/min will be subsequently&#xD;
      started to achieve a VT of 4-6 ml/kg and/or to maintain the transcutaneous partial carbon&#xD;
      dioxide pressure (TcPCO2) between 40 and 60 mmHg (5.3 and 8.0 kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surfactant administration, the babies of both groups will be extubated within 30&#xD;
      minutes (if satisfactory respiratory drive is present) and will receive nasal CPAP (6-8&#xD;
      cmH2O) (20). In case of insufficient respiratory drive, CDP (in the babies of IN-REC-SUR-E&#xD;
      arm) or PIP (in the IN-SUR-E arm) will be reduced until spontaneous respiratory activity is&#xD;
      restored. Maintaining a FiO2 &lt; 0.30 to obtain SpO2 values in the desired range (87-94 %) will&#xD;
      drive the eventual reduction in the level of CPAP in the following days. The decision as to&#xD;
      whether to begin Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) or nasal-Intermittent Mandatory&#xD;
      Ventilation (N-IMV) to prevent the need for re-intubation in infants of both groups will be&#xD;
      up to the neonatologist on duty, and will be considered in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants of both groups can receive a subsequent dose of surfactant (100 mg/kg of poractant&#xD;
      alfa) using the same method (INSURE or INRECSURE) if they meet the CPAP failure criteria&#xD;
      again during the following 12 to 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All collected data can be obtained from the clinical records. They will be&#xD;
      reported in electronic data sheets designed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on an intention to treat&#xD;
      basis. Clinical characteristics of infants in the &quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot; and &quot;IN-SUR-E&quot; groups will&#xD;
      be described using mean values and standard deviation, median value and range, or rate and&#xD;
      percentage. Univariate statistical analysis will be performed using the Student &quot;t&quot; test for&#xD;
      parametric continuous variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-parametric continuous&#xD;
      variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. Then, &quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot; treatment and clinical characteristics which&#xD;
      are most likely associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (gestational age, birth&#xD;
      weight, antenatal steroids, CRIB score) will be included in multiple logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis to assess their independent role in predicting &quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot; success or failure.&#xD;
      Effect estimates will be expressed as relative risk (RR) with profile likelihood-based 95 %&#xD;
      confidence limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis is planned when 50 infants will be enrolled in each arm. Duration of&#xD;
      study: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES Compliance to protocol Compliance will be&#xD;
      defined as full adherence to protocol. Compliance with the protocol will be ensured by a&#xD;
      number of procedures as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site set-up Local principal investigators are required to participate in preparatory meetings&#xD;
      in which details of study protocol, data collection, &quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot; and &quot;IN-SUR-E&quot; procedures&#xD;
      will be accurately discussed. All centers will receive detailed written instruction on web&#xD;
      based data recording, and, to solve possible difficulties, it will be possible to contact the&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Coordinating Center. Moreover, it has been ascertained that &quot;IN-REC-SUR-E&quot;&#xD;
      procedure is followed similarly in all participating centers.&#xD;
