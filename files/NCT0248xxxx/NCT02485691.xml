      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) [using Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for tumor lesions and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2&#xD;
      (PCWG2) criteria for bone scan lesions or death due to any cause] with chemotherapy&#xD;
      (cabazitaxel plus prednisone, Arm A) versus Androgen Receptor (AR)-targeted therapy&#xD;
      (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, Arm B) in mCRPC patients who have been&#xD;
      treated with docetaxel and who had disease progression while receiving AR-targeted therapy&#xD;
      within 12 months of AR treatment initiation (≤12 months, either before or after docetaxel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare efficacy for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and time to PSA progression (TTPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor response rate and duration of tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain response and time to pain progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health status and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation of a signature of resistance to AR-targeted agents with&#xD;
           clinical outcome via the analysis of circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes as well as&#xD;
           expression and localization of proteins including AR isoforms in CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of the study per patient will be approximately 2 years. Each patient will be&#xD;
      treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal&#xD;
      of further study treatment, and each patient will be followed after completion of study&#xD;
      treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of patient consent.&#xD;
