      The purpose of the study is to address the following hypotheses: (i) Anti-PD-L1 therapy with&#xD;
      MEDI4736 administered concomitantly with weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by MEDI4736&#xD;
      concomitant with ddAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy will induce higher pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) rate (&gt;55%) in triple negative breast cancer than historical pCR rates&#xD;
      (30-40%) observed with chemotherapy alone. (ii) MEDI4736 can be safely co-administered at&#xD;
      full dose with sequential with nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) and ddAC (60 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of the Phase I portion of the trial is to assess the safety of MEDI4736&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and determine if full dose of MEDI4736 can be administered&#xD;
      concomitantly with full dose weekly nab-paclitaxel followed by dose-dense AC chemotherapies,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase II portion of the study is to estimate the pCR rate with&#xD;
      MEDI4736 in combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel x 12 treatments followed by MEDI4736 in&#xD;
      combination with ddAC x 4 treatments for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)&#xD;
      and HER2 negative (triple negative, TNBC), clinical stage I-III breast cancer. Pathologic&#xD;
      complete response is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and&#xD;
      eosin evaluation of the resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes&#xD;
      following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e. ypT0/Tis ypN0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include: to assess the safety and toxicity of adding anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      antibody, MEDI4736 to standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the Phase II portion of&#xD;
      the trial. The study will also monitor for events of special clinical interest with a&#xD;
      suspected auto-immunologic etiology including grade â‰¥3 colitis, hyperthyroidism,&#xD;
      hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, rash and anti-drug-antibody (ADA) immune complex&#xD;
      disease (manifested by symptoms of arthralgias, abdominal pain, back pain, and vasculitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives include: to assess correlation between response to therapy and immune&#xD;
      parameters of the tumor at baseline and post-treatment in patients who have residual cancer&#xD;
      after therapy.&#xD;
