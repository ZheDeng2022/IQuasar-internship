    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate that functional improvement measures over a 6-month period for&#xD;
      chronic low back patients under the care of Primary Care Provider (PCP), using a therapeutic&#xD;
      plan formulated initially by the Pain Medicine Specialist (PMS), are equivalent to those&#xD;
      under the care of the PMS only. Chronic low back pain patient will be initially be evaluated&#xD;
      by the PMS. If no interventional pain therapy is required, a multimodal therapeutic plan&#xD;
      (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) will be formulated to manage the chronic low&#xD;
      back pain. Patients will be randomized into one of the two groups: Group 1 - Subjects will be&#xD;
      treated monthly for the following 6 months by PMS, and Group 2 - Subjects will be treated by&#xD;
      their own PCP for monthly visits for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, each chronic low back pain patient presenting to the Rush University Pain&#xD;
      Center will initially be evaluated by the PMS.The initial evaluation visit, as part of the&#xD;
      routine care for all new low back patients, will include the following: a full physical&#xD;
      examination, review of medical health and medication history, and radiological imaging (EHR&#xD;
      will be used for the study). In addition, all new patients will need to provide a urine drug&#xD;
      screening test and will need to undergo psychological testing and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A determination will be made by the PMS on whether the best treatment modality includes an&#xD;
      interventional approach or non-interventional. If no interventional pain therapy is required,&#xD;
      a multimodal therapeutic plan (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) will be formulated&#xD;
      to manage the chronic low back pain. A complete workup will be performed to accomplish this&#xD;
      task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a non-interventional treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) is selected, that&#xD;
      can be implemented by a PCP, the patients will be informed of the study, and if interested, a&#xD;
      Prescreening Informed Consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
      form will be obtained from patient to give permission to contact their PCP. At that point,&#xD;
      the patients' PCPs will be contacted, presented with the study information, and asked if they&#xD;
      want to participate in the study. If the PCP agrees, the Main Study Informed Consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patient. Patients meeting criteria would then be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups for continued treatment over the next 6 months. This initial multimodal&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment can be altered by the respective treatment groups (PMS or PCP) to which&#xD;
      study subject has been randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (PMS treatment): Subjects will continue to be followed for the next 6 months by the&#xD;
      PMS (typically every month for the treatment of chronic pain) per standard protocol. The PCP&#xD;
      will not be involved in the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (PCP treatment): Subjects will be followed by the PCP for the next 6 months. The PCP&#xD;
      will be involved using EHR and a multimodal therapeutic strategy will be communicated to the&#xD;
      PCP by the PMS. The PCP will make dosage based on an algorithm provided by the PMS on how to&#xD;
      adjust drug doses over time (general template-See below). It is not intended that the PCP may&#xD;
      have ongoing engagement with the PMS. While the PCP may request clarification by the PMS&#xD;
      during the first week of subject treatment, any further contact between the PCP and the PMS&#xD;
      would result in the subjects being withdrawn from the study. In addition, a direct line of&#xD;
      communication will be set up between the PCP and the data integration clinical coordinator to&#xD;
      handle serious medical concerns. In case of serious medical events, the subject will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and appropriate medical care will be provided by the PMS or PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 &amp; 2: Subjects in both groups will undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Urine drug screening test (qualitative); includes amphetamines, barbiturates,&#xD;
           benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, ethanol, and opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Receive a sample copy of an opioid contract/agreement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PMS will query the Illinois prescription monitoring program for that patient to&#xD;
           determine the various health care providers who are prescribing narcotics or other&#xD;
           controlled medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Undergo a psychological test and evaluation by the Rush University Pain Center&#xD;
           psychologist (including the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with&#xD;
           Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R)13), to determine risk of drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Template for treatment of low back pain to be provided for PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This template is only a suggestion, and clinical and medical judgment for each patient will&#xD;
      be decided by the PMS. Listed are the categories of pharmacological and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      modalities, but the PMS will formulate a patient-specific prescriptive plan after evaluation&#xD;
      at the initial work-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): preferably COX-2 inhibitor for all&#xD;
           patients. If NSAIDs are prescribed, GI prophylaxis needs to be provided.14,15 This would&#xD;
           be prescribed to all patients and will be provided daily and not 'as needed' medication,&#xD;
           unless there are adverse events that prevent its administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle relaxants: such pharmacological agents include baclofen, tizanidine, or lorazepam&#xD;
           to relieve painful muscle spasms16&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Opioids: long-acting opioids (oxycodone, controlled- release), short-acting opioids&#xD;
           (e.g. hydrocodone/acetaminophen)14,15,17&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticonvulsants: mainly gabapentin or pregabalin18&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit19 At the end of the 6-month&#xD;
           treatment period (end of study), patients will be given the option to continue the&#xD;
           treatment with their group or changing to any other treatment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research study nurse, blinded to group allocation, will call patients (from both groups)&#xD;
      every month to collect BPI questionnaire responses over the phone. In addition, a general&#xD;
      measure of functional health and well-being, the SF-36 health-related quality of life outcome&#xD;
      measure (Short-Form 36 Health Survey), will be collected during the same call.21 The SF-36&#xD;
      total score can be used as an overall health measure, or as a measure of two different health&#xD;
      domains: physical health (including bodily pain) and mental health, as well as further&#xD;
      division into more specific subscales. A baseline BPI and SF-36 will be obtained from each&#xD;
      subject's initial visit record (EHR). The research study nurse will enter data obtained from&#xD;
      the phone calls directly into the Rush University Pain Centers (RUPC) EHR on the&#xD;
      eClinicalWorks platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate procedural variations, side effects and secondary outcomes over the 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up treatment period, a data integration clinical coordinator (DICC), not blinded to&#xD;
      group allocation, will query electronic and physical health records, from both the PCP and&#xD;
      PMS, as well as corresponding HIS's.&#xD;
