      Two Intensive Life Style Intervention Programs in Related Caregivers of Preschool Children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substantial strides have been made in the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions, such&#xD;
      as myocardial infarction and stroke, however, the global burden of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) continues to rise at an alarming rate. Furthermore, despite the abundant data&#xD;
      demonstrating a greater burden of CVD in racial/ethnic minorities, and many specific&#xD;
      interventions aimed at changing risk factor patterns or behaviors in racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minorities, health disparities persist. In the present study, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a multifaceted and comprehensive lifestyle intervention coupled with&#xD;
      atherosclerosis imaging on reducing cardiovascular risk among minority adults living in&#xD;
      Harlem, New York. The investigators believe that holistic, multi-dimensional individual and&#xD;
      peer-to-peer intensive lifestyle interventions involving parents/caregivers of preschool&#xD;
      children will be effective in producing favorable change in their behaviors, which will be&#xD;
      sustained over time. The primary hypothesis of the study is that aggressive lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions will be more effective in improving healthy behaviors and biological correlates&#xD;
      in at-risk adult parents and/or caregivers of preschool children in Harlem, NY. In aim 1, as&#xD;
      an initial pilot study, the investigators will identify the contextual factors, facilitators&#xD;
      and barriers that may impact the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for&#xD;
      adults in Harlem, using qualitative research methods. In aim 2, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine the impact of two intensive lifestyle interventions on promoting and improving&#xD;
      healthy behaviors and biological parameters to lower cardiovascular risk, the impact of the&#xD;
      knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors and the impact of these&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk&#xD;
      adults. Finally, in aim 3, the investigators will evaluate the sustainability of the impact&#xD;
      of the two intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after the intervention program ends.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim 1 - Pilot: To identify the contextual factors, facilitators and barriers that may impact&#xD;
      the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for adults in Harlem, using&#xD;
      qualitative research methods: 1) focus group discussions among a representative cohort of&#xD;
      adults; 2) focus group discussions among community leaders; and 3) Pilot studies of&#xD;
      feasibility of interventions in the representative cohort of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsidiary Aim 1.1: To use identified facilitators and barriers to develop a contextually and&#xD;
      culturally appropriate model for an adult lifestyle intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsidiary Aim 1.2: To implement a pilot intervention of the contextually and culturally&#xD;
      adapted program among a sample of parents/caregivers of children in preschools in Harlem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess for acceptability and feasibility, and make any necessary&#xD;
      modifications prior to the implementation of the cluster-randomized trial. This aim will be&#xD;
      carried out at 2 preschools in Harlem, NY by including the parents and caregivers of&#xD;
      pre-school children. The final intervention program that results from this&#xD;
      intervention-mapping program will be piloted in parent groups of 8-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Randomization: To determine (i) the impact of two intensive lifestyle interventions&#xD;
      on promoting and improving healthy behaviors (increased physical activity, smoking cessation&#xD;
      etc.) and biological parameters (lipids, sugar) to lower cardiovascular risk, (ii) the impact&#xD;
      of the presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors and (iii) the impact of the lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a greater&#xD;
      improvement in healthy behaviors and biological parameters compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis as defined by three-dimensional vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound will lead to greater improvement in healthy behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a lesser&#xD;
      progression or regression of three-dimensional vascular ultrasound quantified atherosclerosis&#xD;
      compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this aim, the investigators will recruit parents and caregivers of pre-school children&#xD;
      from up to twenty schools in Harlem, NY and perform a 3:2 (3 intervention, 2 control) cluster&#xD;
      randomization of the schools. Those schools in the &quot;intensive intervention&quot; group will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two interventions- an Intensive Individual Intervention Program&quot;&#xD;
      (IIIP) developed through the intervention mapping program described in aim 1 or 'Peer-To-Peer&#xD;
      Program - Intervention&quot; (PPPI), refined during that same pilot phase. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be a composite score consisting of a 0-3 scale for behaviors/outcomes related to Blood&#xD;
      pressure, Exercise, Weight, Alimentation (diet) and Tobacco (smoking) [Fuster-BEWAT score].&#xD;
      Primary assessments will be performed at baseline, at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      (approximately 12 months, peak effect), and at approximately 24 months (sustainability). The&#xD;
      12 month assessment will be used to calculate the between group difference for the change in&#xD;
      the Fuster-BEWAT score and will be the primary outcome measure for the adults. To evaluate&#xD;
      the sustainability of the impact of the two intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy&#xD;
      behaviors and biological parameters 12 months after the intervention program ends. For the&#xD;
      assessment of secondary outcome measures, participants will undergo point of care testing for&#xD;
      a lipid panel and blood sugar assessment, and a three-dimensional vascular ultrasound&#xD;
      (carotid, ileo-femoral) to assess for presence and extent of atherosclerosis at baseline and&#xD;
      after the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected from all adults who provide consent at enrollment and at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention period. Blood from adults will be used to isolate DNA and plasma. In&#xD;
      addition, by in vitro culture of blood-derived mononuclear cells, we will derive macrophages,&#xD;
      which will then be driven to become foam cells. RNA will be isolated from pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention blood samples. Genomic data obtained from adult blood samples will be&#xD;
      integrated with data obtained from saliva in children to identify network models and&#xD;
      predictors of primary prevention outcomes. Also, RNA data will be integrated to identify the&#xD;
      genetic, genomic and molecular signature of favorable vs. poor responders to lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention; and to identify novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets in network models of&#xD;
      early atherothrombotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 - Sustainability: To evaluate the sustainability of the impact of the two intensive&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters approximately 12&#xD;
      months after the intervention program ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Adult caregivers receiving the intensive lifestyle approaches program, will&#xD;
      maintain sustainability with an advantage of the two &quot;Intensive Interventional groups&quot; over&#xD;
      the control &quot;Traditional Health Education&quot; group. All participants will be followed for&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after the end of the intervention period and reassess their&#xD;
      Fuster-BEWAT Score.&#xD;
