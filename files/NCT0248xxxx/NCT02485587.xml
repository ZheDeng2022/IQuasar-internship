    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individualized biofeedback of arousal (skin&#xD;
      conductance) is effective in the treatment of aggressive behavior problems in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with either predominantly impulsive (reactive) and/or high callous unemotional&#xD;
      traits (proactive) subtypes of aggression when compared to treatment as usual (TAU), and&#xD;
      induces normalization when compared to a group of typically developing children receiving no&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      In this study, which is part of the EC FP7 projects Aggressotype&#xD;
      (FP7-Health-2013-Innovation-1 602805, Aggression subtyping for improved insight and treatment&#xD;
      innovation in psychiatric disorders), the investigators focus on the testing of an&#xD;
      innovative, non-pharmacological therapeutic approach for children and adolescents with&#xD;
      different subtypes of aggressive behavior problems. Participants will be trained to acquire&#xD;
      control over their arousal as measured by skin conductance/electrodermal activity. As&#xD;
      aggressive behavior involves a dysregulation of arousal at rest and in response to emotional&#xD;
      stimuli (lower electrodermal activity and heart rate, differences in EEG), the individualized&#xD;
      acquisition of self-control over ones arousal level might represent a promising therapeutic&#xD;
      approach for this kind of disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While trying to control their arousal level, participants receive direct continuous feedback&#xD;
      about their physiological state and its changes, and are rewarded for successful&#xD;
      manipulation, i.e. up- or downregulation. During transfer trials continuous feedback is&#xD;
      omitted. Biofeedback methods are currently used to treat patients with a variety of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders such as ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to focus on the following questions concerning the effectiveness&#xD;
      of this treatment approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can participants gain increasing control over their arousal level through biofeedback&#xD;
           training of electrodermal activity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Which short- and longer term consequences can be expected from improved self-control&#xD;
           over physiological measures of arousal upon aggressive and antisocial behavior problems?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the training, all subjects will undergo an extensive pre-treatment assessment as part&#xD;
      of the characterization and subtyping of aggression within the large multicenter subtyping&#xD;
      studies (EU-Aggressotype and EU-MATRICS). The assessment includes clinical and psychometric&#xD;
      measures, neuropsychological testing, fMRI (3 tasks + resting state), MRS (2 voxels) and DTI&#xD;
      as well as biosampling (blood/saliva for genetics/epigenetics/hormones). Comparison with a&#xD;
      typically developing (TD) control group receiving no intervention will allow to interpret&#xD;
      changes in terms of normalisation or compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of this pretest, subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      arousal-biofeedback treatment study will be randomly assigned to two different treatment&#xD;
      arms, either to the experimental arousal feedback condition or to the comparator condition&#xD;
      with TAU lasting about 20 weeks. Subjects assigned to the experimental condition will receive&#xD;
      20 sessions (1/week) of arousal (electrodermal activity)-feedback, learning to either in- or&#xD;
      decrease levels of electrodermal activity. At the beginning of the first treatment session, a&#xD;
      baseline assessment of arousal measures will be done in order to determine the arousal&#xD;
      subtype of the participants (hypo- or hyperarousal), and the main direction of individualized&#xD;
      training (up- or downregulation). Afterwards, each training will last about 1 hour and&#xD;
      consist of several experimental blocks, including feedback as well as transfer trials with&#xD;
      EEG and heart rate recorded simultaneously during the sessions. Video clips of emotional and&#xD;
      aggressive situations will be used to support regulation of arousal. During the first 10&#xD;
      sessions, all participants will be asked to increase/decrease their electrodermal activity in&#xD;
      a proportion of about 2:1 depending on the dominant arousal subtype, in order to train mainly&#xD;
      upregulation in patients with hypoarousal, and downregulation in patients with hyperarousal.&#xD;
      Subjects in the comparator TAU arm will receive several sessions of psychoeducation and&#xD;
      counseling with their parents/caregivers or group training over the 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 10 sessions of feedback training (or several appointments with their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers or group trainings in the TAU group) approximately 10 weeks after the&#xD;
      beginning of the training, parents/caregivers will be asked to shortly evaluate behavioral&#xD;
      measures of aggressive behavior by filling out the MOAS. In the feedback group arousal&#xD;
      measures will be reassessed as done at the beginning of the first training to assess&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of either the training or the TAU, subjects will undergo post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment including again the same teachers and parents reports on behavioral measures, as&#xD;
      well as the neuropsychological testing, fMRI and MRS. A follow-up assessment with parents and&#xD;
      teachers reports on behavioral measures only will take place 6 months after the end of the&#xD;
      treatment phase.&#xD;
