    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of conducting a larger cluster randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      facilitate the effectiveness of a complex Knowledge Translation (KT) intervention, i.e.&#xD;
      implementation of multimodal care, into chiropractic clinical practice, designed to improve&#xD;
      the management of patients with Non-Specific Neck Pain (NSNP) disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate feasibility, the investigators will ascertain how well participating&#xD;
      chiropractors and patients adhere to the study protocol and will solicit feedback from them&#xD;
      about the overall usefulness of the content and format of the KT intervention. This study&#xD;
      will determine planning for the main study and also the outcomes to be used as a primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study project is to determine the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      multifaceted KT intervention to promote the use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing&#xD;
      patients with NSNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Cluster randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial. Chiropractors in private&#xD;
      practice in Canada will be randomized to receive either a theory-based tailored KT&#xD;
      intervention in the experimental group or simply a printed copy of the guideline in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and sample size: 30 chiropractors will be recruited from a random,&#xD;
      nationally representative sample of 200 chiropractors. Each chiropractor will recruit five&#xD;
      neck pain patients for a total of 150 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the KT intervention was informed by the results of a related qualitative study&#xD;
      (Theoretical Domains Framework interviews) and consists of a series of three webinars, two&#xD;
      online case scenarios, a self-management video on Brief Action Planning (BAP) and a printed&#xD;
      copy of the practice guideline (Bussières et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary feasibility outcomes for both chiropractors and patients include rates of: 1)&#xD;
      recruitment, 2) study retention, and 3) adherence to the intervention (Tickle-Degnen, 2013).&#xD;
      A checklist of proxy measures embedded within patient encounter forms will be used to assess&#xD;
      chiropractors' compliance with guideline recommendations e.g., exercise and self-care&#xD;
      prescriptions, at study onset and at three months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include whether or not the chiropractor's recommended multimodal care,&#xD;
      scores on measures of behavioural constructs e.g., self-efficacy, knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary clinical outcomes for patients includes measures of pain intensity and neck&#xD;
      pain-specific disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses from this pilot study will focus on generating point estimates and corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for parameters of a priori interest (e.g., recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      adherence, pain intensity, neck disability index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The main strength of this study includes its use of a representative sample and&#xD;
      randomized controlled design. The results of this study will inform the design of a larger&#xD;
      cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at confirming the effectiveness and increasing the&#xD;
      use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing patients with NSNP.&#xD;

    <description>The main outcome of interest is feasibility that includes recruitment, retention, adherence to the study protocol and effectiveness potential.&#xD;
Recruitment rate include: 1) eligibility rate (number of eligible chiropractors and patients divided by invited chiropractors or patients) and 2) participation rate (number agreeing to participate divided by eligible chiropractors or patients).&#xD;
Retention rate: Number of chiropractors and patients who completed all outcome measures at baseline and at 3 month follow-up plus rate of completion of questionnaires by chiropractors (measures of behavioural constructs) and patients (clinical outcomes).&#xD;
For chiropractors, rate of adherence includes attendance of all 3 webinars, associated quizzes, 2 clinical vignettes and the self-management learning module; For patients, rate of adherence includes follow-up visits, prescribed home exercise and physical activity.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of three webinars followed by the quiz, two online case scenario and a video on BAP model plus a printed copy of Clinical Practice Guideline (CPGs) on NSNP.&#xD;
After completing these modules and learning the key strategies, each chiropractor will recruit five neck pain patients and implement the strategies on their patients to measure the clinical outcomes for a follow-up of three months.&#xD;
The control group will receive only a printed copy of CPGs. A checklist of proxy measures embedded within patient encounter forms will be used to assess chiropractors' compliance with guideline recommendations at study onset and at three months.</description>
