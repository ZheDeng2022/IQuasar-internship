  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iConquerMS™ is a research initiative developed by and for people with multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      to contribute their health data and ideas to advance and accelerate research into MS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a Multiple Sclerosis Patient-Powered Research Network&#xD;
      (MS-PPRN) that includes at least 20,000 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who contribute&#xD;
      data on their health and other topics. Survey data will be made available to research&#xD;
      scientists who are studying MS and similar diseases. Our goal is to use this data to answer&#xD;
      questions that researchers and people with MS have regarding the disease, including its&#xD;
      causes, treatments, and other topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MS-PPRN will be part of a national network for conducting research called PCORnet, the&#xD;
      National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. PCORnet is supported by the&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). As the MS-PPRN is part of PCORnet, the&#xD;
      data collected in surveys you complete may also be shared with researchers studying other&#xD;
      diseases within the PCORnet network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the MS-PPRN is focused on enrolling people with MS, people without MS are also welcome&#xD;
      to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted online via the iConquerMS.org website. This is an ongoing study&#xD;
      and will last for an indefinite period of time.&#xD;
