  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a consensus that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in preterm infants is&#xD;
      preferred over intubation. There are two ways of delivering NIV in preterm infants, nasal&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation (NIPPV), where ventilator inflations are delivered intermittently over a fixed&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure. The synchronization in conventional mode is very difficult to obtain&#xD;
      in premature infants. In all ventilation modes PEEP (end-expiratory pressure) is fixed.&#xD;
      Considering that preterm infants are more likely to develop atelectasis, an active and&#xD;
      ongoing management of the PEEP is very important to prevent de-recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new respiratory support system (NeuroPAP) was developed to address these issues&#xD;
      (synchronization problems and control the PEEP). It uses the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      diaphragm (EDI) to control the ventilator assist continuously, both during inspiration&#xD;
      (principle of NAVA mode) and also during expiration (based on tonic Edi level).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mode NeuroPAP will work with the continuous Edi-level and deliver pressures according to&#xD;
      the Edi-signal x set NeuroPAP-level, over the whole breath (inspiration and expiration). The&#xD;
      NeuroPAP will work between two pressure levels set by the user and named higher Pressure&#xD;
      limit (Plimit) and minimum Pressure (Pmin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A safety upper pressure limit (UPL) will also be set. A backup ventilation will be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific gastric tube equipped with an array of microelectrodes (Edi catheter, Maquet,&#xD;
      Solna, Sweden) will be installed after inclusion, by the same oral or nasal route as the tube&#xD;
      previously in place. Patients will then be ventilated in the 5 aforementioned conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On conventional NIPPV device on clinical settings for a 30 minute period. The&#xD;
           investigators will note the mean airway pressure being delivered with the clinical&#xD;
           settings and the resulting peak Edi, as well as neural respiratory rate, tonic Edi,&#xD;
           Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With NeuroPAP without modification of Pmin (=peep). The exchange of the nasal interface&#xD;
           may be necessary, depending on the original interface. FiO2 will initially be the same&#xD;
           as previously set in conventional NIPPV. The Pmin will initially be set at the level of&#xD;
           PEEP used during conventional NIPPV. A titration maneuver will be conducted to identify&#xD;
           the optimal NeuroPAP level. The infant will be ventilated for one hour. Clinical&#xD;
           adjustments in pressures and FiO2 are permitted. Safety termination will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NeuroPAP with adjusted Pmin: the Pmin in NeuroPAP will be reduced by 2 cm H2O, with the&#xD;
           same NeuroPAP level. The patients will be ventilated for one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPAP delivery with NeuroPAP device: the device will be switched to CPAP mode, for a 15&#xD;
           minute period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second 30 minutes period of the conventional NIPPV will be conducted.&#xD;
