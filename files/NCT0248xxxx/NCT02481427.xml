      Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be used as the treatment of knee OA isolated to a&#xD;
      single compartment instead of TKA. Both UKA and TKA have been used for decades as a treatment&#xD;
      of knee OA. However, operative indications for TKA and UKA overlaps, but they are not&#xD;
      similar. Therefore, the outcome or survivorship of these procedures cannot be compared&#xD;
      directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some advantages of UKA over TKA have been reported, including faster recovery time, reduced&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and mortality, a subjective preference of feeling more normal knee,&#xD;
      lower cost and improved return to work and sport. On the other side national arthroplasty&#xD;
      registers consistently report around a threefold increase in crude cumulative revision rate&#xD;
      at 8 to 10 years for UKA compared with TKA 7-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare functional, clinical, patient satisfaction, and implant&#xD;
      survival results of cementless UKA with those of cemented TKA at 2 months, 1, 2, 5 and 10&#xD;
      years after the procedure. The study design is a multicenter, double-blind and randomized&#xD;
      trial of knee replacement patients. The primary outcome is the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and&#xD;
      Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 2 year.&#xD;

      Background Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease, which may cause severe pain&#xD;
      and lead to a reduced quality of life. It has been shown that the prevalence of symptomatic&#xD;
      OA in those aged 60 and above was 9.6% in men and 18% in women. Primary treatment of knee OA&#xD;
      is conservative including physical activity, exercise and analgesics. Meta-analysis shows&#xD;
      small to moderately sized effects of exercise on pain and function. Total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) is the gold standard option for the treatment of painful OA of the knee when&#xD;
      conservative treatment is not sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) can be used as the treatment of knee OA isolated to a&#xD;
      single compartment instead of TKA. Both UKA and TKA have been used for decades as a treatment&#xD;
      of knee OA. However, operative indications for TKA and UKA overlaps, but they are not&#xD;
      similar. Therefore, the outcome or survivorship of these procedures cannot be compared&#xD;
      directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some advantages of UKA over TKA have been reported, including faster recovery time, reduced&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and mortality, a subjective preference of feeling more normal knee,&#xD;
      lower cost and improved return to work and sport. On the other side national arthroplasty&#xD;
      registers like the National Joint Registry of England and Wales (NJR), the Australian&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR), the Swedish Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty Register (SKAR), and the Finnish Arthroplasty Register (FAR) consistently report&#xD;
      around a threefold increase in crude cumulative revision rate at 8 to 10 years for UKA&#xD;
      compared with TKA 7-10. Few reports have been published about patient-perceived outcomes&#xD;
      following TKA compared with UKA. Newman et all compared fixed bearing UKA to TKA and&#xD;
      published better range of movement (ROM) after UKA. Sun PF et all compared mobile bearing UKA&#xD;
      to fixed bearing TKA. They didn't had significant difference in ROM or Knee Society score&#xD;
      (KSS) postoperatively after mean 52 months follow-up, but in TKA group had significantly more&#xD;
      postoperative deep vein thrombosis and more blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study comparing cemented UKA (Oxford, Biomet) and TKA, have been published using&#xD;
      patient-perceived outcome measures, but the study protocol lacks of blinding. There is no&#xD;
      published randomized controlled, double-blind trial which compares patient-perceived outcomes&#xD;
      after TKA and UKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxford mobile bearing UKA is most used unicondylar prosthesis according to national&#xD;
      registries. The most common reason for revision of UKA according to NJR is aseptic loosening,&#xD;
      accounting for up to 48% of all UKA revisions. Other reasons for UKA revision in Finland&#xD;
      where malalignment, prosthesis fracture, instability, infection, fracture, patella&#xD;
      complication and other reasons (35%). A randomized controlled trial of 62 knees comparing&#xD;
      cemented and cementless Oxford UKA has demonstrated a greatly reduced incidence of tibial&#xD;
      radiolucencies with similar functional outcomes at 1 year 15. Cementless Oxford unicondylar&#xD;
      knee is relative new product and was developed to address problems related to cement&#xD;
      fixation, and has been demonstrated in a randomised study to have similar clinical outcomes&#xD;
      with fewer radiolucencies than observed with the cemented device. New Zealand Joint Registry&#xD;
      (NZJR) data shows revision rate 1,37/100 component years for cemented Oxford phase 3 and&#xD;
      0,72/100 component years for cementless Oxford phase 3 UKA. The uncemented Oxford UKA has a&#xD;
      significantly lower revision rate than the overall mean of 1.27 /100 observer component&#xD;
      years. Also the NJR show better survivorship for cementless unicondylar arthroplasty compared&#xD;
      to cemented unicondylar arthroplasty. On the other hand cementless TKA shows lower&#xD;
      survivorship compared cemented TKA in Finnish Arthroplasty Register (FAR). There are no&#xD;
      published randomized controlled, double-blind trial which compare patient-perceived outcomes&#xD;
      after cemented TKA and cementless Oxford UKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study The aim of this study is to compare functional, clinical, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and implant survival results of cementless UKA with those of cemented TKA at 2&#xD;
      months, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting The study design is a multicenter, double-blind and randomized trial of knee&#xD;
      replacement patients. Arthroplasty procedures will be performed by experienced knee surgeons&#xD;
      who are experienced in both UKA and TKA operations. As UKA we will use cementless Oxford&#xD;
      phase 3 mobile bearing prosthesis with Microplasty instrumentation (Biomet) and as TKA&#xD;
      cemented Triathlon CR condylar prothesis (Stryker). According to power analysis, we are going&#xD;
      to recruit 140 patients from 3 orthopedic units in Finland. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to UKR or TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants Participants with anteromedial osteoarthritis of knee will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients must be applicable for both a medial UKR and TKR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent Potential patients will be contacted in outpatient clinics by the&#xD;
      participating orthopedic surgeon. At this stage patients will be provided with an 'Invitation&#xD;
      letter' and a information sheet which will explain why they have been approached and will&#xD;
      provide further details about the study. Those patients, who voluntary will take part to the&#xD;
      study, will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is appropriate&#xD;
      for the study, pre-assessment clinic appointment will be organized. The pre-assessment&#xD;
      appointments are routine appointment for a short time before their scheduled operation date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments Preoperative assessments will include a patient reported questionnaire&#xD;
      examining pain, other Symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation&#xD;
      and knee related Quality of life. (OKS and KOOS). Also a clinical assessment of range of&#xD;
      motion and function of the knee, will be carried out. Preoperative weight bearing X-rays&#xD;
      knees 20 degrease flexion, valgus stress x-rays and mechanical axis will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operation, the operative details will be recorded and routine postoperative&#xD;
      radiographs collected. Operative details will be sealed and saved. Code will be opened and&#xD;
      randomization will be cancelled only if it's necessary. Reasons which might result in&#xD;
      cancellation of randomization are, for example, symptoms of the operated knee which might&#xD;
      require revision arthroplasty. Cancellation of randomization occurs also if the patient wants&#xD;
      to discontinue participating to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control outpatient policlinic appointment will be arranged for the clinical examination at 2&#xD;
      months, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post operation. Outpatient controls will be carried out by&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons, who are not aware which type of operation -UKA or TKA - was performed.&#xD;
      Range of movement and stability are assessed. The radiographs are not available for the&#xD;
      patient at the outpatient policlinic, but they are controlled by radiologists and the&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon to complications. Patients are informed of any surgical complications or&#xD;
      possible abnormal findings in X-rays, and are treated using standard methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A postal questionnaire (containing the 15D, OKS and KOOS) will be sent out at 2 months, 1, 2,&#xD;
      5 and 10 years post randomization. Additional clinical appointments (if needed) will be&#xD;
      performed by surgeon not participating study operations or controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 to 24 hours before the operation, if a patient is confirmed to be eligible for the trial,&#xD;
      the surgeon opens an envelope containing the study-group assignment (TKA or UKA). The&#xD;
      assignment will not be revealed to the patient. The sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes&#xD;
      will prepared by a statistician with no involvement in the clinical care of patients in the&#xD;
      trial. Randomizations will be performed in a 1:1 ratio with a block size of 4. The&#xD;
      randomization sequence involved stratification according to age (45 to 60 or 61 to 79 years&#xD;
      of age), sex, and preoperative OKS (0-17, 18-27, or 28-48). Only the orthopedic surgeon and&#xD;
      other staff in the operating room will be aware of the group assignment, and they do not&#xD;
      participate in further treatment or follow-up of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total knee replacement procedure TKA is performed through a standard medial parapatellar&#xD;
      incision, which provides easy access to the knee joint. Skin incision is done to midline.&#xD;
      Intramedullary guide is used for alignment of femoral and tibia saw cuts and component&#xD;
      positions. Components will be cemented in position. The patella will not be resurfaced.&#xD;
      Intraoperative local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is used for postoperative pain management.&#xD;
      Drain is not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial knee replacement procedure UKA involves only the replacement of affected medial&#xD;
      compartment. In the study, the operation will be performed through standard medial&#xD;
      parapatellar incision with midline skin incision, but the knee joint and fascia will be&#xD;
      opened like in standard Oxford minimally invasive incision. The procedure will be performed&#xD;
      by using Oxford Microplasty instrumentation and following Microplasty surgical technique&#xD;
      (Biomet Orthopedics). Intraoperative local infiltration analgesia is used for postoperative&#xD;
      pain management. Drain is not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety The study participants have symptomatic medial knee OA and have failed conservative&#xD;
      treatment. Patients, which are suitable for knee replacement have been selected from&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. The operation will be performed as standard knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be informed of the risks associated with anesthesia and knee&#xD;
      replacement surgery. Potential intra- or perioperative complication are; anesthesia-related&#xD;
      complications, wound infection, bleeding, fracture, rupture of collateral or patellar&#xD;
      ligament, thrombo-embolic complications, death, ongoing pain, and deterioration of existing&#xD;
      co-morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical long-term complications following the knee replacement are loosening of implant,&#xD;
      lack of osteointegration of a cementless implant, periprosthetic fracture, luxation- or wear&#xD;
      of bearing, infection, adverse knee pain 12 months after operation, knee stiffness, and&#xD;
      lateral compartment OA in UKA. These complications may need surgery as revision, open&#xD;
      debridement, washout or as worse even amputation.&#xD;
