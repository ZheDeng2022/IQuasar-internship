  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Season of birth influences pregnancy for reasons that remain unclear however the answer may&#xD;
      lie in the amount of sunshine pregnant women are exposed to. Sunshine, or ultraviolet light&#xD;
      (UV) exposure is already known to have benefits for health on heart disease, strokes and&#xD;
      depression. In pregnancy, relationships between sunshine exposure are evident in birth&#xD;
      weight, preterm birth and risk of blood pressure complications. Vitamin D, the UV generated&#xD;
      hormone, was thought to be responsible when low vitamin D levels were associated with these&#xD;
      pregnancy complications. However, vitamin D replacement is ineffective at preventing these&#xD;
      outcomes, and the investigators hypothesise that this is because it is the UV that is&#xD;
      beneficial for pregnancy and it is working through a different pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new understanding of skin function is central to this, with a 2014 study showing that&#xD;
      exposing an adult to 20 minutes of low dose UV light lowered their blood pressure and&#xD;
      improved blood flow. These investigators demonstrated this was a direct effect of UV on the&#xD;
      skin and was mediated by nitric oxide, a chemical central to many aspects of pregnancy&#xD;
      including blood pressure regulation and uterine activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators in this study have funding from Tommy's to investigate if a similar effect&#xD;
      is seen in pregnancy on the circulation. The design is similar to the previously successful&#xD;
      method and volunteers would be recruited from clinical areas during the second trimester. As&#xD;
      both resting and warming for 20 minutes have the potential to have similar effects on the&#xD;
      circulation, a control arm will expose participants to these without the UV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study would involve one visit and measurements taken would include heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, arteriography, ultrasound of the uterine arteries and blood measurements of&#xD;
      nitric oxide levels. Arteriography is performed using a specialised arm cuff and is safe and&#xD;
      non-invasive. A subset of these women would be invited to repeat this in the third trimester&#xD;
      to investigate for a difference in effect at a later gestation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure during pregnancy will release nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) from the skin and that in turn this will cause blood vessel dilatation. This will&#xD;
      be seen by changes in uterine artery blood flow, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      (arteriography). The aim is to investigate this in a low risk group and a high risk group, as&#xD;
      these 2 groups of women have different baseline characteristics of their vascular system and&#xD;
      potentially different responses to our intervention. A subset of these women will be invited&#xD;
      to repeat the intervention in the third trimesters of their pregnancies to establish if the&#xD;
      effect differs with advancing gestation. Birth outcomes on participants will be collected to&#xD;
      check if the high and low risk groups are representative of this status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant contact information will be kept separately from their collected data to&#xD;
      anonymise the collected data and all outcome data will be de-identified. All collected&#xD;
      information will be stored on secure university servers that are password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited to participate in the low sunshine months November 1st until&#xD;
      March 1st to minimise background sunshine and UV exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOW RISK ARM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants will be recruited from community and hospital antenatal clinics, day&#xD;
      assessment unit, labour ward or at first trimester screen appointment by posters, a research&#xD;
      midwife or a member of clinical research team. Potential participants will be given an&#xD;
      information form and will be asked to give written consent following sufficient time for&#xD;
      consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be between 14 and 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the intervention and&#xD;
      have no pregnancy related complications or risk factors for pre-eclampsia or growth&#xD;
      restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a single morning or afternoon the protocol will be completed with the participant&#xD;
      exposed to both the intervention and the control in the one 4 hour period. The intervention&#xD;
      participants will be exposed to is ultraviolet A for 20minutes in a dermatology phototherapy&#xD;
      cabinet. This is the equivalent of 2 standard erythemal doses (SED's) of UV light exposure.&#xD;
      On a normal summer day in Northern Europe the general population would expect to receive&#xD;
      30-40 SED's. In the control intervention participants will be exposed to sham irradiation&#xD;
      where they will undergo this exposure while wearing a loose fitting paper boiler suit that is&#xD;
      UVA impenetrable to prevent UVA exposure. Protective sunglasses will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to the active or control treatment arm first with a simple randomisation method (coin toss)&#xD;
      by a member of the clinical research team. As the groups will be controlled for risk factors,&#xD;
      the main important covariate is age. The purpose of randomisation in this setting is to aid&#xD;
      with blinding the ultrasound investigator to which arm the patient is in, as the investigator&#xD;
      can affect ultrasound results. As such, a simple randomisation procedure such as a coin toss&#xD;
      by the research nurse on arrival is appropriate. One toss will determine group allocation&#xD;
      with heads getting control exposure first and tails getting intervention first. This will be&#xD;
      recorded on the participant information sheet and unblinded for analysis. The participant&#xD;
      will then rest seated for 30 minutes in comfortable clothing in a temperature controlled room&#xD;
      at 25 degrees Celsius. They will be assigned a study number and the researcher will collect&#xD;
      pregnancy and maternal characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will measure baseline blood pressure, skin temperature, heart&#xD;
      rate and perform arteriography. Arteriography has a standard collecting procedure and is an&#xD;
      established tool to measure stiffness of the aorta (the largest blood vessel from the heart).&#xD;
      An ultrasound will confirm fetal viability and baseline uterine artery Doppler measurements.&#xD;
      An intravenous (IV) cannula will be inserted and a 5ml venous blood sample will be collected&#xD;
      by an experienced member of the clinical research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then be exposed to the intervention of UVA for 20 minutes in either&#xD;
      their underwear (active) or in a loose fitting paper boiler suit that is UVA impenetrable.&#xD;
      The suit allows the skin to heat up, but not be exposed to the UVA. This controls for any&#xD;
      temperature effects. The investigator performing ultrasound is blinded to whether the&#xD;
      participant was wearing the suit or not by the use of a research nurse and the investigator&#xD;
      not being present during the irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following exposure BP, heart rate, skin temperature and uterine artery Doppler's&#xD;
      will be measured at 10 minutely intervals for 1 hour. 3 measurements will be collected at&#xD;
      each time point for BP, heart rate and uterine artery Doppler. A venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected from the cannula at the 0, 30 and 60 minute time points. At the 60 minute time&#xD;
      point, arteriography will be repeated. Uterine artery Doppler images will be stored with a&#xD;
      study number for offline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then cross over in to the other arm, which the investigator remains&#xD;
      blind to and the process is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH RISK ARM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants between 14 and 28 weeks will be referred from their direct care team based on&#xD;
      historical risk factors in a previous pregnancy or high risk factors in their current&#xD;
      pregnancy including essential hypertension, renal or vascular disease, previous intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction or from a low Papp-A result on their first trimester screening blood&#xD;
      tests. Papp-A is measured as part of first trimester screening and is produced by the&#xD;
      developing placenta. Low results are associated with poor fetal growth and pre-eclampsia.&#xD;
      Their direct care team in community or hospital antenatal clinics, day assessment unit or in&#xD;
      the ultrasound department may identify these potential participants and refer them to the&#xD;
      research team if they are interested in participating. This will include midwives, doctors&#xD;
      and ultrasound staff. A poster and mechanism for self referral will be present in the care&#xD;
      areas of antenatal clinic and the ultrasound department. If they give consent, they will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate. If there is any concerns about fetal or maternal well being they&#xD;
      will be excluded from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will undergo the above protocol including randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LONGITUDINAL ARM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to return to undergo the trial protocol again at a third&#xD;
      trimester time point within the 3 month window that the trial is being run. The investigators&#xD;
      would aim to collect 10 from the low risk group and 10 from the high risk group. Participants&#xD;
      whose third trimester commences outside this window will not be eligible for the longitudinal&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOR ALL GROUPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent will include permission to collect birth outcomes once they are delivered.&#xD;
      Outcomes of interest will be pregnancy outcome (stillbirth, live birth), birth weight,&#xD;
      gestational length, incidence of pre-eclampsia or pregnancy induced hypertension. This will&#xD;
      be retrieved from the medical record and will be used for post hoc subgroup analysis to&#xD;
      assess for any difference in response to UVA exposure. The study will conclude once the last&#xD;
      baby is delivered and their birth data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be recorded in an anonymised way with a study number, and anonymised data will&#xD;
      be stored separately to participant data. After the last pregnancy is delivered, all data&#xD;
      will be completely de-identified. Blood samples will be stored in the Edinburgh Reproductive&#xD;
      Tissue Biobank with participant consent.&#xD;
