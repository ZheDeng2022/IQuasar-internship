             of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range (or defined screening threshold for the&#xD;
             Investigator site), unless the Investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically&#xD;
             irrelevant for diabetes patients; however serum creatinine should be strictly below&#xD;
             the upper laboratory norm; alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and total bilirubin (unless the patient&#xD;
             has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not be above 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
             (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (less than 2 years postmenopausal or not surgically&#xD;

             test at Day 1 in all treatment periods (TPs) and must use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             birth control, which is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (ie, less&#xD;

             use 2 independent methods of contraception, eg, diaphragm and spermicide-coated&#xD;
             condom. The use of a condom and spermicidal creams is not sufficiently reliable. For&#xD;
             postmenopausal women with presence of less than 2 years post menopausal, and not&#xD;
             surgically sterile for more than 3 months, the hormonal status will be determined&#xD;
