  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not&#xD;
      responded to previous treatment (refractory). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete hematologic response (CR)/complete response incomplete (CRi)&#xD;
      rate when sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) is administered to adult patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (CR, CRi/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia&#xD;
      free state [MLFS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the CR/CRi duration when MLN0128 (TAK-228) is administered to adult patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the frequency of proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT)&#xD;
      for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve a response on MLN0128 (TAK-228).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the overall survival for relapsed/refractory ALL patients on MLN0128&#xD;
      (TAK-228).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in ALL patients. II. To assess&#xD;
      whether phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate 4EBP1 decreases in leukemic blasts harvested&#xD;
      from the bone marrow on day 8 compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 (TAK-228) enhances expression of the&#xD;
      pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma in marrow ALL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether Mcl-1 levels decrease in blast cells during&#xD;
      MLN0128 (TAK-228) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether a) the phospho-protein pattern at baseline or&#xD;
      b) MLN0128 (TAK-228)-associated changes in the phospho-protein pattern differs between ALL&#xD;
      samples that respond to therapy and those that do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are non-responders&#xD;
      and in PR at the end of course 4 may receive sapanisertib PO daily on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A complete response will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot;. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent exact binomial confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be estimated by the total number of complete or partial responses (complete hematologic response [CR], complete response incomplete [CRi], partial response [PR], or morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]) divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Duration of complete response (complete hematologic response [CR]/complete response incomplete [CRi])</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a CR to the earliest date progression is documented, assessed up to 4 years</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency is estimated by the number of patients who proceed to allogeneic SCT after achieving response divided by the total number of evaluable patients who achieved a response. All evaluable patients who achieved a response will be used for this analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated.</description>
