      Prospective observational study in 40 adult critically ill patients. Patients were eligible&#xD;
      if they were mechanically ventilated with an FiO2 ≤0.5 and PaO2/FiO2 ≥200 mmHg and&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable with a hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, no acute bleeding or need for blood&#xD;
      transfusions, no renal failure, no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Twenty patients&#xD;
      (hyperoxia group) underwent a 2-hour exposure to normobaric hyperoxia (FiO2 1.0), 20 patients&#xD;
      were evaluated as controls. Serum erythropoietin (EPO) was measured at baseline, 24h and 48h.&#xD;
      Serum Glutathione (GSH) and reacting oxygen species (ROS) were assessed at baseline (t0),&#xD;
      after 2 hours of hyperoxia (t1) and 2 hours after the return to baseline FiO2 (t2).&#xD;
      Sidestream dark field videomicroscopy was applied sublingually to assess the microvascular&#xD;
      response to hyperoxia. Near infrared spectroscopy with a vascular occlusion test was applied&#xD;
      at t0, t1, t2.&#xD;

      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients were enrolled in total. The first 20 patients (hyperoxia group) underwent a&#xD;
      2-hour period of normobaric hyperoxia (FiO2 1.0), according to the protocol applied in. No&#xD;
      variation in the FiO2 was applied for the other 20 patients (control group). All patients&#xD;
      were enrolled in the morning and hyperoxia was performed in the time range between 10am-2pm&#xD;
      in order to minimize variability due to the circadian rhythm of EPO production. No variations&#xD;
      to sedation or vasopressor dose were applied during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the study day, measurements were taken at 2-hour intervals: baseline (t0), under 1.0 FiO2&#xD;
      (t1) and after returning to baseline FiO2 (t2). These included: body temperature, heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), arterial partial&#xD;
      pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2), PaO2/FiO2, arterial pH, bicarbonate,&#xD;
      base excess) and central venous saturation (ScvO2) blood gases, arterial lactates, evaluation&#xD;
      of the sublingual microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. The same measurements were&#xD;
      performed in the control group at 2-hour intervals. In 24 patients (12 patients per group),&#xD;
      arterial blood samples (10 mL) were taken at each time point and immediately centrifuged;&#xD;
      plasma and serum were stored at -70°C for subsequent analyses. Serum EPO, reticulocyte count,&#xD;
      hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit were measured at 8am in all patients on the study day, at 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation measurements with sidestream dark field imaging The sublingual&#xD;
      microcirculation was evaluated with sidestream dark field (SDF) videomicroscopy (Microscan,&#xD;
      Microvision Medical, Amsterdam, NL). This technique has been described in details elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor-quality images were discarded, and three images for each time point were selected and&#xD;
      analyzed by using a computer software package (Automated Vascular Analysis Software;&#xD;
      Microvision Medical BV). According to the consensus report on the performance and evaluation&#xD;
      of microcirculation using SDF imaging, total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density&#xD;
      (PVD), De Backer score, proportion of perfused vessels (PPV), microcirculatory flow index&#xD;
      (MFI), flow heterogeneity index (FHI) and blood flow velocity (BFV) were calculated in small&#xD;
      or medium vessels (diameter ≤ or &gt;20 μm, respectively), as previously described. In addition&#xD;
      to discontinuous microvascular measurements at 2-hour intervals, the investigators evaluated&#xD;
      the early response of the microcirculation to variations in the FiO2 on one and the same site&#xD;
      of sublingual mucosa in order to detect even minute changes in the microvascular density and&#xD;
      flow. Directly after obtaining measurements from 5 different sites, the SDF probe was placed&#xD;
      in a stable position and manipulated to avoid any pressure artifacts or secretions&#xD;
      interfering with the analysis. By manually supporting the microscope, continuous video&#xD;
      recording was performed for at least 2 minutes during the variation of the FiO2 (start or end&#xD;
      of hyperoxia). Video clips of 10 s (2 per time point) corresponding to before (baseline or 2h&#xD;
      FiO2 1.0) and after (2 min FiO2 1.0 or 2 min after returning to baseline FiO2) the variation&#xD;
      of FiO2 were subsequently selected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of peripheral tissue oxygenation and microvascular reactivity with near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometry (NIRS) (InSpectra™ Model 650; Hutchinson&#xD;
      Technology Inc., Hutchinson, USA) was used to measure peripheral tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (StO2) and tissue Hb index (THI) at baseline and during a vascular occlusion test (VOT). A 15&#xD;
      mm-sized probe was placed on the skin of the thenar eminence, and a sphygmomanometer cuff was&#xD;
      placed around the (upper) arm to occlude the brachial artery. After a 3-minute period of StO2&#xD;
      signal stabilization, arterial inflow was arrested by inflation of the cuff to 50 mmHg above&#xD;
      the systolic arterial pressure. The cuff was kept inflated until the StO2 decreased to 40%&#xD;
      and then released. StO2 was continuously recorded during the reperfusion phase until&#xD;
      stabilization. The StO2 downslope (%/minute) was calculated from the regression line of the&#xD;
      first minute of StO2 decay after occlusion, providing an index of O2 consumption rate. The&#xD;
      StO2 upslope (%/minute) was obtained from the regression line of StO2 increase in the&#xD;
      reperfusion phase. The area under the curve (AUC) of the hyperemic response was also&#xD;
      calculated. StO2 upslope and the AUC of the StO2 reflect microvascular reactivity. All the&#xD;
      parameters were calculated by using a computer software package (version 3.03 InSpectra&#xD;
      Analysis Program; Hutchinson Technology Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoassays :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of ROS and GSH were measured in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software,&#xD;
      USA). Normality of distribution was checked by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data were&#xD;
      presented as mean ± standard deviation or median [1st-3rd quartile], as appropriate. One-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures with Bonferroni post-hoc test or Friedman&#xD;
      test with Dunn's multiple comparison test were used to evaluate changes over time in the same&#xD;
      group. Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to evaluate&#xD;
      differences between the two groups, where applicable. For non-normally distributed variables,&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U test was applied to evaluate difference between the two groups at the same&#xD;
      time point. A Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to assess correlations between&#xD;
      variables. The alpha level of significance was set a priori at 0.05.&#xD;
