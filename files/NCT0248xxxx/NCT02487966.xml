      This is a two-site study that explores the effects of mirror therapy and transcranial Direct&#xD;
      Current Stimulation (tDCS, Soterix ©) in a randomized factorial controlled trial in which&#xD;
      patients will be assigned to one of four groups: active tDCS and active MT; sham tDCS and&#xD;
      active MT; active tDCS and sham MT (which consists of using a covered mirror for the&#xD;
      therapy); and both sham tDCS and sham MT (covered mirror).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) belongs to a group of neuropathic pain syndromes that is&#xD;
      characterized by pain in the amputated limb. Rehabilitation for chronic pain involves a&#xD;
      structured treatment plan targeting all dimensions of the pain experience, and should include&#xD;
      a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach that allows patients to receive the most benefit&#xD;
      according to their needs. As in other chronic pain syndromes, chronic Phantom limb pain (PLP)&#xD;
      is often difficult to treat; showing to be resistant to classical pharmacological and&#xD;
      surgical treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we hypothesize that novel treatments of PLP need to target specific neural&#xD;
      networks associated with this maladaptive plasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS,Soterix ©) is a powerful and non-invasive technique of brain stimulation that is known&#xD;
      to significantly modulate plasticity and alleviate chronic pain in various syndromes. device&#xD;
      for this trial. This study usiGiven tDCS underlying neural mechanisms, it is critical to use&#xD;
      a multimodal approach to treatment - using both tDCS and behavioral therapy simultaneously.&#xD;
      In this case, an ideal therapy is mirror therapy (MT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we showed that anodal tDCS can induce a selective short-lasting relief from PLP,&#xD;
      and repeated applications of anodal tDCS induces long-lasting analgesic effects. These&#xD;
      preliminary results show that tDCS may be a promising rehabilitative tool for the management&#xD;
      of chronic PLP. This neurorehabilitation technique is commonly used in PLP, and is designed&#xD;
      to modulate cortical mechanisms of pain by performing movements using the unaffected limb in&#xD;
      front of a mirror. We propose to carry out a mechanistic, factorial, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate a novel rehabilitation approach combining tDCS and MT in PLP patients. We&#xD;
      aim to compare the brain changes before and after treatment in order to study the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying PLP.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the severity of pain measured by changes in PLP from baseline to 4 weeks (value at 4 weeks minus value at baseline), as indexed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS pain scale is a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine''). Since we are using a difference, smaller values (negative) represent a better outcome.</description>

          <description>Subjects will receive 20 minutes of active tDCS, while receiving 15 minutes of active Mirror Therapy.&#xD;
transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): active (Soterix ©): Subjects will undergo tDCS stimulation. For both active and sham stimulation, we will use electrodes of 35cm^2, at an intensity of 2mA on the primary motor cortex contralateral to the amputated leg. For active tDCS, the subject will undergo stimulation for 20 minutes.&#xD;
Mirror Therapy: active: Subjects will be asked to perform movements (15 minutes daily) using the unaffected limb while watching its mirrored reflection superimposed over the affected limb. During Mirror Therapy, subjects will be asked to consciously relate the movement observed in the mirror to their phantom limb and to keep their attention focused on the task. Instructions will be explained verbally, demonstrated by a therapist, and performed by the subject in front of the therapist.</description>

transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): active (Soterix ©): Subjects will undergo tDCS stimulation. For both active and sham stimulation, we will use electrodes of 35cm^2, at an intensity of 2mA on the primary motor cortex contralateral to the amputated leg. For active tDCS, the subject will undergo stimulation for 20 minutes.&#xD;
Mirror Therapy: active: Subjects will be asked to perform movements (15 minutes daily) using the unaffected limb while watching its mirrored reflection superimposed over the affected limb. During Mirror Therapy, subjects will be asked to consciously relate the movement observed in the mirror to their phantom limb and to keep their attention focused on the task. Instructions will be explained verbally, demonstrated by a therapist, and performed by the subject in front of the therapist.</description>

        <description>The primary endpoint will be the severity of pain measured by changes in PLP from baseline to 4 weeks (value at 4 weeks minus value at baseline), as indexed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS pain scale is a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine''). Since we are using a difference, smaller values (negative) represent a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Changes in the Visual Analog Scale for Phantom Limb Pain</title>
          <description>The primary endpoint will be the severity of pain measured by changes in PLP from baseline to 4 weeks (value at 4 weeks minus value at baseline), as indexed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS pain scale is a simple 10- point scale (0 = ''no pain'', 10 = ''pain as bad as you can imagine''). Since we are using a difference, smaller values (negative) represent a better outcome.</description>
