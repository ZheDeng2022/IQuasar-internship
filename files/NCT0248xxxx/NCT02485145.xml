  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 30 million people in the United States and represents our&#xD;
      nation's leading cause of disability. Data for the years between 1996-2005, indicate that OA&#xD;
      raised overall health care costs by $185.5 billion annually. Largely as a consequence of this&#xD;
      disease, the number of patients undergoing joint replacement surgery will quadruple over the&#xD;
      next 17 years. Importantly, several recent studies have demonstrated that OA is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease . Presently investigators have no&#xD;
      medications that alter the natural history of OA. Weight control, exercise and some physical&#xD;
      therapy measures are the only interventions short of total joint replacement that alter the&#xD;
      course of this disease. To make matters worse, investigators have experienced only setbacks&#xD;
      in use of medications aimed at symptom control. Recognition of toxicities of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotic-based analgesics has narrowed the presently&#xD;
      available armamentarium for pain control in OA . Clearly OA is a major factor that demands&#xD;
      better solutions as the health care system is redesigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OA involving the hands represents a major part of the overall burden of this disease. In&#xD;
      radiographic surveys about a quarter of the total US population has changes consistent with&#xD;
      OA involving the hands. Among the elderly, radiographic hand OA has been found in over half&#xD;
      of such individuals and as many as a quarter of them suffer from pain and functional&#xD;
      incapacitation. The joints affected typically are the first carpometacarpal (CMC-1) joint,&#xD;
      the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints .&#xD;
      Therapeutic options include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and&#xD;
      a variety of physical measures such as physical therapy, bracing, and heat and cold&#xD;
      applications. To achieve some symptomatic benefit while limiting systemic toxicity, topical&#xD;
      therapies have been developed which either act as counter irritants, seek to reduce substance&#xD;
      P (capsaicin), or to deliver an NSAID locally through the skin. The leading example of the&#xD;
      latter is Diclofenac sodium gel which was shown to reduce pain intensity and improve hand&#xD;
      function in a double blind controlled trial. However none of these measures have proven&#xD;
      sufficiently effective to meet patient needs. Topical polytherapy will be employed in this&#xD;
      study to see if it will be effective against the pain of OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potentially more effective approach is to provide a combination of analgesic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents through a topical delivery system. In the present study compounds&#xD;
      with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties will be combined in a vehicle that promotes&#xD;
      penetration of molecules through the skin to deeper underlying tissues such as the joint&#xD;
      capsule at articulations in the hands. The vehicle consists of Versapro cream base (a&#xD;
      formulation of Medisca, Inc. that contains Vitamin E and Aloe Vera, along with other&#xD;
      ingredients that are proprietary), Tranilast powder, Pentoxifylline USP powder, Cetyl&#xD;
      Myristoleate 40% wax, liquid Pentylene Glycol, liquid Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) USP, liquid&#xD;
      Propylene Glycol USP, liquid Ethoxy Diglycol reagent, liquid Ethyl Alcohol 190 proof USP.&#xD;
      These are all inert ingredients, i.e. they only promote penetration of molecules through the&#xD;
      skin. A mixture of the following compounds will be incorporated into this vehicle as the&#xD;
      active test medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diclofenac 3% - an NSAID. FDA pregnancy category C for the first 30 weeks, then category D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baclofen 2% - an agonist for the GABAB receptors. FDA pregnancy category C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orphenadrine 5% - an anticholinergic drug of the ethanolamine antihistamine class. FDA&#xD;
      pregnancy category C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine 2% - a local anesthetic that binds voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks&#xD;
      sodium influx into nerve cells preventing depolarization. FDA pregnancy category C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the FDA pregnancy categories for the drugs used in this study, pregnancy is an&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control medication: The vehicle alone will serve as the control compound.&#xD;
