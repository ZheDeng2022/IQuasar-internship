  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a five year study conducted in cooperation with the Brain Health Registry (BHR), an&#xD;
      internet-based registry which enrolls adult volunteers in order to facilitate clinical trials&#xD;
      for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The investigators goal is to validate the&#xD;
      Brain Health Registry's online cognitive measures developed by Lumosity. Investigators will&#xD;
      meet this goal by collecting data from the newly developed the BHR online cognitive screening&#xD;
      battery along with standardized measures of memory, attention, executive functioning and&#xD;
      speed of information processing currently used in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      This study is conducted in cooperation with the Brain Health Registry (BHR, CHR #12-09628),&#xD;
      an internet-based registry which will enroll individuals in order to facilitate clinical&#xD;
      trials for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other brain diseases and disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal is to validate the Brain Health Registry's online cognitive measures&#xD;
      developed by Lumosity. Investigators will meet this goal by collecting data from the newly&#xD;
      developed BHR online cognitive screening battery along with standardized measures of memory,&#xD;
      attention, executive functioning and speed of information processing currently used in&#xD;
      clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll 1000 subjects, 500 of whom will be recruited upon registering in&#xD;
      the BHR. The other 500 subjects will be recruited from the Memory and Aging Center at the&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the Center for Imaging of&#xD;
      Neurodegenerative Diseases (CIND) at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC).&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data will be obtained for each participant who will have 3 tests of&#xD;
      cognitive function over a 2 week period: 1) unsupervised online cognitive testing, 2)&#xD;
      supervised online cognitive testing, and 3) standard clinical neuropsychological assessments.&#xD;
      The order in which cognitive evaluations are administered will be equally distributed within&#xD;
      the sample so as to minimize practice effects. These subjects will also provide a saliva&#xD;
      specimen in order to determine their ApoE genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, investigators will also conduct a small pilot study of 34 subjects to obtain&#xD;
      one 3 Tesla MRI scan and one PET scan in order to obtain feasibility data for collecting&#xD;
      longitudinal neuroimaging studies for participants in this sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main validation project and MRI/PET substudy, we will also run a substudy&#xD;
      (n=330) that looks to validate an additional unsupervised online cognitive measure&#xD;
      (administered via iPad application) called ReVeRe. ReVeRe, is an automated, self-administered&#xD;
      measure of verbal memory (word list recall) that is modeled after the Rey Auditory Verbal&#xD;
      Learning Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two substudies for ReVeRe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReVeRe 1 (n=250): This approximately 30 minute procedure will be administered initially&#xD;
      during the NVP participant's clinic visit, and then will be collected remotely (by&#xD;
      participants at home) on: (1) Day 7 after the initial clinic testing, (2) Day 21 after the&#xD;
      initial clinic testing, and (3) ongoing at 6 month intervals through at least 18 months - for&#xD;
      a total of 6 administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReVeRe 2 (n=80): This approximately 30 minute procedure will be administered initially 2&#xD;
      weeks after a follow up in-clinic visit, and then will be collected remotely in burst&#xD;
      intervals. There will be three administrations at each time point (Day 0, 3, and 7), which&#xD;
      will be collected every 6 months for 24 months after the in-clinic follow up visit. All&#xD;
      participants in ReVeRe 2 will also receive an amyloid PET scan, as long as they did not&#xD;
      already participate in the MRI/PET substudy.&#xD;
