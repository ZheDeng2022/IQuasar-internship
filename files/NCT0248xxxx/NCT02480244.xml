  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to assess the effectiveness of a culturally&#xD;
      appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce obesity levels and ultimately the risk of&#xD;
      developing diabetes type II in immigrant Latino farm workers. Randomization is at the farm&#xD;
      ranch level. Individuals at intervention ranches will receive a multi-week curriculum at the&#xD;
      work-site on diabetes, diet and physical activity and optional supplemental sessions in the&#xD;
      evening and weekends. The investigators will adopt the intent-to-treat principle for the&#xD;
      primary analysis. Individuals on control ranches will receive no health educational&#xD;
      instruction. The primary outcome is BMI. The investigators hypothesize that intervention&#xD;
      ranches will achieve significant improvement in obesity and diabetes risk factors as compared&#xD;
      to control ranches.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention participants attend up to 12 educational sessions teaching them about diabetes, and modifiable lifestyle factors (behaviors) to reduce the risk of diabetes by controlling weight. Sessions are conducted by Promotoras using culturally sensitive and appropriate materials and themes. Group activities and support are also emphasized. The control participants like the intervention were measured and interviewed before and again after the intervention sessions, but received no educational instruction or materials.</description>
