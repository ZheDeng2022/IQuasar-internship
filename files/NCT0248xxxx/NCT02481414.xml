  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a human papilloma virus (HPV)&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccine called PepCan (HPV 16 E6 peptides combined with Candida skin testing&#xD;
      reagent called Candin®) in adult females over a 12 month time period. As the results from the&#xD;
      Phase I trial demonstrated some efficacy against non-16 HPV types, Candin alone will also be&#xD;
      tested. Therefore, there will be two treatment arms: (1) PepCan and (2) Candin. Subjects&#xD;
      found to be eligible for vaccination will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion at a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Each participant will be receiving injections four times with three weeks between&#xD;
      injections. Clinical and virological responses will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. Safety&#xD;
      will be assessed from the time of enrollment to 12 Month Visit. Immunological assessments&#xD;
      will be made at 4 time points (prevaccination, after 2 injections, 6 month after 4 injections&#xD;
      and 12 months after 4 vaccinations).&#xD;

      This is a single site Phase II clinical trial of PepCan for treating women with biopsy-proven&#xD;
      HSILs (High Grade Intraepithelial Lesions) randomized and double-blinded to two treatment&#xD;
      arms. Half of the subjects will receive PepCan, and the other half will receive Candin®&#xD;
      alone. The study design closely resembles the latest guidelines for treating young women with&#xD;
      HSIL. Study subjects will be patients attending the UAMS Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics&#xD;
      with untreated biopsy-proven HSILs and patients referred from other clinics. Four injections&#xD;
      (one every 3 weeks) of PepCan or Candin® will be intradermally administered in the&#xD;
      extremities. Clinical response will be assessed by comparison of colposcopy-guided biopsy&#xD;
      results obtained prior to vaccination and at 12-Month Visit. Safety will be monitored from&#xD;
      the time of enrollment through the 12-Month Visit. Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing&#xD;
      and immunological analyses (&quot;blood test&quot;) prior to injection, after the second vaccination, 6&#xD;
      months after the fourth vaccination, and 12 months after the fourth vaccination. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn to aid T-cell analyses (&quot;blood draw&quot;) after the first and third vaccinations, and&#xD;
      possibly at the Optional Follow-Up and/or Optional LEEP visits. HPV-DNA testing will be&#xD;
      performed at Screening and 6- and 12-Month Visits. If a subject has persistent HSIL at the&#xD;
      12-Month Visit or if a subject is withdrawn due to excessive toxicity, she will be given an&#xD;
      option to return for a LEEP visit. Alternatively, she may choose to exit the study and be&#xD;
      followed by a gynecologist for up to 2 years of observation as recommended before surgical&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate efficacy, clinical response will be assessed by obtaining colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies at the 12-Month Visit. If, upon the 12-Month Visit biopsy, a subject does not have any evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, subject would be considered a &quot;responder&quot;. Some would have regressed to CIN 1, and others may have no dysplasia. If there is still CIN 2 and/or 3 present at the 12-Month Visit, the subject will be considered a &quot;non-responder&quot;.</description>
