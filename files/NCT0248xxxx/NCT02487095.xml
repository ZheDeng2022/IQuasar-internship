    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy damages cancer cell DNA so the cells die and the tumor shrinks. But it may stop&#xD;
      working in some people over time. This is partly due to efficient DNA damage repair&#xD;
      mechanisms used by tumor cells. VX-970 (M6620) may stop cancer cells from preventing the&#xD;
      repair of DNA damaged by chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to see if using the&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug topotecan along with the drug VX-970 (M6620) will improve the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and efficacy of VX-970 (M6620) and topotecan in treating small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with small cell lung cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and heart tests, and&#xD;
      scans. Most of these tests are part of their routine care. Most of these tests will be&#xD;
      repeated throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is set in 21-day cycles. Participants will get topotecan IV on days 1 through 5.&#xD;
      They will get VX-970 (M6620) IV on day 5 alone or on day 5 and day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants doctors will monitor them weekly for the first cycle, every 3 weeks after that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 1 of this Study the doses of topotecan and VX-970 (M6620) will be increased&#xD;
      (according to the Protocol) to determine the maximum safe dose of the combination. The&#xD;
      maximum safe dose of the combination is the dose at which no more than 1 in 6 people have an&#xD;
      intolerable side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More participants will join in Phase 2. They will take the drugs at the maximum safe dose, on&#xD;
      the same schedule as the drugs were taken in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give samples of blood, hair, and tumor tissue (optional) at different&#xD;
      times. They will discuss side effects at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A month after stopping taking the drugs, participants will have a physical exam and blood&#xD;
      drawn. They will have follow-up phone calls every 3 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC typically relapses quickly and&#xD;
      becomes refractory to treatment within a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is only one FDA approved treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC after first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy: topotecan, which inhibits religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand&#xD;
      DNA breaks leading to lethal doublestrand DNA breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survival of some SCLC cells despite initial tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy suggests&#xD;
      the existence of a highly effective DNA damage response network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCLC is characterized by high replication stress (RB1 inactivation, MYC and CCNE1 activation)&#xD;
      and defective ATM-p53 signaling pathway, which cause an excessive reliance on ATR for&#xD;
      survival following DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a combination of ATR kinase inhibition with DNA damaging agents such as&#xD;
      topotecan will provide an attractive synthetically lethal therapeutic option for SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VX-970 is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor of ATR, and in vitro data support the&#xD;
      hypothesis that ATR inhibition can improve SCLC responses to DNA damaging agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan in combination with&#xD;
      VX-970.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: To assess the efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of&#xD;
      topotecan and VX-970 in the second-line treatment of patients with SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Phase 1 and 2: Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a&#xD;
      performance status (ECOG) less than or equal to 2. Subjects must not have received&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Subjects with histologically confirmed SCLC, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer,&#xD;
      and neuroendocrine cancers, and at least one prior chemotherapy. Patients with other&#xD;
      histolgies will be allowed if no standard treatment options exist. Patients with evaluable,&#xD;
      but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Subjects with histological confirmation of SCLC and one prior platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease will be&#xD;
      eligible. Patients must have measurable disease to be eligible for Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive topotecan and VX-970&#xD;
      administered every 21 days (1 cycle), until disease progression or development of intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points during cycle 1&#xD;
      (pre-treatment on day 1, post treatment on days 2, and 3) for PD analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies, which are optional, will be obtained at baseline, during the first treatment&#xD;
      cycle (approximately 15 hours after the first dose of VX-970 on day 3) and at disease&#xD;
      progression except for subjects at the first dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants at the first dose level will undergo biopsies on day 3 prior to third dose of&#xD;
      topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored weekly during the first cycle by clinic visit and basic labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0, and tumor assessments will be made&#xD;
      using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline and after every 2 cycles according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for survival will be carried out every 3 months.&#xD;

          -  Both Phase I and Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male and female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Because no&#xD;
                  dosing adverse event data are currently available on the use of topotecan in&#xD;
                  combination with VX-970 (M6620) in subjects less than 18 years of age, children&#xD;
                  are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatrics trials.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients must have measurable disease, per RECIST 1.1. Subjects with evaluable,&#xD;
                  but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must not have received chemotherapy, or undergone major surgery within 4&#xD;
                  weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.&#xD;

               -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The effects of VX-970 (M6620) on the developing human fetus are unknown For this&#xD;
                  reason and because topotecan is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
                  potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
                  method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during study&#xD;
                  participation and for 6 months after the last dose study therapy. Should a woman&#xD;
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with histologically confirmed SCLC, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, cervical&#xD;
                  cancer, and neuroendocrine cancers will be eligible. Pathological confirmation of&#xD;
                  diagnosis will be done at NCI Laboratory of Pathology. Patients with other&#xD;
                  histologies will be allowed if no standard treatment options exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NSCLC subjects with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations should have previously&#xD;
                  received appropriate FDA approved therapies in addition to prior chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Histological confirmation of SCLC, or extrapulmonary small cell cancer. Although&#xD;
                  NCI confirmation of pathology is not required prior to starting treatment, every&#xD;
                  effort will be made to obtain outside pathology to be reviewed by an NCI&#xD;
                  pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease will be&#xD;
                  eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to (study agent) or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to&#xD;
             poor prognosis. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis&#xD;
             and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for 1 week or on physiologic&#xD;
             doses of steroids may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Lists including&#xD;
             strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP 3A4 are provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, or any concurrent&#xD;
             condition, which could compromise participation in the study, including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, Hepatitis B,&#xD;
             Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6&#xD;
             months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, stroke/cerebrovascular accident within the&#xD;
             past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations which would jeopardize&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with VX-970 (M6620). In addition, these&#xD;
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because topotecan is a Class D agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and because the effects of&#xD;
             VX-970 (M6620) on the developing human fetus are currently unknown. In addition,&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with topotecan or VX-970 (M6620), breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents.&#xD;
