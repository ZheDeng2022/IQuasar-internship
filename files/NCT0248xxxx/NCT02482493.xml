  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedures.&#xD;
      Approximately 84,000 knee replacement procedures were recorded in the UK in 2012. The main&#xD;
      goal of TKA is to relieve the disabling pain of arthritic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction following TKA is related to quick recovery and return to daily&#xD;
      activities. This can be dependent on the design of the implant used in the knee. Improvements&#xD;
      in implant design and surgical technique mean many modern designs offer implant survival&#xD;
      rates beyond 10 - 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As cost pressure increases in the NHS the unit cost of implants is now being scrutinised,&#xD;
      particularly with regard to cost effectiveness. The Press-Fit Condylar (PFC) Sigma implant&#xD;
      can be used with either a conventional metal backed or alternatively an all polyethylene&#xD;
      tibial component (part fitted to the shin bone), the latter considerably cheaper to&#xD;
      manufacture. Four small prospective randomised trials and one large regional registry study&#xD;
      with long follow up support the safe use of all polyethylene tibial components in TKA. The&#xD;
      investigators will therefore undertake a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      the results of all polyethylene tibial components with those of conventional metal backed&#xD;
      tibial components in patients aged 75 or over, comparing both clinical outcome and&#xD;
      radiological survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of knee replacement used for each patient (metal-backed or polyethylene) will be&#xD;
      chosen at random once a patient has agreed to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by means of follow-up appointments and questionnaires and clinical&#xD;
      tests both before the operation 1 year, 2 years and 5 years postoperatively. This will allow&#xD;
      us to see how both types of knee replacement perform over time and if one performs better&#xD;
      than the other in terms of patients movement, pain and functional activities.&#xD;

      Summary of design and methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient who is appropriate for the study is added to the waiting list for a Total Knee&#xD;
      replacement they will be given (or if missed, posted) an information sheet about the study.&#xD;
      This will allow patients several weeks to read the information and telephone the Orthopaedic&#xD;
      research department, if they wish, with any questions they may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Patients will then come to preassessment clinic as usual. At this point the study will be&#xD;
      explained again in person, the patient will be given time to ask questions and will be asked&#xD;
      if they wish to consent to participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient consents to taking part they will complete preoperative measures and&#xD;
      questionnaires There are 3 questionnaires on how the patient is functioning. 2 are completed&#xD;
      by the patient and 1 with the help of the Researcher&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxford Knee Score American Knee Society Score (AKSS) Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36&#xD;
      Health Survey (MOS SF-36) All questionnaires will be performed preoperatively, 1 year, 2&#xD;
      years and 5 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six weeks postoperatively the patient will attend a follow-up clinic. This is standard for&#xD;
      all patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at the Tunbridge Wells Hospital. Routine&#xD;
      wound checks and postoperative care will take place and any patient's concerns dealt with. At&#xD;
      this point the patient will be booked in for another routine follow up appointment 3 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. No study data will be collected at these visits besides adverse events or&#xD;
      lost to follow-up where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At one year post-operatively the patient will be asked to attend for an appointment. The knee&#xD;
      will be assessed clinical and same series of clinician and patient questionnaires completed.&#xD;
      A series of x-rays will also be taken to allow the position of the implant to be recorded.&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken to be taken from the x-rays Similarly the patient will be invited&#xD;
      to attend a further 2 appointments at 2 year and 5 years post-operatively. At these&#xD;
      appointments the questionnaires will be repeated along with the x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the patient wish to withdraw at any point they are free to do so and will not then be&#xD;
      contacted for any subsequent appointments unless they are due routine clinical appointments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient undergoing total knee replacement and not in the study will attend routine 6 week&#xD;
      and 3 month and one year follow-up appointments, as routine but will be discharged when&#xD;
      appropriate and will not be subject to long term follow-up.&#xD;
