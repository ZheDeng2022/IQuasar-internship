  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effect of oral antibiotics for an outpatient&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation (respiratory illness) on sputum (mucus) bacterial infections, lung&#xD;
      function, airway inflammation and quality of life. In this study subjects will perform&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests, provide a sputum sample and complete a questionnaire at two&#xD;
      separate clinic visits. If a subject is unable to cough up sputum in clinic he or she will be&#xD;
      asked to breathe in a salt water solution to help cough up sputum. The first sputum sample&#xD;
      will be obtained at the first visit (within 48 hours of starting antibiotics). Pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing and the questionnaire will also be completed at this time. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete a two week course of oral antibiotics at home. During these two weeks subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to write down the times antibiotics are taken and airway clearance (vest treatment)&#xD;
      is performed. Within one week of completing the antibiotic course subjects will return to&#xD;
      clinic for a second visit. At that time a sputum sample will be obtained again and if&#xD;
      subjects are unable to cough up sputum they will again be asked to breathe in salt water&#xD;
      solution to help cough up sputum. Pulmonary function testing and the questionnaire will also&#xD;
      be completed at this second visit. Sputum samples will be tested for infections with bacteria&#xD;
      and viruses. Sputum samples will also be used to measure markers of airway inflammation&#xD;
      (swelling). The investigators hypothesize that the use of two weeks of oral antibiotics for&#xD;
      the treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation will result in a decrease in the amount of bacteria&#xD;
      measured in sputum. Additionally the investigators hypothesize that treatment with&#xD;
      antibiotics will lead to an improvement in lung function, a decrease in airway inflammation&#xD;
      and an improvement in quality of life measurements.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis based on sweat chloride (â‰¥60) or two known disease&#xD;
             causing mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 8 - 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Starting treatment for an outpatient pulmonary exacerbation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to participate in study after informed consent and assent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chronic daily oral antibiotics. Patients receiving azithromycin&#xD;
             therapy three times a week will not be excluded as its use in this setting is felt to&#xD;
             be anti-inflammatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous reaction to inhalation of hypertonic saline. This is distinctly unusual in&#xD;
             cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis within 2&#xD;
             weeks of the exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being started simultaneously on inhaled and oral antibiotics.&#xD;
             Patients who are routinely receiving inhaled antibiotics as part of their chronic&#xD;
             management and continue inhaled antibiotics as previously scheduled will not be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
