  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness between polyp removal with or&#xD;
      without electrical current. The investigators want to include 600 polyps in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that polyps have the potential to develop to cancer if left in situ, but the&#xD;
      investigators do not know the best way to remove them completely.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to compare to widely used methods for polyp removal; hot&#xD;
      and cold snare polypectomy. There has not been performed any big studies on this subject&#xD;
      earlier, but current knowledge indicates that hot polypectomy (i.e. with use of electrical&#xD;
      current) is somewhat better with regard to complete resection of polyps compared to cold&#xD;
      polypectomy (without electrical current).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the patients will be randomized to either hot or cold polypectomy. The&#xD;
      investigators will distribute videos of how the polypectomies should be performed, and a&#xD;
      gastroenterologist in the project group will instruct the doctors examining the patients to&#xD;
      make sure that everyone performs polypectomy according to current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in this arm will have their polyps removed by cold polypectomy, i.e. a metal sling that is closed around the basis of the polyp, and the polyp is cut off.&#xD;
After removal there will be taken biopsies from the resection margins, and both the polyp and the biopsies will be examined by a histopathologist to see if the polyp is removed completely.</description>
