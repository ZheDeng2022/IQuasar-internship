  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a frequent consequence of amputation, and it is notoriously&#xD;
      difficult to treat. Amputation usually follows traumatic injuries or surgery following&#xD;
      vascular diseases, diabetes, osteomyelitis or tumours in cases where the loss of the limb is&#xD;
      required for the survival of the patient. The loss of a limb or other body parts is usually&#xD;
      followed by the sensation that the lost body part is still present and can be felt. These&#xD;
      phenomena are called, respectively, phantom awareness and phantom sensation. In 50-80% of&#xD;
      amputees neuropathic pain develops in the lost limb also referred to as phantom limb pain&#xD;
      (PLP). PLP can be related to a certain position or movement of the phantom limb, and might be&#xD;
      elicited or worsened by a range of physical factors (e.g. changes in the weather or pressure&#xD;
      on the residual limb) and psychological factors (e.g. emotional stress). It is well known&#xD;
      that most treatments available for PLP today, such as pharmacological, surgical, anaesthetic,&#xD;
      psychological and other, are ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today it is believed that phantom limb pain may be related to changes in the cortex of the&#xD;
      brain. There is evidence that these changes may be modulated - or even reversed - by&#xD;
      providing sensory input to the stump or amputation zone. For example, cortical reorganization&#xD;
      and alleviation of phantom limb pain has been observed in amputees following intense use of a&#xD;
      hand prosthesis. However, there is no consistent knowledge on which type of peripheral&#xD;
      sensory feedback may be effective in affecting the cortical plasticity or on how to best&#xD;
      apply the sensory feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to create natural, meaningful sensations through&#xD;
      providing non-invasive sensory feedback (i.e. surface electrical stimulation) and the&#xD;
      effectiveness to alleviate phantom limb pain and restore the cortical neuroplastic changes.&#xD;

      Purpose of the experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50-80 % of persons with amputations experience pain in the part of the body that is&#xD;
      missing. This phenomenon is called phantom limb pain. It is not clear today why phantom limb&#xD;
      pain occurs, and since the pain can be difficult to treat, it can affect the quality of life.&#xD;
      Other scientific studies have shown, that the use of electrical stimulation applied through&#xD;
      surface electrodes, can assist to decrease or alleviate the phantom limb pain. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate if daily surface electrical stimulation for a period of 30 days&#xD;
      can decrease or alleviate the phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study begins, it will be necessary to test if the participant can tolerate the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation and that the participant fulfill all criteria for participating in the&#xD;
      study. During the study, different electrical stimulation sequences will be applied. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires before, during and after the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, to describe how the electrical stimulation is experienced, and if the&#xD;
      stimulation had an effect on the phantom limb pain and phantom sensations. The participant&#xD;
      will also be asked about their general mood to investigate if this has an effect on the pain.&#xD;
      The brain signals of the participants brain signals will be measured twice with either&#xD;
      surface electrodes or with a scanning technique, while the participant is thinking about&#xD;
      moving the amputated arm/hand or leg, while moving the healthy arm/leg, or while receiving&#xD;
      electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for the experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will take place over a period of three months and consists of a series of&#xD;
      measurement and intervention sessions planned in five phases. All sessions will take place at&#xD;
      Aalborg University, Denmark except for the days when the brain signals are measured by using&#xD;
      the scanning technique, which will take place at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. Interview and meeting with the subject (before the experiment begins, 1 session, 1-2&#xD;
      hours). Before the experiment begins, the participant is invited to a meeting and interview&#xD;
      with project responsible to inform the participant about the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. Preliminary investigation (1 session of maximum 3 hours before the experiment&#xD;
      starts). Before the experiment starts, but after the participant has signed the informed&#xD;
      consent, the investigators will test if the participant can tolerate the electrical&#xD;
      stimulation. If all criteria for participation are fulfilled, the participation of the&#xD;
      subject will be decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. Baseline measurements (day 1-27, 2 weekly sessions, maximum of 3 hours for each&#xD;
      session). Before the repeated, electrical stimulation sessions begin, a series of baseline&#xD;
      measurements will be performed. In this phase the sensory threshold (i.e., the level of the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation that you can feel) will be measured, and the electrical stimulation&#xD;
      parameters determined. The brain signals of the participant will be measured by a scanning&#xD;
      technique (so-called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI) and by surface electrodes&#xD;
      placed oh the scalp (so-called electroencephalographic recordings or EEG). On the day that&#xD;
      the brain signals are measured the session may last up to 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4. Intervention period (day 28-56, 2-5 weekly sessions, maximum of 3 hours for each&#xD;
      session). In these sessions, electrical stimulation will be applied through surface&#xD;
      electrodes placed on the upper arm/the stump or the leg. The participant will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a series of questionnaires to report on the phantom limb pain, phantom sensations&#xD;
      (i.e., non-painful sensations) and their general mood. Again the participant's brain signals&#xD;
      will be measured using the scanning and the surface electrode techniques. On the day that the&#xD;
      brain signals are measured the session may last up to 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 5. Follow-up (day 57-112, 4 weekly session over 8 weeks of maximum 3 hours). To measure&#xD;
      the effect and duration of the intervention the participant will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      series of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface stimulation may cause muscle-contractions. Attachment of the surface electrodes may&#xD;
      cause the skin to become red or irritated for some hours following the experiment. The type&#xD;
      of electrical stimulation used in this experiment is not associated with any known risks or&#xD;
      side effects. When the sensory threshold is determined (i.e., the lowest strength of the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation that the participant can feel), it may feel unpleasant or painful for&#xD;
      a short period of time, but the unpleasantness or pain will disappear as soon as the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation stops. The electrical stimulation applied during the intervention&#xD;
      period will be adjusted such that is it not painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the brain signals using the fMRI-technique (scanning) is safe, and there are&#xD;
      no known risks or side effects of this procedure. The participant may, however, find that&#xD;
      being placed inside the scanner is unpleasant. Measurement of the brain signals with surface&#xD;
      electrodes is also considered safe, and there are no known risks or side effects of this&#xD;
      procedure. There may be risks associated with the experiment that are unknown to the&#xD;
      investigators. Therefore, the participant is asked to inform the investigators if the&#xD;
      participant experiences any health problems during the experiment. If the investigators&#xD;
      discover any side effects, the participant will be informed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no benefits for the subject by participation in the study. However, the&#xD;
      participant may find that his/her phantom limb pain is alleviated during the experiment as a&#xD;
      result of the electrical stimulation. However, it is not possible for the investigators to&#xD;
      predict if the electrical stimulation will affect the phantom limb pain, when the effect will&#xD;
      start, how large the effect will be, or how long the effect will last. It is not possible to&#xD;
      offer the participants a permanent or lasting solution after termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion from and suspension of the experiment&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant, according to the assessment of the investigator, react unexpectedly on&#xD;
      the procedures or in any other way are not suitable for continuing in the experiment, the&#xD;
      participation in the experiment can be terminated at any time. In general, the experiment&#xD;
      will be terminated if it turns out that the subjects in general cannot tolerate the&#xD;
      procedures of the project or find the experiment too exhausting.&#xD;
