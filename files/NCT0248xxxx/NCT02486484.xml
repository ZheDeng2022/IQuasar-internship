    <textblock>
      Background/aims: Aflibercept is an approved therapy for neovascular macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion and other retinal conditions.&#xD;
      Ziv-aflibercept is also approved by FDA and is extremely cost-effective relative to the&#xD;
      expensive same molecule aflibercept. In vitro and in vivo studies did not detect toxicity to&#xD;
      the retinal pigment epithelium cells using the approved cancer protein, ziv-aflibercept.&#xD;
      Ziv-aflibercept had no loss of anti-VEGF activity when kept at 4°C in polycarbonate syringes&#xD;
      over 4 weeks. Similar to bevacizumab, compounded ziv-aflibercept would yield a tremendous&#xD;
      saving compared to aflibercept or ranibizumab. Phase I studies and case reports did not&#xD;
      report any untoward toxic effects but attested to the clinical efficacy of the medication.&#xD;
      Our purpose is to ascertain the long-term safety and efficacy in various retinal diseases of&#xD;
      intravitreal ziv-aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospectively, consecutive patients with retinal disease that require aflibercept&#xD;
      (AMD, DME, RVO, and others) will undergo instead the same molecule ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      intravitreal injection of 0.05 ml of fresh filtered ziv-aflibercept (1.25mg). Monitoring of&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular inflammation, cataract progression, and retinal&#xD;
      structure by spectral domain OCT to be done initially, one month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2&#xD;
      years after injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results: Analyze signs of retinal toxicity, intraocular inflammation, or change&#xD;
      in lens status, together with best corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness at 1&#xD;
      month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 year. Anticipated Conclusions: Off label use of ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      improves visual acuity without ocular toxicity and offers a cheaper alternative to the same&#xD;
      molecule aflibercept (or lucentis), especially in the third world similar to bevacizumab.&#xD;

      Ascertain the long term safety and efficacy of ziv-aflibercept in a large variety of ocular&#xD;
      diseases and over a long-term after its proven safety and efficacy in the laboratory, in&#xD;
      phase one study and in isolated case report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-VEGF therapy is currently one of the mainstay of therapy in a great number of diseases&#xD;
      of the eye with intravitreal injections of antiVEGF being the number one procedure done in&#xD;
      the office of an ophthalmology practice. The ophthalmic community has currently 2 very&#xD;
      expensive antiVEGF both approved by the FDA for ocular use: Ranibizumab and aflibercept.&#xD;
      However because of the prohibitive cost of these medications in the third world and the need&#xD;
      for repetitive use of these agents in the control of eye disease, the off-label use of&#xD;
      bevacizumab is currently the most common anti-VEGF used worldwide because of its equivalent&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy and cost-effective superiority. Bevacizumab and ranibizumab have high&#xD;
      affinity to VEGF, aflibercept possess additional properties. Aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron,&#xD;
      Tarrytown, New York, USA and Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany) is a fusion protein&#xD;
      consisting of the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin IgG1 and the extracellular domains of&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1), which binds to&#xD;
      circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thus acting as a decoy receptor.&#xD;
      Laboratory studies and clinical trials suggest that aflibercept's high binding affinity for&#xD;
      VEGF may impart greater durability of activity and similar efficacy compared to ranibizumab1&#xD;
      or bevacizumab. Aflibercept is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the therapy&#xD;
      of wet age related macular degeneration (AMD) , macular edema from retinal vein occlusion or&#xD;
      diabetes.3 Ranibizumab is given monthly, while aflibercept is given bimonthly after 3 monthly&#xD;
      injections for eyes with wet AMD. Because of the high cost of ranibizumab and aflibercept, a&#xD;
      majority of ophthalmologists worldwide tend to treat patients with bevacizumab at a major&#xD;
      saving for the patient. Commercially, a much cheaper yet identical fusion protein to&#xD;
      aflibercept is ziv-aflibercept. Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap, Sanofi-Aventis US, LLC,&#xD;
      Bridgewater, NJ and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Tarrytown, NY) was approved by FDA in&#xD;
      August 2012 for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma resistant to an&#xD;
      oxiplatin-containing regimen. One may wonder if ziv-aflibercept can be used instead of&#xD;
      aflibercept in ophthalmic disorders. Hence the need to answer some major safety concerns:&#xD;
      first the difference in osmolarity, and second whether ziv-aflibercept could impair retinal&#xD;
      function and alter morphology6. A preliminary study was conducted on the use of&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept in patients with exudative AMD or diabetic macular edema (DME) with poor&#xD;
      vision. In addition, the investigators tested the stability of ziv-aflibercept over a period&#xD;
      of 4 weeks and the economic implications of the use of compounded drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ziv-aflibercept is supplied in single-use vials of 100 mg per 4 ml and 200 mg per 8 ml&#xD;
      formulated as 25 mg/mL ziv-aflibercept in polysorbate 20 (0.1%), sodium chloride (100 mM),&#xD;
      sodium citrate (5 mM), sodium phosphate (5 mM), and sucrose (20%), in Water for Injection&#xD;
      USP, at a pH of 6.2. Eylea is supplied as a single-use, glass vial designed to deliver 0.05&#xD;
      mL (2mg) of aflibercept (40 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM sodium chloride, 0.03%&#xD;
      polysorbate 20, and 5% sucrose, pH 6.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: inject intravitreal ziv-aflibercept according to published protocols approved by&#xD;
      FDA (PROTOCOL A and PROTOCOL B, PROTOCOL C, PROTOCOL D, and other published aflibercept&#xD;
      protocols or protocols to be approved or under study for other diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective nonrandomized open label long-term interventional clinical study in&#xD;
      patients with subfoveal CNV, extrafoveal CNV due to AMD or other diseases (myopia,&#xD;
      inflammatory, angioid streaks, traumatic, idiopathic), DME, BVO or CRVO-related macular&#xD;
      edema, diabetic vitreous hemorrhage, and any disease requiring anti-VEGF therapy. The&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are summarized in tables 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have to sign a study consent form for the off-label use of intravitreal&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept that is approved by FDA for oncology and the same molecule under different&#xD;
      osmolarity for eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Patients All patients will have to sign a study consent form for the&#xD;
      off-label use of intravitreal ziv-aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment work up Initial work-up will include best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using&#xD;
      ETDRS acuity charts, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, dilated fundus&#xD;
      examination, and fluorescein angiography. Pretreatment macular thickness will be measured&#xD;
      with ocular coherence tomography (OCT) for all eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal injection of ziv-aflibercept The hospital pharmacy will divide 4cc vial of&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept (ZALTRAP) purchased by the Ophthalmology Department, into twenty 1 cc&#xD;
      syringes using aseptic techniques. Therefore, each syringe will contain 0.2 ml of&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept. The syringes will be stored at 4 degrees Celsius for no longer than 30 days.&#xD;
      The eye to be treated will be prepared with 5% povidone-iodine solution. Topical Anesthesia&#xD;
      will be administered. Using a 30-gauge needle, 0.05 ml ziv-aflibercept will be injected&#xD;
      intravitreally through the pars plana 3.5 mm from the limbus. If the intraocular pressure is&#xD;
      greater than 25 mmHg or the optic nerve head is not adequately perfused 20 minutes after the&#xD;
      injection (if patient reports poor vision of hand motion or less), then a paracentesis will&#xD;
      be performed. There is no need to either patch the eye or use topical antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-injection follow-up Patients will be examined every month after the injection. At each&#xD;
      visit, BCVA will be measured along with slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment and&#xD;
      dilated fundus examination. OCT will be repeated at each follow-up. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed as per the standard approach delineated in the aflibercept trials for AMD or DME. In&#xD;
      case of unusually recurrent CNV or DME based on OCT, fluorescein angiography, clinical&#xD;
      examination or decrease in vision additional injections may be done depending on the&#xD;
      particular case above and beyond the standard protocols. The total follow-up period of the&#xD;
      extended study will be 24 months for each patient. Patients and data collection will span&#xD;
      over a period of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome The main outcome measures will be improvement in visual acuity, decrease in&#xD;
      central retinal thickness, and stability of lesion size in AMD or retinopathy in DME. The&#xD;
      paired Student's t-test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks Potential risks due to the injection itself are minimal. However patients&#xD;
      have about 0.2% risk of eye infection. Retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage are&#xD;
      extremely rare potential risks. No untoward effects are expected from aflibercept itself.&#xD;
      From our experience and others, no signs of ocular toxicity were noted in already treated&#xD;
      eyes. But the investigators will again look at any sign of cataract or corneal toxicity. In&#xD;
      addition, intraocular inflammation is known to occur at a rate of 0.2% of any anti-VEGF&#xD;
      including aflibercept. Such cases will be recorded and treated with anti-inflammatory agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL A (AMD) adapted from VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 In eyes with wet AMD, involved eyes are&#xD;
      treated every 4 weeks for 3 initial monthly injections, then every 8 weeks till year 1.&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated monthly to determine the need for treatment and were treated at least&#xD;
      every 12 weeks (capped PRN regimen) 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL B (BVO) adapted from VIBRANT The recommended dosage for CRVO is monthly injection&#xD;
      till month 6 then monthly monitoring and PRN dosing PROTOCOL C (CRVO) adapted from COPERNICUS&#xD;
      and GALILEO The recommended dosage for CRVO is monthly injection till month 6 then monthly&#xD;
      monitoring and PRN dosing PROTOCOL D (DME) adapted from VISTA and VIVID The recommended&#xD;
      dosage for DME treatment is 5 initial monthly injections followed by one injection every 8&#xD;
      weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject identification, recruitment, and compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation for participation: None (Compensation relates to 25 times saving of the very&#xD;
      expensive drug). The department of ophthalmology would cover the cost of complication from&#xD;
      the study, i.e. like treating the patient with endophthalmitis with necessary antibiotics&#xD;
      intravitreal and systemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each collaborator will supply the data with the initials only of the patients to keep patient&#xD;
      anonymity under full protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who is a candidate for anti-VEGF therapy for ocular disease is offered this form&#xD;
      of therapy such as: choroidal neovascularization of any kind (age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration, myopia, inflammatory, angioid streak, trauma, laser induced, idiopathic) and&#xD;
      maculopathy or retinopathy from diabetes mellitus, branch or central retinal vein occlusion,&#xD;
      or other occlusive anterior or posterior pole disorders (neovascular glaucoma, rubeosis&#xD;
      iridis, corneal neovascularization, angry pterygium, surgical or traumatic fibrovascular&#xD;
      ingrowth), and tumor-associated new vessel formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/benefit assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk for endophthalmitis of 0.2% with any intraocular injection. Benefit is visual&#xD;
      restoration and avoidance of blindness outweigh the risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs to the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have a regular charge of the medication (100,000 LL or 66 USD) similar to&#xD;
      the off-label use of bevacizumab. Ranibizumab or aflibercept or dexamethasone implants cost&#xD;
      each 25 times more, knowing that ziv-aflibercept and aflibercept represent the same molecule&#xD;
      exactly. So the investigators are giving the patient the same active product at lower price.&#xD;
      This is a major difference between ranibizumab and bevacizumab (different molecule) with 25&#xD;
      times cheaper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy, Data Storage and Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of the files will be maintained using coded data under the supervision of Dr&#xD;
      AMM. Reference between subject code and identity, demographic data, and medical data entered&#xD;
      on study sheets will be maintained in a locked drawer in Dr AMM, and on a password-protected&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
