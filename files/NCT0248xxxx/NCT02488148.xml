  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial stiffening and endothelial dysfunction are correlates of advancing age contributing&#xD;
      to the decline in cardioprotection with age. Arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      are emerging risk factors for cardiovascular disease and predict future cardiac events.&#xD;
      Vascular function has long been a target for lifestyle interventions with several studies&#xD;
      showing improvements traditional exercise modes. However, the impact of yoga on vascular&#xD;
      function remains elusive. This study will determine the effect of a 12-week Bikram yoga&#xD;
      intervention on arterial stiffness and endothelial function in healthy, middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Bikram yoga in improving&#xD;
      vascular endothelial function and arterial distensibility in middle-aged adults with risk&#xD;
      factors for coronary artery disease and to determine whether the heated environment plays a&#xD;
      role in mediating these alterations in vascular function. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      conduct a 12-week Bikram yoga intervention study in sedentary individuals in order to test&#xD;
      the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bikram yoga will elicit reductions in arterial stiffness and enhancements in endothelial&#xD;
           function in sedentary, middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The postulated effects of Bikram yoga will be greater when practiced in a heated&#xD;
           environment.&#xD;

      Bikram yoga is a trademarked form of yoga in which a series of 26 yoga postures are performed&#xD;
      in a heated (41ºC), humidified environment over a 90-minute period. Bikram yoga has rapidly&#xD;
      gained popularity with approximately 300 studios currently operating in the U.S. The&#xD;
      90-minute session consists of pranayama (breathing), and standing, balancing, strengthening,&#xD;
      and stretching asanas (postures) all performed in a sauna-like environment. Although this&#xD;
      highly controlled style of yoga provides an optimal choice for interventional research&#xD;
      studies, few studies have attempted to elucidate the health benefits associated with Bikram&#xD;
      yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: heated Bikram yoga (41ºC), room&#xD;
      temperature Bikram yoga (22ºC), or control in which the participants will be instructed not&#xD;
      to alter physical activity patterns. Collected data from this interventional study will be&#xD;
      analyzed by ANOVA and/or ANCOVA with repeated measures. Pearson correlation coefficients will&#xD;
      be used to examine associations between variables of interest. A significance level of p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be employed to determine statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 sedentary (&lt;2 days of physical activity weekly) male and female adults between&#xD;
      the ages of 40 and 60 years will be recruited and studied. Twenty subjects in each group will&#xD;
      complete 12 weeks of Bikram yoga at room temperature (22ºC), Bikram yoga in a heated&#xD;
      environment (41ºC), or a control period during which participants will be instructed not to&#xD;
      alter physical activity levels. Based on a previous study competed by the investigators which&#xD;
      employed Bikram yoga as an intervention, a dropout rate of 25% is anticipated. Therefore, as&#xD;
      the goal of the investigators is to have a minimum of 60 subjects (20 per group) complete the&#xD;
      12-week intervention, the investigators will recruit and enroll 80 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants report to the laboratory, height and weight will be measured and a finger&#xD;
      prick will be performed. Body composition will then be measured via dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function will be measured non-invasively via flow-mediated dilation. This&#xD;
      technique involves ultrasound imaging of the upper arm to obtain an image of the brachial&#xD;
      artery. Once baseline images are acquired, a cuff placed around the forearm will be inflated&#xD;
      for 5 minutes. More images will be acquired after the cuff is deflated and the images will be&#xD;
      analyzed to determine the percent change in arterial diameter from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness will be measured using pulse wave velocity. Tonometric sensors will be&#xD;
      placed on the carotid and femoral pulse sites and blood pressure cuffs placed on the arms and&#xD;
      ankles to determine brachial and tibial arterial blood pressure. The distance between the&#xD;
      carotid and femoral pulse sites will be measured and pulse wave velocity will be determined&#xD;
      as distance traveled divided by the time between the initiation of the carotid and femoral&#xD;
      pulses.&#xD;
