    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of genetic testing on healthcare&#xD;
      decisions and patient outcomes for patients suffering from pain, cardiovascular problems,&#xD;
      Arthritis, Type II Diabetes, and/or Mental Health disorders. Results of genetic testing will&#xD;
      also be compared with the clinical outcome measures collected to discover novel genetic&#xD;
      factors that may influence patient care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular basis of many pharmacogenetic polymorphisms has now been elucidated, with&#xD;
      genetic variations resulting in alteration of expression or function of receptors, enzymes,&#xD;
      and transporters relevant to the safety and efficacy of a medical treatment. Genetics has&#xD;
      been shown to be a significant factor in the variability of responses of medication choices&#xD;
      and doses. With the rapid development of cost-effective high throughput molecular genotyping&#xD;
      methods, pharmacogenetics has become increasingly important because of its potential to&#xD;
      identify patients with increased risk of adverse drug reactions or decreased likelihood of&#xD;
      response at standard dosage of drug. By identifying the genetic risks and the most effective&#xD;
      therapy for an individual patient, clinicians may improve the efficacy of treatment and&#xD;
      decrease the risk of adverse drug events. The addition of pharmacogenetic testing to routine&#xD;
      clinical practice may also be extremely helpful because of the cost reduction associated with&#xD;
      the identification of patients that will not respond to expensive drugs or with the&#xD;
      identification of patients likely to suffer from severe adverse events. There are also&#xD;
      tremendous efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to lower the cost for drug development;&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics may fulfill the need to provide the right drug to the right patient and to&#xD;
      increase the likelihood of success of large phase II and phase III clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how currently available genetic tests are being&#xD;
      implemented in various clinics around the United States, and whether this information results&#xD;
      in benefits to patient care. Patients presenting to clinics with pain, cardiovascular&#xD;
      conditions, Arthritis, Type II Diabetes, and/or Mental Health disorders that are receiving&#xD;
      Proove Bioscience's genetic testing will complete validated questionnaires to measure&#xD;
      specific outcomes related to their treatment at each clinical visit, including medication&#xD;
      efficacy, reduction in adverse drug events, and healthcare utilization. Physicians will&#xD;
      document any changes made to treatment regimens, including adjustments to medications or&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatments, and any improvements in the outcome measures. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to calculate relationships between genotypic and phenotypic data&#xD;
      points collected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide a measurable understanding of the medical and economic&#xD;
      value of implementing genetic testing into clinical care. Furthermore, data points collected&#xD;
      will be used to examine novel correlations and associations between single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms and longitudinal clinical outcome measures.&#xD;
