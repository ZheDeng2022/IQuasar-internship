    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-881 in gliomas, that harbor an IDH1and/or IDH2&#xD;
      mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients&#xD;
      will receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion&#xD;
      phase where patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. The anticipated time on study treatment&#xD;
      is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator&#xD;
