    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether combining electronic nicotine&#xD;
      delivery systems (ENDS) with nicotine patch treatment will augment abstinence rates compared&#xD;
      to either treatment alone.&#xD;

      Cigarette smokers, who are motivated to quit smoking but who rate the inhalation aspects of&#xD;
      smoking as important will be randomized to three groups: Group 1. Nicotine ENDS + nicotine&#xD;
      patch; Group 2: Nicotine ENDS + placebo patch; Group 3: Placebo ENDS + Nicotine patch.&#xD;
      Participants will initially receive 1 week of 21 mg nicotine (or placebo) skin patches while&#xD;
      continuing to smoke their usual cigarettes ad lib, in order to assess responsiveness to&#xD;
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Starting with week 2, participants will receive&#xD;
      nicotine-containing (or placebo) ENDS devices (menthol or non-menthol versions in accordance&#xD;
      with their baseline preference). They will also be instructed to substitute ENDS for as many&#xD;
      cigarettes as possible in this week. The target quit-smoking date will occur at the beginning&#xD;
      of week 3. Treatments will continue until week 8 post-quit, at which time participants will&#xD;
      be instructed to reduce ENDS use over the next 4 weeks, at which time ENDS will no longer be&#xD;
      dispensed. Subsequently, the nicotine patch dose will be gradually reduced according to&#xD;
      standard weaning regimen from 21 mg/24 h to 14 mg/24 h for 2 weeks, and 7 mg/ 24 h for 2&#xD;
      weeks. All nicotine-based treatments will end at week 16 after the quit date.&#xD;

    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4-8 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 4-8 post target Quit Day while treatment is ongoing. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 8). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking after withdrawal of ENDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9-12 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 9-12 post target Quit Day while participants are decreasing their use of ENDS. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 12). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking after withdrawal of nicotine patches</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 13-16 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 13-16 post target Quit Day while participants are using decreasing doses of nicotine patches. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 16). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seven-day point abstinence from smoking at 6 months post Quit Day</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be seven-day abstinence from smoking at six months post target Quit Day. This will be determined by self-report of no smoking for the previous seven days when called for 6-month follow-up, verified by expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at 6-month follow-up visit). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
