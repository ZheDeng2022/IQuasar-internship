  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in oral health among children, children living in areas characterized by&#xD;
      low socio-economic status still have a significant disease burden with regard to dental&#xD;
      caries. Special efforts to prevent disease development in this group of children have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful. Small children with extensive treatment needs often have limited abilities to&#xD;
      cooperate and to provide quality dental care in this patient group, general aneaethesia (GA)&#xD;
      may often be the treatment modality of choice. Preschool children treated under general&#xD;
      anesthesia have significantly higher caries prevalence (deft and defs), apical parodontitis&#xD;
      and infection due to pulpal necrosis. They also have significantly more emergency visits and&#xD;
      previous use of treatment under sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aim to test the hypothesis, that a telephone based case management intervention&#xD;
      for children with severe early childhood caries can prevent further caries development in&#xD;
      preschool children who are treated under general anesthesia for severe early childhood&#xD;
      caries.&#xD;

      Consecutive children (n=130) who are referred to the departments of pediatric dentistry at&#xD;
      Eastman Dental Institute, Public Dental Service and Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet,&#xD;
      who fulfill inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the study. This is done during&#xD;
      the visits preceding the anesthetic evaluation of the patient. Parents will be given written&#xD;
      information about the study. During the last visit preceding the GA, a contact is established&#xD;
      between dental health coach and family. During this visit the aim of the project is explained&#xD;
      and an agreement is signed and informed consent is obtained from the parents only (the&#xD;
      parents are the target for this intervention, it is they who perform the preventive oral&#xD;
      health measures and supports the child). During this interview, the parents will also answer&#xD;
      a structured interview measuring level of self-efficacy and well as their thoughts on dental&#xD;
      health care as well as why the situation has occurred. After the initial interview patients&#xD;
      are assigned to either intervention group (dental health coach group) or to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dental healthcoach will keep in close contact with the intervention group, and by&#xD;
      telephone based support provide information, support parental self-efficacy, motivate the&#xD;
      family to keep preventive measures that have been individually agreed on, motivate parents to&#xD;
      keep preventive appointments and to provide tools for caries prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit is scheduled after 1 year. Parents who decline participation in the program&#xD;
      will receive treatment as usual and will be followed for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will receive treatment as usual. This means recall visits to&#xD;
      the dental clinic within 3 months after the procedure, reinforcing the individually tailored&#xD;
      preventive program. Recall visits after that are scheduled based on treatment needs. A&#xD;
      follow-up visit is scheduled after 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries will be diagnosed at baseline ( during GA) and progression will be monitored according&#xD;
      to ICDAS after 12 and 24 months. Plaque and gingivitis will be registered.&#xD;
