      Purpose: To understand the baseline knowledge on the transition of care to adult providers in&#xD;
      hospitalized adolescent patients and to test if an educational intervention given during an&#xD;
      inpatient stay in a medium size academic pediatric hospital affects perception of knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and participation in transition planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Question: Will a video-based educational intervention in an academic&#xD;
      pediatric hospital affect perception of knowledge, attitudes and participation in transition&#xD;
      planning to adult oriented health care of the hospitalized adolescent?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Question: What is the baseline experience of the hospitalized adolescent&#xD;
      in key elements of transitioning to adult oriented health care?&#xD;

      Purpose: To understand the baseline knowledge on the transition of care to adult providers in&#xD;
      hospitalized adolescent patients and to test if an educational intervention given during an&#xD;
      inpatient stay in a medium size academic pediatric hospital affects perception of knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and participation in transition planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the effect of viewing a video-based educational intervention in an&#xD;
      academic pediatric hospital affect perception of knowledge, attitudes and participation in&#xD;
      transition planning to adult oriented health care of the hospitalized adolescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To describe the baseline experience and knowledge base of hospitalized adolescents&#xD;
      regarding key elements of transitioning to adult-oriented health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of subjects: There will be approximately 140 subjects assuming approximately 50%&#xD;
           attrition by the third survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender of Subjects: Subjects of either gender will be part of the study. Discrepancies&#xD;
           in gender will be related to the patient population at the time of the study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age of Subjects: The age range will be 15 to 25 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Racial and Ethnic Origin: There will be no enrollment restrictions based on race. It is&#xD;
           expected that the racial distribution of our study population will mirror that of the&#xD;
           inpatient pediatric patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study will be achieved by surveying all eligible subjects admitted to the&#xD;
      children's hospital. Eligible patients will be identified by the daily unit census in the&#xD;
      children's hospital, excluding the patients outlined under exclusion criteria. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from their parents and patients will assent to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Personal health information and contact information will be collected with parents&#xD;
      present by study investigator prior to randomization of subjects and will be stored&#xD;
      separately from other survey data stored in a secure database on a password protected&#xD;
      computer. All paper files will be kept in a locked office.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the time of enrollment patients will be stratified by age for block randomization in&#xD;
           order to have balanced intervention and control groups. The age groups will be 15-16&#xD;
           year old control or intervention group vs 17 years old and greater control or&#xD;
           intervention group. Both groups will be asked to complete three surveys during the&#xD;
           course of the study; in terms of education, the control groups will receive standard&#xD;
           care education while the intervention group will view an educational video on transition&#xD;
           from adolescent to adult oriented health care. All subjects will be oriented to the use&#xD;
           of the Get Well Network in order to access the surveys via SurveyMonkey© (Palo Alto,&#xD;
           CA). The first survey will consist of 40 questions. A number of first survey questions&#xD;
           were obtained and modified from the web questionnaire of 2007 Survey of Adult Transition&#xD;
           and Health (SATH) from Department of Health and Human Services, Maternal and Child&#xD;
           Health Bureau (MCHB) of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Other&#xD;
           questions from the Health-Care, Self Determination questionnaire packets relating to&#xD;
           treatment self-regulation and perceived competence have been modified to focus on&#xD;
           independence in health care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After completing the first survey the intervention group subject will then be prompted&#xD;
           via an embedded html link within the survey to watch a seven minute educational video.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Prior to discharge from the hospital, participants in both groups will be asked to&#xD;
           complete a second survey assessing willingness to prepare for the transition to adult&#xD;
           oriented medical care, and actions taken during the hospital stay. Possible actions&#xD;
           include taking a tour of an adult unit, discussing health insurance changes with a&#xD;
           social worker, asking for a copy of a sample medical summary or requesting information&#xD;
           about adult primary care and/or specialty providers. Patients will be given a reminder&#xD;
           in person or via Facebook, phone, text or e-mail to complete the second survey via&#xD;
           SurveyMonkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Approximately 4 weeks after hospital discharge a reminder via Facebook, phone, text or&#xD;
           e-mail will be sent to complete the third survey via SurveyMonkey©. If the subject does&#xD;
           not have access to the internet, then the survey will be administered by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review will be performed to record each subject's type of health&#xD;
      insurance and chronic illness based on the medical chart from the current hospitalization.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made between the patient's awareness of his underlying chronic illness and&#xD;
      compared with health care providers' documentation of underlying chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Monitoring Data will be statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      such as mean and standard deviation, chi square testing and regression analysis. Excel, SPSS&#xD;
      and SAS will be used for statistical calculations. Dr. Keely Dwyer-Matzky , the principal&#xD;
      investigator will be responsible for ensuring the privacy of the data. Since there is minimal&#xD;
      risk a data and safety monitoring plan is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage and Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      SurveyMonkey© is a confidential proprietary survey tool that collates quantitative data and&#xD;
      written comments into convenient reports. SurveyMonkey© uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)&#xD;
      technology, which protects user information through both server authentication and data&#xD;
      encryption, ensuring that user data is safe, secure, and available only to authorized&#xD;
      persons. Investigators will protect all health identifiers. Data downloaded from&#xD;
      SurveyMonkey© will be maintained on electronic files on a secure server with password&#xD;
      protection. Only authorized researchers will have access to the data. University of Rochester&#xD;
      Office of Human Subjects or research regulatory groups may review these records.&#xD;
