  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) has been developed as a novel technique that&#xD;
      actually enables in vivo microscopic analysis of the gastrointestinal tract, during ongoing&#xD;
      endoscopy. The potential role of CLE has been explored in pathology of both upper and lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, showing good accuracy for predicting the final histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis, based on immediate evaluation of tissue and vascular patterns. Because of its&#xD;
      minute scanning area, this techology is best used in conjunction with other &quot;red-flag&quot;&#xD;
      techniques to screen the mucosa for areas of interest, which can then be examined by CLE for&#xD;
      a histological diagnosis. I-scan technology (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) is a new image-enhanced&#xD;
      endoscopic technique that can achieve a virtual chromoendoscopy, but until now there have&#xD;
      been no studies to determine the role of this technology in the evaluation of activity in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease. The study protocol is based on comparing imaging findings of&#xD;
      p-CLE in conjunction with I-scan endoscopy with activity score and histological diagnosis of&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease. CLE might have an important role in IBD patients management, by&#xD;
      assessing the inflammation, dysplasia or response to treatment.&#xD;

      The value of I-Scan and Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy for the assessment of chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Colonoscopy plays an important role in the diagnosis, assessment of activity,&#xD;
      extension and response to therapy in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Conventional&#xD;
      examination underestimates extent and activity of the disease compared with histology,&#xD;
      therefore, mucosal biopsy is a critical component of endoscopic examination of these&#xD;
      patients. Taking multiple biopsies is time consuming, carries a low but not negligible risk&#xD;
      of secondary hemorrahage, and causes a delay in diagnosis, whilst awaiting histological&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy has emerged in recent years as a novel technique that actually&#xD;
      enables in vivo microscopic analysis during ongoing endoscopy. Endomicroscopy can be&#xD;
      performed either with a dedicated endoscope (eCLE) or with miniprobe-based systems (pCLE)&#xD;
      [1]. It is a contrast based technique, the most widely used agent being the intravenously&#xD;
      administered fluorescein [2]. The probe-based endomicroscopy system consists of a flexible&#xD;
      catheter probe representing a bundle of optical fibers linked to a micro-objective, a laser&#xD;
      scanning unit and the control and acquisition software (Cellvizio; Mauna Kea Technology,&#xD;
      Paris, France). The flexible confocal miniprobes were specifically designed to be passed&#xD;
      through the working channels of standard endoscopes, biliary catheters or cholangioscopes and&#xD;
      thus the pCLE system can be easily integrated into any endoscopy unit. The principle of the&#xD;
      technique is based on a laser beam of defined wavelength being focused towards the targeted&#xD;
      tissue and the recaptured signal is displayed as 'optical biopsies' in a single horizontal&#xD;
      plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential role of CLE has been explored in pathology of both upper and lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, showing good accuracy for predicting the final histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis based on immediate evaluation of tissue and vascular patterns [3]. Because of its&#xD;
      minute scanning area, this techology is best used in conjunction with other &quot;red-flag&quot;&#xD;
      techniques to screen the mucosa for areas of interest, which can then be examined by CLE for&#xD;
      a histological diagnosis [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-scan technology (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) is a new image-enhanced endoscopic technique,&#xD;
      consisting of three types of algorithms: surface enhancement (SE; enhancement of the&#xD;
      structure through recognition of the edges), contrast enhancement (CE; enhancement of&#xD;
      depressed areas and differences in structure through colored presentation of low density&#xD;
      areas) and tone enhancement (TE; enhancement tailored to individual organs through&#xD;
      modification of the combination of RGB components for each pixel) [5,6]. Like narrow band&#xD;
      imaging i-scan can achieve a virtual chromoendoscopy, but until now there have been no&#xD;
      studies to determine the role of this technology in the evaluation of activity in&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of the study is to compare imaging findings of p-CLE in conjunction&#xD;
      with I-scan endoscopy with activity score and histological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods The study will prospectively include patients with active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis or Crohn's disease who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients will&#xD;
      be examined by conventional colonoscopy, followed by I-scan examination and p-CLE, and biopsy&#xD;
      samples will be taken for each segment of the colon. Then, the correlation between histology&#xD;
      as &quot;gold standard&quot;, activity score (Mayo score for ulcerative colitis, respectively Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease Activity Index for Crohn's disease) and imaging findings will be calculated for both&#xD;
      pathological and normal areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt; 18 years old, male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients diagnosed with active ulcerative colitis (MAYO score &gt;3) or Crohn's disease&#xD;
           (CDAI score &gt;150), where an indication for treatment and colonoscopy exists. Newly&#xD;
           diagnosed as well as patients already on oral 5-ASA therapy, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent for colonoscopy and p-CLE examination Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a contraindication to colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy to fluorescein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine or biological&#xD;
           agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for each participant will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal data (name, surname, age, sex)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from previous investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation (stools frequency, rectal bleeding, fever, abdominal pain, extra&#xD;
           intestinal manifestation, abdominal mass) and blood count for activity index calculator&#xD;
           (Mayo score for ulcerative colitis, respectively CDAI score for Crohn disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histological and immunohistochemical findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular analysis findings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be examined by I-scan colonoscopy and the degree and distribution of&#xD;
           the acute inflammation will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  p-CLE examination will follow, after the intravenous administration of the contrast&#xD;
           agent (2.5 ml fluorescein 10%), in every segment of the colon in both normal and&#xD;
           pathological areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Image data will be stored digitally for offline analysis (10-20 seconds movie for each&#xD;
           area examined).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy samples will be taken from each area examined by p-CLE for histological,&#xD;
           immunohistochemical and molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological material collected during the study (this will include one ml of whole blood&#xD;
      and tissue biopsies from normal tissue and from modified areas of 2 to 3 mm each) will be&#xD;
      frozen and stored. When the expected number of participants is reached the samples will&#xD;
      undergo molecular studies for assessing the markers of angiogenesis as detailed further in&#xD;
      the protocol. The biological materials will be stored and analyzed during an estimated time&#xD;
      of 18 months from the start of the trial. After completion of the study the biomaterials will&#xD;
      be disposed of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples for molecular tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected before imaging procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For DNA extraction 2-5 ml of blood can be collected in tubs containing EDTA and&#xD;
                stored at 4°C for a day or transferred to -80°C freezer for longer storage&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For RNA extraction 2-5 ml of blood must be collected in PAX tubs and kept maximum 2&#xD;
                hours at room temperature and then transferred to -80°C freezer for longer storage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible methods to stabilize tissue samples for further molecular analysis&#xD;
      (RNA/DNA/protein):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 0,3-0,5 cm of tissue is stored immediately in a tube containing RNAlater Solution for&#xD;
           approximately 24 hours at 4°C; after this the RNAlater solution is taken out from the&#xD;
           tube (under sterile conditions) and the sample is frozen at -80°C until RNA/DNA&#xD;
           extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 0,3-0,5 cm of tissue is stored immediately in an empty cryogenic tube and thrown in a&#xD;
           container that contains liquid nitrogen or dry ice with methanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  p-CLE findings are recorded and compared with the findings of conventional colonoscopy&#xD;
           and I-scan colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  p-CLE and I-scan colonoscopy findings are compared with the pathological evaluation of&#xD;
           tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of therapy, based on the results of the conventional colonoscopy, I-scan and&#xD;
           p-CLE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registering time of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registering possible complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and side effects Complications may occur during colonoscopy, but they are rare. These&#xD;
      consist of bleeding at the biopsy site which is usually minimal, self-limited and rarely&#xD;
      requires follow-up. Perforation of the bowel is extremely rare. The safety profile of the&#xD;
      contrast agent (fluorescein) showed a very low incidence of side effects. It is not&#xD;
      nephrotoxic and the incidence of hypersensitivity or severe allergic events is low.&#xD;
      Fluorescein is approved for clinical use in EU countries.&#xD;
