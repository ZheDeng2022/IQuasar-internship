      This is an open-label, Phase I study of the bioavailability and safety of BPM31510 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects dosed 2 or 3 times daily for 4 days, after an initial cohort of 6 subjects receiving&#xD;
      a single dose (pre-study cohort). The pre-study cohort subjects will receive 1600 mg as a&#xD;
      single administration. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will consist of 10 patients each. The cohorts&#xD;
      may be enrolled sequentially.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, Phase I study of the bioavailability and safety of Berg Pharma&#xD;
      Molecule 31510 (BPM31510) in healthy subjects dosed 2 or 3 times daily for 4 days, after an&#xD;
      initial cohort of 6 subjects receiving a single dose (pre-study cohort). The pre-study cohort&#xD;
      subjects will receive 1600 mg as a single administration. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will consist&#xD;
      of 10 patients each. Men and women over the age of 18, and in good general health, will&#xD;
      undergo Screening and baseline evaluations up to 21 days prior to dosing. The cohorts may be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will self-administer the all Day 1 doses of study drug under supervision of the&#xD;
      clinic staff. In the pre-study cohort, subjects will be administered a single dose of 1600&#xD;
      mg. In Cohort 1, doses will be administered two times per day before the morning and evening&#xD;
      meals with no less than 8 and no more than 10 hours between doses. Immediately after&#xD;
      administration, subjects will ingest 6 ounces of tap or bottled water. Solid food and drinks,&#xD;
      other than water should be restricted to 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing. In Cohort 2&#xD;
      doses will be administered three times per day before meals, with no less than 4 and no more&#xD;
      than 6 hours between doses. Immediately after administration, subjects will ingest 6 ounces&#xD;
      of tap or bottled water. Solid food and drinks, other than water should be restricted to 2&#xD;
      hours before and 1 hour after dosing. Dosing will continue for an additional 4 days on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis with the last study dose to be administered at the clinic on Day 5 (only&#xD;
      morning dose is given on Day 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pre-study cohort, subjects will be administered a single dose of 1600 mg before&#xD;
      breakfast. PK and PD sampling will be performed 30 minutes prior to dosing, and 0.5, 1, 2 and&#xD;
      4 hours later. Subjects will be evaluated for any untoward signs or symptoms and will be&#xD;
      discharged. For cohorts 1 and 2, on Days 1, 2,and 5, pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling will be performed 30 minutes prior to the first dose, and 0.5,&#xD;
      1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose at all visits for BID and TID (with an additional PK&#xD;
      draw on Day 1 at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 after the second dose of TID subjects only). Urine for&#xD;
      PK/PD will be collected pre-dose on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 5. At all visits (on Days 1, 2,and&#xD;
      at the final dose on Day5), samples will be collected for chemistry, CBC, INR, PT, PTT,&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, and vitamin K level. Blood samples for PK/PD will be collected 30&#xD;
      minutes prior to the last dose (AM) on Day 5 and also at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing.&#xD;
      Lab samples (chemistry, etc.), as above will also be drawn at the time of the first PK/PD&#xD;
      draw on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone interview will be conducted no fewer than 25 days and no more than 35 days after the&#xD;
      last dose on Day 5 to collect information on concomitant medications and adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
