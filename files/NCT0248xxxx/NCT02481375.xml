      Globally, the most common cause of anemia is thought to be iron deficiency anemia (IDA). This&#xD;
      was assumed to be the major cause of anemia in Cambodia, because Cambodian diets, which&#xD;
      consist mainly of rice, lack iron-rich animal food sources. However, our findings from a&#xD;
      previous study in Cambodia (a Canadian government funded study investigating multiple&#xD;
      interventions to improve food and nutrition security) showed that IDA is almost non-existent&#xD;
      and challenges this assumption. In a cross-sectional survey of 450 women from rural Cambodia,&#xD;
      only 1.0% had Hb and ferritin levels indicative of IDA (Hb &lt;120 g/L and ferritin &lt;15 μg/L). A&#xD;
      national survey conducted by UNICEF in 2014 found similarly low rates of IDA (Dr. Arnaud&#xD;
      Laillou, UNICEF Cambodia). Further, other micronutrients known to be associated with anemia&#xD;
      were also low (&lt;3%) including folate and vitamins B12 and B6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, 54% of the Prey Veng women had a genetic Hb disorder (e.g., α-thalassemias),&#xD;
      which are inherited diseases that can result in a defective Hb structure and/or impair Hb&#xD;
      production, either of which can reduce Hb concentration and increase the risk of anemia.&#xD;
      Further, genetic Hb disorders cause ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR)&#xD;
      concentrations to increase, which reduce the diagnostic sensitivity of these biomarkers to&#xD;
      identify IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the Cambodian Ministry of Health (MOH) recommended weekly iron and folic acid (IFA)&#xD;
      supplementation for all women of reproductive age, consistent with WHO guidelines. However,&#xD;
      if iron deficiency is not a major cause of anemia, then at best supplementation is a waste of&#xD;
      valuable resources and at worst could cause harm. Further, the justification for provision of&#xD;
      multiple micronutrients among this population has not yet been proven, despite the push from&#xD;
      some organizations such as the WHO. There is an urgent need to conduct a trial to clarify&#xD;
      whether iron or other micronutrient deficiencies are a major cause of anemia in Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare Hb concentration (g/L) after 12-weeks of supplementation in women to&#xD;
           determine if iron significantly improves Hb concentration, compared to a placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare Hb concentration (g/L) across the four groups (multiple micronutrients with&#xD;
           iron, multiple micronutrients without iron, iron alone, and placebo) after 12-weeks; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine which of the hematological indicators (ferritin, sTfR, reticulocyte count&#xD;
           and hepcidin) have the strongest diagnostic ability to predict responsiveness to iron&#xD;
           therapy after 12-weeks using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 2 x 2 factorial randomized controlled trial will be conducted over 12 weeks. A&#xD;
      total of ~800 women (18-45 y) with mild or moderate anemia will be recruited and randomized&#xD;
      to 1 of 4 groups: multiple micronutrients with iron, multiple micronutrients without iron,&#xD;
      iron alone or placebo. Blood will be collected at baseline and at 1 and 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention and assessed for Hb, hematological biomarkers, inflammation and genetic Hb&#xD;
      disorders. The investigators will use a general linear model to measure differences in Hb&#xD;
      concentration across the four groups after the intervention. Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curves will be used to determine the diagnostic ability of the multiple&#xD;
      hematological indicators to predict responsiveness to iron therapy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia is a severe public health problem in Cambodia, affecting ~44% of women of reproductive&#xD;
      age. Defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 120 g/L, anemia can increase the risk&#xD;
      of adverse pregnancy outcomes and impair work capacity and productivity. The potential causes&#xD;
      of anemia are poor nutrition (e.g. micronutrient deficiencies), genetic Hb disorders (e.g.&#xD;
      thalassemia), and inflammation and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, the most common cause of anemia is thought to be iron deficiency anemia (IDA). This&#xD;
      was assumed to be the major cause of anemia in Cambodia, because Cambodian diets, which&#xD;
      consist mainly of rice, lack iron-rich animal food sources. However, our findings from a&#xD;
      previous study in Cambodia (a Canadian government funded study investigating multiple&#xD;
      interventions to improve food and nutrition security) showed that IDA is almost non-existent&#xD;
      and challenges this assumption. In a cross-sectional survey of 450 women from rural Cambodia,&#xD;
      only 1.0% had Hb and ferritin levels indicative of IDA (Hb &lt;120 g/L and ferritin &lt;15 μg/L). A&#xD;
      national survey conducted by UNICEF in 2014 found similarly low rates of IDA (Dr. Arnaud&#xD;
      Laillou, UNICEF Cambodia). Further, other micronutrients known to be associated with anemia&#xD;
      were also low (&lt;3%) including folate and vitamins B12 and B6. On the other hand, other&#xD;
      nutrients known to be associated with anemia such as zinc and riboflavin deficiencies were&#xD;
      prevalent (30% and 82%, respectively). In addition, 54% of the Prey Veng women had a genetic&#xD;
      Hb disorder (e.g., α-thalassemias), which are inherited diseases that can result in a&#xD;
      defective Hb structure and/or impair Hb production, either of which can reduce Hb&#xD;
      concentration and increase the risk of anemia. Further, genetic Hb disorders cause ferritin&#xD;
      and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations to increase, which reduce the&#xD;
      diagnostic sensitivity of these biomarkers to identify IDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the Cambodian Ministry of Health (MOH) recommended weekly iron and folic acid (IFA)&#xD;
      supplementation for all women of reproductive age, consistent with WHO guidelines. However,&#xD;
      if iron deficiency is not a major cause of anemia, then at best supplementation is a waste of&#xD;
      valuable resources and at worst could cause harm. Further, the justification for provision of&#xD;
      multiple micronutrients among this population has not yet been proven, despite the push from&#xD;
      some organizations such as the WHO. There is an urgent need to conduct a trial to clarify&#xD;
      whether iron or other micronutrient deficiencies are a major cause of anemia in Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iron-supplemented group will have a significantly higher mean Hb concentration than the&#xD;
      placebo group after 12-weeks, indicating a higher prevalence of iron deficiency than&#xD;
      suggested by ferritin and sTfR biomarkers at baseline. The multiple micronutrients with iron&#xD;
      group will have a significantly higher mean Hb concentration than the iron alone-supplemented&#xD;
      group, indicating that the addition of other micronutrients confer a benefit in reducing&#xD;
      anemia. Reticulocyte count is the most sensitive biomarker to predict the responsiveness to&#xD;
      iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Goals and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 1. To determine if iron deficiency exists among women in Cambodia, where genetic Hb&#xD;
      disorders and inflammation are prevalent, by conducting a randomized controlled trial of iron&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To compare Hb concentration (g/L) after 12-weeks of supplementation in women to&#xD;
      determine if iron significantly improves Hb concentration, compared to a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 2: To determine if the addition of other micronutrients confers any additional benefit&#xD;
      to iron supplementation, by conducting a 2 x 2 factorial study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To compare Hb concentration (g/L) across the four groups (multiple&#xD;
      micronutrients with iron, multiple micronutrients without iron, iron alone, and placebo)&#xD;
      after 12-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal 3. To investigate multiple biomarkers of iron deficiency to determine which is most&#xD;
      sensitive and specific to predict the response to iron or multiple micronutrient with iron&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To determine which of the hematological indicators (baseline values for&#xD;
      ferritin, sTfR, reticulocyte count and hepcidin) have the strongest diagnostic ability to&#xD;
      predict responsiveness to iron therapy after 12-weeks using receiver operating characteristic&#xD;
      (ROC) analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2 x 2 factorial double blind randomized controlled trial will be conducted over 12 weeks. A&#xD;
      total of ~800 women (18-45 y) with anemia will be recruited and randomized to 1 of 4 groups:&#xD;
      multiple micronutrients with iron, multiple micronutrients without iron, iron alone or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Setting: Cambodian women will be recruited to local health centers using&#xD;
      convenience sampling from 4 randomly selected villages in a peri-urban area of Kampong&#xD;
      Chhnang province. This province is ~1.5 hours outside of the capital city of Phnom Penh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Women will be randomized 1:1 by a computer-generated random list to one of&#xD;
      four interventions (n=200 each group). Randomization to either a treatment or control group&#xD;
      will reduce bias and confounding factors, which may affect the Hb response (outcome). The&#xD;
      manufacturers of the gel capsules will be responsible for blinding the four interventions at&#xD;
      time of capsule packaging and will retain confidentiality of capsule contents until the time&#xD;
      of study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected at baseline, and at 1 and 12 weeks after the intervention and&#xD;
      assessed for Hb, hematological biomarkers (reticulocyte count, MCV, RDW, hepcidin),&#xD;
      micronutrients and iron biomarkers (vitamin B12, folate, zinc, riboflavin, ferritin, sTfR,&#xD;
      RBP) inflammation (AGP and CRP) and genetic Hb disorders. We will use a general linear model&#xD;
      to measure differences in Hb concentration across the four groups after the intervention.&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to determine the diagnostic ability of&#xD;
      the multiple hematological indicators to predict responsiveness to iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: This translational research is urgently required in Cambodia to build the&#xD;
      evidence needed to inform the Ministry of Health on strategies, policy and programs to&#xD;
      reduce, prevent and treat anemia among women in Southeast Asia (~300,000,000) and among&#xD;
      Southeast Asian immigrants in Canada (who will number ~450,000 by 2031).&#xD;
