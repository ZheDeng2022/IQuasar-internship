      Background The emergency department is a chaotic place with high levels of noise and light 24&#xD;
      hours a day. Patients are often boarded overnight while they await tests or consultations&#xD;
      scheduled for the morning. Sleep deprivation, high noise levels have been associated with&#xD;
      negative patient experiences and outcomes in other clinical settings. Interventions to&#xD;
      counter the effects of noise and light in the emergency department for patients staying&#xD;
      overnight have not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine if sleep and other aspects of the patient experience can be improved&#xD;
      for patients boarded overnight in the Emergency Department with the use of a sleep mask and&#xD;
      ear plugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A randomized control study will take place in the Emergency Department of Kingston&#xD;
      General Hospital. Eligible patients will randomized to receive either sleep aids (sleep mask&#xD;
      and ear plugs) or standard treatment (no sleep aids). The primary outcome will be sleep&#xD;
      quality, assessed by Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, hours of sleep, blood pressure, heart rate, new-onset delirium,&#xD;
      patient's sense of feeling well-rested and patient overall sense of well-being. The primary&#xD;
      analysis will be intention-to-treat comparing primary and secondary outcomes between the two&#xD;
      groups in an unadjusted fashion. A secondary analysis will involve linear regression to&#xD;
      explore the association between treatment group and Richards-Campbell Sleep Score,&#xD;
      controlling for potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance Determining the feasibility and efficacy of sleep masks and earplugs for patients&#xD;
      in the emergency department to improve sleep and the patient experience has never been done&#xD;
      before. If found to be effective, this relatively low- cost intervention could be implemented&#xD;
      in emergency departments across the country and around the world.&#xD;

      Study Design This will be a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Kingston General Hospital is the Regional Trauma and Tertiary Care Center in&#xD;
      Kingston, Ontario. The Emergency Department sees approximately 56,000 patients annually. It&#xD;
      is staffed by Emergency Medicine Physicians, and residents in both the FRCP and CCFP-EM&#xD;
      Emergency Medicine programs, as well as off-service residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population This study will include a convenience sample of recruitment on weekdays when we&#xD;
      have research assistance available. Specifically included are emergency department patients&#xD;
      aged ≥18 years, GCS 15, who at 2300h are deemed likely by study personnel to board in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department until at least 0700h the following morning while they wait for&#xD;
      consultant assessments, investigations, or transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded patients include those previously enrolled in this study or involved in sleep&#xD;
      research within last month, those who are legally blind or have a history of hearing&#xD;
      impairment, a documented history of cognitive impairment, a positive delirium screen at&#xD;
      enrollment, and those with a presenting complaint of head trauma. Also excluded are prisoners&#xD;
      and those who cannot comprehend English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome will be sleep quality as measured by a modified&#xD;
      Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ), completed by the patient at the termination of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include individual sleep domains on the Richards Campbell sleep&#xD;
      questionnaire (depth, latency, awakenings, percentage time awake, and quality of sleep),&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, perceived hours of sleep, blood pressure, heart rate, new-onset&#xD;
      delirium, changes in the patient's sense of being well-rested and changes in the patient's&#xD;
      overall sense of well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Group allocation will be randomized by night, cluster randomization, in an&#xD;
      effort to decrease contamination between patients enrolled during the same evening. All&#xD;
      eligible patients will be screened and consented (see Level 1 Information Sheet and Consent),&#xD;
      with primary information (see Enrollment Questionnaire) completed prior to randomization. A&#xD;
      sequential opaque envelope, with a tin-foil wrapped allocation card, will then be opened.&#xD;
      During treatment nights, patients will then be consented to the intervention (see Level 2&#xD;
      Information Sheet and Consent). Sleep aids will then be distributed to consenting patients&#xD;
      (see Verbal Instructions at Enrollment). Treatment patients will be reminded to not disclose&#xD;
      allocation until the last question of the Completion Questionnaire the following morning.&#xD;
      Night randomization will be randomly permuted to boxes of 6-10. A randomization log will be&#xD;
      kept and the date will be recorded in the log and on the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be informed of the randomized nature of the study, and the&#xD;
      nature of both study groups at the completion of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures and consent Patients will be identified as potentially eligible by a trained&#xD;
      research staff at 2300h on each day of recruitment. This will be accomplished through&#xD;
      examination of electronic medical records in the emergency department and discussion with&#xD;
      treating clinicians. Eligibility will be confirmed with Eligibility Confirmation prior to&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a two-level consent procedure. This is necessary to avoid a&#xD;
      measurement bias in patients ultimately randomized to the control group. Many of our outcomes&#xD;
      are subjective, and patients randomized to the control group (no sleep mask or earplugs)&#xD;
      might be prone to answer sleep quality and patient satisfaction questions more negatively if&#xD;
      they gain knowledge that mask and sleep plugs had been available but withheld via the consent&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources and data collection Outcome data will be collected with the assistance of the&#xD;
      Research Assistant prior to and at the termination of intervention (including modified-RCSQ&#xD;
      and satisfaction VAS) and retrospectively (vital signs and overnight, sedating or stimulating&#xD;
      medications used from the nursing records assessed via electronic medical records).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts will be made to blind the research staff undertaking the morning measurements to&#xD;
      study group. The nighttime treating nurse will remove the sleep mask and ear plugs prior to&#xD;
      leaving at 0700hrs. Data collection will begin at 0800hrs to allow for a 1hr washout in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delirium assessment will be made by the study staff at enrollment and termination of&#xD;
      intervention (approximately 0700h) via standardized screening protocol (Delirium Triage&#xD;
      Screen and Brief Confusion Assessment Method from Han, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Nursing interaction&quot; will be quantified at the end of the study period in the morning. We&#xD;
      define one &quot;Nursing interaction&quot; as a visit to the patient bedside recorded in the electronic&#xD;
      medical record (EDIS). Typical interventions will include medication delivery, vital sign&#xD;
      assessment, or responding to a call bell. For example, two medications offered at once will&#xD;
      count for a single intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should a patient leave the Emergency Department prior to collecting outcome data, a research&#xD;
      staff member will mail the paper-based questionnaire to the patient. This will be followed by&#xD;
      telephoning the patient once a week for 3 weeks or until their information is returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Department description: as in similar studies, serial decibel measurements will be&#xD;
      made in each section of our emergency department on five nights. Each section will be&#xD;
      represented by a mean dB reading and peak value. Similar measurements for light intensity&#xD;
      will be made. This will provide comparisons between sections for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan Baseline characteristics will be summarized by descriptive statistics (e.g.&#xD;
      mean/SD for continuous variables, count/percent for categorical). The primary analysis will&#xD;
      be an intension-to-treat analysis. The primary analysis will be unadjusted for patient or&#xD;
      environmental characteristics. Mean Richards-Campbell Sleep Score will be compared between&#xD;
      treatment groups using a mixed effects model. Patient and environmental characteristics will&#xD;
      be compared between groups with descriptive statistics. These characteristics include age,&#xD;
      gender, pain (as recorded on a visual analogue scale), emergency department location (section&#xD;
      A, B, C, D, E), the presence of a companion in the room, lighting conditions (lights on/off),&#xD;
      private room versus multi-patient area versus hallway/non patient area placement, day of week&#xD;
      and the use of sedatives, home sleep quality, and chronic use of medications and sleep aids&#xD;
      at home. A sensitivity analysis employing linear regression will be used to explore the&#xD;
      association between treatment group and Richards-Campbell Sleep Score while controlling for&#xD;
      these potential confounders. Secondary analysis will include a per-protocol analysis&#xD;
      including only patients who actually used the ear plugs and sleep mask for &gt;3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation Power calculations have been completed using mean RCSQ scores from previous&#xD;
      work done in ICU patients (no data were available from patients in the emergency department).&#xD;
      The mean score in this patient population is 57 +/- 28. For a two-sided alpha=0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 80% to detect a 20% difference in mean RCSQ between groups we will need 96 patients&#xD;
      in each group. Because of the cluster analysis we will increase this to 150 patients in each&#xD;
      group to account for the possible loss in power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and timeline This study will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to&#xD;
      participant enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an informal review of the KGH ED patient census we anticipate there will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 people waiting for morning imaging or CCAC referrals who could be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility. Making a conservative estimate of 4 eligible and consenting patients who&#xD;
      complete the study per recruiting day, 75 recruiting days are required. Given the convenience&#xD;
      sample with recruitment on weekdays only, the recruitment phase of the study will require 15&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
