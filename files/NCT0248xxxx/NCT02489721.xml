    <textblock>
      Most important peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and Midline complications are&#xD;
      thrombosis and catheter related blood stream infections. No large prospective observational&#xD;
      study are present in literature about these topics. The aim of this multicenter prospective&#xD;
      observational study is to analyze all the complications due to PICC and Midline insertion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A PICC line is a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter. It is long, small, flexible tube&#xD;
      that is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically in the upper arm, and terminates in a&#xD;
      large vein in the chest to obtain a central intravenous access. A Midline catheter is similar&#xD;
      to a PICC, but it is shorter in length (about 25 cm) and is inserted into a large vein in the&#xD;
      upper arm, terminating not beyond the axillary vein. Midline catheters offer a longer dwell&#xD;
      time and better hemodilution than the short peripheral IV catheters.The use of PICC and&#xD;
      Midline has been increasing in outpatient and inpatient settings. Factors driving this&#xD;
      increased use include their ease of insertion due to the placement into a peripheral vein-a&#xD;
      safer approach-with the benefit of a central tip location appropriate for any osmolarity and&#xD;
      pH infusions, a low reported incidence of infection, a better patient comfort, a durable&#xD;
      venous access, and an easier nursing management in outpatient setting. PICC placement under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance can be carried out with no iatrogenic, mechanical complications&#xD;
      associated with central venous catheter insertion in the neck or chest (pneumothorax,&#xD;
      hemothorax etc…). Despite their many advantages, recent data suggest that PICCs are&#xD;
      associated with venous thromboembolism. The incidence of symptomatic thrombosis ranges from&#xD;
      1.9% to 8.4% and it increases to 75% considering also the asymptomatic one. The risk factors&#xD;
      that predispose a patient to the development of a thrombotic complication are: the caliber of&#xD;
      the device (≥5Fr), the position of the catheter tip, the insertion of the PICC in a paretic&#xD;
      limb, a history of venous thrombosis, the residence time of the device and the presence of an&#xD;
      oncological pathology. The second major complication due to the PICC insertion is the&#xD;
      catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI). The incidence of PICC-BSI in literature&#xD;
      ranges from 2.0 per 1000 catheter days to 3.1 per 1000 catheter days. This disparity stems&#xD;
      from the fact that there is no single definition of catheter infection. Multiple factors&#xD;
      associated with patient and catheter care have been identified has having an increased risk&#xD;
      of CRBSI and are amenable to preventive measures. Independent risk factors for PICC BSIs&#xD;
      included congestive heart failure, intrabdominal perforation, Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infection, recent chemotherapy, presence of tracheostomy, and type of catheter (double or tri&#xD;
      lumen). Limited data exists regard prospective observational study on deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      and CRBSI related to PICC and Midline insertion, including the different calibers of the&#xD;
      device and the presence of single or multiple lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a multicenter prospective observational study to determine the&#xD;
      incidence of deep vein thrombosis, related/associated catheter blood stream infections and&#xD;
      the incidence of all the minor complications due to PICC and Midline insertion.&#xD;
