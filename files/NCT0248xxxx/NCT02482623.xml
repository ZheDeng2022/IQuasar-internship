  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with dementia and their caregivers are often cared for in the community through home&#xD;
      healthcare (HHC). While these patients and their caregivers need significant help and often&#xD;
      have difficulty maintaining their quality of life, home healthcare clinicians are often&#xD;
      unprepared to care for this population. This study will therefore examine the ability of an&#xD;
      integrated, multi-pronged evidence-based practice intervention for home healthcare registered&#xD;
      nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists, the DSM-H, to improve the quality of&#xD;
      care and quality of life for persons with dementia and their family caregiver. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll persons with dementia and their family caregiver upon admission to&#xD;
      the HHC agency and examine their quality of life over 60 days following admission, comparing&#xD;
      those who receive the intervention to those who serve as controls.&#xD;

      The Dementia Symptom Management at Home (DSM-H) Program is an integrated bundled&#xD;
      implementation science intervention to improve interprofessional care in home healthcare&#xD;
      (HHC). It consists of training, assessment instruments, patient-caregiver centered care plans&#xD;
      and workflow changes. The investigators will perform a cluster randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial at a single, urban, non-profit HHC agency, randomizing care teams to either be trained&#xD;
      in performing the intervention or serve as controls. The aims of this program are to examine&#xD;
      the efficacy of this program to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Measure the effects of DSM-H on pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver rated&#xD;
      QOL in the person with dementia receiving HHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the effects of DSM-H on QOL, burden and depression for the informal caregiver&#xD;
      of persons with dementia receiving HHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the effects of DSM-H on the number of emergency room visits and hospital&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
