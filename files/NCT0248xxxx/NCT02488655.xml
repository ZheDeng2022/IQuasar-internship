      This study evaluates the efficacy of the HIFU for the treatment of breast fibroadenoma with&#xD;
      the FastScan version using assessment of patient experience and adverse event reporting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Echopulse is specially designed, manufactured and CE marked for treating breast fibroadenoma.&#xD;
      HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to deliver&#xD;
      a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to&#xD;
      85-90°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous european feasibility study performed at 4 sites (France and Bulgaria), 51&#xD;
      fibroadenomas in 42 patients were treated. The HIFU treatment was well tolerated and showed&#xD;
      efficacy (mean volume reduction of 72.5% +/-16.7 at 12 months follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients 18 years or older with one diagnosed breast fibroadenoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be based on :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinical examination,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ultrasound image alone for patients under 35 years old. For women older than 35&#xD;
                  years, a mammogram will be performed in addition to ultrasound. The BI-RADS&#xD;
                  (Breast Imaging, Reporting and Data System) score of this mammogram must be less&#xD;
                  than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  histologic confirmation after core needle biopsy by two independent readers&#xD;
                  (biopsy must be performed at least two weeks before therapy unless a microbiopsy&#xD;
                  has been already done less than 3 months before inclusion visit and&#xD;
                  histopathology slices are available).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The requirements for the distance from the skin and the following regions of the&#xD;
             fibroadenoma are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≤ 23 mm from the posterior border of the fibroadenoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 5 mm from the anterior border of the fibroadenoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 11mm from the focal point of the HIFU treatment. These criteria shall be&#xD;
                  evaluated immediately prior to treatment once breast is immobilized and&#xD;
                  potentially compressed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The rib cage should not be in the prefocal ultrasound path or behind the target&#xD;
             fibroadenoma (minimum distance behind the focal point= 10 mm). This criterion shall&#xD;
             only be reached in treatment conditions, once breast is immobilized and potentially&#xD;
             compressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's fibroadenoma is 1 cm or greater at its largest dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fibroadenoma is palpable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has signed a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a BI-RADS score &gt; 2 at the mammogram, or presence of microcalcifications&#xD;
             within the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with history of breast cancer or history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with history of laser or radiation therapy to the target breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with breast implants in the target breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a breast cyst&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's fibroadenoma not clearly visible on the ultrasound images (in B mode) at the&#xD;
             inclusion visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient participating in other trials using drugs or devices.&#xD;
