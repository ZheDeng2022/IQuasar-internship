      to compare the blood loss during caesarean section between two different methods of&#xD;
      separating the placenta after fetal extraction, keeping in mind that most blood loss occurs&#xD;
      after placental separation.&#xD;

      We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from independent control and&#xD;
      experimental subjects with 1 control(s) per experimental subject. In a previous study1 the&#xD;
      response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation up to&#xD;
      272. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 37, we will need to&#xD;
      study 249 experimental subjects and 249 control subjects to be able to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with&#xD;
      probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null&#xD;
      hypothesis is 0.5. To allow for 15% drop, the sample on each arm will be increased to 287.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval of the ethical &amp; scientific committee of the obstetrics &amp; gynecology&#xD;
      department, Kasr Alainy Hospital, Cairo University. A randomized controlled trial involving&#xD;
      at least 574 patients will be undertaken in which, all patients will be randomized in to two&#xD;
      groups, with a closed envelope system containing equal number allocations for both groups&#xD;
      (1:1 bias) by the operating room nurse. Informed consent will be taken from all patients&#xD;
      before caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will contain 287 patients in which manual separation of the placenta will be done&#xD;
      immediately after fetal extraction &amp; cord clamping, where the fingers of the surgeon will be&#xD;
      insinuated between the margin of the placenta and the uterine cavity, then by sawing movement&#xD;
      and controlled traction by the other hand till placenta is separated from the uterine cavity.&#xD;
      Group B will also contain 287 patients but following fetal extraction and cord clamping, the&#xD;
      placenta will be left insitu &amp; uterus is massaged awaiting spontaneous placental separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups a uterotonic agent Oxytocin 5IU( syntocinonÂ® Sandoz Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Corporation East Hanover, New Jersey) will be given I.V in 250 ml ringer solution immediately&#xD;
      after cord clamping, and the uterus is exteriorized,&amp; the caesarean is performed by surgeons&#xD;
      of equal training level (Senior residants). Any serious tears or extensions into the lower&#xD;
      uterine segment, along with any major bleeding points on the suture line will be repaired&#xD;
      before attending to the placenta in both groups to prevent any serious blood loss before&#xD;
      placental separation, which will cause the results to be biased &amp; increase the risk of major&#xD;
      hemorrhage for the patient. The blood lost will be measured by recording the fluid in the&#xD;
      suction apparatus before and after placental separation, keeping in mind that most fluid in&#xD;
      the apparatus before fetal extraction was amniotic fluid and therefore will be deducted from&#xD;
      the total. The net amount of fluid in the suction apparatus will be added the volume of fluid&#xD;
      collected from blood soaked sterilized towels used after fetal extraction and the under&#xD;
      buttocks drapes placed under the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of fluid collected in soaked materials will be calculated according to (2) AWHONN&#xD;
      Practice Brief Number 1, where the dry weight of these materials in grams before the&#xD;
      operation is recorded and subtracted from the soaked weight &amp; converted to milliliters. The&#xD;
      net weight will be calculated through the following equation WET Item Gram Weight - DRY Item&#xD;
      Gram Weight = Milliliters of Blood within the item. (2) Descriptive data was recorded along&#xD;
      with blood loss after placental separation, and the time taken for placenta to spontaneously&#xD;
      separate in group B. Preoperative &amp; 6 hour postoperative hemoglobin will be recorded in both&#xD;
      groups. All statistical calculations were done using computer program SPSS (Statistical&#xD;
      Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) release 15 for Microsoft Windows&#xD;
      (2006). PS Power and Sample size calculations software, version 2.1.30 for MS windows, was&#xD;
      used to calculate sample size (Dupont &amp; Vanderbilt, USA)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria for this study were healthy volunteers scheduled for Caesarean&#xD;
             section, age range between 20-38 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion from the study included patients with anemia, abnormal coagulation defects,&#xD;
             multi-fetal gestation, failed progress in ongoing labour, pregnancy induced&#xD;
             hypertension &amp; other factors increasing risk for primary postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
             Diagnosed uterine fibroid or mullerian anomalies. A maximum of 10 minutes was allowed&#xD;
             in group B before actively removing the placenta, as a diagnosis of retained placenta&#xD;
             and abnormal placental adhesions is probably the cause and the patient was excluded&#xD;
             from the results&#xD;
