  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Landmarks used to make a vascular puncture has long been based on the only knowledge of&#xD;
      anatomy. This method assumes that the target vessel is in its expected position, permeable&#xD;
      (non-thrombosed), and heavy enough to be catheterized. Any variations from these assumptions&#xD;
      is likely to cause failures of puncture and complications. The development of ultrasound&#xD;
      allowed to &quot;see&quot; the structures to achieve, whether before a puncture or in live for guiding&#xD;
      the procedure. Visualization of vessels and adjacent structures has logically resulted in&#xD;
      larger cases to a greater security of catheterization, improving the success rate, and&#xD;
      decreasing complications. Several positions of the probe can be used to guide a puncture&#xD;
      under ultrasound: the transversal approach in short axis, the long axis longitudinal approach&#xD;
      and the oblique view approach.The aim of the study was to compare these three different&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided approaches to peripheral vascular access in children. All children weighing&#xD;
      less than 30 kg that should benefit from the introduction of an arterial catheter or central&#xD;
      venous catheter introduced through a peripheral vein are eligible. Patients will be included&#xD;
      after parent's and children's information and consent. The choice of the technique used&#xD;
      (transverse, longitudinal or oblique approach) is determined by a randomization table.The&#xD;
      puncture procedure is performed according to the usual protocols of the paediatric anesthesia&#xD;
      unit of the investigators, under ultrasound guidance in a sterile manner. No time limit is&#xD;
      required for the identification and implementation of the catheter. The position of the probe&#xD;
      is dictated by the result of randomization and the Seldinger technique is used for the&#xD;
      establishment of the catheter. Beyond two unsuccessful attempts, the procedure is considered&#xD;
      as a failure. The anesthetist then uses the alternative technique of his choice. All&#xD;
      anesthetists participating in this study exercised their main activity in the Montpellier&#xD;
      University Hospital pediatric anesthesia unit. The laying of ultrasound-guided peripherally&#xD;
      inserted central catheter and arterial catheter is part of the current activity of the unit.&#xD;
