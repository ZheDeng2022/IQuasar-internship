  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebroplasty itself is challenged regarding its clinical efficacy. While two randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) with substantial methodological problems have led to an intense&#xD;
      discussion another RCT with larger case numbers, more representative inclusion criteria and a&#xD;
      more consistent and sound methodology has revealed results that mirror the investigators' own&#xD;
      clinical experience. In their daily practice, the investigators have further advanced their&#xD;
      treatment concept and routinely apply prophylactic augmentations with VP using an algorithm.&#xD;
      Biomechanical studies support their approach, but clinical studies are rare so far.&#xD;
      Prophylactic augmentation with balloon kyphoplasty has not shown convincing effects in a&#xD;
      small pilot study. Given the above mentioned methodological and clinical disputes and the&#xD;
      call for high-evidence studies about VP, the investigators aim at generating a reliable&#xD;
      sample size calculation and preliminary results for a future multicenter RCT about&#xD;
      prophylactic adjacent level augmentation with VP in single level osteoporotic compression&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite current academic debates percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) has been convincingly used&#xD;
      for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures all around the world.&#xD;
      Polymethylmethacrylate bone cement is directly injected into a fractured vertebral body&#xD;
      through one or two bone biopsy needles to stabilize the fracture fragments and to possibly&#xD;
      improve the vertebral body height. The fracture pain represents a significant burden for the&#xD;
      patients, limiting physical function, quality of life and increasing social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate and clinically relevant pain alleviation after vertebroplasty does therefore&#xD;
      have a large impact on patients' mobility, autonomy and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current state of the art in the treatment of acute osteoporotic vertebral compression&#xD;
      fractures that are nonresponsive to conservative treatment is still augmentation of the&#xD;
      fractures with VP or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) given an intact posterior vertebral body wall.&#xD;
      BKP is claimed to be saver by reducing the occurrence of cement leakages and more effective&#xD;
      in reducing the fracture, i.e. reconstituting vertebral body height. While the first argument&#xD;
      largely depends on the definition of an adverse event, i.e. is an asymptomatic radiologically&#xD;
      visible cement leakage truly a complication, the second argument could not hold its promise&#xD;
      since the regained vertebral body height is partially lost after balloon deflation. This&#xD;
      problem is tackled by further developed BKP technologies like vertebral body stenting (VBS).&#xD;
      From a cost-effectiveness perspective, VP is superior to conservative medical care and one&#xD;
      can postulate that it is hence also more cost-effective than BKP which is a much more costly&#xD;
      treatment option.In addition, it is the only prophylactic augmentation option that does not&#xD;
      &quot;destroy&quot; intact unfractured bone structures by deployment of the balloon but does only&#xD;
      augment them. It is hence the least aggressive augmentation option for prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis as the underlying disease leads to an increased risk of fractures of the&#xD;
      adjacent vertebral bodies, with incidences up to 22% in the first year. After fracture&#xD;
      augmentation new fractures in the spine can occur. This leads to reoperations in a frail&#xD;
      population with high numbers of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) 3-4 patients.&#xD;
      Any non-life-saving surgical intervention in these patients needs to be avoided. Therefore,&#xD;
      prophylactic augmentation of the adjacent non-fractured vertebral bodies is a treatment&#xD;
      option which is safe and may reduce reoperation rates. Since VP is currently under scientific&#xD;
      and clinical scrutiny and calls for level-one-evidence become audible everywhere, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to assess the hypothesis that prophylactic augmentation significantly&#xD;
      decreases reoperation rates for adjacent new fractures with a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to show the effect of preventive augmentations of adjacent&#xD;
      vertebral bodies on 6 (12) months reoperation rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with an acute (&lt;= 6 weeks) single level osteoporotic compression fracture, meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and having no exclusion criterion will be randomized to either single&#xD;
      level fracture fixation with vertebroplasty or triple level augmentation with VP fixation of&#xD;
      the fracture and additional prophylactic vertebroplasty in both adjacent levels. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that prophylactic VP augmentation of both adjacent vertebral bodies in acute&#xD;
      single level osteoporotic compression fractures results in significantly lower reoperation&#xD;
      rates for new spinal fractures within 6 months after surgery compared to isolated single&#xD;
      level fracture fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label mono-center randomized controlled pilot trial. Given the timeframe and&#xD;
      budget of the study, the investigators aim at conducting a pilot trial for clinically&#xD;
      verifying the sample size calculation in order to have a sound basis of information for&#xD;
      planning a larger multicenter trial. The inclusion of primary cases will last for 12 months,&#xD;
      the followup intervals for each case will be 2 and 6 months since the large majority of new&#xD;
      fractures appears within that time window. 12 months followup will be conducted by&#xD;
      mail/telephone interview. Preliminary calculation of results, i.e. a new corrected sample&#xD;
      size will hence be carried out at the end of one and a half years. Two treatment groups will&#xD;
      be compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: single level fracture fixation with vertebroplasty, Group 2: triple level&#xD;
      augmentation with VP fixation of the fracture and additional prophylactic vertebroplasty in&#xD;
      both the adjacent levels.&#xD;
