  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Drugs and talk therapy help treat depression, but these treatments usually take quite a bit&#xD;
      of time to work. Ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant, but it has side effects like&#xD;
      unusual dreams and experiences. The drug AV-101 may have the same antidepressant effects but&#xD;
      fewer side effects. Researchers want to see if it is effective and safe for people with major&#xD;
      depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if the drug, AV-101 is safe and if it treats symptoms of major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults ages 18-65 with major depression without psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the hospital for 12-14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 (2-7 weeks): participants will stop taking their medicines then not take any for&#xD;
           2 weeks. They will have several scans and other procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 (6-7 weeks): 2 weeks each of study drug and placebo once a day, with 2 weeks of&#xD;
           no drugs in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent blood collection. A needle will place a small plastic tube in the arm. Some&#xD;
           blood samples will be taken through this tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 spinal taps (optional). The back will be numbed. A needle will insert a catheter&#xD;
           between back bones. That will be left in for up to 30 hours. Spinal fluid will be&#xD;
           collected through it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 scans. Participants will lie in a machine with a magnetic field. The machine takes&#xD;
           pictures of the brain and brain chemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, participants will have medical evaluation, questions, and blood&#xD;
           tests. Some may continue treatment at the clinic.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modulation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex or other components of glutamatergic&#xD;
      signaling is likely involved in improvement of depressive symptoms and related&#xD;
      constructs/dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures. Current standard&#xD;
      monoaminergic pharmacological approaches for major depressive disorder (MDD) have proven to&#xD;
      be only modestly effective during acute depressive episodes. We have systematically tested&#xD;
      different glutamatergic modulators in patients with mood disorders in order to develop&#xD;
      improved therapeutics. We found that the NMDAR antagonist ketamine produces rapid&#xD;
      antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (in MDD and Bipolar&#xD;
      Disorder). However, despite being highly efficacious, the proof of concept ketamine produces&#xD;
      psychotomimetic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present protocol, we aim to evaluate a new glutamate-mediated mechanism associated&#xD;
      with antidepressant efficacy by targeting the glycine receptor within the NMDA receptor.&#xD;
      Targeting the glycine co-agonist site of the (NMDA) receptor may bypass potential adverse&#xD;
      effects that occur with ketamine without affecting the robust efficacy observed. This may&#xD;
      then result in the glutamate surge that has been associated with the rapid acting&#xD;
      antidepressant effects of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present Phase 2 proof-of-concept study is designed to evaluate the antidepressant effects&#xD;
      of AV 101 (L-4-chlorokynurenine or 4-Cl- KYN) in MDD; this is a synthetic compound which is&#xD;
      enzymatically converted into the selective glycine/NMDAR antagonist 7-chlorokynurine&#xD;
      (7-Cl-KYNA) after crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) and then reaching brain glial cells.&#xD;
      In animal models of depression, 4-Cl-KYNA (AV 101) induced acute and prolonged&#xD;
      antidepressant-like effects without exhibiting ketamine-like side effects as determined by&#xD;
      the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, and pre-pulse inhibition tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the antidepressant response&#xD;
      to AV 101. We expect that this effect may modulate glutamate transmission and reverse the&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of depression. The demonstration that a glycine-antagonist produces&#xD;
      antidepressant effects without psychotomimetic side effects would support the therapeutic&#xD;
      relevance of the glycine site of the NMDAR and could direct the development of novel drug&#xD;
      targets for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an&#xD;
      episode of major depression, will be recruited for this study. This study will consist of a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind crossover administration of either the glycine receptor antagonist&#xD;
      AV 101 (1,080 or 1,440 mg/day given orally) or placebo for 2 weeks. The study will assess the&#xD;
      efficacy in improving overall depressive symptomatology and tolerability of AV 101 in&#xD;
      treatment-resistant MDD. Other aims of the study include: 1) determining whether changes in&#xD;
      brain neurochemicals (e.g. glutamate) and peripheral biomarkers obtained via MRS and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlate with antidepressant response (decrease in Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total scores) to AV 101 in patients with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      MDD, and 2) examine other potential biomarkers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Hamilton Rating Scale (HDRS) total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Proportion of subjects achieving remission (HDRS less than or greater than 7) and&#xD;
      response (greater than or equal to 50% reduction from baseline in HDRS total score); change&#xD;
      from baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale (MADRS), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) total scores.&#xD;
      Surrogate biomarkers of drug effect/response include: changes in prefrontal glutamate levels&#xD;
      measured with 7T H-MRS.&#xD;
