  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Durvalumab is a drug that may help people s immune systems respond to and kill cancer&#xD;
      cells. Olaparib is a drug that may inhibit repairing DNA damage of cancer cells. Cediranib is&#xD;
      a drug that may stop the blood vessel growth of cancer cells. This study has two components.&#xD;
      In the phase 1 component of the study, researchers want to investigate how well participants&#xD;
      tolerate the combination of these drugs in treating advanced solid tumors, and in the phase 2&#xD;
      part of this study, researchers want to study if the combination treatments are effective in&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Phase 2 part of the study: To determine how effective this combination is in treating&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Phase 2 part of the study: Adults age 18 or older with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer&#xD;
      that has no standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They will have CT or MRI scans. For these, they will lie in a machine that takes&#xD;
           pictures of their bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 part of the study requests the participants to have tumor samples removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get Durvalumab through an IV. A small plastic tube will be inserted&#xD;
           into a vein. The drug will be given every 4 weeks until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take olaparib or cediranib by mouth every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 28 days will be 1 cycle. For cycle 1, participants will have 2 study visits. All&#xD;
           other cycles, they will have 1 visit. At these visits, they will repeat the screening&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will keep a drug and diarrhea diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on cediranib will monitor their blood pressure and keep a blood pressure diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who can become pregnant, or have a partner who can become pregnant, must&#xD;
           practice an effective form of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 12 cycles, participants will have 1-3 months of follow-up.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 pathway yielded clinical activity in subsets&#xD;
      of advanced solid tumors, such as melanoma and lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib (O), a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), has demonstrated single agent activity in recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (OvCa), and subsets of prostate, triple negative breast or lung cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recent randomized phase 2 study showed that O and cediranib (C), a VEGFR1-3 inhibitor was&#xD;
      clinically superior to O alone in platinum-sensitive recurrent OvCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that increased DNA damage by PARP inhibition and/or reduced angiogenesis by&#xD;
      VEGFR inhibition will complement the anti-tumor activity of an immune checkpoint inhibitor,&#xD;
      Durvalumab, in recurrent OvCa and other solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and the safety of doublet&#xD;
      therapies (Durvalumab/olaparib [Durvalumab+O] and Durvalumab/cediranib [Durvalumab+C]) and&#xD;
      triplet therapy (Durvalumab+O+C) in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;

      determine clinical efficacy as measured by progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;

      as measured by PFS&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase II Cohort 1 Durvalumab+O, Durvalumab+C and Durvalumab+O+C arms: Advanced or recurrent&#xD;
      OvCa&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Cohort 2 Durvalumab+O and Durvalumab+C arms: Advanced or recurrent NSCLC&#xD;

      Phase II Cohort 5 Durvalumab+O arm: Advanced or recurrent TNBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Cohort 6 C+Durvalumab arm: Advanced or recurrent CRC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or biologic therapy for at least 3&#xD;
      weeks. mCPRC patients (Cohort 4) may be on hormonal therapy with GnRH agonists/antagonists.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase II Cohort 6 CRC; C+Durvalumab arm: Patients in the Cohort 6 will be treated with C 20mg&#xD;
      daily alone for 14 days followed by the combination at RP2D (C 20mg once a day [5 days on/2&#xD;
      days off] and Durvalumab at 1500 mg every 4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Correlative studies: Research samples including whole blood, CTCs, cell free DNA and&#xD;
      plasma will be obtained at pretreatment, prior to cycle 1 day 15, prior to cycle 3 day 1 and&#xD;
      at progression. Mandatory baseline core biopsy and two optional biopsies will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by CTCAEv4.0, and for response every&#xD;
      two cycles (8 weeks) by RECIST 1.1. Patients with mCRPC (Durvalumab+O Cohort 4) will be&#xD;
      evaluated for response initially at 8 weeks then every 12 weeks using RECIST v1.1 criteria as&#xD;
      per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2).&#xD;
