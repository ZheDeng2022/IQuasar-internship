  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suriname is a small developing country in South America with a population of half a million&#xD;
      people. Early neonatal death in Suriname is high with 16 per 1000 live births. Unpublished&#xD;
      data from the Suriname Perinatal and Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution of&#xD;
      infection to early neonatal mortality at 25% (4 per 1000 live births) of all deaths. In&#xD;
      comparison, incidence rates of neonatal sepsis alone are 3.5 per 1000 live births. These&#xD;
      numbers indicate an increased burden of neonatal infection in Suriname versus the U.S. In any&#xD;
      case about 40 newborns that die each year of infection are a huge loss, also considering the&#xD;
      small Surinamese community. Despite this overall idea on the impact of infectious disease in&#xD;
      Surinamese neonates exact information regarding incidence, type of infection (e.g.,&#xD;
      localized, viral, early-onset or late-onset sepsis), risk factors (e.g., insufficient&#xD;
      antenatal care, maternal Group B-Streptococcus status), etiology, microbial causes,&#xD;
      morbidity, antibiotic treatment (type and duration), and epidemiological determinants (e.g.,&#xD;
      gestational age, sex, ethnicity) are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical perspective, there is still a challenge to identify neonates with infection.&#xD;
      Neonates are often admitted with ambivalent clinical symptoms and receive preventive&#xD;
      antibiotics that are costly, promote pathogen-resistance, and have negative long-term effects&#xD;
      (i.e., on the development of the intestinal bacterial flora). Currently, assessment of blood&#xD;
      leukocyte or trombocyte counts and levels of CRP are insufficiently sensitive to be used as&#xD;
      biomarkers, while confirmation of actual sepsis or meningitis by positive culture results is&#xD;
      relatively rare (0.5-3% in the United States). This complicates decisions on duration of&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment and hospitalization significantly, while no other biomarkers exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The circulating isoforms of adhesion molecules (cAMs), which mediate interactions of&#xD;
      leukocytes with the vascular endothelium, have been proposed as biomarkers for infection and&#xD;
      sepsis. During infection they accumulate in the bloodstream as a result of shedding, which&#xD;
      represents their removal from cell surfaces of endothelial cells and leukocytes by enzymes&#xD;
      called sheddases. Recently, we have reviewed mechanisms behind shedding of cAMs in neonatal,&#xD;
      pediatric and adult sepsis. The shedding process reflects a critical and active process in&#xD;
      orchestrating interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium for an effective host&#xD;
      response, while minimizing collateral tissue damage. As a result, both plasma levels of cAMs&#xD;
      and their sheddases are subject to change during infection and sepsis. Additionally,&#xD;
      compelling, albeit limited, data suggest changes of levels of cAMs in CSF in adult and&#xD;
      pediatric meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, some evidence exists of changes in levels of cAMs during malaria (in children from&#xD;
      Malawi) and sepsis, although not sensitive enough to predict outcomes in the clinic. Those&#xD;
      levels have never been assessed simultaneously with levels of their sheddases in blood or CSF&#xD;
      as a diagnostic tool. We propose that this combined approach may provide more detailed&#xD;
      information about the extent of inflammatory activation in neonates.While a balance in levels&#xD;
      is maintained under resting conditions or mild (local) infection, it may be perturbed during&#xD;
      sepsis or meningitis . Thus, simultaneous measurement of these levels could promote early&#xD;
      identification of infection, and may even distinguish between mild infection, systemic&#xD;
      infection or meningitis. Currently, manufacturers are rapidly developing LuminexÂ® technology&#xD;
      as an advanced, fast, high-throughput and clinically feasible bedside tool for such an&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that incidence rates of neonates with infection in Suriname are high. We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that, upon signs of infection, the simultaneous measurement of cAMs and&#xD;
      their SEs in serum and CSF discriminates between infected and non-infected neonates. We aim&#xD;
      to: 1) identify and follow neonates at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo with signs of&#xD;
      infection to establish incidence rates of infection, and 2) investigate diagnostic potential&#xD;
      of our proposed biomarker combination in these neonates for infection, type of infection&#xD;
      (e.g., local (mild), sepsis or meningitis) and outcomes.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Academic Hospital Paramaribo (AZP) has the largest perinatal care facility in Suriname.&#xD;
      Recently, the AZP opened the country's only neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This study&#xD;
      aims to include all neonates presenting here and at the high and medium care facilities with&#xD;
      clinical signs of infection, sepsis or meningitis (age: 0-1 month) that require infection&#xD;
      work up. Along with the inclusion of these neonates follows a detailed epidemiological&#xD;
      description of newborns with infectious disease. Inclusion will take place by one of 10&#xD;
      residents, with approval from one of the 5 attending pediatricians. Along with standard blood&#xD;
      draws for infection parameters (at t=0 and t=48 hours), blood culture (at t=0 hours) and CSF&#xD;
      culture (at t=0 hours), serum and CSF will be separated for our biomarker study. For all&#xD;
      neonates, normal local protocol for the management of infection, sepsis or meningitis will be&#xD;
      followed. This includes antibiotic treatment for 7 days when 1) clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      infection at admission was high; 2) infection parameters are aberrant at 48 hours; 3) blood&#xD;
      culture is positive. Otherwise, antibiotic treatment is stopped after 48 hours. Further&#xD;
      protocol includes necessary changes in respiratory support, circulatory (fluid) support and&#xD;
      feeding. Medical treatments can be cardiotonics and treatments for hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      seizures. Neonates are divided over 5 groups based on course of antibiotic treatment and&#xD;
      culture results: 1) Baseline controls (no signs of infection): neonates admitted for serial&#xD;
      blood draws at t=0 and 48 hours for uncomplicated hyperbilirubinemia (with jaundice, but&#xD;
      without other signs of infection); 2) Signs of infection, further divided in: 2a) No&#xD;
      infection: antibiotics stopped after 48 hours; negative cultures; 2b) Clinical infection: 7&#xD;
      day antibiotics; negative cultures; 2c) Sepsis: positive bacterial blood culture; 2d)&#xD;
      Meningitis: positive bacterial CSF culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power analysis is complicated because The Suriname Perinatal and Infant&#xD;
      Mortality Survey only provides data on mortality as a result of infection (amongst other&#xD;
      causes), without data on the incidence of neonatal infection. We estimate an incidence of&#xD;
      admission for clinical signs for infection of 50 per 1000 live births (5%) at the NICU of the&#xD;
      AZP. An annual birth rate at the AZP of about 3000 live births per year gives us n=150&#xD;
      neonates with signs of infection divided over four groups. Based on these estimations the&#xD;
      recommended sample size of the whole population would be n=1538 (margin of error 1% and CI&#xD;
      99%). Since the incidence of newborns for which exclusion criteria apply and incidence of the&#xD;
      subgroups are currently unknown, and to compensate for loss to follow up, we decided to&#xD;
      include over a one-year period (n=3000). The biomarker study is exploratory in nature and we&#xD;
      aim for a baseline control group of n=40 (larger n may be difficult to establish due to&#xD;
      practical constraint). In our analysis we will adjust for gestational age and ethnicity.&#xD;
      Absence of prior data on levels of biomarkers in relation to neonatal infection prevents us&#xD;
      from estimating power. With analysis of sera and CSF from our 150 inclusions we aim to&#xD;
      perform that for future follow-up biomarker studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology: The following data will be recorded upon (t=0 hours) and during (t=48 hours)&#xD;
      admission: date and time, maternal age, gender, maternal Group-B-streptococcus culture&#xD;
      result, maternal fever, (premature) prolonged rupture of membranes ((P)PROM), gestational age&#xD;
      (if unknown according to Ballard), delivery location and mode, Apgar scores, birth weight,&#xD;
      gender, ethnicity, leukocyte count and differentiation, trombocyte count, CRP, antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment (type, duration), sepsis (early/late onset, line), survival/expiration. The Score&#xD;
      for Neonatal Acute Physiology II will be scored at t=0 and 48 hours. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum separation: Whole blood will be collected by vena puncture in one serum microtainer&#xD;
      (500 Î¼L). Serum samples will be separated by centrifugation at 2500 xg for 15 minutes and&#xD;
      kept on ice until storage. All serum and CSF samples will be stored at -80Â°C in the central&#xD;
      laboratory of the AZP. Batched serum and CSF samples will be packaged on dry-ice (max. 24&#xD;
      hours; according to the International Air Transport Association guidelines) and transported&#xD;
      to the Endothelial Biomedicine and Vascular Drug Targeting Laboratory in Groningen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LuminexÂ® Technology: Our laboratory in Groningen has extensive experience with the use of&#xD;
      LuminexÂ® arrays for the measurement of multiple adhesion molecules at once in clinical&#xD;
      patient samples (i.e., multiplexing). Currently, the technique is applied successfully in&#xD;
      basic and translational research and is gradually making its way into the clinic, allowing&#xD;
      for the compilation of a diagnostic multi-array of molecules for complex diseases, such as&#xD;
      sepsis or cancer. See Table 1 for specific adhesion molecules and their associated shedding&#xD;
      enzymes that we include in our array. Measurement of soluble L-, E-, and P-selectin,&#xD;
      Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1),&#xD;
      neutrophil elastase (NE), Matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue-inhibitor of&#xD;
      metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) will be performed&#xD;
      with LuminexÂ®; NE and ADAM-17 will be analyzed by ELISA as long as LuminexÂ® is not yet&#xD;
      available for these molecules. We will also use LuminexÂ® to measure circulating Angiopoetin-1&#xD;
      and -2, and soluble Tie-2 receptor as markers of endothelial cell activation. For LuminexÂ®&#xD;
      assays (Life Technologies) appropriate diluted volumes of samples will be aliquoted in 96&#xD;
      well plates. Simultaneous analysis will take place with the LuminexÂ® 100 Analyzer (Life&#xD;
      Technologies). ELISA will be performed according to the manufacturers protocol (R&amp;D systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence rates end epidemiological determinants will be calculated at the end of the&#xD;
      inclusion period. Categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages and&#xD;
      continuous variables as mean +/- SD or, if not normally distributed, as median +/- 10th&#xD;
      percentile. Categorical data will be compared with chi-square and continuous variables with&#xD;
      the independent t-test or two-way ANOVA. To assess the independent effect of biomarker&#xD;
      combinations (cAM/SE ratios) on the occurrence of infections multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      will be performed with infection as dependent and cAM/SE ratios, gestational age and&#xD;
      ethnicity as independent variables. We will calculate Spearman rank correlation to assess&#xD;
      bivariable association between biomarkers. Diagnostic accuracy of cAM/SE ratios will be&#xD;
      assessed by using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-based area under the curve.&#xD;
      Other test characteristics such as predictive value and likelihood ratios will be calculated.&#xD;
      P-values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using Stata (StataCorp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties and Limitations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, separation of serum from neonates could lead to low volumes, yet LuminexÂ® technology&#xD;
      is designed for the assessment of high numbers of molecules in low volumes. According to&#xD;
      local protocol, CSF collection is not performed in baseline controls and not in neonates that&#xD;
      are not suspect for meningitis. Measurement of two time-points may be insufficient to detect&#xD;
      changes in time. We will not be able to identify viral causes of infection, since proper&#xD;
      diagnostics are currently not available in Suriname.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical concerns for the Surinamese situation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have received approval from the Surinamese Ethical Board on March 9th 2015. Upon&#xD;
      eligibility of a newborn, at least one parent or guardian will be asked for participation of&#xD;
      their child into the study and will be given written information in Dutch. If the patient is&#xD;
      illegible or does not understand Dutch, oral explanation will be given in a language that is&#xD;
      understood (either English or Sranan Tongo). Written informed consent (with either signature&#xD;
      or fingerprint) is obtained from a parent or guardian for the collection of all clinical&#xD;
      data, blood and CSF. Blood draws for serum separation and spinal tap for CSF collection will&#xD;
      only take place along with interventions according to local protocol (i.e., no additional&#xD;
      blood draws or spinal taps will take place). All samples will be treated anonymously and&#xD;
      receive a sample ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of individual subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardians of subjects can initiate leave of the study at any time for any reason&#xD;
      if they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a&#xD;
      subject for medical reasons or when subjects are non-cooperative (i.e., resist blood draws).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature termination of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no situations expected that would lead to premature termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse and serious adverse events population (base) We do not expect any (serious) adverse&#xD;
      events related to drawing blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative aspects and publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling and storage of data and documents: Paper data will be stored by the coordinating&#xD;
      investigator, in a unique folder, which will be accessible by the coordinating investigator,&#xD;
      and the investigators involved in the study. The data will also be stored electronically in&#xD;
      an Excel database. The principal investigator will enter the data. The file will be only&#xD;
      accessible by the investigators and data exchange through email will be encrypted with a&#xD;
      password. Each participant will receive a unique participation number after signing informed&#xD;
      consent, which corresponds to the sample ID of the blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments are changes made to the research after a favorable opinion by the accredited&#xD;
      ethical board has been given. All amendments will be notified that gave a favorable opinion.&#xD;
      A 'substantial amendment' is defined as an amendment to the terms of the ethical board&#xD;
      application, or to the protocol or any other supporting documentation, that is likely to&#xD;
      affect to a significant degree:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scientific value of the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The conduct or management of the trial; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The quality or safety of any intervention used in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All substantial amendments will be notified to the ethical board and to the competent&#xD;
      authority. Non-substantial amendments will not be notified to the accredited ethical board&#xD;
      and the competent authority, but will be recorded and filed by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual progress report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor/investigator will submit a summary of the progress of the study to the accredited&#xD;
      ethical board once a year. Information will be provided on the date of inclusion of the first&#xD;
      subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that have completed the trial,&#xD;
      serious adverse events/ serious adverse reactions, other problems, and amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will notify the accredited ethical board of the end of the study within a&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks. The end of the study is defined as the last patient's last visit. In case&#xD;
      the study is ended prematurely, the investigator will notify the accredited ethical board,&#xD;
      including the reasons for the premature termination. Within one year after the end of the&#xD;
      study, the investigator/sponsor will submit a final study report with the results of the&#xD;
      study, including any publications or abstracts of the study, to the accredited ethical board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public disclosure and publication policy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final publication of the study results will be written by the study coordinator(s) on the&#xD;
      basis of the statistical analysis performed. A draft manuscript will be submitted to all&#xD;
      co-authors for review. After revisions the manuscript will be sent to a peer reviewed&#xD;
      scientific journal. The study coordinators must approve any publication, abstract or&#xD;
      presentation based on patients included in the study.&#xD;
