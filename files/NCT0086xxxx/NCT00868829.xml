  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized,&#xD;
      single-arm clinical registry trial. The study will enroll 5,000 patients who receive the&#xD;
      Firebird2TM Cobalt-ChromiumAlloyed Sirolimus-Eluting Stent implantation. For patient with&#xD;
      multivessel disease, only Firebird 2TM Stent will be implanted. The enrollment of patients&#xD;
      will take about 4 months. Clinical follow-up will be at 30 day, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month&#xD;
      and 36 month. Patients withdrawing the study due to any reasons will not be replaced.&#xD;

      [Definition and management of adverse event] Adverse event refers to any undesirable clinical&#xD;
      event. It may be caused by devices, rapamycin, procedure related complications, or the&#xD;
      adjunctive medications (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or other anti-platelet&#xD;
      agent) used in this study. Self report of adverse events by patients should be encouraged.&#xD;
      Patients have a right to inquire any information on adverse event at any time of the study.&#xD;
      If an adverse event is confirmed, the investigator should collect all related information and&#xD;
      complete the Adverse Event Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Classification of adverse events severity] Mild: Mild adverse event refers to clinical event&#xD;
      not interfering patient's daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate: Moderate adverse event refers to clinical event affecting patient's daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious: Serious adverse event refers to clinical event results in patient's inability to&#xD;
      undertake daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Management of adverse event] All adverse events occurring during the study period should be&#xD;
      documented on Adverse Event Forms. Investigators should provide appropriate treatment for all&#xD;
      adverse events and follow up the patient until symptom(s) disappear or remain stable&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Documents Recordkeeping] All CRFs and their other original supporting files (such as the&#xD;
      informed consent, the lab report, the process records, medical history, the results of&#xD;
      physical examinations and diagnosis, the diagnosis, procedure dates and the records regarding&#xD;
      equipment management) must be set up in a secure central location by a research site staff&#xD;
      and maintained for at least 2 years upon the notification on the termination or completion of&#xD;
      the trial issued by MicroPort Medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the person in charge of keeping these files cannot keep the trial records&#xD;
      continuously due to retirement, transferring or any other reason, the recordkeeping should be&#xD;
      handed over to another person who is able to accept this task, and a written notification&#xD;
      with the successor's name and address should be sent to MicroPort and the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
