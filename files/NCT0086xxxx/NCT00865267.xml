      The purpose of this study is to determine the duration of application of halobetasol&#xD;
      propionate 0.05% ointment to be used in a definitive study of bioequivalence of to&#xD;
      formulations of this ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: To validate vasoconstrictor assay precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: To evaluate the dose response vasoconstriction profile of Ultravate® 0.05% ointment&#xD;
      at different dose durations over a short period of time (0.17 - 4 hrs).&#xD;
