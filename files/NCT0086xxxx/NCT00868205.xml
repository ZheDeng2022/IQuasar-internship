    <textblock>
      Food and beverage intake that leads to a decrease in the level of in vivo markers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress indicates that such foods and beverages act as antioxidants (AOX) in humans.&#xD;
      Coffee drinking at a high level (&gt; 900 ml/day) for a short period of time (1 week) has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce DNA oxidative damage-as indicated by a decrease in the level of percent tail&#xD;
      DNA (%T)- in study populations comprised mainly of young adults aged &lt; 30 years. It is not&#xD;
      clear whether such findings remain present over a longer period of time, and to extend such&#xD;
      findings across a population that is more representative of European adults who consume&#xD;
      common daily intakes of coffee, which is a low-to-moderate daily intake level (&lt; 750 ml/day).&#xD;
      As such, the investigators propose to determine the effect of drinking 3 and 5 cups of coffee&#xD;
      per day (equivalent to 450 and 750 ml per day, respectively) for 8-weeks on markers of in&#xD;
      vivo oxidative stress relative to control in a population of healthy adults free of chronic&#xD;
      diseases aged 35 to 65 years. To ensure that overall health is considered, the investigators&#xD;
      will also evaluate the effect on markers of cardiovascular health, inflammation, and glycemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

      Objective: The main objective of the present study is to determine the short- and mid-term&#xD;
      effects of a coffee, on oxidative stress parameters in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded, 3-arm parallel Study&#xD;
      population: 168 apparently healthy volunteers: males and females aged &gt;=35 and &lt;= 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The treatments consist of daily consumption of either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 1: 0.45 L coffee (3 cups) and 0.30 L bottled water daily or; Treatment 2: 0.75 L&#xD;
      coffee (5 cups) daily or; Treatment 3: 0.75 L water daily Duration of the treatment&#xD;
      intervention is 8 weeks. Before the intervention period starts, a run-in period of five weeks&#xD;
      where all subjects maintain their low antioxidant diet (Dutch average) is conducted by all&#xD;
      subjects in order to standardize the antioxidant intake of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Mean level of %T as a measure of DNA oxidative damage at&#xD;
      week 8. Secondary outcome is the mean level of 8-isoprostane in 24 hr urine.&#xD;
