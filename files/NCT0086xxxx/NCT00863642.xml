      While there exists consensus among surgeons that patients with gallstone pancreatitis should&#xD;
      undergo cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence, the precise timing of laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy for mild to moderate disease remains controversial. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 48 hours of admission, regardless of resolution&#xD;
      of abdominal pain or abnormal laboratory values, will result in a shorter hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is a common diagnosis worldwide, with more than 220,000 cases reported&#xD;
      annually in the United States alone. The leading etiology is gallstones.1 Gallstone&#xD;
      pancreatitis is thought to occur due to transient obstruction of the common channel that&#xD;
      drains both the biliary and pancreatic ducts, resulting in inflammation of the pancreas. The&#xD;
      pancreatitis that ensues is usually mild and self-limited and the treatment is initially&#xD;
      supportive with subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). However, a small subgroup of&#xD;
      patients develop severe pancreatitis and/or concomitant cholangitis. When the latter is&#xD;
      present, ERC and sphincterotomy with stone extraction as indicated are typically performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a clear consensus that patients who present with gallstone pancreatitis should&#xD;
      undergo cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence, precise timing of surgery remains&#xD;
      controversial. In patients with severe pancreatitis (Ranson's &gt; 3), there is consensus that&#xD;
      surgery is delayed until the pancreatitis has resolved because early operation is associated&#xD;
      with a higher complication rate. 2 However, despite more than 30 years of debate in the&#xD;
      surgical literature, the optimal timing of surgery in mild to moderate pancreatitis (Ranson's&#xD;
      ≤ 3) remains unclear. With recurrence rates for gallstone pancreatitis reported as high as&#xD;
      63%3 and with some of the repeat attacks occurring within two weeks of initial index&#xD;
      presentation1, most investigators have recommended cholecystectomy during the initial&#xD;
      hospitalization.4,5 Still, the actual timing of surgery during the initial index&#xD;
      hospitalization is unsettled. In practice, surgeons often delay surgery until there is&#xD;
      evidence of complete resolution of the inflammatory process, as evidenced by absence of&#xD;
      abdominal pain and normalization of liver functional tests and pancreatic enzymes.6&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this strategy may result in prolongation of hospitalization without any proven&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous prospective, non-randomized study from our institution suggested that early&#xD;
      cholecystectomy could safely be performed within 48 hours of admission in patients with mild&#xD;
      to moderate pancreatitis, regardless of resolution of abdominal pain and abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      values. In this study, when compared to a retrospective control group in which surgery was&#xD;
      delayed until there was resolution of clinical and laboratory parameters, hospital stay was&#xD;
      significantly reduced from a median of 7 days to 4 days, without additional complications.7&#xD;
      In order to address the optimal timing of surgery in a more definite fashion, a prospective&#xD;
      randomized study was performed in which patients with mild to moderate gallstone pancreatitis&#xD;
      were allocated to either an early group (surgery within 48 hours of presentation) or a&#xD;
      control group (surgery after resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of laboratory&#xD;
      values) and assessed overall outcomes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adults are included between the age of 18 and 100 with mild to moderate gallstone&#xD;
             pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject is classified as having gallstone pancreatitis if they had the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and epigastric tenderness;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. absence of ethanol abuse;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. elevated amylase level to at least twice the upper limit of normal and elevated&#xD;
                  lipase level to at lease three times the upper limit of normal; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. imaging confirmation of gallstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The classification of mild to moderate pancreatitis is defined by the presence of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. three or fewer Ranson's criteria on admission: age &gt; 55 years, glucose &gt; 200&#xD;
                  mg/dL , LDH&gt; 350 mg/dL, AST &gt; 250 units/L, and WBC&gt;16 K/mm3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. clinical stability with admission to a non-monitored ward bed;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. absence of acute cholangitis: defined as a temperature &gt;38.6°C, right upper&#xD;
                  quadrant pain and tenderness, and significant hyperbilirubinemia; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. low suspicion for a retained common bile duct (CBD) stone (total bilirubin &lt;4&#xD;
                  mg/dl on admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe pancreatitis (as defined by the presence of more than three Ranson's criteria&#xD;
             on admission);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected concomitant acute cholangitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High suspicion for retained common bile duct stone (total bilirubin ≥ 4 mg/dl on&#xD;
             admission or ultrasound demonstration of CBD stone);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient refusal to participate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe preexisting medical comorbidities contraindicating cholecystectomy (as&#xD;
             determined by the primary physicians);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior gastric bypass surgery (making ERC difficult )&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admission to a monitored unit. The need for admission to a monitored bed is determined&#xD;
             by the admitting surgeon and is guided primarily by a need for aggressive fluid&#xD;
             administration as demonstrated by severe volume depletion (e.g., admission tachycardia&#xD;
             &gt;110 beats/minute, blood urea nitrogen &gt; 15 mg/dl) or evidence of cholangitis.&#xD;
