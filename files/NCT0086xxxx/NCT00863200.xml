    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn how well a telephone system works for improving&#xD;
      the management of emotional distress, sadness, and/or depression in patients who are being&#xD;
      treated for cancer.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to 1 of 2 groups: telephone intervention or standard care. You have an equal chance of&#xD;
      being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter which group you are assigned to, you will be asked to tell your doctor and/or nurse&#xD;
      about all symptoms you may be experiencing during your regularly scheduled visits. You will&#xD;
      also be asked to call your doctor and/or nurse right away when your symptoms are severe. The&#xD;
      doctor and/or nurse will give you instructions about calling when your symptoms are severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive educational material about emotional distress, sadness, and depression in&#xD;
      people who are being treated for cancer. The material also will tell you about community&#xD;
      resources that are available for people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the feedback group, your symptom information will be collected using a&#xD;
      telephone system. You will be asked to rate 13 symptoms, such as sadness, emotional distress,&#xD;
      and fatigue, on a scale of 0 to 10 using the touch tone key pad of your telephone. The 0&#xD;
      means that you are not having the symptom at all, and the 10 means that the symptom is as bad&#xD;
      as you can imagine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you rate either of the 2 symptoms of sadness and/or emotional distress as moderate or&#xD;
      severe, then the telephone system will send a message to the research staff and your doctor&#xD;
      or nurse right away. Only the symptoms of sadness and emotional distress will be reported&#xD;
      right away to the doctor or nurse and the research staff. If you answer moderate to severe to&#xD;
      any other questions, it will not be sent right away to the doctor, nurse or study staff. The&#xD;
      telephone system usually works very well. But, if for any reason the telephone system is not&#xD;
      working, the research staff will report any moderate or severe sadness or distress to your&#xD;
      doctor or nurse. Your doctor or nurse also will receive a written summary of your symptom&#xD;
      ratings before your next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the standard care group, your symptom information will not be&#xD;
      collected using the telephone system. You will be asked to tell your doctor and/or nurse&#xD;
      about all symptoms you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone System:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the feedback group, the research staff will teach you how to use a telephone&#xD;
      system for measuring your symptoms. The research staff also will ask you to practice using&#xD;
      the telephone system. The telephone system will call you 1 time a week for 16 weeks. You will&#xD;
      be asked to rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere with your life. You can&#xD;
      set up a time to receive the phone calls that works best for you. Rating your symptoms using&#xD;
      the telephone system will take about 5 minutes for each call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you do not answer the telephone system on the first call, then the system will try to&#xD;
      reach you 3 more times. If you do not answer after the fourth try, then the research staff&#xD;
      will call you to find out why you could not answer the telephone system. If you prefer, the&#xD;
      research staff will change the day or time that the telephone system calls you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires and Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to fill out 3 questionnaires during 3 regularly scheduled clinic visits.&#xD;
      These questionnaires ask questions about pain, stress, sadness, quality of life, and other&#xD;
      symptoms you may be experiencing. You will also compete an interview at the first and third&#xD;
      visit. During the interview, you will be asked questions about your feelings and emotions.&#xD;
      The questionnaires and interview will be completed at the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit when you enroll in the study, 8-10 weeks after the study begins, and&#xD;
           14-16 weeks after the study begins, you will complete the questionnaires. This will take&#xD;
           about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit and 14-16 weeks after the study begins, you will complete a short&#xD;
           interview. Completing the interview will take about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will last up to 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 166 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
