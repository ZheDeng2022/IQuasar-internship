      This will be a single-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, two-way crossover&#xD;
      study in healthy male and female subjects. There will be two treatment periods each&#xD;
      consisting of 7 days. During each treatment period subjects will receive single doses of&#xD;
      ketoconazole or placebo on the morning of days 1-6 with a single dose of GW642444M on the&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator only if the finding is unlikely to introduce additional&#xD;
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
             ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12&#xD;
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with&#xD;
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml&#xD;
             (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
             in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they&#xD;
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation&#xD;
             of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.&#xD;
             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT&#xD;
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in&#xD;
             Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of&#xD;
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until after&#xD;
             the final follow-up visit has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated ability to use the inhaler device in a satisfactory and repeatable manner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers, who have not used any inhaled tobacco products&#xD;
             (snuff is permitted) in the 12 month period preceding the screening visit and who have&#xD;
             a pack history of ≤ 10 pack years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following&#xD;
             requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ventricular rate ≥ 40 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PR interval ≥ 120 and ≤ 210 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Q waves &lt; 30 msec (up to 50 msec permitted in lead III only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QRS interval to be ≥ 60 msec and ≤ 120 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  QTc interval must be &lt; 450 msec (QTcB or QTcF; machine or manual reading) based on an&#xD;
             average from three ECGs obtained over a brief recording period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 ≥ 80% predicted and a FEV1 / FVC ratio ≥ 0.7 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure which is outside the range 90 to 140 mmHg, diastolic blood&#xD;

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a&#xD;

             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
