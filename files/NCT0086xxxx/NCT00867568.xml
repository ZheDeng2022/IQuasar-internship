    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug (TPI 287) for&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma both alone and in combination with temozolomide (a&#xD;
      currently approved drug). An investigational drug is one that has not yet been approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration. This investigational drug is called TPI 287. This study&#xD;
      will look at the safety and tolerability of TPI 287 both alone and in combination with&#xD;
      temozolomide, and look to establish a safe dose of this agent. The study will also look at&#xD;
      the tumor's response to these drugs, but this is not the primary objective of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPI 287 was shown to be effective in stopping tumor growth and was also shown to be safe in&#xD;
      three different animal species. TPI 287 has been tested in humans in four clinical trials,&#xD;
      and approximately 100 subjects with various types of cancers have received the drug. All of&#xD;
      these subjects that have received TPI 287 have been adults. TPI 287 has not been tested in a&#xD;
      pediatric population before this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide was tested in recurrent neuroblastoma and showed activity in a recently&#xD;
      published study. Preclinical studies of TPI in combination with temozolomide have shown at&#xD;
      minimum an additive effect. The ability of temozolomide and TPI 287 to be effective in&#xD;
      combination is suggested by these two drugs showing even greater activity when used together.&#xD;

      Neuroblastoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor and accounts for 7% to&#xD;
      10% of childhood cancers (American Cancer Society 2008; Bernstein et al. 1992). Whereas the&#xD;
      prognosis for infants with neuroblastoma is generally good, currently only 30% of children&#xD;
      diagnosed after 12-15 months of age survive despite aggressive multimodal therapies (Brodeur&#xD;
      et al 1993; Park et al 2008). High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) and maintenance therapy with retinoic acid improves survival by&#xD;
      35% in children presenting with metastatic NB, but the 5-year event-free survival remains&#xD;
      below 50% (Matthay et al, 1999; Hartmann, et al, 1999). Consequently, the evaluation of new&#xD;
      drugs is strongly needed in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medulloblastoma:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and accounts for 16% of&#xD;
      all brain tumors in children 0-14 years old and 6% in adolescents 15-19 years old (CBTRUS&#xD;
      2008). Current therapies for children with disseminated disease are associated with severe&#xD;
      long-term toxicities, and lead to cure in only a minority of cases. (Partap et al, 2007).&#xD;
      Thus, the development of new therapies-especially ones with more favorable toxicity&#xD;
      profiles-would represent a significant improvement in the treatment of this disease. Although&#xD;
      there have been reports that the survival rate of children with chemosensitive relapsed&#xD;
      medulloblastoma can approach 40% following intensive chemotherapy combined with autologous&#xD;
      stem cell support, more recent data looking at survival of all patients relapsing after&#xD;
      modern combination chemotherapy and radiation is also on the order of 10-15%. (Rood, et al,&#xD;
      2004) As such, new therapeutic approaches are needed to treat these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 The Investigational Product TPI 287 1.3.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. developed a novel anti-microtubule agent, TPI 287, for which&#xD;
      Archer Biosciences, Inc. is now the sponsor. TPI 287 is synthetically manufactured from&#xD;
      naturally occurring taxanes extracted from yew starting material. The synthesis involves&#xD;
      modifications of the side chain to make the drug more lipophilic, and modification of the&#xD;
      baccatin ring structure with the intent of circumventing MDR-based resistance and allowing&#xD;
      for binding to mutant tubulin. Selection of TPI 287 was also made on the basis of the very&#xD;
      high potency of this drug against several neuroblastoma cell lines and xenograft models (see&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro, TPI 287 was shown to have comparable cytotoxicity to paclitaxel in several MDR-&#xD;
      cell lines, but was 5 - 3900-fold more active than several comparator compounds in MDR+ cells&#xD;
      lines. In MCF-7-AR breast cancer cells, which display MDR-based resistance, TPI 287 was&#xD;
      20-times more active than paclitaxel. Similar findings were observed in MDR+ cells derived&#xD;
      from colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, as well as from neuroblastoma, as noted.TPI 287&#xD;
      was also evaluated in a variety of xenograft models. As in vitro, TPI 287 was superior to&#xD;
      paclitaxel in vivo in the MCF-7-AR xenograft. TPI 287 also had superior activity when&#xD;
      compared to SN-38 in the HCT-15 and HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts; when compared to&#xD;
      docetaxel in the PC3 prostate cancer xenograft; and when compared to docetaxel and&#xD;
      doxorubicin in the MV522 NSCLC xenograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity against glioblastoma was shown in transplanted xenografts, and efficacy was&#xD;
      demonstrable using both IV and oral administration. In addition, in an orthotopic xenograft&#xD;
      using U251 cells implanted in the brains of nude mice, treatment with either TPI 287,&#xD;
      temozolomide, or combinations were compared to control animals, evaluating median survival&#xD;
      (10 animals per group) as well as animals whose survival extended beyond 110 days. The&#xD;
      results of this study, repeated for corroboration at an outside facility, are shown in Table&#xD;
      4. Significant synergy and improvement in long term survival can be seen with the combination&#xD;
      of temozolomide (TMZ) plus TPI 287.Potent activity had also been shown against neuroblastoma&#xD;
      cell lines as previously noted, and this was also demonstratable in transplanted xenografts,&#xD;
      showing greater activity than paclitaxel, docetaxel or nab-paclitaxel. Studies recently&#xD;
      completed (Sholler, et al, personal communication) show TPI 287 has activity against&#xD;
      additional neuroblastoma cell lines as well as medulloblastoma cell lines and increased&#xD;
      efficacy when TPI 287 is combined with TMZ in neuroblastoma.Toxicology studies demonstrated&#xD;
      that TPI 287 was generally well tolerated. The MTD in the rat was 48 mg/kg and in the dog,&#xD;
      12.5 mg/kg. Toxicity was primarily characterized by bone marrow suppression and mucositis.&#xD;

The starting dose of 90 mg/m2 (Dose Level 1) is 75% of the established adult MTD for this schedule in adults, which is 125 mg/m2. Dose escalation will take place in a standard 3+3 design, in which doses will increase by approximately 20 to 25% in successive 3-patient cohorts.</description>
