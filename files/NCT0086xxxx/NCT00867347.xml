      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount&#xD;
      of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective than surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared with surgery in treating patients with bladder cancer who are receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility and patient acceptability of radical cystectomy vs&#xD;
           selective bladder preservation (SBP) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
           muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine compliance rates of patients with their assigned treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if bladder preservation is equivalent to radical cystectomy, in terms of&#xD;
           overall survival, in responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall survival of patients receiving SBP vs radical cystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rate of salvage cystectomy in patients undergoing bladder preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine and compare the toxicity of treatment in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine and compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare locoregional progression-free and metastasis-free survival of patients&#xD;
           treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to cancer center and&#xD;
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients are assessed after completion of 3 courses of&#xD;
      pre-study neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with poor response (≥ pT2, residual pT2,&#xD;
      macroscopic invasive tumor) undergo immediate radical cystectomy (within 6 weeks fo&#xD;
      completing chemotherapy). Patients* with responsive disease (≤ pT1 tumor or macroscopically&#xD;
      normal bladder) proceed to course 4 of chemotherapy (on-study) followed by treatment&#xD;
      according to randomization arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients with a clear bladder or those who are unsure of their histological results&#xD;
      prior to course 4 also proceed to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Course 4 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
           30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (radical cystectomy): Patients undergo a radical cystectomy, including pelvic&#xD;
           lymphadenectomy, between 4 and 6 weeks after initiating course 4 of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (selective bladder preservation): Patients with no visible residual tumor (cT0 or&#xD;
           pT0) or residual but superficial tumor (pTa, pT1) undergo radiotherapy beginning within&#xD;
           4-6 weeks of day 1 of course 4 and continuing for 6.5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life is assessed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;
