  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired disorder of pigmentation that leads to irregular pigmented patches on&#xD;
      the face. Treatment is difficult and to date the best treatment option is the combination of&#xD;
      hydroquinone, retinoic acid and steroids combined in topical daily application (called&#xD;
      Kligman's trio). Q-switched pigmentary lasers are usually ineffective and can induce post&#xD;
      inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Intense pulsed light can sometimes improve melasma but&#xD;
      also induce PIH which limit their use. Recently, pulsed dye laser were demonstrated to be&#xD;
      effective in treating some pigmentary defects. Associating blanching cream with hydroquinone&#xD;
      to prevent PIH after laser or intense pulsed light has been already reported with success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare in a prospective intra individual comparative trial&#xD;
      the association of pulsed dye laser plus stabilized Kligman's trio to Kligman's trio alone.&#xD;
      The secondary objective was to study the frequency and the intensity of the potential side&#xD;
      effects including PIH.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be treated by stabilized Kligman's trio with daily application during 4 months.&#xD;
After one month, the left side of the face will be treated with pulsed dye laser at the rate of 3 sessions (one every weeks).&#xD;
Applications of cream will be stopped on both side of the face for the 3 days following each laser session. Final visit will be scheduled 1 month after the end of applications of stabilized Kligman's trio.&#xD;
All the patients will used a sunscreen indication 50 + for the duration of the entire study.&#xD;
The patient is her own witness. They compare the hemiface treated without laser and the hemiface treated with the laser.</description>

    <description>All patients will be treated by stabilized Kligman's trio at the rate of application in the evening during 4 months.&#xD;
After one month, the side of the right face will be treated by pulsed dye laser at the rase of 3 sessions spaced out by 3 weeks each.&#xD;
Applications will be stopped in the 3 days which will follow every session by laser with blown colouring agent. The patients will be seen again 1 month after the stopping of applications of stabilized Kligman's trio&#xD;
All patients will be used a sunscreen indication 50 + for the duration of study.&#xD;
The patient is her own witness. They compare the cheek treated without laser and the cheek treated with the laser.</description>
