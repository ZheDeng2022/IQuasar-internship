    <textblock>
      Iron fortification of foods is usually considered the most cost-effective approach to prevent&#xD;
      iron deficiency. However, iron is the most difficult mineral to add to foods. When added as&#xD;
      water-soluble, highly bioavailable compounds such as ferrous sulfate, the soluble iron&#xD;
      rapidly catalyzes fat oxidation resulting in rancid products. In addition, water-soluble iron&#xD;
      compounds can cause unacceptable color reactions during storage and food preparation. Thus,&#xD;
      food manufacturers are often obliged to use water-insoluble iron compounds to fortify foods&#xD;
      and fortification compounds such as elemental Fe powder and ferric pyrophosphate are widely&#xD;
      used to fortify cereal flours and infant cereals. However, these compounds never dissolve&#xD;
      completely in the gastric juice and are usually far less well absorbed than ferrous sulfate&#xD;
      (Hurrell 1997). Ferrous fumarate on the other hand, although almost insoluble in water,&#xD;
      readily dissolves in the gastric juice and has been shown to have an equivalent absorption to&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate in healthy, Western adults (Hurrell et al. 1989, 2000). Because it is&#xD;
      non-water soluble, it causes relatively few sensory problems in the fortified foods and is&#xD;
      therefore an interesting food fortificant. Iron absorption from ferrous fumarate has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be significantly higher than from ferric pyrophosphate in European infants&#xD;
      (Davidsson et al. 2000) and this compound is currently used to fortify blended cereal flours&#xD;
      for food aid programs and commercial infant cereals in Europe. However, based on our recent&#xD;
      study in Bangladeshi children, there is now concern that due to lower gastric acid output,&#xD;
      young children in developing countries may not be able to absorb ferrous fumarate as well as&#xD;
      Western adults (Davidsson et al. 2001a, Sarker et al. 2001, 2003). Clearly, there is a need&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of water insoluble iron compounds to prevent the development of iron&#xD;
      deficiency/iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children living in developing&#xD;
      countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ferrous fumarate and ferric&#xD;
      pyrophosphate, as compared to ferrous sulfate, as food fortificants in preventing development&#xD;
      of anemia/IDA in Bangladeshi infants and young children (part I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential cause of low gastric acid secretion in Bangladesh and many developing countries&#xD;
      is Helicobacter pylori infection. Although H. pylori-infection appeared to have no influence&#xD;
      on absorption of ferrous fumarate in children, the impact of chronic H. pylori infection in&#xD;
      adults could be expected to be more pronounced due to long time effects on the gastric&#xD;
      mucosa, resulting in reduced gastric acid output. The other aim of the study is therefore, to&#xD;
      assess of iron absorption and gastric acid output in adult women of child-bearing age with H.&#xD;
      pylori infection (part II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred and forty non-anemic Children (Hb&gt;105 g/L) will be randomized to three study&#xD;
      groups; ferrous fumarate, ferric pyrophosphate or ferrous sulfate (n=80 per group) in wheat&#xD;
      flour- and cow milk-based infant formula and will be fed for 9 months. Hemoglobin, serum&#xD;
      ferritin, and transferin receptor will be analyzed at baseline and after 4.5 and 9 months of&#xD;
      intervention. Prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency during and after the intervention&#xD;
      among the three groups will be compared (part I). We furthermore propose a complementary&#xD;
      study to determine the relative absorption of ferrous fumarate (relative to ferrous sulfate)&#xD;
      in H. pylori infected and non-infected adult Bangladeshi women (15 each) of 20-40 year of age&#xD;
      with IDA using stable isotope technique based on the incorporation of iron stable isotopes&#xD;
      into erythrocytes 14 days after administration. Assessment of gastric acid output will also&#xD;
      be performed. Iron stature and absorption, and assessment of gastric acid output will be&#xD;
      compared before and after therapy in H. pylori infected women (part II). The results of this&#xD;
      study are expected to have implications in the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency&#xD;
      anemia in developing countries&#xD;

      The efficacy study will test the ability of ferrous fumarate and ferric pyrophosphate to&#xD;
      prevent anemia/IDA in non-anemic Bangladeshi infants/young children in comparison to ferrous&#xD;
      sulfate during a 9 month feeding trial. Hemoglobin and indicators of Fe status (ferritin and&#xD;
      circulating transferrin receptor) and an acute phase reactant (C-reactive protein) will be&#xD;
      monitored at baseline and after 4.5 and 9 months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Non-anemic infants and young children (6-24 months; n=240) (Hb &gt;105g/L) will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study from the population at Nandipara, a peri-urban community near Dhaka&#xD;
      city. All children will be randomized to one of three study groups; ferrous fumarate, ferric&#xD;
      pyrophosphate or ferrous sulfate (n=80 per group), and stratified based on H. pylori&#xD;
      infection (based on H. pylori stool antigen test, positive or negative) at base line. All&#xD;
      infants/young children will be retested for H. pylori infection at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents or guardians will be fully informed about the aim and procedures of the study and&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from at least one parent/guardian per child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Exclusion criteria include children with anemia (Hb&lt;105 g/L), systemic&#xD;
      infection or apparent inflammatory process or weight for age of &lt; 70% of NCHS median. The&#xD;
      children with exclusion criteria will be appropriately treated or if needed, or will be&#xD;
      referred to appropriate health center for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is based on the expected anemia prevalence after the intervention, i.e.,&#xD;
      children with anemia after 9 months of intake of fortified infant cereal. We assume that the&#xD;
      prevalence of anemia will be 10% in infants consuming cereal fortified with ferrous sulfate,&#xD;
      30% in infants consuming cereal fortified with ferrous fumarate and 50% anemia in infants&#xD;
      consuming cereal fortified with ferric pyrophosphate. To detect a difference of 20% points&#xD;
      ((P1 - P2); sulfate versus fumarate and sulfate versus pyrophosphate) with 95% confidence and&#xD;
      power=0.80, the sample size is calculated to 62 infants/young children per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a drop out rate of about 25 %, we will recruit 80 infants/young children per group&#xD;
      i.e. 240 non-anemic infants/young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume a high prevalence of anemia (70-80%) in the study population and will therefore&#xD;
      need to screen approximately 1000-1200 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortified food Each serving will consist of 25 g infant cereal based on wheat or rice flour&#xD;
      and cow milk (produced especially for the study; 9.3 mg Fe as ferrous fumarate, ferric&#xD;
      pyrophosphate or ferrous sulfate/25 g dry cereal will be added during manufacture. Ascorbic&#xD;
      acid will be added during manufacture at a molar ratio 3:1 relative to added Fe. Fortified&#xD;
      infant cereals will be administered by health workers, one serving per day, 6 days per week,&#xD;
      under close supervision by the study physician/investigators. Intake will be monitored weekly&#xD;
      and, if needed, fed during 7 days per week to compensate for days when the child was sick or&#xD;
      absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fortified food will provide the Recommended Nutrient Intake of iron for infants 7-12&#xD;
      months according to WHO/FAO 2002 (in press; please see PAHO/FNP/USAID consultation 2001) per&#xD;
      serving, i.e., 9.3 mg Fe. Fortified infant cereal will be fed once per day, 6 days per week,&#xD;
      for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary information by simplified food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ), validated and&#xD;
      currently being used by the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP), will also be&#xD;
      obtained twice a month. Anthropometrical measurement e.g. weight, height, and mid upper arm&#xD;
      circumference (MUAC) will be measured at baseline, at 4.5 months and 9 months of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parents or guardians will be fully informed about the aim and procedures of the study and&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from at least one parent/guardian per child. All anemic&#xD;
      infants/young children (diagnosed during the screening study) will be treated with medicinal&#xD;
      Fe according to standard treatment practice at ICDDR.B; (ferrous sulfate drops; (2 mg Fe/kg&#xD;
      BW/d) for 2 months. Infants/young children with anemia at 4.5 and 9 months (efficacy study)&#xD;
      will be treated with medicinal Fe (ferrous sulfate drops; (2 mg Fe/kg BW/d) for 2 months and&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Medicinal Fe will be administered by health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hookworm infection is not prevalent in this community but all children participating in the&#xD;
      study will be screened for hookworm infection at the time each blood sampling. Infected&#xD;
      children will be treated with Albendazole 400 mg single dose for two times (2 weeks apart)&#xD;
      but will not be excluded from the intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analysis Venous blood samples will be drawn (2 ml in EDTA treated tubes) during the&#xD;
      screening study to identify non-anemic infants/young children and at baseline and after 4.5&#xD;
      and 9 months of intervention. Hb will be analyzed using the cyanomethemoglobin method (Sigma&#xD;
      kit, Sigma, St Louis, MO). Plasma ferritin and plasma circulating transferrin receptor will&#xD;
      be measured by ELISA technique by using commercial kits during the initial screening study&#xD;
      (Ramco, Houston, TX). Samples drawn at baseline and after 4.5 and 9 months of intervention&#xD;
      will be analyzed at KUMC for plasma ferritin and plasma circulating transferrin receptor by&#xD;
      ELISA assays based on monoclonal antibodies (Flowers et al. 1986)/dual monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      (Flowers et al. 1989). Plasma samples will also be analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP) at&#xD;
      KUMC. CRP will be monitored as an acute phase reactant. Dr. Cook and Ms. Flowers are&#xD;
      currently developing a monoclonal ELISA technique for CRP, which will be used in this study.&#xD;
      Commercial quality control materials (DiaMed, Cressier sur Morat, Switzerland, Sigma and&#xD;
      Ramco) will be analyzed together with all series of samples analyzed for Hb and ferritin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food analysis Infant cereals will be analyzed for Fe and calcium (Ca) by electrothermal/flame&#xD;
      atomic absorption spectroscopy (SpectrAA 400, Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) after&#xD;
      mineralization by microwave digestion (MLS 1200) using a HNO3/H2O2 mixture, using standard&#xD;
      addition technique to minimize matrix effects. The phytic acid content will be determined by&#xD;
      HPLC technique (Sandberg &amp; Ahderinne 1986, Sandberg et al. 1989&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples; screening for H. pylori infection and hookworm infection Stool specimens will&#xD;
      be collected and tested for the presence of H. pylori antigen (HpSA) by a newly developed&#xD;
      enzyme immunoassay (EIA). A polyclonal commercial kit (H. pylori antigen EIA; Cat# 740096,&#xD;
      Novitech, Freiburg, Germany) will be used. The HpSA test has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      sensitive (&gt;80 %) and specific (&gt;95 %) for the detection of H.pylori infection (Braden et al.&#xD;
      2000, Vakil et al. 2000, Sarker et al. personal communication 2003). Stool samples will also&#xD;
      be screened for the presence of parasite eggs, using standard microscopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics ANOVA will be used to compare variables within each study group as well as between&#xD;
      the 3 study groups. Results with significant F ratio (p&lt;0.05) will be further analyzed by&#xD;
      Student's t-test using multiple comparison procedure. Different outcome variables, i.e., Hb,&#xD;
      ferritin, and TfR concentrations before and after intervention in each group will be compared&#xD;
      by paired t-test. Data with skewed distribution will be normalized by log transformation&#xD;
      before statistical analysis. Chi-squared test will be used to evaluate binary variables at&#xD;
      different time points during the study. Odds Ratios and confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression and multiple regression) will also be&#xD;
      performed to adjust for confounders, e.g. age, nutritional status.&#xD;
