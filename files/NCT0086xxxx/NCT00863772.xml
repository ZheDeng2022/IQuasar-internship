    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical and Mental Component Scores at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36v2 is a self-administered questionnaire evaluating 8 aspects/domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, general health, social function, role emotional and mental health. Total score for each aspect were scaled 0-100(100=highest level of functioning). For obtaining physical and mental component scores, z-score for each scale=(observed score - mean score for general 1990 United States [US] population)/corresponding standard deviation. The 2 component scores were obtained by multiplying each aspect z-score by physical or mental factor score coefficient (1990 general US population) and summing the eight products. Component scores indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive z-score [better functioning])/lower (in case of negative z-score [worse functioning]) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. Change from baseline &gt;0 indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>5NC(nd)+HRdb(nd)composite score included 5 Nerve Conduction Studies(NCS)attributes(peroneal motor nerve distal latency [MNDL],peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential[CMAP],peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity[MNCV],tibial MNDL,sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude [SNAP])and HRdb value. Values of attributes scored as percentile(calculated from distribution of normal values corresponding to participant's baseline demographic characteristics),then expressed as normal deviate(nd)score based on standard normal distribution.Score &gt;0=worse response,less than(&lt;)0=better response compared to normal matched population.Score change&gt;0=worsening,&lt;0=improvement compared to baseline.2 neurological visits(NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. NCS measurements were collected once at each NV.HRdb measurements were collected twice and highest nd score was selected at each NV.

        <description>5NC(nd)+HRdb(nd)composite score included 5 Nerve Conduction Studies(NCS)attributes(peroneal motor nerve distal latency [MNDL],peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential[CMAP],peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity[MNCV],tibial MNDL,sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude [SNAP])and HRdb value. Values of attributes scored as percentile(calculated from distribution of normal values corresponding to participant's baseline demographic characteristics),then expressed as normal deviate(nd)score based on standard normal distribution.Score &gt;0=worse response,less than(&lt;)0=better response compared to normal matched population.Score change&gt;0=worsening,&lt;0=improvement compared to baseline.2 neurological visits(NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. NCS measurements were collected once at each NV.HRdb measurements were collected twice and highest nd score was selected at each NV. Mean of selected measurements at each NV was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>

Components of muscle weakness (hip and knee flexion, hip and knee extension, ankle dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, toe extensors, toe flexors) scored on scale 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score=greater weakness. Components of reflexes (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae); sensation (touch pressure, pin-prick, vibration, joint position) scored 0 = normal, 1 = decreased, or 2 = absent.

        <description>Peroneal motor nerve compound muscle action potential amplitude (in millivolts) was measured using electromyography of the left lower limb. Values were scored as percentiles (calculated from distribution of normal values corresponding to participant's baseline demographic characteristics), then expressed as normal deviate (nd) score based on standard normal distribution. Score &lt;0 indicated worse response and &gt;0 indicated better response than the normal matched population. Score change &lt;0 indicated worsening and &gt;0 indicated improvement as compared to baseline. 2 neurological visits (NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. Mean of the two NV measurements was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>

          <description>Peroneal motor nerve distal latency (in milliseconds) was measured using electromyography of the left lower limb. Values were scored as percentiles (calculated from distribution of normal values corresponding to participant's baseline demographic characteristics), then expressed as normal deviate (nd) score based on standard normal distribution. Score &gt;0 indicated worse response and &lt;0 indicated better response as compared to normal matched population. Score change &gt;0 indicated worsening and &lt;0 indicated improvement as compared to baseline. 2 neurological visits (NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. Mean of the 2 NV measurements was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intravenous study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Missing values were imputed using LOCF method. Here 'number analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable at specific time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Tibial Motor Nerve Distal Latency (MNDL) Score at Week 24: PPAS</title>
          <description>Tibial motor nerve distal latency (in milliseconds) was measured using electromyography of the left lower limb. Values were scored as percentiles (calculated from distribution of normal values corresponding to participant's baseline demographic characteristics), then expressed as normal deviate (nd) score based on standard normal distribution. Score &gt;0 indicated worse response and &lt;0 indicated better response as compared to normal matched population. Score change &gt;0 indicated worsening and &lt;0 indicated improvement as compared to baseline. 2 neurological visits (NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. Mean of the 2 NV measurements was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>
          <population>PPAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intravenous study medication and excluded those who violated the exclusion criterion &quot;significant signs of neuropathy at baseline visits&quot;. Missing values were imputed using LOCF method. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable at specific time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <description>HRdb test was used to evaluate the effect of treatment on autonomic function. Participants took a series of 8 deep breaths and average heart rate difference was measured and compared to normative data. R-R (time between two consecutive R waves in the electrocardiogram) response to deep breathing was reported as a normal deviates. Score &lt;0 indicated worse response and &gt;0 indicated better response as compared to normal matched population. Score change &lt;0 indicated worsening and &gt;0 indicated improvement as compared to baseline. 2 neurological visits (NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. Measurements of HRdb were collected twice and highest nd score was selected at each NV. Mean of the 2 selected NV measurements was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Deep Breathing [HRdb] at Week 24: PPAS</title>
        <description>HRdb test was used to evaluate the effect of treatment on autonomic function. Participants took a series of 8 deep breaths and average heart rate difference was measured and compared to normative data. R-R (time between two consecutive R waves in the electrocardiogram) response to deep breathing was reported as a normal deviates. Score &lt;0 indicated worse response and &gt;0 indicated better response as compared to normal matched population. Score change &lt;0 indicated worsening and &gt;0 indicated improvement as compared to baseline. 2 neurological visits (NVs) were conducted both at baseline and Week 24. Measurements of HRdb were collected twice and highest nd score was selected at each NV. Mean of the 2 selected NV measurements was calculated to obtain Baseline and Week 24 values.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>PPAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intravenous study medication and excluded those who violated the exclusion criterion &quot;significant signs of neuropathy at baseline visits&quot;. Missing values were imputed using LOCF method. Here 'number analyzed' signifies participants who were evaluable at specific time points for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <description>Participants answered: Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today? Participants rated their condition using a 5-point scale where 1 = very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities), 2 = good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3 = fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4 = poor (Severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities) and, 5 =very poor (Very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher score indicated severe condition.</description>

        <description>Participants answered: Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today? Participants rated their condition using a 5-point scale where 1 = very good (asymptomatic and no limitation of normal activities), 2 = good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3 = fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4 = poor (Severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities) and, 5 =very poor (Very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities).

        <title>Number of Participants With Cumulative Reduction From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Participants with specified reduction (as percent) from baseline at Week 16 are reported.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more stiffness. Total score range for WOMAC stiffness subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate more stiffness. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical and Mental Component Scores at Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36v2 is a self-administered questionnaire evaluating 8 aspects/domains of functional health and wellbeing: physical function, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, general health, social function, role emotional and mental health. Total score for each aspect were scaled 0-100(100=highest level of functioning). For obtaining physical and mental component scores, z-score for each scale=(observed score - mean score for general 1990 United States [US] population)/corresponding standard deviation. The 2 component scores were obtained by multiplying each aspect z-score by physical or mental factor score coefficient (1990 general US population) and summing the eight products. Component scores indicated how many standard deviations higher (in case of positive z-score [better functioning])/lower (in case of negative z-score [worse functioning]) participant's value was relative to the mean of the reference population. Change from baseline &gt;0 indicates an improvement.</description>
