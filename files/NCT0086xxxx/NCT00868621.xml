    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a widespread condition characterized by urgency, urge&#xD;
      incontinence, nocturia and excessive urinary frequency, affecting millions of people&#xD;
      worldwide.(1) In two epidemiological studies, OAB was found in about 17% of American and&#xD;
      European populations.(2)(3). This accounts for an estimated 33 million patients suffering&#xD;
      from OAB in the USA. The disorder constitutes a psychological stress that impacts the&#xD;
      patient's social life.&#xD;

      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a widespread condition characterized by urgency, urge&#xD;
      incontinence, nocturia and excessive urinary frequency, affecting millions of people&#xD;
      worldwide.(1) In two epidemiological studies, OAB was found in about 17% of American and&#xD;
      European populations.(2)(3). This accounts for an estimated 33 million patients suffering&#xD;
      from OAB in the USA. The disorder constitutes a psychological stress that impacts the&#xD;
      patient's social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The luminal surface of the bladder is covered by the urothelium, which functions as a highly&#xD;
      efficient barrier to the movement of water and ionized substances across the bladder wall.(4)&#xD;
      Urothelial cells also have specialized sensory and signaling properties that allow them to&#xD;
      respond to their chemical and physical environment, and engage in reciprocal chemical&#xD;
      communication with neighboring nerves in the bladder wall. These properties are 1) nicotinic,&#xD;
      muscarinic, tachykinin, adrenergic and capsaicin (TRPV1) receptor expression, 2) sensitivity&#xD;
      to transmitters released from afferent and efferent nerves, 3) mechanosensitivity, 4) close&#xD;
      physical association with afferent nerves and 5) the ability to release chemical mediators&#xD;
      such as ATP and NO, which can regulate the activity of adjacent nerves and, thereby, trigger&#xD;
      local vascular changes and/or reflex bladder contractions.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transmitter release from urothelial cells appears to be mediated by a calcium dependent&#xD;
      exocytotic mechanism that is similar to the mechanism involved in transmitter release from&#xD;
      nerve terminals. Transmitters released from urothelial cells can act in an&#xD;
      autocrine/paracrine manner in the urothelium, or on subepithelial myofibroblasts, nerves or&#xD;
      blood vessels to influence various functions, including the urothelial barrier, local blood&#xD;
      flow and sensory mechanisms.(6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine cytokine assays have been studied in various bladder and kidney disorders with the hope&#xD;
      of understanding the pathophysiology and developing a noninvasive, reliable predictor of&#xD;
      disease progression and evaluate the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a severely debilitating syndrome of unknown etiology affecting&#xD;
      the urinary bladder that is mainly associated with urgency, frequency and pain.&#xD;
      Pro-inflammatory molecules and neuroinflammation are suggested in the patho-mechanism of IC.&#xD;
      Abdel Mageed and Ghoniem found out the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-k B) in&#xD;
      the bladder biopsy of IC patients. NF-k B is a transcription factor found in some&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, and inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      diseases. NF-k B has a role in induction of pro inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-2, IL-1β and&#xD;
      TNF-α. Activation of NF-k B was associated with 27, 8, 10 and 7 fold increase in TNF-α,&#xD;
      IL-10, IL-6 and IL-8 transcripts respectively.(7,8) Keay et al determined that the urine of&#xD;
      IC patients specifically contains a factor that inhibit primary bladder epithelial&#xD;
      proliferation, anti proliferative factor (APF) and it has significantly decreased heparin&#xD;
      binding epidermal growth factor like factor (HBEGF) and increased epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      (EGF) levels compared to urine from normal subjects.(9) Chai et al compared urine levels of&#xD;
      APF and HB-EGF before and after bladder distention and neurostimulation.(10,11) Both of urine&#xD;
      markers changed toward normal levels after hydrodistention or neuromodulation treatment of&#xD;
      IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary cytokines have also been studied in patients undergoing intravesical bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy for superficial bladder cancer.(12) BCG is thought to cause&#xD;
      local immunostimulation, resulting in infiltration of T-lymphocytes in the bladder wall.&#xD;
      After treatment, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF are significantly elevated in the urine. It is&#xD;
      thought that BCG induced cytokines may generate bladder tumor killing cells, and an elevation&#xD;
      of urine cytokines may correlate clinical response to BCG therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there have been studies that have attempted to identify specific measurable urinary&#xD;
      factors that lead to the progression of chronic renal disease. Cytokines are involved in the&#xD;
      recruitment of inflammatory cells, leading to infiltration in the diseased kidney, ultimately&#xD;
      resulting in renal scarring. Elevated levels of urinary IL-6 and TNF receptor-1 are&#xD;
      identified in children with vesicoureteral reflux associated with reflux nephropathy and&#xD;
      renal scarring.(13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute renal allograft rejection is a result of the recipient's immune response to the donor&#xD;
      kidney, and 35% of these patients experience an episode of acute rejection the first year&#xD;
      after surgery. Elevated urinary cytokines have been measured in patients who have biopsy&#xD;
      proven renal allograft acute rejection.(14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary cytokines and markers have been identified in different urological disorders. They&#xD;
      are used to understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis and evaluation of the treatment of&#xD;
      these disorders. We hypothesize that there is urothelial abnormality in cases of overactive&#xD;
      bladder that leads to elaboration of certain kinds of urinary cytokines. To our knowledge, no&#xD;
      study has been published evaluating urinary markers in patients with OAB.&#xD;
