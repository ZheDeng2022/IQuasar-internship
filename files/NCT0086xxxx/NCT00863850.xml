        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed, relapsed or&#xD;
             refractory malignancy, except for uveal melanoma, sarcoma or primary brain tumors.&#xD;
             Additionally, the malignancy must be considered unresponsive or poorly responsive to&#xD;
             accepted treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient, if a woman, is surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of&#xD;
             child bearing potential, using a medically accepted method of contraception, and&#xD;
             agrees to continued use of this method for the duration of the study and for 90 days&#xD;
             after discontinuation of study drug. Acceptable methods of contraception include&#xD;
             abstinence or an intrauterine device (IUD) known to have a failure rate of less than&#xD;
             1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient, if a man, is surgically sterile, or, if capable of producing offspring,&#xD;
             is currently using an approved method of birth control and agrees to continued use of&#xD;
             this method for the duration of the study (and for 90 days after taking the last dose&#xD;
             of study medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000 cells/mm3, platelet count ≥100000 cells/mm3, and&#xD;
             hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has adequate hepatic function. For patients without liver metastases,&#xD;
             adequate hepatic function is defined as ≤2.5 x upper limit of the normal range [ULN]&#xD;
             for aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and ≤1.5 x&#xD;
             ULN for total bilirubin. For patients with liver metastases, adequate hepatic function&#xD;
             is defined as ≤5 x ULN for AST and ALT, and ≤1.5 x ULN for total bilirubin. Patients&#xD;
             with non-clinically significant elevations of bilirubin due to known or suspected&#xD;
             Gilbert's disease are eligible; this must be documented on the medical history page of&#xD;
             the case report form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt;30 mL/minute as determined by&#xD;
             the Cockcroft-Gault equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, or immunotherapy&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug or has not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to any agents administered previously. For patients who received therapy&#xD;
             with mitomycin C, the interval is 42 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has known cerebral metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is receiving treatment other than bendamustine for&#xD;
             hematologic/nonhematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had any previous treatment with bendamustine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has been treated with any hematopoietic growth factors within 14 days of&#xD;
             study entry (patients on chronic erythropoiesis stimulating agents are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had a serious infection, medical condition, or psychiatric condition&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, should preclude the patient from&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a known positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or&#xD;
             a history of HIV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has presence of inflammatory bowel disease, occlusion of the&#xD;
             gastrointestinal tract, significant constipation, or any condition resulting in&#xD;
             clinically significant obstruction of the urinary tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient requires treatment with cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inducers or&#xD;
             inhibitors on days 1 through 8 of cycle 1, has used CYP1A2 inhibitors within 14 days&#xD;
             before the 1st administration of study drug, or has used CYP1A2 inducers within 30&#xD;
             days before the 1st administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is a smoker or an ex-smoker who stopped smoking less than 3 months before&#xD;
             the 1st dose of study drug or is using or has used topical or oral nicotine&#xD;
             preparations for smoking cessation within the past 3 months before the 1st dose of&#xD;
             study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has known hypersensitivity to bendamustine or any if its components (i.e.,&#xD;
             mannitol).&#xD;
