  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid management of surgical patients has changed dramatically in recent years. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that so called 'restrictive' fluid strategies can improve outcomes such as&#xD;
      length of stay and time to fitness for discharge. Furthermore, new monitoring technologies&#xD;
      have been developed that allow the clinician to better monitor the effects of intravenous&#xD;
      fluid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid management of free flap reconstruction surgery is controversial. As vasoactive&#xD;
      agent use during the anesthetic is not the preferred intervention for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypotension, fluid therapy is often administered to correct hemodynamic instability. A&#xD;
      liberal fluid strategy may predispose the flap to edema, venous congestion and ultimately&#xD;
      flap failure. A restrictive fluid strategy however has (at this institution) anecdotally been&#xD;
      reported to lead to a higher incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolus&#xD;
      (PE). Thus, there is clinical equipoise as to the optimal fluid management for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive cardiac output (CO) monitoring based on the arterial pulse contour is a nascent&#xD;
      technological advance that has been widely validated in the operating theatre. The&#xD;
      calculation of CO is based on the assumption that stroke volume is proportional to the&#xD;
      integral of the area under the arterial pressure versus time curve. With these monitors, the&#xD;
      variation in stroke volume during mechanical ventilation is also calculated and this can be&#xD;
      utilized as an estimate of the patient's volume status. A stroke volume variation (SVV) of&#xD;
      less than 15% has been shown to be indicative that a patient is no longer volume responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we plan to recruit patients undergoing microvascular free flap reconstruction.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either standard care, or goal directed fluid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a pre-operative 5 ml kg-1 bolus of normal saline. Subsequently, all&#xD;
      patients will then receive lactated ringers at a rate of 5 ml kg-1 hr-1. Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group will have their CO and SVV monitored by a Flo-Trac pulse contour monitor&#xD;
      (Edwards Life Sciences, Irvine, CA). Patients in the intervention group will receive 6%&#xD;
      tetrastarch boluses (Voluven, Fresenius Kabi, Hamburg, Germany) if their SVV exceeds 15%.&#xD;
      Patients in the control arm will receive fluid at a rate and type at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist to maintain hemodynamic stability and a urine output of 0.5 ml&#xD;
      kg-1 hr-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative variables studied will include total fluid administered (colloid and&#xD;
      crystalloid), urine output, SVV and CO (both at the start and end of surgery). Postoperative&#xD;
      variables examined will be urine output, daily fluid balance (days 0-3), incidence of DVT,&#xD;
      PE, pulmonary edema, rate of re-operation, daily serum creatinine, chloride and bicarbonate&#xD;
      concentration, and incidence of flap failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of flap oxygenation and water content will be made with near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy at baseline, and during the immediate post-operative period (days 1-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the goal directed group would have more intra-operative colloid given&#xD;
      with a reduced incidence of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
