      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of lopinavir/r in monotherapy and&#xD;
      peg-interferon plus ribavirin for the control of both HIV and HCV infection respectively&#xD;
      after 12 months of active treatment for HCV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral hepatitis, mainly when caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is highly significant in&#xD;
      the setting of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because high activity&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has a very favorable impact upon morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      this disease. HAART has achieved disease control, significantly increasing survival and&#xD;
      improving the quality of life of subjects with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spain has one of the highest prevalences of HIV-HCV co-infection because both HCV and HIV&#xD;
      infection are strongly associated to being or having been an intravenous drug user (IDU);&#xD;
      thus, from 61% to 69% of these subjects infected by HIV in Spain are also infected by HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 1998, standard treatment for chronic C hepatitis consists of the combination of&#xD;
      interferon alpha and ribavirin, based on an increased efficacy versus interferon monotherapy;&#xD;
      however, development of pegylated interferon, with a more convenient bioavailability as&#xD;
      compared to conventional interferon alpha, has allowed for developing even more effective&#xD;
      combined therapies and the possibility of improving response prediction based on changes in&#xD;
      viremia within the first few weeks of treatment. However, treatment of HCV infection usually&#xD;
      involves severe side effects, which often lead to treatment discontinuation or to the need&#xD;
      for adjusting drug dosage, in which case treatment efficacy may decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV+ subjects who, because of HIV co-infection, should also receive HAART, may have an&#xD;
      increased number or increased severity of adverse reactions due to interactions occurring&#xD;
      with drug co-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is a potent HIV protease inhibitor and is characterized by a very&#xD;
      high pharmacological and genetic barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies (subject cohorts, uncontrolled studies) during the past years have appeared&#xD;
      in the literature showing the efficacy of LPV/r or controlling viral replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies were conducted with the soft gel capsule formulation of LPV/r. In this study,&#xD;
      the new formulation of LPV/r (Kaletra) as tablets approved by the FDA and EMEA (Spain&#xD;
      authorization 30th Oct 2006) will be used. This new formulation will provide additional&#xD;
      benefits to this strategy that has only been studied to date with soft gel capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the foregoing and on the additional cost savings involved in this strategy, we think&#xD;
      that LPV/r, as single antiretroviral agent concomitantly administered with treatment for&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus infection may provide significant benefits because it would prevent&#xD;
      interactions between NRTIs and ribavirin, thus being potentially able to decrease the adverse&#xD;
      events derived from mitochondrial toxicity and minimizing the possibility of anemia. In&#xD;
      addition, replacement of NNRTIs by LPV/r may significantly decrease CNS involvement that may&#xD;
      be enhanced by co-administration of efavirenz and peg-interferon, or minimize the risk of&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity caused by nevirapine.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject is at least 18 years old, is co-infected by HIV and HCV, and has been&#xD;
             recommended treatment for HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Liver biopsy confirming the presence of chronic hepatitis performed within one year of&#xD;
             patient entry into the study.&#xD;

             least two viral load determinations lower than 50 cop/mL 6 months apart are required.&#xD;
             The inclusion of patients showing one single &quot;blip&quot; during the pre-enrollment past 6&#xD;
             months is allowed. A &quot;blip&quot; is defined as a HIV viral load greater or equal to 50&#xD;
             cop/mL both preceded and followed of viral loads inferior to 50 cop/mL without changes&#xD;
             in the antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CD4 at screening should be at least or greater to 350 cells/microl&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject on continued, uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy for the past 6 months with&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. LPV/r + 2 NRTIs/NtRTIs for at least 4 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. 1 NNRTI + 2 NRTIs&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. 3 NRTIs Only changes in protease inhibitor due solely to toxicity,&#xD;
                  simplification, or optimization are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has not been treated for an active opportunistic infection within 30 days of&#xD;
             the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a Karnofsky index &gt;-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Throughout the study, the patient does not require and agrees not to take any of the&#xD;
             following drugs, that are contraindicated with Kaletra: astemizole, terfenadine,&#xD;
             midazolam, triazolam, cisapride, certain ergot derivatives (ergotamine,&#xD;
             dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine), pimozide, propafenone, and&#xD;
             flecainide. Rifampin, a potent enzyme inducer, should not be administered with the&#xD;
             study medication due to the possibility of a significant decrease in Kaletra&#xD;
             concentrations during concomitant administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject agrees not to take any medication, including over-the-counter medicines,&#xD;
             alcohol, drugs, or herbal preparations without the knowledge and approval of the&#xD;
             principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Laboratory tests have been made in the subject in the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count &gt;750 cells/microL Platelet count&#xD;
             &gt;20.000/microL ALT or AST &lt;5 x upper normal limit (UNL) Creatinine &lt;1.5 x UNL&#xD;

             with ribavirin at least two contraceptive methods (including a barrier one).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from study participation if they meet any of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects in whom a switch in protease inhibitor has ever been made due to suspected or&#xD;
             documented virological failure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy or nursing, and in women of childbearing age, if they do not agree to use&#xD;
             throughout the study a barrier contraceptive method of proven reliability in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the opinion of the principal investigator, patient is unlikely to comply with the&#xD;
             study protocol, or the patient was not eligible for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects infected by the hepatitis B virus and who are being treated with tenofovir&#xD;
             (TDF) or lamivudine (3TC).&#xD;
