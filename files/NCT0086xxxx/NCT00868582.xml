      The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), as the Federal agency that administers&#xD;
      the Medicare program, only pays for positron emission tomography (PET) scans in patients with&#xD;
      cancer for certain reasons and for certain types of cancer. This study was developed to help&#xD;
      CMS determine if they should pay for PET scans for additional reasons and additional types of&#xD;
      cancer. In order to collect the information needed to decide which other types of cancer&#xD;
      should be covered by Medicare, CMS will provide payment for the otherwise non-covered PET&#xD;
      scans of patients who are properly registered with the National Oncologic PET Registry&#xD;
      (NOPR). This information will then be analyzed to determine the effect PET scans had on the&#xD;
      way physicians planned to treat their patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR) was developed in response to the Centers for&#xD;
      Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) proposal to expand coverage for positron emission&#xD;
      tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) to include cancers and indications not&#xD;
      presently eligible for Medicare reimbursement. Under this coverage with evidence development&#xD;
      (CED) program, Medicare reimbursement for these cancers can be obtained if the patient's&#xD;
      referring physician and the provider submit data to a clinical registry to assess the impact&#xD;
      of PET on cancer patient management. The NOPR implemented this registry for CMS. The NOPR is&#xD;
      sponsored by the World Molecular Imaging Society (formerly the Academy of Molecular Imaging),&#xD;
      and managed by the American College of Radiology through the American College of Radiology&#xD;
      Imaging Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original goal of the National Oncologic PET Registry was to assess the effect of positron&#xD;
      emission tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) on referring physicians' plans of&#xD;
      intended patient management for those cancers and indications not currently eligible for&#xD;
      reimbursement from CMS. Data were collected from the referring physician before and after the&#xD;
      PET study. If complete and timely data are reported to the NOPR within 30 days of the PET&#xD;
      scan, the PET facility and interpreting physician (nuclear physician/radiologist) are&#xD;
      eligible for reimbursement by CMS. Based in part on data obtained from the NOPR, CMS expanded&#xD;
      coverage for FDG-PET in patients with cancer on April 3, 2009 and further expanded coverage&#xD;
      on June 11, 2013. Specifically, on June 11, 2013, CMS issued a final decision memorandum&#xD;
      ending the prospective data collection requirements under CED for all oncologic indications&#xD;
      for FDG-PET. Overall accrual to the FDG-PET registry was nearly 288,000 scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On February 26, 2010, CMS announced its decision to cover the use NaF-18 PET to identify bone&#xD;
      metastasis. Under this new policy, the use of NaF-18 PET would be covered only under an&#xD;
      approved (CED) program. The NOPR obtained CMS approval to develop a registry for NaF-18 as an&#xD;
      amendment to the then-existing NOPR for FDG-PET. The NaF-18 PET registry component of NOPR&#xD;
      was activated for accrual on February 7, 2011. Estimated total accrual to the NaF-PET&#xD;
      registry is 45,000 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with the registry for FDG-PET, the goal of the NaF-18 PET registry component is to assess&#xD;
      the impact of this imaging examination on referring physicians' plans of intended management&#xD;
      of patients with known or suspected osseous metastatic disease. Data are collected from the&#xD;
      referring physician before and after the PET study, as well as from the interpreting&#xD;
      physician. If complete and timely data are reported to the NOPR within 30 days of the PET&#xD;
      scan, the PET facility and interpreting physician (nuclear physician/radiologist) are&#xD;
      eligible for reimbursement by CMS.&#xD;
