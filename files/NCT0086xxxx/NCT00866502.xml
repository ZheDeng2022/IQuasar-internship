    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product sNN0031,&#xD;
      containing Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), when administered directly into one of the&#xD;
      fluid filled cavities in the brain using an implanted catheter and an implanted SynchroMed®&#xD;
      II pump. Patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremor, rigidity, slow movement, poor balance, and difficulty walking are characteristic&#xD;
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that are associated with degeneration of&#xD;
      dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain. Administration of growth factors that stimulate&#xD;
      neuronal stem and progenitor cells is one possible approach to restore the dopaminergic&#xD;
      activity. The drug product sNN0031 containing the endogenous growth factor PDGF has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce the typical symptoms in animal models of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of PDGF in&#xD;
      the form of the drug product sNN0031 can improve motor function in patients with PD. In this&#xD;
      first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 2 weeks followed by 10 weeks&#xD;
      follow-up will be evaluated.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  MRI examination of the brain and cervical spinal cord within 3 months before&#xD;
             anticipated implantation of the device with no findings of tumors or potential sources&#xD;
             of pathological bleedings, or abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of&#xD;
             safety or efficacy or would, in the judgment of the investigator, represent a surgical&#xD;
             risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Values of coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalized prothrombin&#xD;
             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is medically able to undergo the surgery required for stereotactic&#xD;
             implantation of the catheter and infusion pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been given written and verbal information, has had opportunity to ask questions&#xD;
             about the study, and understands time and procedural commitments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed consent (written) to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             other neurological conditions including Shy-Drager syndrome (multiple system atrophy),&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent clinically significant depression with a score of 16 or higher on the MADRS&#xD;
             rating scale, equivalent to moderate or severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to neuroleptic drugs blocking dopamine receptors within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of structural brain disease including tumors and hyperplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of increased intracranial pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical procedures or implantation of device for the treatment of PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to any formulation of PDGF-BB (including topical)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (eg, signs of sepsis or inadequately&#xD;
             treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g. including bleeding disorders), or&#xD;
             renders chronic ICV delivery or device implants medically unsuitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that&#xD;
             is not managed optimally. Physicians should specifically investigate anatomical&#xD;
             factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities, neoplasms, or other&#xD;
             abnormalities), underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or&#xD;
             platelet count (e.g., hemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other&#xD;
             medical conditions), and the administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant&#xD;
             medication (e.g., aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDs) in the pre- or perioperative period. Any of&#xD;
             those conditions or drugs could place a patient at an increased risk for&#xD;
             intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an&#xD;
             implanted central nervous system (CNS) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable&#xD;
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the&#xD;
             programmer, without prior approval by Medtronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters as&#xD;
             assessed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the&#xD;
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (eg, severe&#xD;
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that&#xD;
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product&#xD;
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (eg, MRI, PET), or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within&#xD;
             3 months prior to Screening visit.&#xD;
