      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin E is an antioxidant that reduces the damaging effects of oxygen in the body.&#xD;
           Most American men (90%) and women (96%) do not get enough vitamin E from their diets;&#xD;
           however, the amount of vitamin E needed by the body has been studied only in men, not&#xD;
           women. In addition, it is unknown whether another antioxidant, vitamin C, helps vitamin&#xD;
           E in protecting the body. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, how much body fat&#xD;
           a person has could affect the amount of vitamin E needed for protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This study has three arms to examine vitamin E requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the amount of fat required to get the best vitamin E absorption from a&#xD;
           meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the amount (i.e., best dose) of vitamin E that must be consumed before it&#xD;
           can be measured in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine how vitamin E and vitamin C work together in the body, in conjunction with&#xD;
           diet and vitamin supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms 1 and 2: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight and&#xD;
           body mass index (BMI) of 27 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight (BMI 27), who&#xD;
           are overweight (BMI &gt; 27), or who are overweight (BMI &gt; 27) and have non&#xD;
           insulin-dependent diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study&#xD;
           = 10 months). Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C twice daily for 2 weeks&#xD;
           before admission to the clinical center for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing a known amount of fat, after which&#xD;
           they will take a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Other&#xD;
           foods contain only negligible amounts of vitamin E. Blood and urine samples will measure&#xD;
           levels of vitamin E and other substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however,&#xD;
           the amount of fat in the breakfast will range from 0% to 40% in random order. During one&#xD;
           of the studies, an adipose tissue biopsy will be collected to determine how much vitamin&#xD;
           E is in the tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study&#xD;
           = 10 months). Preparation for Arm 2 is the same as in Arm 1. The proportion of fat,&#xD;
           muscle, and water in the body will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing 30% fat, after which they will take&#xD;
           a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Conditions and&#xD;
           procedures are the same as in Arm 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however,&#xD;
           the amount of vitamin E in the breakfast will range from 2 to 30 mg in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: Outpatient (2 to 6 weeks) and inpatient studies (4 to 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient study: Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily and provide&#xD;
           blood and urine samples, as well as an adipose tissue sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatient studies: Two vitamin E inpatient studies. Before these begin, participants&#xD;
           vitamin C blood levels will be reduced by means of a diet low in vitamin C. Blood tests&#xD;
           will determine how quickly vitamin C leaves the body. Once the vitamin C level is&#xD;
           reduced, the first vitamin E study will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A: The procedure for this study is the same as in Arm 2, Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: The procedure for this study is the same as in Study A, except that the participants&#xD;
      blood vitamin C levels will be higher.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is essential for humans but determining human dietary&#xD;
      requirements has proved difficult. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is&#xD;
      not met by 96% of American women, without apparent harm. Because vitamin E is an antioxidant,&#xD;
      optimum consumption of vitamin E may improve the health of obese women who experience high&#xD;
      levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. We hypothesize that vitamin E functions as an&#xD;
      antioxidant is related to its tissue stores, and that delivery to tissue stores can be&#xD;
      calculated from plasma vitamin E turnover kinetics from slow release pools. We propose&#xD;
      turnover kinetics as a new means to estimate vitamin E recommended dietary allowance. We will&#xD;
      study vitamin E pharmacokinetics using dual stable-isotope labeled (deuterium)&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherols administered orally and intravenously to healthy nonobese, overweight and&#xD;
      overweight non-insulin requiring diabetic women. Blood samples will be collected at intervals&#xD;
      and vitamin E measured by mass spectrometry. Because ascorbic acid (vitamin C) concentrations&#xD;
      may alter alpha-tocopherol pharmacokinetics, subjects will be studied first at low and then&#xD;
      high steady state plasma vitamin C concentrations. Before this main study, two preliminary&#xD;
      trials will be performed. In preliminary trial 1, fat content for optimal absorption will be&#xD;
      assessed because fat-content of a meal may alter vitamin E absorption. The fat content in&#xD;
      preliminary trial 1 will be 0 - 40% of calories in the breakfast meal during which vitamin E&#xD;
      will be administered. In preliminary trial 2, optimal fat content from preliminary trial 1&#xD;
      will be used, and the vitamin E dose will be varied. Vitamin E dose amount could&#xD;
      non-specifically alter vitamin E kinetics. We will therefore determine the largest dose (2-30&#xD;
      mg) that does not non-specifically increase vitamin E turnover, with fat held constant.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will measure vitamin E pharmacokinetics as a function of lipid peroxidation&#xD;
      biomarkers to provide direct data that can be used to predict vitamin E requirements for&#xD;
      women, and to set new recommendations for vitamin E intakes. We will explore new&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherol functions, specifically whether gene transcription in human subjects is&#xD;
      regulated by vitamin E status in relation to vitamin C status. Because vitamin E turnover may&#xD;
      be affected by vitamin C concentrations, we will use a vitamin C depletion-repletion study&#xD;
      design to investigate the relationship between vitamin C status and vitamin E turnover.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients on antihypertensive medication are excluded even if blood pressure is well&#xD;
        controlled because antihypertensive medication may affect vitamin E status, thus&#xD;
        introducing a confounding variable. Whether antihypertensive medication interacts with&#xD;
        vitamin E is not&#xD;
&#xD;
        known. Patients on insulin treatment are excluded because Insulin treatment indicates a&#xD;
        more severe form of diabetes than the mild to moderate type two diabetes that need only&#xD;
        dietary treatment or treatment with submaximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents for&#xD;
        adequate blood sugar control. The effect of insulin administration on vitamin E is unknown,&#xD;
        and is a confounding factor that will make data interpretation difficult.&#xD;
