  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine: how safe it is to take SQ109 (an experimental&#xD;
      tuberculosis treatment) once a day by mouth for up to 2 weeks in 2 different dosages; how&#xD;
      well the body accepts it; how SQ109 enters and leaves the body and blood tissues over time;&#xD;
      the amounts that can be detected in the blood; and how long it stays in the body. The study&#xD;
      involves 30 volunteers: 24 will receive SQ109 and 6 will receive placebo (inactive&#xD;
      substance). Qualified participants will be admitted to the study unit within 28 days from the&#xD;
      screening and stay as inpatient for approximately 2 weeks. During this period they will&#xD;
      receive study drug and complete all scheduled procedures including multiple blood draws.&#xD;
      After discharge, there is a 14 day follow up period. Total study participation is about 56&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important global health problems. According to recent&#xD;
      estimates from the World Health Organization, 8 million new cases of TB and 1.9 million&#xD;
      deaths from TB occur annually, making TB the second leading cause of death from an infectious&#xD;
      pathogen. Due to multidrug resistant TB, the need for new and more effective drugs to treat&#xD;
      TB is well recognized. This study is a phase 1B, prospective, single-center, double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study of SQ109 to evaluate single-daily dose&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral SQ109 in healthy subjects. The objectives of&#xD;
      the study are to: determine the safety and tolerability of SQ109 administered daily for 14&#xD;
      days in healthy male and female volunteers; assess single dose and multiple dose PK of SQ109&#xD;
      administered daily for 14 days in healthy male and female volunteers; and assess single dose&#xD;
      and multiple dose PK of SQ109 administered twice per week after a 5-day loading regimen in&#xD;
      healthy, male and female volunteers. A total of 30 subjects, ages 18-45, will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study, allocated equally among 3 cohorts of 10 subjects each, 8 treated with active drug&#xD;
      and 2 with placebo. Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3 will receive an oral dose of 75 mg or 150 mg,&#xD;
      respectively, of study medication daily for 14 days. Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive 150 mg&#xD;
      daily for 5 days followed by 2 additional doses of 150 mg on Days 9 and 14. Subject&#xD;
      participation will include a screening visit within 28 days of study entry, a 14 day&#xD;
      in-patient treatment period, and a 14 day out-patient follow-up phase. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by study personnel continually during the 14 day in-patient treatment period and the&#xD;
      out-patient follow-up phase. Adverse events will be recorded for all subjects. Other safety&#xD;
      measures include laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), visual and neurological&#xD;
      assessments, physical examinations, and vital signs. Study duration will be approximately 6&#xD;
      months. Subject participation duration will be 56 days.&#xD;
