    <textblock>
      To determine the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of cetirizine hydrochloride formulations&#xD;
      after administration of single doses to normal healthy subjects under fasted conditions.&#xD;
      These data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet&#xD;
      bioequivalence criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec®) or related compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions that affect the absorption, metabolism or passage of drugs out of the body,&#xD;
             e.g., sprue, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, liver, kidney or thyroid&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;

             alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A hematocrit value of ≤ 33.0 % for females and ≤ 37.0 % for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donation of greater than 500 ml of blood in the past 4 weeks prior to study dosing or&#xD;
             difficulty in donating blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Received an investigational drug within the 4 weeks prior to study dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently taking any systemic prescription medications, except for&#xD;

             subject and/or her partner are: oral contraceptives/patches, progestin injection or&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Grapefruit beverages or foods beginning 7 days before each study medication&#xD;
             administration and alcohol, caffeine or xanthine beverages or foods beginning 24 hours&#xD;

             Such restricted items include coffee, tea, iced tea, Coke®, Pepsi®, Mountain DeW®,&#xD;
             chocolate, brownies, etc.&#xD;

             include barbiturates, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenylhydantoins, phenothiazines,&#xD;
             cimetidine,omeprazole, macrolides, imidazoles, fluoroquinolones) within 30 days prior&#xD;
             to study administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Positive test results for: HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Positive test results for: drugs of abuse or pregnancy at screening and prior to each&#xD;
