      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving&#xD;
      bortezomib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride when given together with rituximab and to see how well they work in&#xD;
      treating patients with progressive or relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining VELCADE (bortezomib) with gemcitabine&#xD;
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with recurrent lymphoma after standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine and Rituxan (rituximab)&#xD;
      administered in combination with VELCADE given on a 21-day (old schema - Schema I) or 28-day&#xD;
      (amended schema - Schema II) schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary data for response to this regimen in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib and gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
      followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV), gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 3-4 hours,&#xD;
      and rituximab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study&#xD;
      treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
