      Many grafts placed for dialysis access fail which causes patients to undergo additional&#xD;
      operations, decreases their quality of life, and increases health care costs. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to see if dialysis access grafts will function longer for patients who receive&#xD;
      additional oxygen by means of a nasal cannula for 42 days after placement of their graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have periodic blood tests to measure oxygen levels in their blood. A series of&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations of patient's dialysis grafts will be taken to ensure the graft is&#xD;
      open and to measure the cellular proliferation (intimal hyperplasia) for comparison in those&#xD;
      receiving extra oxygen and those with no oxygen.&#xD;

      Vascular bypass grafting is a commonly performed procedure in vascular and cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery and the preferred bypass grafts are autogenous vein. Creation of a vascular&#xD;
      anastomosis (AVA) is required at 2 sites (proximal and distal anastomoses) for every&#xD;
      synthetic bypass graft. It is estimated that 50% of vascular bypass failures are due to&#xD;
      anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH). Intimal thickening of the artery wall is a normal&#xD;
      response to healing at an anastomosis. Progression of intimal thickening leads to a&#xD;
      pathological, hyperplastic, occlusive lesion - AIH, which in turn results in myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, limb loss, death, graft failure, repeat operative procedures, and&#xD;
      increased medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our laboratory demonstrated in a rabbit model of AIH that: 1) there is a significant decrease&#xD;
      in the delivery of oxygen to the peri-anastomotic artery wall following creation of a&#xD;
      prosthetic vascular graft to artery anastomosis, 2) the oxygen gradient across the artery&#xD;
      wall in the area of a prosthetic vascular graft anastomosis normalizes over a period of 6&#xD;
      weeks as healing occurs, 3) the gradient can be normalized immediately following an&#xD;
      anastomosis by the administration of supplemental oxygen, and 4) the amount of AIH and smooth&#xD;
      muscle cell proliferation can be reduced by immediately administering supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      following creation of the anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-range goal of our program is to understand the role of oxygen in blood vessel wall&#xD;
      pathology. The specific objective of this project, which is the next step in the pursuit of&#xD;
      our long-range program goal, is to determine if supplemental oxygen can inhibit AIH in a&#xD;
      human graft model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Following review of inclusion and exclusion criteria suitable patients undergo&#xD;
      surgical placement of a graft for hemodialysis. Following surgery, patients randomized to&#xD;
      oxygen will breathe 5L supplemental oxygen during waking hours for 42 days. Periodic&#xD;
      ultrasounds will be taken to assess graft function and patency and to measure intimal&#xD;
      thickness. Patients will be followed for two years or until their graft fails.&#xD;
