  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to better understand the treatment outcomes of extended-release&#xD;
      methylphenidate and atomoxetine in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) as evaluated by physicians and parents in a community setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate and atomoxetine are available for the treatment of ADHD in children.&#xD;
      Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the&#xD;
      presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monamines into the extraneuronal space.&#xD;
      The mechanism by which atomoxetine produces its therapeutic effect is thought to be related&#xD;
      to selective inhibition of the presynaptic norephinephrine transporter. This was a&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, open-labeled, parallel design study of extended-release&#xD;
      methylphenidate and atomoxetine in children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD as evaluated by&#xD;
      physicians and parents. Children were randomly assigned (2:1, respectively) to 3 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with extended-release methylphenidate or atomoxetine. Physicians evaluated&#xD;
      treatment using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) and the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression-Improvement of Illness scale (CGI-I). Assessments were made prior to beginning&#xD;
      treatment (screening), at a telephone interview 1 week after beginning treatment, at a clinic&#xD;
      visit 2 weeks after beginning treatment, and at the final clinic visit (3 weeks). Parents&#xD;
      assessed treatment using the Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) from treatment days 2 to&#xD;
      13 and at the clinical visit 3 weeks after beginning treatment. The questions of interest&#xD;
      included whether there is a difference between treatment in the improvement of behavior and&#xD;
      the timing of such differences. Vital signs, height, and weight were also recorded as were&#xD;
      adverse events. Study drug was to be taken orally once each day. Patients randomly assigned&#xD;
      to extended-release methylphenidate began treatment with 18 mg/day. Patients randomly&#xD;
      assigned to atomoxetine began treatment with 0.5 mg/kg/day. The study medication was to be&#xD;
      titrated as considered appropriate by the patient's physician. The duration of treatment was&#xD;
      21 days.&#xD;
