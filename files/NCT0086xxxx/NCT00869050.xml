      This phase II study is designed to assess whether treatment with capecitabine/temozolomide&#xD;
      (CAP/TEM) is safe and effective in treating subjects with progressive, differentiated,&#xD;
      metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The primary objective of the study is to determine&#xD;
      the radiologic response rate to this regimen in progressive, metastatic, differentiated&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cancers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a classification that has evolved over time to include a group&#xD;
      of related tumors which all originate from neuroendocrine cells. This group includes&#xD;
      carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs), catecholamine-secreting tumors (e.g.&#xD;
      pheochromocytomas), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and small cell lung cancer. Carcinoid&#xD;
      tumors are mostly derived from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, occuring most&#xD;
      frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (67.5%) and the bronchopulmonary system (25.3%).&#xD;
      Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) arise from the several types of pancreatic islet cells,&#xD;
      which manifest as insulinomas, somatostatinomas or glucagonomas. NETs are broadly classified&#xD;
      as functional or nonfunctional, as determined by whether plasma hormone elevation and&#xD;
      endocrine symptoms occur. NETs are classified into two groups: 1) rapidly growing anaplastic&#xD;
      small cell cancers such as small cell lung cancer and small cell carcinomas of the GI tract&#xD;
      and 2) slow growing, more differentiated NETs such as carcinoid and PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, an estimated 12,000 - 15,000 cases of NETs (not counting small cell carcinomas) are&#xD;
      diagnosed in the United States annually. The incidence of carcinoid tumors alone is estimated&#xD;
      to be 2 per 100,000 in the United States (5,400 cases/yr/U.S.). PETs are less common, with&#xD;
      about 1,000 new cases per year in the United States. Carcinoids and PETs are potentially&#xD;
      curable by surgical resection; the 5-year survival rates in patients with localized carcinoid&#xD;
      is 78.2%. However, these tumors are frequently indolent in their growth and patients often&#xD;
      present with unresectable or metastatic disease (80% of all cases). The hormonal symptoms&#xD;
      that may accompany their disease, as exemplified by carcinoid syndrome, complicate the&#xD;
      management of these patients. Hormonal therapy, namely octreotide, is used to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms and has been reported to have a response rate of 1-5% by itself. Metastatic disease&#xD;
      is associated with significantly worse prognosis; carcinoid patients with visceral metastases&#xD;
      have a 5-year survival rate of 38.5%. Based on the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin&#xD;
      and etoposide in treating small cell lung cancer, these agents have been explored in the&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic islet cell tumors and carcinoids. In general, etoposide-cisplatin&#xD;
      regimens have poor response rates for the slow growing, differentiated NET group with an&#xD;
      average response rate of 7-10%. Furthermore, these cisplatin-etoposide regimens have been&#xD;
      associated with significant toxicities, including frequent severe neutropenia, ototoxicity,&#xD;
      neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial of patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      unresectable progressive pancreatic islet cell tumors, including poorly and&#xD;
      well-differentiated PETs, showed that a regimen of streptozocin and doxorubicin had a&#xD;
      significantly superior objective response rate compared to a combination of streptozocin and&#xD;
      fluorouracil (69 versus 45%, p=0.05). The study used a definition for objective response that&#xD;
      included regression of the tumor mass, regression of malignant tumor causing hepatomegaly or&#xD;
      a reduction in excessive hormone production. Streptozocin-doxorubicin was also significantly&#xD;
      superior to streptozocin-fluorouracil in terms of median time to tumor progression and of&#xD;
      median overall survival (2.2 versus 1.4 years, p=0.004). However, significant toxicity was&#xD;
      associated with either streptozocin-based regimen with roughly 80% in either arm experiencing&#xD;
      vomiting that lasted throughout the 5-day course of streptozocin per cycle. Additionally,&#xD;
      Grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 25% of patients who received streptozocin-fluorouracil, with&#xD;
      one treatment-related death secondary to leukopenia complicated by sepsis. Notably,&#xD;
      streptozocin has significant renal toxicity causing significant proteinuria. Thus, the&#xD;
      doubtful efficacy of streptozocin-based combinations and the significant associated toxicity&#xD;
      has limited the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of differentiated NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lab, the investigators have found that capecitabine (5-DFUR), an oral pro-drug for&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and temozolomide were synergistic for induction of apoptosis in 2&#xD;
      human NET cell lines. The mechanism and pathways involved are under investigation, but it was&#xD;
      found to be important for the synergism that temozolomide be exposed to the NET cell lines&#xD;
      during the end of the capecitabine exposure. The team believes that the combination of&#xD;
      temozolomide and capecitabine will prove to be an effective regimen. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the DNA damage induced by capecitabine by incorporation of 5-FdUTP into DNA and reducing&#xD;
      thymidine pools by inhibition of thymidylate synthase via 5-FdUMP will synergistically&#xD;
      potentiate the effect of temozolomide as an alkylator by reducing the repair activity of&#xD;
      O6-alkylguanyl-alkyl-transferase (O6-AGAT). O6-AGAT is a DNA repair enzyme which removes&#xD;
      temozolomide-alkylated groups from guanine. A 5-day regimen of temozolomide is vital to&#xD;
      decreasing O6-AGAT levels by direct binding which leads to a suicide inactivation of&#xD;
      O6-AGAT-mediated DNA repair. This saturates O6-AGAT after 23 days of temozolomide, thus&#xD;
      allowing the last 23 days of dosing to induce alkylation of DNA and thereby induce apoptosis.&#xD;
      The investigators found that cells with prior 5-FU exposure were more sensitive to the&#xD;
      induction of apoptosis by temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another fundamental rationale and hypothesis which the investigators have developed into the&#xD;
      synthesis of a novel regimen for NET is based upon cytokinetics and p53. NET are&#xD;
      characteristically very slow growing, yet fatal, cancers with the great majority of them&#xD;
      having wild type p53. Therefore, their drug resistance is probably not based upon mutational&#xD;
      p53 causes because of the wild type p53 status but rather upon their slow cytokinetics. The&#xD;
      best way to kill slow growing tumors with a long interval in G0 phase is with lipophilic&#xD;
      alkylators (i.e. Temodar) and utilizing continuous exposure to antimetabolites such as Xeloda&#xD;
      or continuous infusion 5-FU. Xeloda's half-life is 11 hrs so q 12 hr dosing is roughly&#xD;
      equivalent to continuous infusion. The investigators believe that the hypothesis is correct&#xD;
      and well grounded in pharmacologic and cell cycle principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have to date pilot experience of ten patients who received capecitabine,&#xD;
      total of 1500 mg/m2/day/PO, for fourteen days, with temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 given on the&#xD;
      last five days of their course of capecitabine. All of our initial 10 patients with&#xD;
      progressive, differentiated NET have had dramatic symptomatic pain relief and at least 75%&#xD;
      reduction in their tumor markers. Five patients had metastatic carcinoid and 5 had metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic NET. All patients had progressive liver metastases, all 10 patients had failed&#xD;
      octreotide therapy with long acting somatostatin, and 7/10 had failed prior chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens. One carcinoid patient had a complete response (CR) proven by surgery and is now&#xD;
      without any tumor recurrence 22 months out from surgery and chemotherapy. Three patients had&#xD;
      a partial response (PR) and one patient had a minor response (MR) in their liver metastases.&#xD;
      Two other patients experienced stable disease (SD) for 6 and 8 months while on therapy. The&#xD;
      overall response rate proven by CT or MRI scans (CR, PR and MR) is 50% to date. Overall,&#xD;
      clinical benefit of this lab based regimen occurred in 7/10 patients (CR, PR, MR and SD).&#xD;
      Toxicities have all been minor with none over grade 2 myelosuppression. There were no&#xD;
      hospitalizations or complications or side effects except grade 12 nausea during temozolomide&#xD;
      therapy. Therefore, the study seeks to evaluate the role of these two drugs in this disease.&#xD;
