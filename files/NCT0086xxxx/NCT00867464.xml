      This research trial studies extended follow up of young women in Costa Rica who received&#xD;
      vaccine therapy for human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and unvaccinated controls.&#xD;
      Collecting information from young women in Costa Rica who have received vaccine therapy for&#xD;
      human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and a new group of unvaccinated controls enrolled for&#xD;
      the follow-up period, may help doctors learn more about the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccine.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 10-year global impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 vaccination of&#xD;
      young adult women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate determinants of the immune response to HPV and the vaccine, and markers of&#xD;
      long-term protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the natural history of HPV and cervical disease in vaccinated and&#xD;
      unvaccinated populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo long term follow-up comprising risk factor questionnaire, pelvic&#xD;
      examination for all sexually experienced women, and specimen collection at years 6, 8, and&#xD;
      10.&#xD;

    <description>For efficiency, a nested case-control approach is envisioned to evaluate this question. We propose to compare women who become infected against a subset of those who do not (non-failures) with respect to immune response markers of interest.</description>

    <description>The 10-year cumulative rate of incident CIN2+ associated with HPV types other than HPV-16/18 and closely related HPV types in the alpha-7/9 species for which evidence of vaccine cross-protection is demonstrated will be compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated women.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who participated in the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) and lived in the&#xD;
             Guanacaste province and a few areas of Puntarenas closest to Guanacaste will be&#xD;
             eligible for the long-term follow up LTFU study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who received the HPV-16/18 vaccine at the start of CVT will be invited for up to&#xD;
             6 years of additional follow-up, and women who were originally in the control arm of&#xD;
             CVT and were offered the HPV-16/18 vaccine at crossover will be invited for an&#xD;
             additional 2 years of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subset of the control arm women who are in the crossover immunogenicity subcohort&#xD;
             will be followed the full 6 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Some women who received HPV vaccination and were not invited into the LTFU protocol&#xD;
             (stopped attending their screening visits during CVT, discontinued their study&#xD;
             participation during CVT or lived outside the study area) will be invited to&#xD;
             participate in the LTFU protocol, particularly those who received an incomplete&#xD;
             vaccination schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  UNVACCINATED CONTROL GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Born in or between July 1978 and November 1987&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residents of Guanacaste Province and a few areas of Puntarenas closest to Guanacaste&#xD;
             at some point during 2005&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak/understand Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Apparently mentally competent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any important medical condition or other criteria that the investigator considers that&#xD;
             precludes enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination with Gardasil or Cervarix will be an exclusionary criterion, but few women&#xD;
             are expected to have received these vaccines at the time of enrollment; use of these&#xD;
             vaccines after enrollment is not a criterion for study interruption but we plan to&#xD;
             collect information on vaccination history so that the few women who report having&#xD;
             been vaccinated with one of the HPV vaccines after enrollment can be evaluated&#xD;
             separately at analysis&#xD;
