    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the extent to which two different reward systems&#xD;
      implemented in the context of a multi-family pediatric weight management group differentially&#xD;
      promote adoption of healthy eating and activity habits among overweight and obese 8-17 year&#xD;
      old youth. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two reward conditions: rewards&#xD;
      for attendance only or rewards for attendance and goal attainment. We hypothesize that all&#xD;
      participants will demonstrate significant increases in healthy nutritional choices and&#xD;
      physical activity and significant reductions in sedentary activity from pre-intervention to&#xD;
      post intervention. We expect that participants in attendance plus goal attainment reward&#xD;
      condition will demonstrate significantly greater improvements than participants in the&#xD;
      attendance only condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric overweight and obesity are significant public health concerns, and group based&#xD;
      interventions incorporating behavioral, nutrition, and activity disciplines have showed&#xD;
      modest success in improving youth health and weight status. The role of financial rewards in&#xD;
      encouraging attendance at weight management sessions and acquisition of healthy eating and&#xD;
      activity habits is not well understood in the context of pediatric weight management,&#xD;
      however. Behavior theory suggests that positive reinforcement can increase the frequency of&#xD;
      desirable behaviors. As such, the primary goal of the study is to evaluate the role of&#xD;
      different reinforcement systems in increasing healthy nutritional choices, increasing&#xD;
      physical activity, and decreasing sedentary activity among youth participating in a&#xD;
      multifamily group based pediatric overweight/obesity intervention program. An additional aim&#xD;
      of the study is to evaluate the role of different levels of rewards in decreasing BMI among&#xD;
      youth participating in a multifamily group based pediatric overweight/obesity intervention&#xD;
      program. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two different reward conditions:&#xD;
      Condition A (rewards for attendance only) and Condition A+G (rewards for attendance and goal&#xD;
      attainment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 participants will be recruited to participate. Eligibility criteria include patient&#xD;
      age 8-17 years, patient with public insurance managed by Children's Community Health Network,&#xD;
      English speaking patient and parent, and patient body mass index at or above the 85th&#xD;
      percentile for age and sex. Exclusion criteria include: significant patient developmental or&#xD;
      cognitive delay, or concurrent involvement in another formal weight management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre and post intervention assessments of anthropometric, psychosocial, nutritional, and&#xD;
      physical fitness variables will be conducted, and participants will complete 8 weekly&#xD;
      multi-family group-based weight management intervention sessions involving psychology,&#xD;
      physical therapy, and dietitian disciplines. Following this intensive phase, families will&#xD;
      follow up on a quarterly basis for one year. Families will receive financial rewards for&#xD;
      attending program sessions (Conditions A and A+G) and for completing behavioral monitoring&#xD;
      assignments (Condition A+G).&#xD;
