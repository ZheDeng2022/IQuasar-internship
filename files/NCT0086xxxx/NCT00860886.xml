      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of breast cancer is very low in Mongolia (6.6/100,000), especially in rural&#xD;
           areas. Over the past 15 years, there has been considerable economic growth in Mongolia,&#xD;
           resulting in migration to urban centers such as the capital, Ulaanbaatar, from areas&#xD;
           with nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles. This recent migration offers an opportunity to&#xD;
           study the endocrine profiles of premenopausal women as they acculturate to a more&#xD;
           Western lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain new data on premenopausal endocrine and growth factor concentrations to assess&#xD;
           possible variations by migration status within Ulaanbaatar; that is, to compare women&#xD;
           who have been living in Ulaanbaatar for the longest period of time with those who have&#xD;
           recently moved to Ulaanbaatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare data from Mongolia with data from the United States (and possibly China),&#xD;
           where women are at higher risk of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample of 375 premenopausal women will be drawn from a larger sample of mothers whose&#xD;
           children are participating in a study conducted by Harvard Medical School. Only mothers&#xD;
           of girls will be included in this cross-sectional study. Women ages 25 44 years who are&#xD;
           not pregnant or breastfeeding are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 30 ml (three 10 ml samples) of whole blood will be collected. Women will be&#xD;
           asked to provide a spot urine sample. These samples will be sent periodically to the NCI&#xD;
           biorespository during the course of the study for testing. A portion of a sample for&#xD;
           each participant will be kept in Ulaanbaatar in case of problems in delivery to the&#xD;
           United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following hormones will be evaluated: testosterone, androstenedione,&#xD;
           dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-sulfate, estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone,&#xD;
           prolactin, placental lactogen, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, VEGF, soluble endoglin, and possibly&#xD;
           other angiogenic proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socioeconomic status and medical and lifestyle information will be assessed by&#xD;
           questionnaire, including ethnicity, occupation, education, and migration status (e.g.,&#xD;
           whether she moved from a rural area and time since migration). Breast cancer risk&#xD;
           factors such as age at first pregnancy, age at first menstruation, gravidity (total&#xD;
           number of pregnancies), parity (total number of childbirths), smoking status, alcohol&#xD;
           use, and dietary intake will also be determined. (These questionnaires will have been&#xD;
           pilot tested and revised before the start of this study.) The Global Physical Activity&#xD;
           Questionnaire, developed by the World Health Organization, will assess physical&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean and median premenopausal hormone concentrations of previously collected blood&#xD;
           samples from women in the United States who are at high breast cancer risk will be&#xD;
           compared with the Mongolian samples. In addition, Chinese data will be compared if&#xD;
           available.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are striking differences in breast cancer incidence rates between Asian and North&#xD;
      American and Western European populations, but within Asia variation is also wide. Incidence&#xD;
      in Mongolia is one of the lowest in the world (6.6/100,000) while China, its neighbor to the&#xD;
      south, has about three times this rate (18.7/100,000). Furthermore, rates appear higher in&#xD;
      urban than in rural areas in Mongolia. Over the last decade and a half Mongolia has&#xD;
      experienced profound economic changes resulting in mass migration from a nomadic or&#xD;
      semi-nomadic existence to a more western lifestyle in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, and&#xD;
      some back migration to rural areas. Together with the contrast in exposures between&#xD;
      traditional and urban settings, migration presents the opportunity to study women as they&#xD;
      acculturate to a more western lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose collecting blood and urine samples from premenopausal Mongolian women living in&#xD;
      UlaanBaatar, the capital of Mongolia, to describe concentrations of several steroid hormones&#xD;
      and growth factors that play a role in breast cancer development. The purpose of the study is&#xD;
      to assess whether endocrine profile differs by degree of Western acculturation among those&#xD;
      who have recently migrated to the capital. Subjects will be recruited among mothers of girls&#xD;
      participating in a study of milk consumption and hormonal status presently being conducted by&#xD;
      our colleagues at Harvard Medical School. In addition to the blood draw and urine collection,&#xD;
      participants will have their height and weight measured and will complete a questionnaire on&#xD;
      reproductive and medical history, migration status and lifestyle factors. Premenopausal blood&#xD;
      samples with accompanying information on medical history and lifestyle factors from women&#xD;
      participating in Project Viva in Boston, Massachusetts will provide a comparison group of US&#xD;
      women at high breast cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, Asian countries have been treated as one entity and the substantial variation in&#xD;
      breast cancer incidence among the countries that make up this large geographic area has not&#xD;
      been addressed. This variation among Asian countries may provide further opportunity for&#xD;
      hypothesis generating as we seek to determine what factors explain differences in breast&#xD;
      cancer rates between populations. Studies of a range of biological parameters in&#xD;
      premenopausal women among different racial/ethnic populations with varying breast cancer&#xD;
      incidence would be informative.&#xD;

        Participants will be drawn from a group of mothers whose children are participating in a&#xD;
        study that will be conducted by our colleagues at Harvard Medical School. The Harvard study&#xD;
        is a randomized trial among 750 3rd grade children (aged 9-11) to determine the impact of&#xD;
        various types of vitamin D fortified and unfortified milk and vitamin D supplements on&#xD;
        levels of 25(OHD), growth hormone, and IGF-1. Children in this study will be recruited at&#xD;
        eleven primary schools in Ulaanbaatar. The trial will run from January through March 2009&#xD;
        and will include 375 girls; we estimate that their mothers will be roughly 30-45 years of&#xD;
        age, and few will be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We plan to recruit participants for our study at the time of the baseline blood draw in&#xD;
        their daughters. Women ages 25-44 are eligible who are not pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
