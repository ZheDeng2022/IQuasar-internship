      Non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts 85% of all lung cancer.The development of brain&#xD;
      metastasis diminished life expectancy to less than one year with a median survival of less&#xD;
      than three months. In NSCLC cancer, approximately 50% of patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      disease develop brain metastasis at some time during the natural of disease. The central&#xD;
      nervous system constitutes the first site of recurrence in 15 to 40% of these patients.&#xD;
      Microarrays evaluate the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer.There are no&#xD;
      studies that specifically evaluate the relationship between a genetic profile of NSCLC and&#xD;
      metastasis to the CNS, with the purpose of distinguishing a subgroup of patients that will&#xD;
      benefit of prophylactic treatment.What is the association between a genetic profile on NSCLC&#xD;
      and the development of CNS metastasis.Obtaining a genetic profile from the primary NSCLC&#xD;
      tumor cells, by using microarrays, we can predict the development of CNS metastasis arise a&#xD;
      subgroup of patients that could benefit from prophylactic cranial radiation with which their&#xD;
      quality of life and prognosis most probably will increase.Objective:Determine the association&#xD;
      between a genetic profile from the primary tumor cells and the development of central nervous&#xD;
      system metastasis in patients with non small-cell lung cancer.A genetic profile from the&#xD;
      primary tumor cells are associated with the development of central nervous system metastasis&#xD;
      in patients with NSCLC. A clinical, prospective, analytic, open, non randomized, prognostic&#xD;
      and observational cohort with 66 patients with NSCLC who authorize a biopsy study from&#xD;
      February, 2008 to December, 2012, INMEGEN institute will be in charge of performing the&#xD;
      microarrays and the computer analysis in order to obtain the different genetic profiles that&#xD;
      will be differentially expressed related with CNS metastasis risk profiles. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up by means of the external consult of lung neoplasms. The statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be performed using tests like Student's t or Mann-Whitney's U test. A multivariate analysis&#xD;
      of logistic regression will be performed. Global survival time will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier's technique and the comparison between groups will be performed with log-rank&#xD;
      test. The adjustment for potential confusors will be performed using multivariate regression&#xD;
      analysis. For result representation, we will use tables and graphs and pertinent measures&#xD;
      will be taken to disclose the study.&#xD;

      Brain metastases occur in 30-50% of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) patients and confer a worse&#xD;
      prognosis and quality of life. A better selection of in-risk patients through a more accurate&#xD;
      biomarker could improve the benefit of prophylactic therapies. The aim of this prospective&#xD;
      study was to determine a gene-expression profile of primary tumor associated with brain&#xD;
      metastasis (BM) and to evaluate the overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced LAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction.Lung cancer is the first cause of cancer death in the world. Eighty five percent&#xD;
      of patients are diagnosed yearly with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite efforts,&#xD;
      innovations, and progress in diagnosis and treatment of these patients, overall survival (OS)&#xD;
      at 5 years of diagnosis is only 15%. The central nervous system (CNS) is a devastating and&#xD;
      frequent site of metastasis development in NSCLC. The reported incidence of CNS metastasis in&#xD;
      patients with NSCLC is 54% with an OS of &lt;1 year after diagnosis. Age, clinical stage,&#xD;
      gender, and initial treatment period are some of the reported with CNS metastasis&#xD;
      development-related factors in patients with NSCLC. We recently described that high&#xD;
      carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels (&gt;40 ng/dL) at diagnosis and adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      histological type are independently associated with higher risk if brain metastasis&#xD;
      development. However, due to their lack of specificity of all this reported factors, we are&#xD;
      required to detect biomarkers to predict brain metastasis in patients with NSCLC with the&#xD;
      objective to prevent their development.Metastasis process is complex it involves well-defined&#xD;
      molecular-printed steps, as invasion, vascular intravasation, implantation and growing at the&#xD;
      new specific organ. Higher motility, capacity for extracellular matrix degradation, immune&#xD;
      system evasion, and adhesion at the new specific organ are some of the tumoral cell&#xD;
      characteristics required to metastasize. In particular, molecular events for brain metastasis&#xD;
      development from primary NSCLC even if no at al described, are currently well understood.&#xD;
      Gene-expression microarray allow analyzing the expression changes of thousands of genes&#xD;
      simultaneously, distinguishing the altered expression of neoplastic cell genes from normal&#xD;
      tissue. Identification of biological patterns, pharmacological molecular targets, and&#xD;
      biomarkers for prognosis and evaluation for therapeutic response, and even a more specific&#xD;
      neoplasia classification are some of the results of gene-expression microarray studies in&#xD;
      hematological, breast and NSCLC cancer. Determination of tobacco-smoke transcriptional&#xD;
      changes in oncogenes and antioncogenes had been determined by the use microarray data. A&#xD;
      gene-expression profile of 20 genes differentiates health lung tissue and lung cancer with&#xD;
      higher specificity than histopathologic evaluation. Furthermore, gene-expression microarray&#xD;
      studies had been developed for predicting survival and recurrence in early NSCLC stages for&#xD;
      identification of patients who could have benefit of adjuvant therapy, with promising&#xD;
      result.The objective of this study was to identify a gene-expression profile from primary&#xD;
      lung adenocarcinoma related with brain metastasis, and to evaluate in a prospective manner&#xD;
      their prognostic significance on survival in patients with advanced disease.Experimental&#xD;
      Design These study used clinical, longitudinal, prospective, observational, and analytical&#xD;
      cohort s with the selection of a nonprobabalistic-type sample.In a prospective manner, from&#xD;
      January 2009 to June 2011, patients admitted to our Institute confirmed histologically&#xD;
      confirmed stage IIIb and IV of LAC were eligible for study inclusion. Analyzed clinical&#xD;
      variables comprised smoking history, gender, age, general condition and brain metastasis&#xD;
      development. Primary tumor core-biopsy was performed prior to any treatment and snap-frozen.&#xD;
      A single pathologist evaluated all tumors. Standard platinum-based chemotherapy was employed&#xD;
      for all patients. All patients were submitted to Magnetic resonance imaging (RM) to evidence&#xD;
      the presence or absence of brain metastasis (BM). During follow-up, we carried out Computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of the brain stem for this purpose. Preliminary statistical analysis was&#xD;
      performed utilizing the Student t, the Mann-Whitney U, the χ2, or the Fisher exact test. Once&#xD;
      the study ends, we will conduct logistic-regression multivariate analysis. Global survival&#xD;
      time will be analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier technique, and comparisons among groups will be&#xD;
      performed with the log-rank test. High Risk characteristics as gender, histology, and age&#xD;
      related with greater frequency of development of metastasis to CNS were analyzed.The study&#xD;
      was carried out according to the principles of ClinicalTrials and accepted by the INCan&#xD;
      Bioethical and Scientific Committees (reference numbers INCAN/CC/067/08). A collaboration&#xD;
      agreement was signed with the INMEGEN and was approved within the Health Research Sectorial&#xD;
      Fund (FSIS) CONACyT-México (SALUD-2009-01-115552).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection for obtaining tumor biopsies depended on the characteristics of the patient and of&#xD;
      the tumor. The biopsy could be taken by means of CT guided tru-cut needle, open thoracoscopy,&#xD;
      or bronchoscopy with optic fiber. Each tumor sample was divided into two; one sample was&#xD;
      analyzed by the INCan Pathology Service (by a sole observer blinded to the clinical&#xD;
      variables) for their histological clinical diagnosis and quantification of neoplastic&#xD;
      cellularity, and the remaining half was immediately stored at -80°C until processing for RNA&#xD;
      extraction.RNA Extraction:RNA was extracted from frozen tumor biopsies, weighted and&#xD;
      cryofractured in liquid nitrogen. Extraction and purification of total RNA from tissue (up to&#xD;
      5 mg tissue) procedure was done using RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) (cat. 217084). RNA&#xD;
      was analyzed using the Agilent 6000 Chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, C.A.). RNA&#xD;
      quality consisted on the obtention of RNA Integrity Number (RIN) &gt; 8. RNA samples were chosen&#xD;
      for microarray analysis when quality and concentration were obtained for this purpose.&#xD;
      Microarray Expression:We are using an Affymetrix platform, which consists of an in situ&#xD;
      synthesized oligonucleotide microarray. The GeneChip® that we are employing is the Human Gene&#xD;
      1.0 ST Array, which allows analyzing the expression of 28,869 different genes (each&#xD;
      transcript is represented by 26 disperse probes along its entire length, present in the human&#xD;
      genome, which covers 99% of the sequences present in the RefSeq data bank of the GenBank. The&#xD;
      Two-Cycle Target Labeling protocol is followed as suggested by the manufacturer and described&#xD;
      succinctly as follows and shown graphically in the figure at the end of this Materials and&#xD;
      Methods section: Total RNA (100 ng/uL) is retro-transcribed using T7-Oligo(dT) Promoter&#xD;
      primers in the synthesis reaction of the first complementary DNA chain (cDNA). After&#xD;
      treatment with RNAase H, the second cDNA chain is synthesized, which will serve as template&#xD;
      in the Transcription reaction in vitro (TVI). The first TVI reaction is carried out with T7&#xD;
      polymerase RNA and unmarked ribonucleotides for the amplification of complementary RNA&#xD;
      (cRNA). These cRNAs are retro-transcribed in the synthesis step of the first cDNA chain of&#xD;
      the second cycle using random primers. Subsequently, T7-Oligo(dT)-Promoter primers are&#xD;
      employed for the synthesis of the second chain of cDNA, generating the double-helix cDNA&#xD;
      template that contains the promoter T7 sequence. This cDNA is amplified and marked in a&#xD;
      second TVI reaction using the T7 polymerase DNA and a mixture of ribonucleotides/biotinylated&#xD;
      nucleotide analog. These target biotinylated cDNAs are cleaned, fragmented, and hybridized to&#xD;
      the GeneChip® expression microarrays. After hybridization, fluorescent marking was performed&#xD;
      with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin and biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody amplifier&#xD;
      system. Fluorescence is detected with a high-resolution laser scanner.Reading and Analysis of&#xD;
      Expression Microarrays:We will utilize the Expression Console of Affymetrix software to&#xD;
      evaluate the quality of the microarrays and will correct the background signal with standard&#xD;
      methods [49,50]. For signal intensity-level normalization, we will employ &quot;non-supervised&quot;&#xD;
      methods, which use the data of all of the experiment's microarrays; this will allow us to&#xD;
      render these comparable among themselves, because what a microarray assay evaluates is gene&#xD;
      expression by means of fluorescence intensities; thus, it is important to establish cut-off&#xD;
      points from which we can consider under- or overexpression. Once the data are normalized, the&#xD;
      final stage is to resume the values of all the probes that exist for each gene in the&#xD;
      microarray in a sole value, which is the gene's expression level. For detection of&#xD;
      differentially expressed genes, we will construct a linear model that includes all of the&#xD;
      experiment's microarrays simultaneously; in this manner, we will be able to analyze contrasts&#xD;
      between group A (patients with metastasis to CNS during the follow-up period) and group B&#xD;
      (patients without metastasis to CNS during the same period). As internal control, we will&#xD;
      prove the differential expression of some genes by RT-PCR in real time. Results will be&#xD;
      represented in blocks of heat maps and in tables, in which the most active genes are listed&#xD;
      along with their functional description. For risk-profile validation, we will perform&#xD;
      leave-one-out cross validation method and will postulate a second cohort for this objective.&#xD;
