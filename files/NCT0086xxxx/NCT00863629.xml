      Objectives. The investigators analysed the effects of tight glycemic control in regenerative&#xD;
      potential of the myocardium during acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. A strict glycemic control after AMI improves the cardiac outcome. The role of&#xD;
      tight glycemic control in regenerative potential of the myocardium during acute myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia are still largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Sixty-five patients with first AMI undergoing coronary bypass surgery were studied:&#xD;
      25 normoglycemic patients served as control group; hyperglycemic patients (glucose &gt;140&#xD;
      mg/dl) were randomized to intensive glycemic control (IGC, n=20; glucose goal 80-140 mg/dl)&#xD;
      or conventional glycemic control (CGC, n=20; glucose goal180-200 mg/dl) for almost 3 days&#xD;
      before surgery, using insulin infusion followed by subcutaneous insulin treatment.&#xD;
      Echocardiographic parameters were investigated at admission and after treatment period.&#xD;
      During surgery, oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine, O2- production), apoptosis (Caspase-3) and&#xD;
      cardiac stem cells (CSCs) (c-kit, MDR1 and Sca-1 positive cells) were analysed in biopsy&#xD;
      specimens taken from the peri-infarcted area.&#xD;

      The study design was structured on the basis of protocol Yale . Upon emergency wards&#xD;
      admission, hyperglycemic patients were randomly assigned to IGC or CGC. In patients with&#xD;
      STEMI the insulin infusion was started after thrombolysis. In the CGC group, continuous&#xD;
      insulin infusion of 50 IU Actrapid HM (Novo Nordisk) in 50 ml NaCl (0.9% using a Perfusor-FM&#xD;
      pump) was started only when blood glucose levels exceeded 200 mg/dl and adjusted to keep&#xD;
      blood glucose between 180 and 200 mg/dl. When blood glucose fell &lt;180 mg/dl, insulin infusion&#xD;
      was slowed down and eventually stopped. In the IGC group, insulin infusion was started when&#xD;
      blood glucose levels exceeded 140 mg/dl and adjusted to maintain glycemia at 80-140 mg/dl.&#xD;
      During insulin infusion, oral feeding was stopped and parenteral nutrition (13±5&#xD;
      Kcal/kg-1/day-1) was started. After the start of insulin infusion protocol a glycemic control&#xD;
      was provided every hour in order to obtain three consecutive values that were within the goal&#xD;
      range. Capillary glucose levels were measured by fingerstick testing. Additionally, plasma&#xD;
      glucose levels were checked every two hours in both CGC and IGT patients throughout the study&#xD;
      period. Both measurements were no statistically different . The infusion lasted until stable&#xD;
      glycemic goal (ICG group: 80-140 mg/dl; CGC group: 180-200 mg/dl) at least for 24 h. After&#xD;
      glycemic goal were maintained for 24 h, a parenteral nutrition was stopped and feeding was&#xD;
      started according to European guidelines (10). Subcutaneous insulin was initiated at the&#xD;
      cessation of the infusion. Insulin was given as short-acting insulin before meals and&#xD;
      intermediate long-acting insulin in the evening, in both group. In IGC group, the treatment&#xD;
      goal was a fasting blood glucose level of 90-140 mg/dl and a non-fasting (two hours after&#xD;
      meal) level of &lt;180 mg/dl (4). In CGC group, the treatment goal was fasting blood glucose and&#xD;
      postprandial levels of &lt;200 mg/dl. With regard to the full medical therapy, the protocol&#xD;
      stated that the use of concomitant treatment should be as uniform as possible and according&#xD;
      to evidence-based international guidelines for AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic assessment. Patients enrolled in the study underwent two-dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiography at admission before starting full medical therapy as well as after achieved&#xD;
      glycemic control goal for almost 3 days, before surgery. The study was performed using a&#xD;
      standardized protocol and phased-array echocardiographs with M-mode, two-dimensional, and&#xD;
      pulsed, continuous-wave, and color flow Doppler capabilities. The ejection fraction was&#xD;
      calculated from area measurements using the area-length method applied to the average apical&#xD;
      area. The left ventricular internal dimension and interventricular septal were measured at&#xD;
      the end diastole and end systole, and the wall motion score index was calculated according to&#xD;
      American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. Isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT) was&#xD;
      the time interval from cessation of left ventricular outflow to onset of mitral inflow, the&#xD;
      ejection time (ET) was the time interval between the onset and the cessation of left&#xD;
      ventricular outflow, and the mitral early diastolic flow deceleration time was the time&#xD;
      interval between the peak early diastolic flow velocity and the end of the early diastolic&#xD;
      flow. The total systolic time interval was measured from the cessation of one mitral flow to&#xD;
      the beginning of the following mitral inflow. Isovolumetric contracting time (ICT) was&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting ET and IRT from the total systolic time interval. The ratio of&#xD;
      velocity time intervals (vti) of mitral early (E) and late (A) diastolic flows (Evti/Avti)&#xD;
      was calculated. The myocardial performance index (MPI) was calculated as (IRT+ICT)/ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy of myocardium. All patients were undergone to CABG after maintained glucose goal for&#xD;
      almost 3 days. After induction of anaesthesia and median sternotomy, the heart of each&#xD;
      patient was examined, and 3-mm partial-thickness biopsy specimens were taken from the&#xD;
      peri-infarcted area. The infarcted zone was identified as a yellow area surrounded by a&#xD;
      purple band of granulation tissue or as gray area with fine yellow lines at its periphery.&#xD;
      The peri-infarct zone was identified as a zone immediately adjacent the zone with the&#xD;
      anatomical characteristics of myocardial infarct. Moreover, the transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiogram (TEE) was performer to evaluate peri-infarct zone All biopsies were performed&#xD;
      before CABG, during ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40% and peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturations of &gt;95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of specimens. Half of each biopsy specimen was fixed in formalin, sectioned to a&#xD;
      thickness of 5 µm, mounted on slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The mounted&#xD;
      specimens were then examined for evidence of ischemia or kept for immunohistechemistry. The&#xD;
      other half of the specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western Blotting analysis.&#xD;
