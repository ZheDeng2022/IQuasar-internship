      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy for the recovery of peripheral fat of&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir in monotherapy versus abacavir/lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir in&#xD;
      subjects who developed lipoatrophy while receiving zidovudine plus lamivudine plus abacavir.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After more than ten years since it was started, it has already been established that&#xD;
      highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has caused a dramatic reduction in the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, HAART is&#xD;
      not exempt of limitations, namely, its toxicity in the long-term; this is of special&#xD;
      importance now that treatment of HIV is chronic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most common HAART involves the use of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      (nucleoside or nucleotide analogues, NRTIs) and either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a&#xD;
      non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, there are other regimens that&#xD;
      remove some of these families, such as those based on three NRTIs, ZDV+3TC+ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAART has been associated with a constellation of major metabolic adverse events, such as fat&#xD;
      redistribution (lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy-central obesity - or both) and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoatrophy, specifically, occurs as a loss of subcutaneous fat mass in the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities, with the possible appearance of venomegaly in face and buttocks Lipoatrophy is&#xD;
      particularly distressing not only for itself, but for its stigma component, affecting the&#xD;
      quality of life and the psychological condition of the patient.This also has a direct impact&#xD;
      on treatment compliance, that is reduced, and, therefore, at risk that the therapeutic&#xD;
      regimen fails to be effective for resistances selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although initially most metabolic adverse events were attributed to PIs, in recent years it&#xD;
      has been shown that lipoatrophy specifically is related more to therapy with NRTIs than with&#xD;
      PIs; specifically, d4T, ddI and ZDV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the accepted strategies for the management of lipoatrophy in patients receiving&#xD;
      therapy with ZDV is its replacement by other NRTI such as TDF or ABC, and consequently, a&#xD;
      significant fat recovery is seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study where therapy with ZDV was discontinued and continued with NNRTIs&#xD;
      (lopinavir/ritonavir-LPV/r and nevirapine-NVP) therapy, fat recovery in the extremities&#xD;
      seemed to be higher than in patients where ZDV was replaced by ABC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lopinavir (ABT-378) is a potent protease inhibitor of HIV. The proven efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      LPV/r-based HAART has led to its inclusion since 2003 in therapeutic guidelines as therapy of&#xD;
      preferential start PI/r based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to its relationship with lipoatrophy, recent data have shown that LPV/r has a low&#xD;
      risk induction profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years data have been published on the use of LPV/r monotherapy: starting, and&#xD;
      induction-maintenance after therapy with HAART with sustained undetectability for at least 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the aforementioned data, in those patients developing lipoatrophy while treated with&#xD;
      ZDV+ABC+3TC, the approach of switching to a regimen in the absence of LPV/r-based nucleosides&#xD;
      could be even more beneficial than just removing ZDV and maintaining them on a HAART&#xD;
      containing LPV/r+ABC+3TC. Despite the fact that lipoatrophy associated with ABC/3TC is very&#xD;
      low in treatment-naive patients, it has yet to be demonstrated that discontinuing even&#xD;
      &quot;benign&quot; nucleosides could provide an additional benefit in patients that had already&#xD;
      developed lipoatrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the working hypothesis for this study would be as follows: the recovery or&#xD;
      reversion of lipoatrophy would increase in patients receiving LPV/r in monotherapy vs those&#xD;
      switching to a classic LPV/r-based HAART. The absence of any nucleoside would then be&#xD;
      beneficial for fat recovery in the extremities.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of the willingness of the patient to participate in this study after&#xD;
             being informed on all the aspects of the trial that may influence their decision,&#xD;
             signing and dating the written informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (Documented) HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving treatment with ZDV+3TC+ABC (in continuous antiretroviral treatment, without&#xD;
             discontinuation periods, for the past 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is confirmation that during the 6 months prior to inclusion in the study the&#xD;
             viral burdens were below 50 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A viral burden below 50 copies/mL no more than 30 days before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous history of virological failure while on antiretroviral treatment with&#xD;
             protease inhibitors (PIs). That is, they have never switched protease inhibitors for&#xD;
             suspected or documented virological failure. The changes in protease inhibitor due&#xD;
             solely to toxicity, simplification or optimization are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of moderate to severe lipoatrophy (according to the case definition&#xD;
             as scoring &gt;- 2. For inclusion in the study, the subject should have moderate to&#xD;
             severe lipoatrophy in at least one site, and defined by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of signs of acute disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has not been treated for an active opportunistic infection within the 30 days&#xD;
             prior to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with Karnofsky index &gt;- 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study, the patient does not require and agrees not to take any of the&#xD;
             following drugs that are contraindicated with LPV/r: astemizole, terfenadine,&#xD;
             midazolam, triazolam, cisapride, certain ergot derivatives (ergotamine,&#xD;
             dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, methylergonovine), pimozide, propafenone, and&#xD;
             flecainide. Rifampin, a potent enzyme inducer, should not be administered with the&#xD;
             study medication due to the possibility of a significant decrease in LPV/r&#xD;
             concentrations during concomitant administration, nor drugs contraindicated with 3TC&#xD;
             and ABC that in principle should not be being taken, as they are part of the treatment&#xD;
             at the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient agrees not to take any medication, including over-the-counter medicines,&#xD;
             alcohol, drugs, or herbal preparations without the knowledge and approval of the&#xD;
             principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory tests have been performed on the patients in the past 30 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  G/dL hemoglobin &gt;8.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count 750 cells/microl&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Triglycerides &lt;750 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women, a negative result of a pregnancy test is available and they agree to use&#xD;
             throughout the study a barrier contraceptive method of proven reliability in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of virological failure on treatment with PIs; that is, that&#xD;
             they have at some point switched to PIs for confirmed or documented virological&#xD;

             (glitazones or metformin), anabolic steroids, growth hormone or any agent that could&#xD;
             interfere with the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug addiction or psychiatric disease that may prevent protocol compliance. Use&#xD;
             of cannabis or being on methadone treatment are excepted, provided protocol compliance&#xD;
             is not compromised in the investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers, and women of childbearing age if they do not agree&#xD;
             to use a barrier contraceptive method throughout the study of proven reliability in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the principal investigator, the patient is unlikely to comply with&#xD;
