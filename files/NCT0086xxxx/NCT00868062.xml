  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In situations such as dehydration, illness and surgery, fluid 'drips' are given to patients&#xD;
      to keep them hydrated. Different fluids stay in the circulation for different lengths of&#xD;
      time. For example, some types of fluid remain in the circulation for a short time which means&#xD;
      patients would need to be given more fluid to achieve the desired effects. Giving a lot of&#xD;
      fluid to sick patients can in itself cause problems, for example, it can affect the way the&#xD;
      bowels work and delay the patient's recovery from illness. In these situations the&#xD;
      investigators use specialized fluids called colloids, that are designed to stay in the&#xD;
      circulation for longer. This means a smaller amount of fluid needs to be used and less&#xD;
      problems are likely to occur. There are two different types of colloids that are commonly&#xD;
      used, but the investigators do not know which of them is better. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate which of the two different colloids (one is called Gelofusin and the other is&#xD;
      called Voluven) works better in patients who undergo surgery. Knowing which of the two fluids&#xD;
      works best in patients will help us improve the care of surgical patients. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the fluid that has the larger size of molecules as part of the solution&#xD;
      will work better during surgery.&#xD;

      To study the responses of patients to 1 litre infusions of Gelofusine (succinylated gelatine&#xD;
      40g/L) and Voluven (6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% saline) over 1 h intraoperatively. In&#xD;
      particular, the extent and time course of the effects of the two infusions on haematocrit,&#xD;
      serum albumin, serum biochemistry, plasma expanding capacity and the resultant urinary&#xD;
      responses will be measured&#xD;
