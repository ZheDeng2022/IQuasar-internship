    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the safety and efficacy of broad area&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) versus vehicle PDT (VEH-PDT) in the&#xD;
      treatment of actinic keratoses (AK) and reduction of new non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) of&#xD;
      the scalp or both forearms in solid organ transplant recipient subjects receiving chronic&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, vehicle-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study of photodynamic therapy in organ transplant recipient subjects for treatment of&#xD;
      AK and the reduction of new NMSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the following two treatment groups (1:1) to receive&#xD;
      topical Levulan® Kerastick® containing 20% aminolevulinic acid HCL (ALA, active study drug)&#xD;
      or the Kerastick® containing vehicle ingredients only (VEH).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 will have ALA applied to the entire scalp OR both forearms 90 +/- 30 minutes&#xD;
           prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 will have VEH applied to the entire scalp OR both forearms 90 +/- 30 minutes&#xD;
           prior to BLUE light treatment for 16 minutes 40 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Area (scalp or both forearms) must have had at least 2 NMSC in the past 12 months,&#xD;
      and must include a continuous 25 cm2 Target Area containing a minimum of 3 AKs, to be&#xD;
      eligible for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject may receive up to nine treatments. The initial four (4) ALA-PDT/VEH-PDT&#xD;
      treatments will be given at 4-5 week intervals, with the remaining five (5) treatments given&#xD;
      every 6 +/-1 weeks. Post-treatment follow-up visit will be scheduled to occur 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the subject's final PDT.&#xD;
