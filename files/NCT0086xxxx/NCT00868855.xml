  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in USA. Contemporary cardiac care has&#xD;
      substantially reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with severe coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. However, patients with mild to moderate coronary artery stenosis (&lt;70% stenosis)&#xD;
      often present in the future with life threatening acute coronary syndrome which carries&#xD;
      significant mortality and morbidity. It is difficult to predict outcomes in these patients&#xD;
      before the events because the lack of complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome and the lack of reliable markers that will predict major adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events (MACE). Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released from endothelial&#xD;
      cells and a major factor that prevent thrombosis in the coronary artery, the cause of acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome. Endothelial dysfunction impairs t-PA release. Therefore, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that patients with impaired coronary artery t-PA release will have significantly higher risk&#xD;
      for future MACE due to intrinsic fibrinolytic dysfunction that leads to increased thrombosis&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether intrinsic endothelial fibrinolytic&#xD;
      dysfunction predicts MACE in patients with non-significant CAD. The study will measure t-PA&#xD;
      release mediated by bradykinin, a major mediator for t-PA release. This will involve infusion&#xD;
      of bradykinin into left main coronary artery of individuals who have undergone routine&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization (clinically indicated). We will take blood samples from the coronary&#xD;
      sinus and measure t-PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and activity levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) is a protein in the blood which breaks down clots and&#xD;
      plays an important role in preventing myocardial infarction. It is produced by the&#xD;
      endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels. Previous studies demonstrate that t-PA is&#xD;
      released in response to the hormones bradykinin and acetylcholine. Impaired t-PA release upon&#xD;
      bradykinin stimulation may indicate endothelial dysfunction that leads to the development of&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome. In this project, we will determine whether impaired t-PA release can&#xD;
      predict future occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. The study will involve individuals&#xD;
      getting routine left heart cardiac catheterizations (indication for cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      is solely based on clinical indication). Prior to the procedure, patient will have two blood&#xD;
      samples (5 ml each) collected from their forearm before and after 2 minutes blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff inflation on their arm. After routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization and there is no&#xD;
      severe coronary artery stenosis (&lt;70% stenosis), research protocol will be initiated. Study&#xD;
      includes infusion with increasing doses of bradykinin into their left main coronary artery,&#xD;
      and sample small amounts of blood from their coronary sinus (15 ml total).&#xD;
