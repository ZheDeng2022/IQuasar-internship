&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (calculated using the BMI Calculator on&#xD;
             the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] website available at&#xD;
             http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/index.htm, last accessed 19 Mar 07) and a weight&#xD;
             of at least 110 pounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Good health as determined by a lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health&#xD;
             assessments performed at Screening, as judged by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females were required to use a medically acceptable method of hormonal contraception&#xD;
             or abstinence throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study is&#xD;
             completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypersensitivity to nabumetone (Nabumetone) or related compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Conditions that affected the absorption, metabolism, or passage of drugs out of the&#xD;
             body (eg, sprue, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, liver, kidney, or thyroid&#xD;
             conditions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recent history (within 1 year) of mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse, or&#xD;
             alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A hematocrit value of ≤ 33.0% for females and ≤ 37.0% for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donation of &gt; 500 mL of blood in the past 8 weeks prior to study drug dosing or&#xD;
             difficulty in donating blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Receipt of an investigational drug within the 4 weeks prior to study drug dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently taking any systemic prescription medications, excluding hormone&#xD;
             contraceptives, within the 7 days prior to study dosing or over-the-counter medication&#xD;
             within 3 days of study dosing. This prohibition did not include vitamins or herbal&#xD;
             preparations taken as nutritional supplements for non-therapeutic indications, as&#xD;
             judged by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Any nonprescription medication consumption reported was to be reviewed by the&#xD;
             investigator prior to dosing. At the discretion of the investigator, these volunteers&#xD;
             could be enrolled if the medication was not anticipated to alter study integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Regular smoking of more than 5 cigarettes weekly or the regular daily use of&#xD;
             nicotinecontaining products beginning 3 months before study drug administration&#xD;
             through the final evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects who were lactating or had a positive pregnancy test at Screening and&#xD;
             prior to each of the treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Alcohol, grapefruit beverages or foods, caffeine, or xanthine beverages or foods&#xD;
             beginning 48 hours before each study drug administration through the last&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic (PK) sample of each treatment period. Such restricted items included&#xD;
             coffee, tea, iced tea, Coke®, Pepsi®, Mountain Dew®, chocolate, brownies, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Regular use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples&#xD;
             include barbiturates, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenylhydantoins, phenothiazines,&#xD;
             cimetidine, omeprazole, macrolides, imidazoles, fluoroquinolones) within 30 days prior&#xD;
             to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C antibody at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Positive test results for drugs of abuse or pregnancy at Screening and prior to each&#xD;
             study drug dosing period. Any deviation from these inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
             must have been approved by the investigator and/or the sponsor on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
             prior to enrollment of the subject. The protocol deviation waiver must have been&#xD;
