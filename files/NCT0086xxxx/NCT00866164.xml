      Intrathecal infusion pumps are increasingly used to deliver analgesics for chronic&#xD;
      intractable pain. The PUMP II trial is designed to evaluate the ongoing safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the new PrometraÂ® Programmable Pump System for intrathecal administration of morphine&#xD;
      sulfate to treat chronic intractable pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of fully implantable systems changed the dynamics and risks associated with&#xD;
      intrathecal drug delivery. Pump reservoirs could be refilled with medication more&#xD;
      infrequently (every 1-3 months), greatly reducing the risk of infection. Pumps were initially&#xD;
      driven by the pressure differential of an injected gas, pushing drug at a fixed rate from an&#xD;
      isolated chamber through an orifice of predetermined size. Later, mechanical pumps were&#xD;
      developed that allowed for programmability of different infusion rates, and complex&#xD;
      administration of infusions and preset boluses. These pumps have dominated the US market for&#xD;
      long-term intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDSs), and have expanded the range of&#xD;
      conditions and patients that can be treated successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because IDDSs characteristically deliver low flow rates of drug to the intrathecal space (&lt;1&#xD;
      mL/day), the reliability, durability, and accuracy of the pump are critical for the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of treatment. This continued access trial will assess the ongoing safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a new fully implanted IDDS, the Prometra Programmable Pump.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is suffering from cancer pain requiring strong opioids (e.g., fentanyl,&#xD;
             methadone, levorphanol, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, oxycodone) OR Patient has chronic,&#xD;
             non-malignant pain OR Patient needs an implantable pump system (pump AND catheter)&#xD;
             replaced due to malfunction or battery depletion. Patient must have documented history&#xD;
             of sufficient pain relief with intrathecal morphine sulfate infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has documented failure to respond to less invasive methods of pain control,&#xD;
             including attempts to eliminate physical and behavioral abnormalities that may cause&#xD;
             an exaggerated reaction to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has pain that is ineffectively controlled by single or multiple systemic&#xD;
             (oral, rectal, transdermal or intravenous) analgesic treatments or patient experienced&#xD;
             intolerable side effects from such treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has had a successful trial of morphine sulfate (intrathecal or epidural) for&#xD;
             relief of the target symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient agrees to obtain pain medication prescriptions only from the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient is considered by the investigator to be a medically and psychologically&#xD;
             appropriate candidate for pump implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Investigator and/or study coordinator considers the patient to be able and willing to&#xD;
             fulfill all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has existing damage to the spinal column observed via MRI of spine that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, would prevent intraspinal drug administration (e.g.&#xD;
             cord compression from metastatic tumor that could obstruct catheter placement or drug&#xD;
             flow). If the patient has a medical condition that contraindicates MRI, the&#xD;
             investigator should proceed with the closest appropriate study (i.e. CT scan, X-ray)&#xD;
             to rule out any spinal abnormalities that would prevent intraspinal drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a systemic infection that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates an implantable pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient's anatomy is not large enough to accommodate the pump's size and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding or is of child-bearing potential and not&#xD;
             employing effective birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has known allergies or sensitivities to pump system materials (e.g., silicone&#xD;
             rubber, titanium, polyphenylsulfone, acetal resin, polyvinylidene fluoride, tungsten).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has known allergies to morphine or would be contraindicated for morphine,&#xD;
             based on the drug labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has a major coexisting medical condition (such as gastrointestinal problems,&#xD;
             respiratory reserve / lung function problems, or heart conditions that cannot tolerate&#xD;
             further lowering of blood pressure) that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             contraindicates an implantable pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient will require MRI evaluation post-implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has other implanted cardiac electronic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has an occupation where he/she would be exposed to high current industrial&#xD;
             equipment, powerful magnets or transmitting towers, such as, electricians, electrical&#xD;
             engineers or MRI technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient is unable to participate in all necessary study activities due to physical or&#xD;
             mental limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient is unable or unwilling to return for all required follow-up visits.&#xD;
