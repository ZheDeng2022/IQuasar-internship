      Evaluation of tracheal pepsin as a biomarker for aspiration&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration is well recognized in children who have chronic lung disease or who are intubated.&#xD;
      There is a known association between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and aspiration. The&#xD;
      distinction between aspiration of swallowed material, such as food and the aspiration of&#xD;
      refluxed gastric contents is important. Determining whether an aspiration syndrome in an&#xD;
      individual is due to GER may be difficult. The most widely used test to determine whether GER&#xD;
      is the cause of aspiration involves staining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for lipid&#xD;
      laden macrophages (LLM) based on the hypothesis that refluxed and aspirated fluid is&#xD;
      phagocytosed by tracheal macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pepsinogen is a protein unique to gastric chief cells and also requires acidic conditions for&#xD;
      activation. Therefore the presence of pepsin in BAL fluid should only be found when gastric&#xD;
      fluid is aspirated. In previous studies, pepsin has been detected in the tracheal fluid of&#xD;
      children with chronic lung disease. Thus far, studies of this material have been small, not&#xD;
      all have control groups, and LLM were not looked for in all studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies and the need to improve diagnostic methods, the following aims are&#xD;
      proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the frequency of pepsin contamination of children without chronic&#xD;
           respiratory disease undergoing elective surgery with intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine frequency of tracheal pepsin and lipid laden macrophages (LLM) in children&#xD;
           with chronic respiratory disease or symptoms and in children with tracheostomies&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare the presence or absence and concentration of pepsin to the presence of LLM&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to relate the presence or absence and concentration of pepsin to clinical status To&#xD;
           achieve these aims, BAL fluid will be obtained from subject patients and controls. These&#xD;
           fluids will be transported to the research lab and stored on ice until analysis.&#xD;
           Determination of LLM will be done in children undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy in the&#xD;
           clinical lab of CHW per routine. BAL analysis will consist of Western blot staining for&#xD;
           the presence of pepsin. Demographic data will also be collected from the medical record.&#xD;
