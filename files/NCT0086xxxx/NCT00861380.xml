      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine (GSK1024850A), administered according to different vaccination schedules,&#xD;
      against invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae as well as vaccine impact&#xD;
      on the occurrence of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia cases, tympanostomy tube placement and&#xD;
      outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also explore vaccine impact on occurrence of respiratory tract infections&#xD;
      (RTIs), including acute otitis media (AOM) in a subset of children in Turku area.&#xD;

    <measure>Person Year Rate as Regards Subjects With Culture-confirmed IPD Due to Any of the 10 Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes. In Children Starting Vaccination Within 7 Months of Life and Assigned to a 3-dose Primary Vaccination Course</measure>
    <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the blinded invasive disease (ID) Follow-up period (The blinded ID Follow-up period lasted at least 30 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) as regards subjects with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to any of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes was tabulated (vaccine pneumococcal serotypes = serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F). PYAR was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>

        <title>Person Year Rate as Regards Subjects With Culture-confirmed IPD Due to Any of the 10 Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes. In Children Starting Vaccination Within 7 Months of Life and Assigned to a 3-dose Primary Vaccination Course</title>
        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) as regards subjects with culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to any of the pneumococcal vaccine serotypes was tabulated (vaccine pneumococcal serotypes = serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F). PYAR was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>

        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log- likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>
        <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the blinded invasive disease (ID) Follow-up period (The blinded ID Follow-up period lasted at least 30 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Infant Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with first dose of study vaccine below 7 months of age and assigned to a 2-dose primary vaccination course.</population>

        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log- likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>
        <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the blinded invasive disease (ID) Follow-up period (The blinded ID Follow-up period lasted at least 30 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Catch-up Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with a 2-dose primary vaccination between 7 and 11 months of age.</population>

        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log- likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>
        <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the blinded invasive disease (ID) Follow-up period (The blinded ID Follow-up period lasted at least 30 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Catch-up Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with a 2-dose primary vaccination between 12 and 18 months of age.</population>

        <title>Person Year Rate in the Prevention of Probable or Culture-confirmed Invasive Disease (ID)- In Children Starting Vaccination in the 12-18 Months Schedule (+ Indirect Effects on the Unvaccinated Population)</title>
        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a probable or culture confirmed ID) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata. Data were not collected regarding indirect effects.</description>
        <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the blinded invasive disease (ID) Follow-up period (The blinded ID Follow-up period lasted at least 30 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Catch-up Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with a 2-dose primary vaccination between 12 and 18 months of age.</population>

        <description>PYAR was calculated: n (= number of subjects with hospital-diagnosed pneumonia [HDP]) divided by T (= sum of follow-up (FU) period expressed in years) (per 1000) with 95% CI (2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI-classical log linear Poisson regression with strata for non-consolidated HDP and without strata for consolidated HDP). FU period considered as period between Dose 1 administration and cut-off date of 31 December 2011. CXR HDP was defined as a HDP case with the presence of abnormal pulmonary infiltrates on the CXR as per independent review panel judgement using WHO methodology. Abnormal pulmonary infiltrates could be either with (Consolidated HDP) or without (Non-consolidated HDP) alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion. New cases of HDP and CXR HDP were based on a 30-day rule, i.e. a new episode was considered if at least a 30-day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>

FU period considered as period between Dose 1 administration and cut-off date of 31 December 2011. CXR HDP was defined as a HDP case with the presence of abnormal pulmonary infiltrates on the CXR as per independent review panel judgement using WHO methodology. Abnormal pulmonary infiltrates could be either with (Consolidated HDP) or without (Non-consolidated HDP) alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion. New cases of HDP and CXR HDP were based on a 30-day rule, i.e. a new episode was considered if at least a 30-day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the Infant Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with first dose of study vaccine below 7 months of age and assigned to a 3-dose primary vaccination course.</population>

          <title>Person Year Rate in Reducing Hospital-diagnosed Pneumonia With CXR Reading According to WHO Criteria - In Children Starting Vaccination in the 12-18 Months Schedule</title>
          <description>PYAR was calculated: n (= number of subjects with hospital-diagnosed pneumonia [HDP]) divided by T (= sum of follow-up (FU) period expressed in years) (per 1000) with 95% CI (2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI-classical log linear Poisson regression with strata for non-consolidated HDP and without strata for consolidated HDP). FU period considered as period between Dose 1 administration and cut-off date of 31 December 2011. CXR HDP was defined as a HDP case with the presence of abnormal pulmonary infiltrates on the CXR as per independent review panel judgement using WHO methodology. Abnormal pulmonary infiltrates could be either with (Consolidated HDP) or without (Non-consolidated HDP) alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion. New cases of HDP and CXR HDP were based on a 30-day rule, i.e. a new episode was considered if at least a 30-day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>

        <title>Person Year Rate in Prevention of All Tympanostomy Tube Placements - In Children Starting Vaccination in the 12-18 Months Schedule (+ Indirect Effects on the Unvaccinated Population)</title>
        <description>PYAR was calculated: n (= number of subjects with tympanostomy tube placement[TTP]) divided by T (= sum of follow-up (FU) period expressed in years) (per 1000) with 95% CI (2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI-classical log linear Poisson regression with strata). FU period considered as period between Dose 1 administration and cut-off date of 31 December 2011. A TTP episode was defined as a TTP episode classified under the DCA 20 code in the Finnish National Institute of Health and Welfare (THL) and Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KELA) registers, using the Nordic Centre for Classifications in Health Care (NOMESCO) Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP), version 1.12 from January 2008, and could refer to either an unilateral or a bilateral TTP procedure. New episodes of TTP defined according to a 30-day rule meaning that a new episode was considered if at least 30-day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>

          <title>Person Year Rate in Prevention of All Antimicrobial Prescriptions- In Children Starting Vaccination Within 7 Months of Life and Assigned to a 3-dose Primary Vaccination Course</title>
          <description>PYAR was calculated: n (= number of subjects with antimicrobial prescriptions (APs)) divided by T (= sum of follow-up (FU) period expressed in years) (per 1000) with 95% CI (2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI-classical log linear Poisson regression with strata). FU period considered as period between Dose 1 administration and cut-off date of 31 December 2011. An APs episode was an episode of APs to an infant/child falling under following Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] codes: J01 (APs) and following codes for AP usually recommended for otitis media (OM) and respiratory tract infections (RTI). &quot;For OM and RTI&quot; category corresponds to following definition: APs for antibacterial usually recommended for OM and RTI (ATC codes: J01CA04, J01CR02, J01CE02, J01DC02, J01DC04, J01EE02, J01FA09 and J01FA10). New episodes of APs were analyzed according to a 2-day rule meaning new episode considered if at least 2 day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>

An APs episode was an episode of APs to an infant/child falling under following Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] codes: J01 (APs) and following codes for AP usually recommended for otitis media (OM) and respiratory tract infections (RTI). &quot;For OM and RTI&quot; category corresponds to following definition: APs for antibacterial usually recommended for OM and RTI (ATC codes: J01CA04, J01CR02, J01CE02, J01DC02, J01DC04, J01EE02, J01FA09 and J01FA10). New episodes of APs were analyzed according to a 2-day rule meaning new episode considered if at least 2 day interval elapsed from the onset of the previous episode.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the Catch-up Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated,subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with a 2-dose primary vaccination between 12 and 18 months of age.</population>

        <description>An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes described below: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.&#xD;
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious.</description>

        <description>The PYAR (Person-Year Rate) was calculated as follows n (= number of subjects reported with a culture confirmed IPD) divided by T (= sum of follow-up period expressed in years) (per 1000) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated as a 2-sided profile log-likelihood ratio 95% CI using a classical log linear Poisson regression with strata.</description>
        <time_frame>Period of follow-up was any time after the administration of first vaccine dose till the end of the long-term Follow-up period (The Follow-up period lasted at least 77 months)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis was performed on the Infant Vaccinated cohort, which included all vaccinated,subjects in the 10PN-PD-DIT-043 study and vaccinated subjects of 10PN-PD-DIT-053 study who contributed to the effectiveness analysis, with first dose of study vaccine below 7 months of age and assigned to a 2-dose primary vaccination course.</population>
