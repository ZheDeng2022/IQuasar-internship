      Primary Hypotheses of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic profiles are influenced by gestational age, chronological age, type and degree&#xD;
           of nutritional support and illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic profiles differ between neonates who receive commercial formula and neonates&#xD;
           who receive primarily human breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonates who develop parenteral associated cholestasis have metabolic markers that&#xD;
           identify at risk patients (high serum urea nitrogen, citrulline, histidine, methionine,&#xD;
           and succinyl carnitine and low thyroxine, serine and glutamate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonates that have hypothyroidism have abnormal metabolic profiles (low tyrosine levels)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common problem in the neonatal intensive care unit. Recent studies indicate&#xD;
      that prematurely born neonates commonly develop a severe nutritional deficit during the first&#xD;
      weeks after birth, referred to as extrauterine growth restriction. Despite an increase in&#xD;
      growth during the second month of hospitalization, many neonates are ultimately discharged&#xD;
      home having grown inadequately. The early nutritional deficit affects weight gain as well as&#xD;
      growth in length and head circumference. Aggressive administration of parenteral amino acids&#xD;
      to improve protein accretion rates in very preterm neonates has been supported in the&#xD;
      literature. Although tolerance of high dose amino acids has been described, researchers&#xD;
      acknowledge that sensitive tests to monitor amino acid toxicity are not readily available in&#xD;
      the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better define normal amino acid and acylcarnitine values and how they change in&#xD;
           premature neonates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect nutritional support has (human breastmilk vs. formula) on amino&#xD;
           acid and acylcarnitines profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect of illness (parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis) on amino&#xD;
           acid and acylcarnitine profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better define abnormal metabolic profiles (low tyrosine levels) in neonates that have&#xD;
           hypothyroidism.&#xD;
