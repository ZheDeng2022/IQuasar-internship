      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the immune system to function declines with aging. This is reflected by a&#xD;
      marked decrease in the responsiveness to vaccinations and to infectious agents.&#xD;
      Consequentially, there is a profound reduction in the quality of live and an increased&#xD;
      dependency on the health systems. Studies have shown that the production of B lymphocytes in&#xD;
      the bone marrow declines with aging and long-lived B cells accumulate in the periphery. Thus,&#xD;
      instead of a juvenile repertoire of B cells that is capable to recognize any new pathogen,&#xD;
      the repertoire of the elderly becomes more restricted and fails to respond to new antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that the dramatic change in the cellular&#xD;
      composition in aging reflects homeostasis pressures that are set by long-lived peripheral B&#xD;
      cells. Here, the investigators hypothesize that altering the homeostasis, by active depletion&#xD;
      of the peripheral B cells, will revive B lymphopoiesis in the BM and rejuvenate the&#xD;
      peripheral repertoire of B cells in aging. Consequentially, this will significantly improve&#xD;
      immune responsiveness of aged individuals to new antigenic challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a parallel study in human and mouse. For our clinical study we will&#xD;
      use old lymphoma patients that were treated with the B cell depleting therapy, RITUXIMAB, for&#xD;
      transient B cell depletion and established full B cell reconstitution. We will test the&#xD;
      responsiveness of these patients to hepatitis B vaccine and compare it to aged-matched&#xD;
      control group. The investigators will also use old human CD20 transgenic mice where B cell&#xD;
      depletion is imposed by anti human CD20 antibodies. In these experiments we will study&#xD;
      physiological and immunological changes to understand aging mechanisms in the B lineage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: We expect that old patients treated for B cell depletion will have an&#xD;
      increased responsiveness to the hepatitis B vaccine relative to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an efficient approach to improve immune response in the elderly&#xD;
      population. This will increase efficacy of vaccination, reduce morbidity and improve quality&#xD;
      of life. It will also reduce the cost of medical treatment. In addition, this study will show&#xD;
      that senescence in the B lineage can be reversed, which is in contrast to the general&#xD;
      concepts of aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable implications to the welfare and health of the aged population Medicine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the immune competence will increase efficacy of vaccination, reduce morbidity, and&#xD;
      reduce dependency on health systems. This will significantly improve the quality of life.&#xD;
