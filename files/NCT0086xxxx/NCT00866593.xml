    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Generic&#xD;
      Escitalopram in the treatment of Chinese patients with depression compared with Innovator&#xD;
      Escitalopram(Lexapro®) by evaluating the change of HAMD-17 total score from the baseline to&#xD;
      week 8.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, parallel assignment, randomized and innovator controlled study. The&#xD;
      subjects investigated are outpatients with major depressive disorder(MDD)according to DSM-IV&#xD;
      from the Chinese population. The screening phase lasts for 1 week. The eligible patients&#xD;
      enter the next randomized treatment phase. The fixed dose(generic escitalopram 10mg/d or&#xD;
      Innovator Escitalopram(Lexapro®) 10mg/d) duration is 2 week. After the first 2 weeks,&#xD;
      according to CGI and investigator's assessment the patients are administrated 2 different&#xD;
      dose, one is previous dose 10mg/d, the other is high dose 20mg/d. In this study, total&#xD;
      duration lasts for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of Innovator Escitalopram(Lexapro®) in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      MDD have been confirmed by multiple double blind studies. This study is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of genetic escitalopram in the treatment of Chinese patients with&#xD;
      MDD. Therefore, the double blind and innovator control(Lexapro®) design should be selected&#xD;
      for this study. The drug titration method and dose are within the range specified in the&#xD;
      instruction and patients with MDD are tolerant to the drug in practical clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of MDD patient treatment is to improve the core symptoms, prevent suicide,&#xD;
      alleviate the side reactions caused by the antidepressant, and recover the life functions of&#xD;
      patients. Generally, the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. In this study,&#xD;
      the treatment in the acute phase lasts for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rating scales used in this study are standard psychiatric rating scales with good&#xD;
      validity and are widely used in the study of antidepressants and in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with MDD. The high inter-investigator reliability and repeated measurement reliability of&#xD;
      these scales(HAMD,MADRS,HAMA) have been proved by multiple studies. The clinical global&#xD;
      impression (CGI) is a simple but convenient global impression scale. It is applicable to any&#xD;
      patients treated and studied by the psychiatric department. The VAS-PI(Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale-Pain Intensity) is used to evaluate the reduction in pain intensity,a common symptom of&#xD;
      patients with MDD. It has good reliability and validity. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)&#xD;
      was developed to assess functional impairment in three inter-related domains; work/school,&#xD;
      social and family life.&#xD;
