      The aim of the iSPOT-A study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identify brain, genetic and cognitive markers of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity&#xD;
           Disorder, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify brain, genetic and cognitive markers that predict treatment response to&#xD;
           short-acting methylphenidate in children and adolescents diagnosed with Attention&#xD;
           Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multi-center, open-label effectiveness trial to identify objective indicators of&#xD;
      treatment response in ADHD subjects (versus healthy controls) using cognitive and brain&#xD;
      function measures, brain structure and genetic measures in subjects diagnosed with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 672 naïve and treatment experienced subjects with ADHD will be enrolled from&#xD;
      approximately 10 primary care centers. These patients are to be outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, up to 672 healthy (non-ADHD) control subjects will be recruited who match the&#xD;
      enrolled ADHD subjects in race, age, gender and years of education.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have signed an informed consent or assent form where required and/or&#xD;
             whose parent or legal guardian has provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who meet DSM-IV criteria for primary diagnosis of ADHD at study entry, as&#xD;
             determined by a psychiatrist, physician or clinical psychologist in conjunction with&#xD;
             the clinical work-up undertaken by trained research assistants, as defined by The Mini&#xD;
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who score at least 6 Inattentive or Hyperactive/impulsive items &gt;1 on the&#xD;
             Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are stimulant naïve or stimulant free (defined as no stimulant medication&#xD;
             in the previous 7 days*).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are 6-17 years of age (with an emphasis to enrol at least a third of the&#xD;
             subjects who are ≥ 13 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are fluent and literate in English (and/or Dutch in The Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  coming off the stimulant medication for 7 days may place the participant at&#xD;
                  increased risk, therefore, the participant may have this washout period reduced&#xD;
                  to that defined in the drug package insert or 5 times the medication half life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known contra-indication or intolerance to the use of methylphenidate as defined in the&#xD;
             product package insert (including previous treatment failure at the highest&#xD;
             recommended dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy and females of child bearing potential who are not using a form of&#xD;
             contraception and are at risk of becoming pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known medical condition, disease or neurological disorder which might, in the opinion&#xD;
             of investigator/s, interfere with the assessments to be made in the study or put ADHD&#xD;
             patients at increased risk when exposed to optimal doses of the drug treatment. For&#xD;
             example, a diagnosis of epilepsy would exclude a patient from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of physical brain injury or blow to the head that resulted in loss of&#xD;
             consciousness for at least 10 minutes or at least 5minutes within the last two years.&#xD;
             Prior treatment with methylphenidate or any other stimulant medication in the past 7&#xD;
             days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known past or present substance dependence, including alcohol, as determined by The&#xD;
             Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in an investigational study within four months of the baseline visit in&#xD;
             which subjects have received an experimental drug/device that could affect the primary&#xD;
             end points of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any psychological or counselling therapy or CNS medication that cannot be&#xD;
             washed out prior to participation or use of any psychological or counselling therapy&#xD;
             between the baseline and week 6 (or Early Termination) visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a severe impediment to vision,&#xD;
             hearing and/or hand movement, which is likely to interfere with their ability to&#xD;
             complete the testing batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unable and/or unlikely to&#xD;
             comprehend and follow the study procedures and instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other co-morbid primary DSM IV disorder.&#xD;
