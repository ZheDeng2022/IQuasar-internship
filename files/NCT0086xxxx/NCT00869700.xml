  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the clinical significance of potential interactions between antimalarials and&#xD;
      antiretrovirals, no drug interaction studies have been published and there is an urgent need&#xD;
      to address this gap in current knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antimalarial combination&#xD;
      artemether/lumefantrine (AL) and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in HIV-infected adults.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to artemether/lumefantrine:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to the artemether, lumefantrine or to any of the excipients of&#xD;
             Coartem®.&#xD;

             female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a family history of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval or&#xD;
             sudden death or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval&#xD;
             such as patients with a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically&#xD;
             relevant bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalaemia or&#xD;

          -  Patients taking any drug which is metabolised by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6 (e.g.&#xD;
             flecainide, metoprolol, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) or CYP3A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval such as&#xD;
             antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, certain&#xD;
             antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides,&#xD;
             fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating&#xD;
             antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride.&#xD;

             hepatic or renal disease) that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the&#xD;
             participant unsuitable for the study in terms of their safety or study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer has participated in another study with any investigational product&#xD;
             within 8 weeks before the first administration of the current investigational&#xD;
