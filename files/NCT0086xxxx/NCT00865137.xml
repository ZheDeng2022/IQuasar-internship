  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the oral bioavailability of&#xD;
      tacrolimus modified release (MR4) capsules together with a standard continental breakfast.&#xD;
      The objective is to assess the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability with and without&#xD;
      food.&#xD;

      Stable kidney transplant recipients who are participating in the clinical trial FG-506-14-02&#xD;
      and who are currently being treated with FK506E (MR4) under fasted conditions and who have&#xD;
      had no changes in any of their medications for at least seven days will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      sub-study. Following enrolment, all patients will remain on all their medication and the same&#xD;
      dosing regimen throughout the study.During the study two 24 hour blood concentration time&#xD;
      profiles will be collected, each one on the last day of Period 2 and Period 3 of the&#xD;
      sub-study as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile 1 on Day 7 under fasted conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile 2 on Day 14 under non-fasted conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of five scheduled visits are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 24 patients with two complete, evaluable profiles are needed to estimate the effect&#xD;
      of food on the oral bioavailability of FK506E (MR4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling - For each sample a 2 mL aliquot of whole blood will be collected. The total&#xD;
      blood volume for the two profiles taken per patient will be approximately 40 mL.&#xD;
