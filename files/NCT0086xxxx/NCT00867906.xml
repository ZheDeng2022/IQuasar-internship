  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with&#xD;
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived&#xD;
      peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Cat-PAD in&#xD;
      controlled asthmatics treated with either inhaled salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids with a LABA and to explore the efficacy of Cat-PAD in these subjects&#xD;
      using the Late Phase Skin Response, Early Phase Skin Response, and Conjunctival Provocation&#xD;
      Test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      multiple dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cat-PAD in cat allergic&#xD;
      subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and controlled asthma. The efficacy of Cat-PAD&#xD;
      will also be explored in these subjects using the EPSR, LPSR, CPT, and levels of cat specific&#xD;
      IgE. A single centre will be initiated first, with a second centre included as a backup, if&#xD;
      needed, to enable recruitment numbers to be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts will be studied, depending on the treatment used to control the subject's&#xD;
      asthma:Cohort 1 - inhaled salbutamol only, Cohort 2 - inhaled corticosteroid only, Cohort 3 -&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroid plus a LABA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,&#xD;
      at the investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of a single visit 1 to 4&#xD;
      weeks before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomised to either 3 nmol Cat-PAD or placebo. Treatments will be administered every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (±2 days) for 14 week&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Period 3, Post Treatment Challenge consist of a single visit 24-28 weeks after the first&#xD;
      administration in the treatment period and assessments will be performed identical to those&#xD;
      at the baseline challenge. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after PTC.&#xD;

             malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment) which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the&#xD;
