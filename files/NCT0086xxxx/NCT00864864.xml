  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if sunitinib can get past the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier and into the brain tumor. Sunitinib has shown promising results in treating other&#xD;
      cancers and works by blocking blood flow to tumors, which may prevent them from growing&#xD;
      further. At the present time, there is no chemotherapy that can cure glioblastoma. The reason&#xD;
      why chemotherapy is not fully effective is that many drugs cannot penetrate into brain&#xD;
      tumors. This is due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which normally protects&#xD;
      the brain from substances in the blood.&#xD;

      -  Participants will take the study drug, sunitinib, for 7 days prior to their surgery. The&#xD;
           surgery is part of the routine care for glioblastoma and will be performed on Day 8. The&#xD;
           study drug is supplied in capsule form and is to be taken at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 7 participants will come to the clinic and have the following tests and&#xD;
           procedures performed: Neurological and physical examination; vital signs; and blood&#xD;
           samples. On day 9 (the day after the surgery) an MRI scan will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fourteen days after the participants surgery (Day 22), they will restart sunitinib&#xD;
           treatment. They will take the study drug once a day for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week&#xD;
           rest period (no study drug treatment). This 6 week period is called a cycle of study&#xD;
           treatment. Participants can continue to receive cycles of study treatment as long as&#xD;
           their disease does not progress and they do not experience any serious side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each new cycle of study treatment (once every 6 weeks) the participant will come&#xD;
           into the clinic for the following tests: Neurological and physical examination; vital&#xD;
           signs; blood sample; urine sample; MRI scan of the brain (done every even cycle).&#xD;
