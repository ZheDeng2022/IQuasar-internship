  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment protocol using IND Ribavirin-there is no control group. Hemorrhagic Fever&#xD;
      with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is caused by a virus acquired by contact with chronically infected&#xD;
      rodent hosts. HFRS is present throughout Europe and caused mainly by Puumala and Dobrava&#xD;
      viruses. Treatment consists mainly of supportive care with careful attention to control of&#xD;
      blood pressure and fluid balance and/or dialysis. Early initiation of IND Intravenous&#xD;
      Ribavirin has been shown to be an effective treatment for HFRS and may prevent the need for&#xD;
      dialysis. It is important to initiate therapy based on a diagnosis consistent with HFRS&#xD;
      (determination if the disease is caused by Puumala or Dobrava virus is helpful) and a history&#xD;
      that makes exposure likely. This study will monitor the clinical events that occur with HFRS&#xD;
      as well as the safety and efficacy of Ribavirin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label study of the safety of IV Ribavirin treatment in individuals&#xD;
      with HFRS admitted to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Germany. The study will also&#xD;
      monitor the morbidity and mortality of subjects with HFRS who are treated with IV Ribavirin.&#xD;
      The study population will include all subjects with a probable or suspected clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of HFRS and meet entry criteria with a 7 day course of IV Ribavirin and a 28-60 day&#xD;
      follow up period after the first dose of Ribavirin. In addition to treatment with Ribavirin,&#xD;
      all subjects will be given standard supportive and symptomatic care as determined by the&#xD;
      clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator, attending physicians or consultants who&#xD;
      manage the subject's care at LRMC. Up to 50 subjects could potentially be enrolled in a five&#xD;
      year time period with an expected accrual of 0-5 subjects per year. Specific&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion/relative exclusion criteria are a part of the protocol. Safety procedures&#xD;
      required during 7 days of treatment include continuous cardiac monitoring, daily lab work,&#xD;
      physical exams and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by viruses in the genus Hantavirus of&#xD;
      the family Bunyaviridae. There are four known Hantaviruses that cause HFRS: Hantaan, Seoul,&#xD;
      Puumala, and Dobrava viruses. Hantaan virus is a spherical, enveloped virus and has been&#xD;
      designated the prototype for the Hantavirus genus family Bunyaviridae (Schmaljohn, 1983).&#xD;
      Serologic, morphologic, and biochemical studies have established that this virus is related&#xD;
      to Puumala virus, Seoul virus, and other Hantaviruses (Schmaljohn, 1985). HFRS is acquired by&#xD;
      contact with chronically infected rodent hosts, most commonly from inhalation of infected&#xD;
      rodent excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) but also reported from rodent bites. In Europe,&#xD;
      HFRS is caused mainly by Puumala and Dobrava viruses, with Puumala virus responsible for most&#xD;
      cases. Puumala virus, the cause of nephropathia epidemica (NE) in Scandinavia (also France,&#xD;
      Germany, Belgium, Scotland, and Italy), is transmitted by Clethrionomys glareolus (mole)&#xD;
      [HFRS manual Niklasson]. HFRS from Puumala virus is associated with a mortality rate of&#xD;
      &lt;0.5%. Oliguria is reported in 40% of cases, and severe renal insufficiency is generally&#xD;
      observed in 3 to 9% cases [HFRS manual Lahdevirta]. However, a report from HFRS due to&#xD;
      Puumala virus in Germany was associated with severe renal disease necessitating dialysis in&#xD;
      4/15 (26% cases) [Rasche et al, 2004)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dobrava virus, the cause of a severe form of HFRS mainly in the Balkan Peninsula (Hungary,&#xD;
      Bulgaria, Albania, the former Yugoslavia, and Greece) but also in Russia in areas west of the&#xD;
      Ural Mountains, is transmitted by the rodent host Apodemus flavicollis (yellow-necked field&#xD;
      mouse), and associated with a mortality rate of 5%-35% {HFRS manual Tatjana; HFRS manual&#xD;
      Tkachenko]. Less data is available on Dobrava virus, but the morbidity and mortality is&#xD;
      expected to be similar to HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, or perhaps more severe. In one study&#xD;
      of HFRS in Greece felt to be secondary to Dobrava virus, 37% cases required dialysis and 15%&#xD;
      cases resulted in death (Antoniadis et al, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease from Dobrava virus has a similar severity and presentation as disease from Hantaan&#xD;
      virus. However, HFRS from Puumala has a lower death rate and dialysis rate and the risk of IV&#xD;
      Ribavirin in treatment for HFRS, in particular, must be measured against the benefit of&#xD;
      treatment. The decision to start IND IV Ribavirin will be based on whether the HFRS is likely&#xD;
      to be Dobrava virus versus Puumala virus based on epidemiological data of past or ongoing&#xD;
      outbreaks of HFRS in that geographical area. Observation with supportive care without the use&#xD;
      of IND IV Ribavirin is the generally recommended medical management of HFRS from Puumala&#xD;
      virus due to the lower morbidity and mortality associated with HFRS from Puumala virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most cases in HFRS in Europe will be from Puumala and Dobrava viruses, the experience&#xD;
      with IV ribavirin has been mainly with HFRS caused by Hantaan and Seoul viruses in Southeast&#xD;
      Asia. All hantaviruses have in vitro sensitivity to IV ribavirin. The data for IV ribavirin&#xD;
      for HFRS caused by hantaviruses in Europe is based on the experience with HFRS from Hantaan&#xD;
      and Seoul viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin is licensed in the United States in aerosol form for the treatment of severe lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection in children and in the oral formulation in combination with&#xD;
      recombinant interferon alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. The&#xD;
      intravenous formulation of ribavirin is not licensed in the U.S. IV Ribavirin for the&#xD;
      treatment of HFRS is used under IND 16,666.&#xD;
