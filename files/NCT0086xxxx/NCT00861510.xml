      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM),&#xD;
           and other lymphoid malignancies are all incurable lymphoid malignancies that mainly&#xD;
           affect persons in their late 60s and early 70s. Conventional chemotherapy can achieve&#xD;
           high rates of clinical response, but relapse following these responses is almost&#xD;
           universal. Patients with lymphoid malignancies relapse because their tumor cells become&#xD;
           resistant to chemotherapy; therefore, new types of drugs are needed for better treatment&#xD;
           responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigational drug ON 01910.Na has been shown to be active against MCL and CLL&#xD;
           cells, but further research is needed to determine the most safe and effective dose for&#xD;
           this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose that does not cause&#xD;
           unacceptable side effects) of ON 01910.Na in patients with cancers of the lymphoid&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects that ON 01910.Na has on cancers of the lymphoid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with cancer of the lymphoid&#xD;
           cells, and who have not been able to take or have not benefitted from existing treatment&#xD;
           options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations before the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full medical history and physical examination, and pregnancy test for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease evaluation with computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (MRI), electrocardiogram; bone marrow and lymph node biopsies; and skeletal x-rays, if&#xD;
           clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with ON 01910.Na:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different research subjects will receive increasing doses of ON 01910.Na to determine&#xD;
           which dose is considered safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To reduce the risk of one rare serious side effect of treatment for myeloid&#xD;
           malignancies, patients will take allopurinol 12 hours before and 7 days after each drug&#xD;
           infusion, one 300 mg pill each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycles 1 2: Patients will be admitted to the clinical center for 2 days at the beginning&#xD;
           of each cycle. Each cycle involves intravenous infusion of ON 01910.Na continuously for&#xD;
           a period of 48 hours, followed by 12 days of observation. Researchers will try to&#xD;
           maintain the schedule of 2 days of infusion every 14 days, but the interval between&#xD;
           doses may be extended if patients experience delayed recovery blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycles 3 4: Patients who are doing well and choose to continue may receive an additional&#xD;
           two cycles (2 days of inpatient infusion followed by 12 days of outpatient observation).&#xD;
           At the end of cycle 4, researchers will determine if the disease is responding to&#xD;
           therapy. Patients who experience side effects may continue to take ON 01910.Na at a&#xD;
           lower dose or may stop receiving the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who respond well to four cycles of ON 01910.Na may be eligible for additional&#xD;
           cycles of ON 01910.Na.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who need to start another medication to treat their disease will stop taking ON&#xD;
           01910.Na, and the researchers will perform a final study visit 2 weeks after the last&#xD;
           dose of ON 01910.Na. After that, participation in the study will be complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) and the&#xD;
      related lymphoid malignancies included in this protocol are all incurable lymphoid&#xD;
      malignancies that mainly affect persons in their late 60s and early 70s. Conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy can be effective at achieving high rates of clinical response, but relapse&#xD;
      following these responses is almost universal. Response rates in the relapsed setting are&#xD;
      inferior due to acquired resistance of the tumor cells, and new therapies with novel&#xD;
      mechanisms of action are needed. Our aim in this study is to specifically address the needs&#xD;
      of these patients for whom few effective treatments are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with lymphoid malignancies relapse due to acquired resistance of tumor cells to&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents and innovative targeted therapies which overcome these mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance are needed. One such investigational drug, ON 01910.Na, is a potent and selective&#xD;
      inhibitor of the cell cycle and leads to reduction in cyclin D1 expression. In vitro,&#xD;
      ON01910.Na shows activity against CLL and MCL cell lines with resultant cellular death. The&#xD;
      overexpression of cyclin D1 in these related lymphoid malignancies provides a rationale for&#xD;
      its use in selected patients with these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose this non-randomized, pilot, dose-escalating Phase I study of ON 01910.Na&#xD;
      in patients with MCL, CLL, MM and related lymphoid malignancies who have relapsed after or&#xD;
      are refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the toxicity profile (including the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose and recommended phase II dose) of ON 01910.Na when administered the first 2 (or amended&#xD;
      later to 3) days of a 2-week cycle in escalating doses in patients with MCL, CLL, MM and&#xD;
      related lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort was dosed at 1200mg/m2/day times 2 days. The second cohort was dosed at&#xD;
      1500mg/m2/day for 2 days. Three subjects were enrolled into the third cohort at 1800mg/m2/day&#xD;
      times 2 days. One subject completed the 1800mg/m2/ day times 2 days dosing scheme. Two&#xD;
      subjects stopped study drug after the first dose due to progressive disease. The 3 subjects&#xD;
      who received 1800mg/m2/day times 2 days will compose cohort 3. New safety data from the drug&#xD;
      manufacturer lead to Amendment L, which changed the dosing from 48 hours to 72 hours. On&#xD;
      November 18, 2010, the IRB approved Amendment L, which changed the dosing for the new cohorts&#xD;
      4 and 5 to 1800mg/day times 3 days, and 2100mg/day times 3 days, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include, the biological effects of ON 01910.Na (for example cyclin D1&#xD;
      expression) on cell-cycle pathways of cells obtained from blood, lymph nodes or bone marrow,&#xD;
      the toxicity profile of ON 01910.Na with subsequent dosing after 2 cycles of therapy, early&#xD;
      indications of biologic activity after 4 cycles of therapy, evaluation of the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ON 01910.Na at the RPTD level, and indications of biologic activity&#xD;
      during extended access (after 4 cycles (day 56)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the toxicity profile at each dose level through day 28 (cycle 2&#xD;
      day 14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the reduction in lymph nodes, quantification of circulating&#xD;
      lymphoma cells, assessment of extranodal disease sites, and/or measurement of the malignant&#xD;
      monoclonal proteins in the serum or urine after 4 cycles of therapy (day 56).&#xD;
