      This is a multi-center Phase 1 b study designed to expand the patient safety using&#xD;
      99mTc-EC-DG with SPECT/CT imaging and to expand the patient radiation dosimetry and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic database using 99mTc-EC-DG in patients who have non-incisional biopsy&#xD;
      definitive evidence of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer as compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female patients at least 18 years old with untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who&#xD;
      have non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence of disease (or cytology results from a&#xD;
      bronchoscope procedure confirming NSCLC) and who have been previously certified (per Centers&#xD;
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services requirements)by their physicians will be consented for the&#xD;
      study. The study consists of a screening visit, gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging followed&#xD;
      by the investigational agent 99mTc-EC-DG with SPECT/CT(if the PET/CT was performed as part of&#xD;
      the pre-study activities on a qualified PET camera for this study, the SPECT/CT must be done&#xD;
      within 45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedures). The study procedures can be performed&#xD;
      within 5-7 days of signing the informed consent. During the 99mTc-EC-DG SPECT/CT visit of the&#xD;
      study, pharmacokinetic (PK) blood draws and urine collection will be taken and radiation&#xD;
      dosimetry (Planar Imaging) will be performed at specified time points post 99mTc-EC-DG&#xD;
      injection. Patients will be seen 24 hours after the 99mTc-EC-DG injection for safety and&#xD;
      final PK blood and urine collection. A 21-day follow-up period (after the SPECT/CT image)&#xD;
      will allow the investigator to acquire additional imaging, surgical, pathology and treatment&#xD;
      documentation (an actual patient visit is not required at the 21 day follow-up time point).&#xD;

             diabetes can be included in the study if the standard of care protocol in place at the&#xD;
             clinical site provides for the management of the patient's glucose level sufficiently&#xD;
             to allow the PET/CT imaging to be performed. The same glucose management used for the&#xD;
             PET/CT imaging should be applied to the SPECT/CT imaging procedures. A waiver will be&#xD;
             required to be completed by the clinical site and approved by the sponsor or&#xD;
             designee);&#xD;

             Principal Investigator with appropriate documentation of the reason for the&#xD;
             exception);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to&#xD;
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the&#xD;
