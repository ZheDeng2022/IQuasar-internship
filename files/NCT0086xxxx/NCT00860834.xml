  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children with asthma must work with their child's pediatrician to ensure that&#xD;
      their child's asthma is managed well. Asthma coaches are one way to facilitate and support&#xD;
      the relationship between parents and pediatricians. This study will evaluate whether access&#xD;
      to a 12-month telephone asthma coaching program for parents is an effective way to improve&#xD;
      asthma outcomes in children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common long-term disease among children. Each year, most children with&#xD;
      asthma will have at least one asthma exacerbation, experience asthma symptoms on&#xD;
      approximately 100 days, and miss 4 days of school because of asthma. Surveys of primary care&#xD;
      physicians (PCPs) and asthma patients have indicated that asthma care is episodic, effective&#xD;
      asthma controller medications are underused, and few PCPs provide self-management education&#xD;
      or support for parents of children with asthma. Previous research showed that when an asthma&#xD;
      coach worked with parents of children from low-income, urban neighborhoods, there were&#xD;
      multiple benefits: improved self-management behaviors, reduced asthma hospitalizations, and&#xD;
      improved rates of follow-up with a PCP after an emergency department visit for asthma&#xD;
      symptoms. In this study, researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma coach&#xD;
      program in a larger, general asthma population. Trained asthma coaches will work with parents&#xD;
      of children with asthma to provide education about the goals of asthma care, and they will&#xD;
      encourage and facilitate an active partnership between the family and PCP to enhance asthma&#xD;
      care and improve self-management behaviors. Study researchers will then evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this program at improving asthma control and quality of life among children&#xD;
      with asthma. The cost effectiveness of the program will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll pediatricians and parents of children between 5 and 12 years old who&#xD;
      have persistent asthma. Pediatricians will be randomly assigned to either the asthma coach&#xD;
      program or usual care. All pediatricians will receive access to the Education in Quality&#xD;
      Improvement for Pediatric Practice (eQIPP) module for asthma care provided by the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics. They will also receive articles about effective doctor-parent&#xD;
      communication on asthma and asthma billing practices. In addition, pediatricians taking part&#xD;
      in the asthma coach program will attend two meetings to learn about asthma coaching and how&#xD;
      the program can be implemented into their practice. For 12 months, an asthma coach will work&#xD;
      directly with the parents of children who see doctors participating in the asthma coaching&#xD;
      group. Telephone calls with the asthma coach will be arranged at times convenient for the&#xD;
      parent and will occur anywhere between once a week to once a month. At Months 12 and 24,&#xD;
      about 40 parents of children in each pediatrician's practice will participate in telephone&#xD;
      interviews and their children's medical charts will be reviewed to assess asthma control,&#xD;
      asthma-related quality of life factors, and urgent care events.&#xD;
