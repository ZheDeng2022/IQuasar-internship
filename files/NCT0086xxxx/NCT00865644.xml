      The purpose of this study is to determine if imiquimod cream can reverse the growth of&#xD;
      neurofibromas. Imiquimod is a skin cream that works by stimulating the body's immune system&#xD;
      to respond to tumors. Imiquimod cream is approved for use in patients with various skin&#xD;
      lesions, including actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and external genital&#xD;
      warts. Information from these studies, as well as previous laboratory studies, suggest that&#xD;
      imiquimod cream may help shrink neurofibromas or keep them from growing.&#xD;

      -  Three of the participant's tumors will be treated with imiquimod cream and one tumor&#xD;
           (out of all the remaining tumors) will be followed without treatment (control tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given a tube of imiquimod cream and be asked to apply it to the&#xD;
           three tumors 5 times per week, for a full 6 weeks (Monday through Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be required to come to the hospital for examinations on Week 1, 2, 4&#xD;
           and 6 (+/- 3 calendar days) and after their last dose of imiquimod cream on Weeks 9, 12&#xD;
           and 18 (+/- 5 calendar days. The following tests and procedures will be performed: skin&#xD;
           test; vital signs and measurements and photographs of the tumors. Participants will be&#xD;
           asked to participate in an optional skin biopsy on Week 4 and research blood tests wil&#xD;
           lbe taken on Day 1.&#xD;

             following qualities:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the lesion must be discrete by clinical exam and must not be contact with another&#xD;
                  skin tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the lesion must be amenable to measurement with calipers with minimum dimension&#xD;
