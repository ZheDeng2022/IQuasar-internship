    <textblock>
      A Phase III trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of&#xD;
      complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacologic profile of PTK 0796 in humans suggests that it has the potential to be used&#xD;
      safely and effectively for this indication. Data from in vitro and animal studies support&#xD;
      this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PTK 0796-CSSI-0804 the safety and efficacy of PTK 0796 in the treatment of cSSSI will be&#xD;
      compared to an antibiotic approved for this indication by FDA. Initial treatment will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously with the option for subsequent oral treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Sponsor-defined clinical success is defined as at least 72 hours of study drug and antibiotics not needed/infection sufficiently resolved. If a participant received antibiotics for a different infection after the primary qualifying infection was considered cured/largely resolved as per the investigator on the Case Report Form (CRF) check box, the participant was also considered as a sponsor-defined clinical success. Sponsor-defined clinical failures must have at least 48 hours of study drug in order to be considered a failure. The sponsor classified participants as clinical failures based on the following: 1) minimum duration of treatment required for outcomes evaluation, 2) use of pre-study antibiotics, 3) use of potentially confounding systemic antibiotics during the study, and 4) timing of concomitant curative surgical procedures.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the time of informed consent to Test of Cure (10 to 17 days after end of treatment [total treatment of up to 14 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety was based mainly on the frequency of AEs, and summaries of vital signs and laboratory values (values classified as AE are captured in the AE module). An AE is defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug, whether or not the event was considered causally related to the medical product. An AE could have been a new occurrence or an existing process that increased in intensity or frequency. AEs were deemed treatment-emergent if the start date was on or after the date of the first dose but was not present before that date or if the AE started before the date of the first dose and increased in severity on or after that date.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Classified as a Sponsor-defined Clinical Success in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population at End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Sponsor-defined clinical success is defined as at least 72 hours of study drug and antibiotics not needed/infection sufficiently resolved. If a participant received antibiotics for a different infection after the primary qualifying infection was considered cured/largely resolved as per the investigator on the Case Report Form (CRF) check box, the participant was also considered as a sponsor-defined clinical success. Sponsor-defined clinical failures must have at least 48 hours of study drug in order to be considered a failure. The sponsor classified participants as clinical failures based on the following: 1) minimum duration of treatment required for outcomes evaluation, 2) use of pre-study antibiotics, 3) use of potentially confounding systemic antibiotics during the study, and 4) timing of concomitant curative surgical procedures.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>The assessment of safety was based mainly on the frequency of AEs, and summaries of vital signs and laboratory values (values classified as AE are captured in the AE module). An AE is defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug, whether or not the event was considered causally related to the medical product. An AE could have been a new occurrence or an existing process that increased in intensity or frequency. AEs were deemed treatment-emergent if the start date was on or after the date of the first dose but was not present before that date or if the AE started before the date of the first dose and increased in severity on or after that date.</description>
