    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the best dosing schedule of a combined&#xD;
      treatment of PEG IntronÂ® (pegylated Interferon-alfa 2b) plus a peptide vaccine (gp100) that&#xD;
      may help improve immune response in patients that had Stage II or Stage III melanoma and are&#xD;
      free of the disease. The safety and tolerability of this drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied. Researchers also want to collect long-term follow-up information.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b is a protein made by the human immune system that helps to fight&#xD;
      viral infections and regulate cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gp100 is a protein that is found on melanoma cells. In laboratory studies, the gp100 vaccine&#xD;
      has been shown to stimulate the immune system to &quot;recognize&quot; and kill melanoma cells that&#xD;
      have gp100 on their cell surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Immune cell response to vaccine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 3-1/2 tablespoons) will be drawn on Weeks 4, 7,10,13,16,19, and 22 for tests to&#xD;
      check the response of your immune system to the vaccine, before each injection. These tests&#xD;
      are for research purposes only and will not be used to make decisions about your medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 parts to this study, an Induction Phase and a Maintenance Phase. The Induction&#xD;
      Phase treatment is the first course of treatment used to stimulate (&quot;turn on&quot;) an immune-cell&#xD;
      response to fight cancer and to learn the body's response to the treatment. The Maintenance&#xD;
      Phase treatment is continued therapy and is used to maintain the immune-cell response and to&#xD;
      help keep the disease in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (as in the roll of dice) to 1 of 3 treatment groups. Participant will have an equal&#xD;
      chance of being assigned to one of each of the groups. Participants in each group will&#xD;
      receive the same dose levels of pegylated Interferon alfa-2b and gp100. The difference&#xD;
      between each group will be the dosing schedule of pegylated Interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every week, participant will give themselves the pegylated Interferon alfa-2b either in the&#xD;
      clinic or at home, and the gp100 will be given to participant every 3 weeks by the research&#xD;
      nurse in the clinic. Participant will be shown how to give yourself Pegylated Interferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b will be given immediately after the GP-100 Peptide Vaccine&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b at a certain dose level once a&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks (in the Induction Phase), followed by once a week for 20 weeks in the&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase (when the drug will be taken at a lower dose level than during Induction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 will take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b at a certain dose level once a&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks (in the Induction Phase), followed by once a week for 16 weeks in the&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase (when the drug will be taken at a lower dose level than during Induction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 3 will take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b at a certain dose level once a&#xD;
      week for 12 weeks (in the Induction Phase), followed by once a week for 12 weeks in the&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase (when the drug will be taken at a lower dose level than during Induction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take pegylated Interferon alfa-2b as an injection just under their skin.&#xD;
      Participant will receive gp100 as an injection just under their skin once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Week 1, PEG-Intron will be given right after GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection in the&#xD;
      clinic. Participant will be observed for at least 30 minutes after both GP-100 Peptide&#xD;
      Vaccine and PEG-Intron Injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22 (+/- 1 day, not counting institutional holidays),&#xD;
      GP-100 peptide will be given in the clinic. Participant will be observed for at least 30&#xD;
      minutes after GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection. Participant should give the PEG-Intron to&#xD;
      themselves within 24 hours of GP-100 Peptide Vaccine injection. The injection of gp100 will&#xD;
      be given in two separate areas of participant's limbs, such as in an upper arm or thigh. It&#xD;
      will be given in the same area each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will remain on this study for up to 25 weeks, unless the disease comes out of&#xD;
      remission or they experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of study treatment (approximately 3 weeks after the last injection of gp100),&#xD;
      participant will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a review of their general health and any medical problems they may&#xD;
           be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of their vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have the leukapheresis repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a CT scan of chest, stomach, and pelvis, and they will have an MRI&#xD;
           or CT scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While participant is on this study no steroids will be allowed while on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pegylated Interferon alfa-2b is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Gp100 is not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. At this time, the combination use of pegylated Interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      plus gp100 is being used for research purposes only in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
