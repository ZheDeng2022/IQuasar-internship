    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will test whether CYR-101, a CNS-active compound with novel&#xD;
      pharmacological profile and devoid of dopamine D2 receptor binding properties, is efficacious&#xD;
      when administered orally in the management of patients with a diagnosis of DSM-IV&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
