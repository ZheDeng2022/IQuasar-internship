      This study will design and test a cognitive behavioral therapy for depressed adolescents that&#xD;
      uses family interactions to help with treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent depression causes persistent feelings of sadness, loss of self-worth,&#xD;
      discouragement, and loss of interest in usual activities. Treatments for adolescent&#xD;
      depression have mixed success, with 25% to 40% of depressed adolescents still experiencing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms at the end of the most effective treatments and gains made in treatment&#xD;
      sometimes fading over time. Research suggests that family processes are associated with the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatments for adolescent depression and with reducing symptoms over time.&#xD;
      Evidence also shows that treatments developed and tested in a research setting are not easily&#xD;
      applied to community settings. This study will first design a cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      for adolescent depression that will involve the families of the depressed adolescents and&#xD;
      then test the therapy in several settings, including clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of this therapy will involve five different groups of participants. Each group&#xD;
      will include both depressed adolescents and a parent or guardian. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will partake in a focus group, in which they will break into two discussion&#xD;
      groups, one of parents and guardians and one of adolescents, that will discuss what kind of&#xD;
      help and information would be useful to them and why they would consider seeing a therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will participate in alpha testing, which will involve receiving the first&#xD;
      version of the therapy. The therapy is anticipated to include 8 to 12 weekly treatment&#xD;
      sessions, with homework assignments to practice their learned skills in everyday life.&#xD;
      Participants in alpha testing will also complete interviews and questionnaires at Week 7 and&#xD;
      at the end of treatment to assess satisfaction with treatment, treatment clarity, and&#xD;
      usefulness of the information and strategies they learned. After alpha testing, the therapy&#xD;
      will be revised based on the feedback received. The third group will participate in beta&#xD;
      testing, which will involve receiving the second version of the therapy and completing the&#xD;
      same assessments as those done by the alpha group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth group of participants will receive pilot testing of the finalized therapy. This&#xD;
      finalized version will involve 11 to 15 weekly sessions. The fifth group will receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual from a mental health clinic and serve as a control group to compare to the&#xD;
      pilot testing group. Before and after treatment, both of these groups will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires and interviews assessing the effectiveness of their treatment and&#xD;
      questionnaires and observations of family functioning. All sessions throughout the study&#xD;
      involving the newly designed family therapy will be videotaped.&#xD;
