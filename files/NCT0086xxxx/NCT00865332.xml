      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain imaging studies, genetic research, and investigations of stress have provided more&#xD;
           information about the role of dopamine in processing reward and punishment, and in&#xD;
           vulnerability to substance dependence. Researchers are interested in learning more about&#xD;
           how the brain responds to rewards, including drugs of abuse, and how these responses may&#xD;
           involve genetic factors or previous stressful events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers intend to use the drug amphetamine to increase levels of dopamine in the&#xD;
           brain and study the effects through two kinds of scanning: functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship among dopamine function, brain activity, reward processing,&#xD;
           genetic profile and exposure to stress in normal healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the variation in these factors between normal healthy adults and individuals&#xD;
           with current cocaine-dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 to 45 years of age who are either current cocaine users or healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with no history of substance abuse or dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will consist of an initial evaluation session and six study visits, four of&#xD;
           which will involve fMRI scans (3 hours each) and two of which will involve PET scans (8&#xD;
           to 9 hours each).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cocaine-using participants will enter the inpatient clinical research ward at the&#xD;
           National Institute on Drug Abuse Addiction Research Center the night before each&#xD;
           scanning session and will be discharged the following day. Healthy volunteer subjects&#xD;
           will not be required to stay overnight and will arrive as outpatients for the PET&#xD;
           session. Participants will not be released until researchers have determined that&#xD;
           participants are not experiencing significant effects of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial session (1): Participants will complete questionnaires about past reactions to&#xD;
           stressful situations, and will be trained to do thinking tasks that will be performed in&#xD;
           fMRI visits. The tasks will be practiced in a mockup of an MRI machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI sessions (2-5): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and&#xD;
           will perform thinking, short-term memory, and reward tasks during MRI scanning as&#xD;
           directed by researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET sessions (6-8): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and&#xD;
           will provide blood samples during the PET scanning sessions. Participants will have&#xD;
           short breaks during the PET scanning sessions.&#xD;

      Objective: This protocol will integrate functional brain imaging of reward processing,&#xD;
      together with assessment of the response to oral dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH), monoaminergic&#xD;
      genotyping, and evaluation of past exposure to stress, in order to examine: (1) the&#xD;
      relationship between these factors (i.e. dopamine function, brain activity, reward&#xD;
      processing, genetic profile and exposure to stress) in normal healthy adults; and (2)&#xD;
      variation in these factors between normal healthy adults and individuals with current&#xD;
      cocaine-dependence, and how this variation contributes to observed behavioral and functional&#xD;
      differences between these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study populations will consist of adult (18-45 years old) healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with no history of substance abuse or dependence and a matched group of&#xD;
      individuals with current primary cocaine-dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Method: After being medically cleared and giving informed consent,&#xD;
      each participant will undergo fMRI (four sessions, on separate days) and PET scanning (two&#xD;
      sessions, on separate days). All brain imaging sessions will take place after single-blind&#xD;
      administration of either d-AMPH (0.43 mg/kg orally) or placebo. Functional MRI will commence&#xD;
      after dosing and will include several measures (both cognitive and affective) designed to&#xD;
      activate neural circuitry involved in the processing of reward and punishment. PET scanning&#xD;
      will also take place after d-AMPH or placebo and will involve administration of the&#xD;
      radioligand [18F] Fallypride to assess CNS dopamine function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: This study is concerned with differences in the noted factors between&#xD;
      experimental cohorts (controls vs. cocaine-dependent adults) and conditions (baseline vs.&#xD;
      post d-AMPH). The primary outcome measures, used to ascertain these differences, will be: (1)&#xD;
      the percentage change in fMRI BOLD signal during performance of measures of reward processing&#xD;
      and cognitive function; (2) alterations or differences in the binding potential of&#xD;
      [18F]Fallypride; (3) variations in genes related to DArgic function between individuals and&#xD;
      groups, and the contribution of this variation to other outcome measures; and (4) history of&#xD;
      exposure to stressful events and its role in behavioral and functional outcomes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Aged between 18 - 45 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. In good health, based on history and physical examination; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Right-handed (as assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; Oldfield,&#xD;
                  1971)&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants in the cocaine group must meet DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence at&#xD;
        the time of participation. Cocaine-dependent participants must also be positive for cocaine&#xD;
        use in their urine toxicology screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential participants for either experimental group will be excluded from participation in&#xD;
        this study according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current drug use: Subjects may smoke regular cigarettes, use moderate amounts of&#xD;
             alcohol and caffeine, or smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette. Moderate alcohol use&#xD;
             is defined as for men, less than ten drinks and for women less than 7 drinks of liquor&#xD;
             (1.5 oz) or the equivalent beer (12 oz) or wine (5 oz) per week. Moderate caffeine use&#xD;
             is defined as less than 500 mg of caffeine per day, where one 5-oz serving of coffee&#xD;
             and 2 12-oz servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea each contain 100 mg. Occasional&#xD;
             marijuana use is defined as less than or equal to 2 cigarettes/month. Participants may&#xD;
             not use alcohol or marijuana for at least 24 hours prior to scanning, but will be&#xD;
             allowed to smoke regular cigarettes according to their normal usage pattern.&#xD;
             Participants who do not meet these guidelines for current drug use will not be allowed&#xD;
             to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or Past Medication Use: Volunteers may not currently use chronic (defined as&#xD;
             daily for more than 10/14 days in the last month) prescription or over the counter&#xD;
             medications that might interfere with the imaging signal (PET or MRI) or which may&#xD;
             interact adversely with any of the substances being given in this protocol. This will&#xD;
             include, but not be limited to, anti-hypertensive, anti-allergy, and pain medications.&#xD;
             In addition, the use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants or&#xD;
             antipsychotic medication, will be exclusionary. Past use of antidepressant medication&#xD;
             will be evaluated on a case by case basis; however, use of MAOI's within 14 days of&#xD;
             AMPH administration will be exclusionary due to the possibility of precipitating&#xD;
             hypertensive crisis. Over the counter or prescription medications may be used on an&#xD;
             occasional basis (for example, for the treatment of self-limited conditions, such as&#xD;
             occasional headache, musculoskeletal discomfort, allergic symptoms or pain), but&#xD;
             medications which can interact with AMPH such as Vitamin C, L-glutamine, sodium&#xD;
             bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate will be exclusionary. In addition, current use of&#xD;
             over-the-counter estrogen-like compounds will be exclusionary for female participants.&#xD;
             Subjects who have previously had significant exposure to medications that act on the&#xD;
             DA system (antipsychotics, psychostimulants) will also be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g. neoplasm,&#xD;
             subarachnoid cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g. abscess),&#xD;
             history of head trauma (defined as documented loss of consciousness &gt; 5 min or injury&#xD;
             requiring hospitalization), history of seizures as an adult, sleep apnea, or tic&#xD;
             disorder will all be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Repeated (measured on three separate&#xD;
             occasions) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, or systolic blood pressure &gt; 135 mm&#xD;
             Hg, known arrhythmia, symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of&#xD;
             endocarditis, cerebral embolism, obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, active&#xD;
             tuberculosis, known endocrine disease (derangements in adrenal, thyroid, bone or&#xD;
             reproductive function), known chronic renal or hepatic dysfunction, known HIV&#xD;
             seropositive, known current autoimmune disease involving the CNS, glaucoma, allergy to&#xD;
             amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants who are currently pregnant or nursing will not be allowed to&#xD;
             participate in this study. Female subjects will be given a serum pregnancy test a&#xD;
             maximum of 24 hours prior to each PET session and a urine pregnancy test on the day of&#xD;
             each fMRI session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which&#xD;
             he/she received a radiation exposure or has been exposed to radiation for medical or&#xD;
             other purpose , which in combination with the present study would result in a total&#xD;
             effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 5.0 rem in a year will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Children under the age of 18 will be excluded to avoid unnecessary exposure to&#xD;
             radiation to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet&#xD;
             of the MRI scanner will exclude participants from this study. This will include, but&#xD;
             not be limited to, pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurysm clips, dental braces, or&#xD;
             bullet(s). A history of working with metal with consequent possible metal fragments in&#xD;
             the body may also result in study exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Miscellaneous exclusionary criteria: Body mass greater than 300 lbs. Hematocrit &lt;&#xD;
             39.0% for males or &lt; 35.0% for females. Participants will also be excluded if veins&#xD;
             are inaccessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Claustrophobia will also serve as an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to those criteria outlined above, potential control participants will be&#xD;
        excluded if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or past psychiatric illness: DSM-IV criteria will be used (DSM-IV, APA, 1994)&#xD;
             to determine this criterion. No subject with a current axis I diagnosis will be&#xD;
             allowed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of Drug Abuse: Control volunteers reporting either current or a significant&#xD;
             history of illicit drug abuse (defined as single illicit substance use of more than 30&#xD;
             times in a lifetime for any given substance, except marijuana) will be excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive urine toxicology screen for either amphetamines or cocaine prior to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cocaine-Dependent Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates for the cocaine-dependent group will be excluded from the study if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They are actively seeking or engaged in substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They are dependent on other substances except nicotine or cocaine at the time of&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
