    <textblock>
      Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) with artemether lumefantrine (AL) is currently the&#xD;
      first line treatment policy in Tanzania. AL is an efficacious drug that also has the capacity&#xD;
      to reduce malaria transmission to mosquitoes. Nevertheless, there is concern about the&#xD;
      development of parasite resistance against AL and there have been very few clinical trials&#xD;
      that compared different ACT regimens. A recent clinical trial shows that the combination of&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) may be more efficacious than AL and may have a more&#xD;
      pronounced beneficial effect on post-treatment malaria transmission. Screening for molecular&#xD;
      markers that are related to parasite susceptibility to ACT drugs and to post-ACT treatment&#xD;
      malaria transmission can assist in preventing the development and spread of ACT resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators compared AL and DP for the treatment of uncomplicated&#xD;
      malaria. The investigators endpoints are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  post-treatment gametocytaemia by molecular techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  post-treatment malaria transmission.&#xD;

      2.1 MALARIA AND ITS TRANSMISSION TO MOSQUITOES Malaria is the most important parasitic&#xD;
      disease in the world. Approximately one fourth of the world population is at risk of&#xD;
      contracting the disease, and every year more than 2 million people, mainly young children in&#xD;
      sub-Sahara Africa, die of malaria. Malaria is caused by single-cell (protozoan) parasites of&#xD;
      the genus Plasmodium. Four species can cause human disease: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale&#xD;
      and P. malariae. The parasites are transmitted between humans by the bite of an infected&#xD;
      female mosquito (Anopheles). Inside the human body, the malaria parasites multiply rapidly in&#xD;
      the liver cells. After approximately six days, parasites leave this organ and subsequently&#xD;
      infect red blood cells (erythrocytes). A next wave of Plasmodium replication takes place in&#xD;
      the erythrocytes, then the red blood cell bursts, followed by infection of new red blood&#xD;
      cells by the parasites. Since this part of the malaria life cycle involves asexual&#xD;
      replication, parasites in this phase are referred to as asexual parasites. A small fraction&#xD;
      of these asexual parasites develop into sexual stage parasites (gametocytes). Asexual&#xD;
      parasites are responsible for malaria morbidity and mortality, while gametocytes ensure&#xD;
      transmission of the parasite from humans to mosquitoes. Malaria transmission takes place when&#xD;
      mature gametocytes are ingested by mosquitoes that are taking a blood meal. Once ingested,&#xD;
      male and female gametocytes merge to form a zygote that develops though an ookinete stage&#xD;
      into an oocyst that can be detected on the mosquito midgut within one week after feeding. The&#xD;
      oocyst will burst and sporozoites are released that migrate to the mosquito salivary glands.&#xD;
      Once the salivary glands are infected with sporozoites, the mosquito is capable of infecting&#xD;
      new human beings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 MALARIA TREATMENT WITH ARTEMISININ COMBINCATION THERAPY (ACT) Accurate diagnosis followed&#xD;
      by prompt and efficacious treatment is the backbone of any malaria control programme.&#xD;
      However, malaria treatment has been facing huge challenges in recent years. A number of&#xD;
      affordable antimalarial drugs have been used to cure malaria since the 1940s: these include&#xD;
      chloroquine (CQ), sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP; Fansidar®), mefloquine, amodiaquine (AQ)&#xD;
      and quinine. The emergence and spread of resistance to these commonly-used drugs has been&#xD;
      largely responsible for the worsening of the malaria situation observed in the past few&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across the African continent, guidelines have recently been changed. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommends for falciparum malaria the use of combination therapies,&#xD;
      preferably those containing artemisinin derivatives (ACTs - artemisinin-based combination&#xD;
      therapies). Artemisinin derivatives, e.g. artesunate, artemether and dihydroartemisinin,&#xD;
      being extremely potent antimalarial agents are the ideal partners in combinations with other&#xD;
      antimalarials. ACTs have three demonstrable advantages over conventional therapy, i) they are&#xD;
      efficacious in treating malaria patients, ii) substantially reduce post-treatment gametocyte&#xD;
      carriaga and iii) &quot;protect&quot; the partner drug from selecting resistant parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Tanzania, both CQ and SP have lost clinical efficacy. CQ was replaced by SP in 2001 and in&#xD;
      the year 2006, SP was officially replaced by Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL: Coartem®). The&#xD;
      policy change to the artemisinin-based drug AL is in line with the WHO recommendations to&#xD;
      shift to ACT as first line antimalarial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 RESISTANT PARASITES, MALARIA TRANSMISSION AND ACT Parasite resistance against SP has a&#xD;
      genetic background in mutations in the parasite dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and&#xD;
      dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these&#xD;
      genes are associated with clinical treatment failure. There is now also accumulating evidence&#xD;
      that these mutant parasite strains also have a transmission advantage compared to wildtype&#xD;
      parasites. Gametocyte carriage is higher for parasite with mutations in the dhfr and dhps&#xD;
      genes, even if parasites are successfully cleared due to a longer parasite clearance time.&#xD;
      Importantly, these mutant parasites are also more infectious to mosquitoes. These are&#xD;
      worrying findings that may explain the rapid spread of parasite resistance in the population.&#xD;
      The findings also indicate that gametocytes may be used as an early warning system to&#xD;
      indicate the development of parasite resistance: parasite strains that produce most&#xD;
      gametocytes are likely to have a reduced susceptibility to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, ACT has proved to be an efficient tool to reduce the transmission of malaria to&#xD;
      mosquitoes. Compared to monotherapy with SP, ACT reduces post-treatment gametocyte prevalence&#xD;
      and density. This translates in a reduction in post-treatment malaria transmission. Compared&#xD;
      to monotherapy, fewer individuals are infectious to mosquitoes after ACT treatment and the&#xD;
      average number of infected mosquitoes and the oocyst burden in mosquitoes is reduced.&#xD;
      Importantly, ACT does not completely prevent malaria transmission but may counteract the&#xD;
      transmission of mutant parasite strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 ACT RESISTANCE There is a genuine fear that resistance against ACTs may develop. Although&#xD;
      there is no direct evidence of full-blown clinical treatment failure of artemisinin&#xD;
      derivatives, there are some worrying findings suggesting a reduced susceptibility of parasite&#xD;
      isolates for ACTs. An increased resistance of parasite isolates to different artemisinin&#xD;
      derivatives was observed in vitro for P. falciparum field isolates from Cambodia, French&#xD;
      Guiana, and Senegal. This resistance was associated with SNPs at codon S769N of the ATPase6&#xD;
      locus of P. falciparum. In addition, the lumefantrine component of AL may exert a selective&#xD;
      pressure for parasites with a mutation in the parasite multi-drug resistance 1 gene (Pfmdr1).&#xD;
      In general, there is fear that there may be a selection for the artemisinin partner drugs.&#xD;
      Although ACTs are clearly giving hopeful results, it is not yet evident which combination of&#xD;
      drugs provides the best results, especially in the light of possible artemisinin&#xD;
      resistance18. Recently, the combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was found to&#xD;
      be superior to AL in reducing the risk of recurrent parasitaemia and post-treatment&#xD;
      gametocytaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the finding that SP resistant parasite strains exhibit a higher gametocyte&#xD;
      production under drug pressure, we hypothesize that gametocytaemia after treatment can be&#xD;
      used to screen for parasites that are most likely to have a reduced susceptibility to ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. JUSTIFICATION Studies on the development of resistance to ACT and the spread of ACT&#xD;
      resistant parasite strains in the population are extremely relevant from a public health&#xD;
      perspective. If resistance against artemether-lumefantrine or other ACTs develops, there will&#xD;
      be no alternative drug available for first-line treatment. The identification of predictive&#xD;
      markers for ACT resistance will be of great value for the protection of ACT. Studies on&#xD;
      malaria transmission after ACT are of great importance in identifying those mutations that&#xD;
      may eventually cause ACT resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study determines the efficacy of two different ACTs with a specific focus on&#xD;
      detecting markers for resistance or reduced susceptibility of parasites to ACTs and the&#xD;
      transmission potential of mutant parasites.&#xD;
