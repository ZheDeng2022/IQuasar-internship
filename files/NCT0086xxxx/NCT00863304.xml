    <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Week 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Week 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated maximum difficulty. Total score range for WOMAC physical function subscale score was 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated worse physical function.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis at Week 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>PGA of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=very good (no symptom and limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in Pain Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). LOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated maximum difficulty. Total score range for WOMAC physical function subscale score was 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated worse physical function.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated maximum difficulty. Total score range for WOMAC physical function subscale score was 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated worse physical function.</description>

        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). LOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>Patient global assessment of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=very good (no symptom and limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>Patient global assessment of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=very good (no symptom and limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). LOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
          <description>Patient global assessment of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=very good (no symptom and limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). LOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Response at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>Participants were considered as OMERACT-OARSI responder: if the improvement from baseline to week of interest was greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent and &gt;=2 units in WOMAC pain subscale or WOMAC physical function subscale score; if improvement from baseline to week of interest was &gt;=20 percent and &gt;=1 unit in at least 2 of the following: 1) WOMAC pain subscale score, 2) WOMAC physical function subscale score, 3) PGA of osteoarthritis. WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst possible pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [maximum difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and PGA of osteoarthritis (score: 1 [very good] to 5 [very poor], higher score = worse condition). Percentage of participants who were considered as OMERACT-OARSI responder were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with at least 30 percent and 50 percent reduction in WOMAC pain subscale at specified weeks were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least 30 Percent and 50 Percent Reduction From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with at least 30 percent and 50 percent reduction in WOMAC pain subscale at specified weeks were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). LOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With at Least 2 Points Improvement in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Osteoarthritis at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>PGA of osteoarthritis was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your osteoarthritis in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1=very good (no symptom and limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Improvement signifies a decrease of at least 2 points on the 5-point scale relative to baseline value. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points in PGA of osteoarthritis were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo).

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Reduction From Baseline up to Week 16 in Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 percent [%]; &gt;= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline up to Week 16 were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 percent [%]; &gt;= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline up to Week 16 were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Pain Score in the Index Hip or Knee at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their average daily pain score in the index hip/knee using a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. A weekly mean was calculated using the daily index hip/knee pain scores within each specified study week. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between each post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale Score at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip).The WOMAC stiffness subscale was a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (worst stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness. Total score range for WOMAC stiffness subscale score was 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (worst stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst possible pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [maximum difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [worst stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (maximum difficulty), where higher scores indicated worse response.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Participants answered a question: &quot;How much pain have you had when going up or down the stairs?&quot; Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when going up or down stairs by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>The SF-36 health survey is a self-administered questionnaire that measures each of the following 8 health domains: domain 1= general health, domain 2= physical function, domain 3= role physical, domain 4= bodily pain, domain 5= vitality, domain 6= social function, domain 7= role emotional, domain 8= mental health. Total score for each of the 8 domains were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher score indicated a better health related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) Physical and Mental Component Aggregate Scores at Weeks 12 and 16: Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF)</title>
        <description>The SF-36 health survey is a self-administered questionnaire that measures each of the following 8 health domains: domain 1= general health, domain 2= physical function, domain 3= role physical, domain 4= bodily pain, domain 5= vitality, domain 6= social function, domain 7= role emotional, domain 8= mental health. Total score for each of the 8 domains were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum). These 8 domains are also summarized as 2 summary scores: mental component aggregate (MCA) and physical component aggregate (PCA). Total score range for each of the 2 summary scores =0 (minimum level of functioning) to 100 (maximum level of functioning). Higher (8 domains and 2 summary) scores indicate a better health related quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, and 16</time_frame>
        <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of randomized IV study drug (either tanezumab or IV placebo). BOCF method was used to impute missing values. Here, 'number analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group, respectively.</population>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 24 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 24 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate participant for signs of peripheral neuropathy. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, where 24 items scored from 0 (normal function) to 4 (extreme abnormal function), higher score indicates higher abnormality and 13 items scored from 0 (normal function) to 2 (extreme abnormal function), higher score indicates higher abnormality. NIS possible overall score ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 122 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased impairment.</description>
