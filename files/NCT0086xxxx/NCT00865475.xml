  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years mayor progress has been made in therapeutic approaches with the introduction&#xD;
      of HAART, which has meant a huge fall in morbidity-mortality in Western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite having a variety of potent HAART combinations, some patients do not obtain&#xD;
      adequate suppression. The causes of virological failure are complex, and one of the most&#xD;
      significant factors is the incomplete compliance with the prescribed dosage of highly-active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The development of fixed dose combination products is most&#xD;
      commonly used to help simplify the dosages and improve treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main problems associated with the treatment of HIV infection is the change in body&#xD;
      structure, generally grouped under the term of lipodystrophy. These usually include fat&#xD;
      accumulation in the stomach, or abdominal girth, and, even worse, atrophy in the face, arms,&#xD;
      and legs. It is usually associated with metabolic disorders, with increased levels of&#xD;
      triglycerides, cholesterol and/or insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of lipodystrophy increases progressively over time in patients starting&#xD;
      treatment with antiretroviral agents. It is estimated that, after 2 years of treatment,&#xD;
      20%-30% of patients experience moderate or severe lipodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trizivir® is a combination of three antiretroviral agents: Abacavir, Lamivudine and&#xD;
      Zidovudine in a tablet. All of them belong to the group of nucleoside/nucleotide analogue&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main advantage of Trizivir is the possibility of simplifying antiretroviral treatment.&#xD;
      Multiple studies have been performed showing that simplification of HAART with Trizivir&#xD;
      enhances compliance and improves quality of life in patients maintaining the efficacy of&#xD;
      previous antiretroviral treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaletra® (lopinavir+ritonavir) is a combination of two protease inhibitors: lopinavir plus a&#xD;
      low dose of ritonavir, enhancing the action of the former.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that most patients treated with Kaletra monotherapy have an&#xD;
      undetectable viral load after 48 weeks. Monotherapy failures were not associated with the&#xD;
      development of primary resistance mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date the development of lipoatrophy appears to occur more frequently in patients with a&#xD;
      NRTI- containing regimen. The combination of abacavir, zidovudine and lamivudine has been&#xD;
      investigated in patients naive to antiretroviral treatments and in patients already treated&#xD;
      with NRTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this setting, we designed this clinical trial to establish the potential benefit of&#xD;
      Kaletra in monotherapy for the prevention of lipoatrophy. For this purpose, we will compare&#xD;
      keeping on treatment with TZV in patients with viral suppression vs switching to Kaletra in&#xD;
      monotherapy in order to prevent fat changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the purpose of the study is to establish the ability of Kaletra to prevent the&#xD;
      development of and exclude patients with acute intolerance to Kaletra, the patients assigned&#xD;
      to the experimental group will be treated for 4 weeks with Trizivir and Kaletra before&#xD;
      switching to Kaletra monotherapy.&#xD;
