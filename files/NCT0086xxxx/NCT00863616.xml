  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) tend to have cough, excess mucus&#xD;
      production and breathlessness as cardinal features. The excess mucus production often leads&#xD;
      to frequent infections, exacerbations and poor quality of life. Mucociliary clearance may&#xD;
      have an impact on improving symptoms, exercise tolerance, quality of life and reduce&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High frequency chest wall oscillation(HFCWO) devices use percussion to the chest wall&#xD;
      delivered from a pump through a close fitting inflatable vest. This technique has been shown&#xD;
      to enhance mucus clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis and Bronchiectasis. This pilot&#xD;
      study was designed to explore the feasibility, tolerance and effectiveness of the HFCWO in&#xD;
      patients with advanced COPD.&#xD;

      1.1 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health problem across the world and&#xD;
      its medical, societal and economic impacts continue to grow. COPD is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      obstruction of expiratory flow affecting peripheral airways, associated with chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis (mucus hypersecretion with goblet cell and submucosal gland hyperplasia) and&#xD;
      emphysema (destruction of airway parenchyma), together with fibrosis and tissue damage, and&#xD;
      inflammation of the small airways1. The beneficial effects of smoking cessation in slowing&#xD;
      the decline in lung function and the progression of disease have been clearly established.&#xD;
      Whether other factors such as mucus hypersecretion, respiratory infections and airway&#xD;
      hyper-reactivity contribute to disease progression independent of cigarette smoking is still&#xD;
      being debated2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with COPD are often distressed by mucus hypersecretion which is one of the hallmarks&#xD;
      of the disease but little is known about the impact of current therapies on mucus&#xD;
      hypersecretion due to the logistical challenges of objectively quantifying mucus in clinical&#xD;
      studies 3. Mucus hypersecretion occurs as a direct result of airway inflammation. Neutrophils&#xD;
      that die by necrosis disgorge proteases and reactive oxygen species into the lumen. It is&#xD;
      concluded that neutrophil death via necrosis leads to the high concentrations of free&#xD;
      neutrophil elastase and reactive oxygen species in the sputum of patients with airway&#xD;
      neutrophilia and mucus hypersecretion. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils), molecules&#xD;
      (neutrophil elastase and reactive oxygen species), signaling pathways (EGFR), and cellular&#xD;
      processes (neutrophil necrosis) contribute to mucus hypersecretion in COPD4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucus hypersecretion leads to increased work of breathing, reduced exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      deteriorating lung function and increases dyspnoea and cough. Often the mucus hypersecretion&#xD;
      also interferes with nocturnal sleep and has a further negative impact on health related&#xD;
      quality of life. Combined mucus hypersecretion, reduced clearance, and impairment of the lung&#xD;
      defence mechanisms explain why COPD patients even with stable condition, carry potential&#xD;
      respiratory pathogens in significant concentration, paving the way for infection and acute&#xD;
      exacerbations of COPD5;6. In the natural history of COPD chronic mucus hypersecretion is&#xD;
      thought to be linked to the accelerated decline of forced expiratory volume in one second&#xD;
      (FEV1)5 7 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mucoactive drugs (which improve the ease of mucus clearance) may be effective in&#xD;
      mucus hypersecretion, the uncertainty surrounding their effectiveness, due primarily to the&#xD;
      relative lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials and an uncertainty from&#xD;
      epidemiological studies linking mucus hypersecretion with mortality8-11, have led to their&#xD;
      poor diffusion and adoption in international guidelines 7. However, in combination with newer&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies currently in research and development phase targeting airway&#xD;
      inflammation and thus reducing mucus hypersecretion, there is a renewed interest in&#xD;
      re-evaluating mucus clearance strategies in improving HRQL, exacerbations and morbidity&#xD;
      associated with COPD 12;13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Airway clearance forms a vital part the management of patients with CF14, Bronchiectasis and&#xD;
      neuro-muscular diseases15 and has a positive impact on lung function, infection rate and&#xD;
      mortality16;17. Individually tailored chest physiotherapy18 with forced expiratory manoeuvres&#xD;
      is often considered the gold standard in airway clearance19, although self-administered&#xD;
      techniques may be equally effective20 and preferred by patients17;21. Self-administered&#xD;
      airway clearance techniques using devices which create a turbulent airflow thus encourage&#xD;
      shearing of mucus from bronchial wall, have shown promise in improving HRQL and function in&#xD;
      COPD patients22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO)23 is known to reduce respiratory rate but&#xD;
      improve ventilation in patients with COPD24 and CF25. Experimental results suggest that&#xD;
      shearing at the air-mucus interface could be a significant factor in the enhanced tracheal&#xD;
      mucus clearance during HFCWO26. Unlike in CF patients who often have greater support from&#xD;
      family members and show high levels of motivation and thus compliance in adhering to&#xD;
      self-administered airway clearance techniques, COPD patients have low motivation and poor&#xD;
      compliance. Thus self-administered techniques for mucosal clearance may be less effective in&#xD;
      clinical settings away from dedicated research programs. Thus the HCFWO may offer a more&#xD;
      passive modality of airway clearance with consequently higher compliance, if found to be&#xD;
      equally effective and well-tolerated in this group of patients. If HFCWO is shown to improve&#xD;
      HRQL, symptoms and exercise tolerance then it may have a significant role in reducing&#xD;
      exacerbations and hospital admissions as well as allowing effective management in the&#xD;
      community setting. The cost benefit of such improvements will need to be explored in larger&#xD;
      studies in the future.&#xD;
