  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of Neuragen (a natural health product&#xD;
      oil rubbed into the skin) is effective at reducing pain and improving the quality of life in&#xD;
      people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of diabetic neuropathy and development of diabetic ulcers varies based on the&#xD;
      severity (lack of blood sugar control) and duration of diabetes. Estimates of rates of&#xD;
      occurrence vary although one prospective study showed 7.2% of newly diagnosed ulcer-free&#xD;
      diabetics developed ulcers within one year of being diagnosed. Current treatment initiatives&#xD;
      aimed at educating diabetic patients on how to prevent diabetic ulcers and mange peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy have had varied success. Chronic pain is the number one reason that this&#xD;
      population seeks help from medical professionals. Diabetics are particularly predisposed to a&#xD;
      potentially disabling form of chronic pain known as peripheral neuropathy. In fact, over 50%&#xD;
      of diabetics have painful neuropathy, or will develop this condition. Other than the primary&#xD;
      goal of addressing blood sugar levels, conventional treatment of diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy involves prescription gabapentanoids or opiod analgesics, both of which have&#xD;
      considerable cost and may be associated with side effects from long-term use and overall&#xD;
      limited success rates. Neuragen is an over-the-counter natural health product that may be a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment option for this disease. Using a randomized double-blind placebo&#xD;
      control clinical trial the effects of Neuragen on pain, function and quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Established diagnosis of neuropathic pain for at least the past 3 months duration, and&#xD;
             type 1 or type 2 diabetes, confirmed by primary care physician and/or neurologist. By&#xD;
             signing the informed consent, participants agree to have the study coordinator contact&#xD;
