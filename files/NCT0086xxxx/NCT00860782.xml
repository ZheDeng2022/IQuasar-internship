      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      complications, which may affect academic achievement. This study will evaluate an educational&#xD;
      support program for parents that aims to improve academic achievement in children with SCD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCD is an inherited blood disorder that is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin-the&#xD;
      protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues. Symptoms include anemia,&#xD;
      infections, organ damage, and intense episodes of pain, which are called &quot;sickle cell&#xD;
      crises.&quot; Children with SCD are also at risk for a variety of CNS complications, including&#xD;
      various types of stroke and increased blood flow to the brain. These conditions affect&#xD;
      neuropsychological performance and academic achievement. In children with SCD, there may also&#xD;
      be a relationship between CNS complications, behavioral problems, family environment&#xD;
      stressors, and pain symptoms. For example, children with SCD-related CNS complications have a&#xD;
      higher risk of developing behavioral problems than children without SCD. In turn, behavioral&#xD;
      problems are associated with high levels of family conflict and can be a significant stressor&#xD;
      for families coping with SCD. This kind of stress can then lead to increased difficulty in&#xD;
      dealing with SCD symptoms, particularly pain, for the child. This study will evaluate an&#xD;
      educational support program for parents of children with SCD, conducted either once a year or&#xD;
      four times a year, in terms of the program's effect on children's academic achievement. In&#xD;
      addition, study researchers will also evaluate the program's effect on behavioral&#xD;
      difficulties, pain frequency, and the family environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll children with HbSS (sickle cell anemia) or HbSb-thal (hemoglobin S&#xD;
      beta thalassemia) SCD. Parents or caregivers of participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      attend the educational support program meetings either once a year or four times a year for 2&#xD;
      years. The educational meetings with the parent/caregiver will be 45 minutes long and will&#xD;
      cover the following four main areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provide education regarding the learning issues often seen with children with SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide information regarding special education services in the school system and how&#xD;
           the parent can obtain academic support for his/her child&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide information on how to assist the child to better manage homework&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the child's current level of pain and how pain may affect school attendance&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three evaluation timepoints. At baseline and Year 3, children will undergo a&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental evaluation, including academic achievement tests. The parent and child&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires on emotional and behavioral functioning, stress levels, and&#xD;
      family functioning. At Year 2, the children will complete academic achievement tests, and the&#xD;
      questionnaires for the parent and child will be repeated.&#xD;
