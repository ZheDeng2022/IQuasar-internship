  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine whether three different single doses of PXL01&#xD;
      are safe and well tolerated by healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetic properties of PXL01&#xD;
      (same doses) will also be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the local tolerability and safety of PXL01 in the&#xD;
      doses 10, 20, 40 mg, and placebo. The secondary objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties of PXL01 in single doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose administration study in male healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Each Subject will visit the centre three times; one screening visit, one dose&#xD;
      administration visit and one follow-up visit over a period of approximately 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (screening visit), the Subject will be given verbal and written patient&#xD;
      information and the informed consent will be signed. Thereafter, the Subject will be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility. Demography, concomitant medication, and medical history will be documented.&#xD;
      A physical examination will be performed and blood/urine will be collected for safety&#xD;
      analysis. Tests for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, drug screening and alcohol breath test will be&#xD;
      performed. Vital signs and a 12-lead ECG will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (dose administration visit), which will occur 7±3 days after the screening visit,&#xD;
      the Subjects will first perform an alcohol breath test and PXL01/placebo will then be&#xD;
      administered as an abdominal subcutaneous injection. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis will be drawn, pulse and blood pressure will be recorded, and local tolerability&#xD;
      assessments will be performed prior to and 15min, 30min, 45min, 60min, 1h 15min, 1h 30min,&#xD;
      2h, 4h, 8h and 24h after the injection. A 12-lead ECG and body temperature will be recorded&#xD;
      prior to dose, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h after the injection. Blood will be collected prior to&#xD;
      and 24 hours after the injection. Adverse Events (AEs) will be recorded and telemetry heart&#xD;
      rythm will be monitored continuously. The Subjects will stay at the clinic for about 26 hours&#xD;
      after the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (Follow-up visit) will be performed 5-8 days after Visit 2. A physical examination&#xD;
      and local tolerability assessments will be performed. Vital signs, a 12-lead ECG and AEs will&#xD;
      be recorded. Blood/urine will be collected for safety analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will start by dosing two Subjects. One Subject will receive placebo and the other&#xD;
      active treatment. If there are no safety/tolerability concerns within 48 hours, another three&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to dose escalation, a safety monitoring board will discuss all safety data. In case of&#xD;
      any safety/tolerability concerns, dosing may be discontinued.&#xD;

    <description>PXL01 is a synthetic peptide sequentially derived from human lactoferrin. The substance is formulated in a viscous solution of sodium hyaluronate. 10, 20, and 40 mg PXL01 will be administered as an abdominal subcutaneous injection of 0.5, 1, and 2 ml respectively.</description>
