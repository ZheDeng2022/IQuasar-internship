  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been four previous Total Therapy (TT1 through IIIB) studies for multiple myeloma&#xD;
      at the MIRT from 1989 to present. Results have shown that participants treated on these&#xD;
      studies had better outcomes (meaning they have lived longer and had better responses to&#xD;
      treatment) when compared to individuals treated with standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past studies conducted at the MIRT and at other institutions have shown that participants&#xD;
      with high-risk features by gene array studies tend to have shorter remissions (disappearance&#xD;
      of signs and symptoms of myeloma) and do not survive as long as participants with low-risk&#xD;
      myeloma. Researchers at MIRT think that one reason for this is that the myeloma cells re-grow&#xD;
      in the time when participants are not receiving treatment because they are recovering from&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy. In this study, participants will receive several chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      previously shown to be effective in myeloma, but in lower doses and in shorter cycles. It is&#xD;
      hoped that by giving the drugs in this way, myeloma cells will not have time to re-grow&#xD;
      between cycles, therefore resulting in longer remissions. This study is being done in an&#xD;
      attempt to improve the remission rate and the survival time for participants with high-risk&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

      -  To find out if giving multi-agent chemotherapy in lower and more frequent doses to make&#xD;
           the timely delivery of chemotherapy cycles possible, will result in better treatment&#xD;
           outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if changing the way the drugs are given during the transplant phase will&#xD;
           also result in fewer side effects, while still being effective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if giving treatment between transplants (called &quot;inter-transplant therapy&quot;)&#xD;
           will prevent the myeloma from re-growing between transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out if long-term maintenance therapy will result in longer remissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find out what the effects (good and bad) of this overall treatment will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn more about the biology and genetics of multiple myeloma by performing imaging&#xD;
           tests and collecting blood, bone marrow aspirate and biopsies, and biopsies of lesions&#xD;
           seen on MRI or PET scans for research&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the&#xD;
             time of registration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other serious medical illness or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere with the completion of treatment&#xD;
