    <textblock>
      In the study, homeless youth from a drop-in site and faculty from UCLA and California&#xD;
      Institute of the Arts will develop, pilot test and evaluate a youth-based drug and&#xD;
      health-promoting program. It is hoped that this program will help in the development of a&#xD;
      program that can be further tested in a larger study and lead to the development of an&#xD;
      innovative and effective drug counseling program that youth situated in homeless sites will&#xD;
      utilize.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nationwide, homeless youths are attempting to escape major life challenges, which may result&#xD;
      in problem drug and alcohol use. Such behaviors are associated with hepatitis virus&#xD;
      infections and HIV. Less than one third of homeless youth seek medical care, and less than&#xD;
      10% of drug and alcohol-using youths seek substance abuse treatment services. Based upon&#xD;
      increasing knowledge about the barriers experienced by homeless youth relating to accessing&#xD;
      treatment for substance use and health promoting services, it is clear that homeless youth&#xD;
      need to play a major role in the planning, implementation and evaluation of drug counseling&#xD;
      programs delivered at sites that homeless youth frequent. Using a community-based&#xD;
      participatory research (CBPR) approach, UCLA researchers recently engaged homeless youth and&#xD;
      community partners in qualitative research to better understand homeless youths' perspectives&#xD;
      on drug counseling and to consider innovative strategies to engage homeless youth, in&#xD;
      accessing drug use and health promotion counseling. Our community partners included homeless&#xD;
      youth from homeless youth-based organizations, and faculty from the California Institute of&#xD;
      the Arts (CalArts). An innovative youth-centered strategy considered by homeless youth was&#xD;
      the use of the arts and media to craft personal messages that capture youth interest and&#xD;
      appeal. In the proposed investigation, researchers, homeless youth and staff from a drop-in&#xD;
      site frequented by homeless youth, along with our CalArts partners, will participate in the&#xD;
      development, pilot testing and evaluation of a youth-centered drug-use and health-promoting&#xD;
      intervention program. In Phase I of this R21, a CBPR approach will be utilized with a&#xD;
      steering committee to develop a youth-centered drug use and health promoting intervention&#xD;
      program, LIFE MATTERS which will be assessed in terms of acceptability via focus group&#xD;
      sessions with street youth and subsequently refined based upon homeless youth feedback. In&#xD;
      Phase 2, investigators and community partners will conduct a pilot study to explore the&#xD;
      acceptability of the LIFE MATTERS program as well as test the impact of the program, compared&#xD;
      to a control group, with 80 similar youth in terms of: completion of the program; reduction&#xD;
      of risky drug and alcohol use; completion of a HAV/HBV vaccine series; and improvement in&#xD;
      knowledge about hepatitis. The short-term goals are to refine strategies that can be fully&#xD;
      tested in a large-scale intervention trial. The long-term goals are to contribute to&#xD;
      knowledge about promoting innovative and youth-designed drug-related behaviors, and treatment&#xD;
      completion in settings where youth congregate.&#xD;
