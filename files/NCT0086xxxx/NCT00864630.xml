      The investigators seek to determine whether brain imaging techniques can be used to help&#xD;
      detect depression, assess its severity, and/or monitor or predict responses to treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects with minor or major depression will be randomly assigned to a wait-list control&#xD;
      group or to treatment with a new computer-based cognitive behavior therapy developed by Dr.&#xD;
      James Cartriene. Brain imaging will be performed before and during treatment using both&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that brain activity, particularly in the lateral frontal areas of the brain, will&#xD;
      provide biomarkers for depression, depression severity, and treatment response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression can significantly disrupt one's ability to function effectively and efficiently,&#xD;
      and the associated performance deficits can seriously jeopardize space mission success. The&#xD;
      incidence of serious depression in Earth based analogues of the spaceflight environment has&#xD;
      been reported as up to 13% per person per year. Extrapolating from existing reports of&#xD;
      depressive episodes during short-duration spaceflight, depression is thus a probable&#xD;
      condition in one or more members of a five to seven person crew during a long duration&#xD;
      spaceflight (e.g., a 30 month mission to Mars). Mission success can be jeopardized by&#xD;
      depression either directly, from the potentially life threatening consequences of lapses in&#xD;
      performance, or indirectly, by adding to the workload and stress of other crewmembers. The&#xD;
      likelihood and potentially serious consequences of depression during spaceflight explains why&#xD;
      the risk of human performance failure due to mood alterations such as depression, anxiety, or&#xD;
      other psychiatric and cognitive problems is a Priority 1 risk for all mission types&#xD;
      (International Space Station, Moon, Mars). Certain countermeasures are already in place:&#xD;
      medications and psychological consultations with ground-crews. However, current in-flight&#xD;
      methods to decide whether a countermeasure should be used rely heavily on subjective&#xD;
      self-reports. The biological basis of mood disorders suggests neural biomarkers may provide a&#xD;
      more objective method for assessing depression. Aim 1 of this proposal, therefore, seeks to&#xD;
      identify neural biomarkers sensitive to, and specific for, depression. These measures will be&#xD;
      used in evaluating and validating a flight-capable, noninvasive neuroimaging technology&#xD;
      (near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging, or NIRS imaging) for its ability to detect&#xD;
      biomarkers of depression and its severity. As an initial step towards developing novel&#xD;
      select-out criteria, Aim 2 will then evaluate which neural biomarkers appear most promising&#xD;
      in detecting an endophenotype that identifies individuals at heightened risk for treatment&#xD;
      resistance. Finally, when depression is objectively identified, an appropriate countermeasure&#xD;
      needs to be selected. Aim 3 will focus on the ability of brain imaging to help predict the&#xD;
      efficacy of Dr. Cartriene's computer based problem solving therapy.&#xD;
