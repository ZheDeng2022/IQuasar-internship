  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the preventive effects of a combination of drugs:&#xD;
      polyphenon E (PPE) derived from green tea extracts, and erlotinib. Because this combination&#xD;
      of drugs has not been tested in humans before for the prevention of cancer, it is not clear&#xD;
      which dose of each agent will be optimal in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the safety of the combination of PPE and erlotinib and see what effects (good&#xD;
      and/or bad) it has on the patient's premalignant lesion, and find the highest dose of each&#xD;
      agent that can be given in combination without causing severe side effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with premalignant lesions (mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe&#xD;
             dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ) of the head and neck, as confirmed by biopsy within&#xD;
             the 4 months prior to study entry or a treated primary T1N0 or T2N0 squamous cell&#xD;

             carcinoma may have oral premalignant lesions (i.e., hyperplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ) at the time of study entry (provided their Stage I or II disease has been&#xD;
             definitively treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion sites include oral cavity (buccal mucosa, gingival, floor of mouth,&#xD;
             dorsal/ventral tongue, pharyngeal wall), oropharynx, hypopharynx,larynx (glottis,&#xD;

             in the setting of a contraindication to topical anesthesia, general anesthesia may not&#xD;
             be used as a substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General anesthesia, if indicated, is acceptable in patients whose lesions would&#xD;
             require general anesthesia for laryngoscopy and biopsy according to routine standard&#xD;
             of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood counts: total neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm³; platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm³.&#xD;

             vital capacity (FVC) at least 60% predicted value by spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of polyphenon E on the developing human fetus at the recommended dose are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because polyphenon E may be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must also have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (β-HCG) within 72 hours of receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to swallow the oral doses of erlotinib and PPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to abstain from drinking green tea or taking supplements containing&#xD;
             green tea or green tea compounds, for the duration of the investigation and for 30&#xD;
             days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Please note that patients with a treated T1N0 or T2N0 squamous carcinoma and who do&#xD;
             not have a pre-malignant measurable lesion at the time of study entry will not be&#xD;
             subjected to a biopsy but will have cytobrush samples taken as specified in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of&#xD;
             Polyphenon E in participants &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with hyperplasia, in absence of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, will be&#xD;
             excluded because there is possibly no benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with acute intercurrent illness or those who had surgery within the&#xD;
             preceding 4 weeks unless they have fully recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous malignancies unless the cancer was stage I or II and rendered free&#xD;
             of disease more than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant or breast feeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this&#xD;
             study because Polyphenon E is an investigational agent with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             Polyphenon E, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             Polyphenon E.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not practicing adequate contraception if the participants are of child bearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, severe active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the past&#xD;
             six months, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of coagulopathy such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand's disease or&#xD;
             inherited thrombophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension not adequately controlled by medication (i.e. systolic blood pressure ≥&#xD;
             150 and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 on at least two separate readings).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congestive heart failure (CHF) greater than New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) Grade II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit confusion, disorientation, or have a history of major&#xD;
             psychiatric illness which may impair their understanding of the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors within 3&#xD;
             months of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known connective tissue disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug within&#xD;
             12 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of liver disease or AST and ALT ≥ 2.5 times ULN on screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of green tea or supplements containing green tea or tea extract within 30&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to polyphenon E, tea, or any of the inactive ingredients present in the&#xD;
             active or placebo drug products, including gelatin capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which would make the subject, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             unsuitable for the study.&#xD;
