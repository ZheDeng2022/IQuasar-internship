    <textblock>
      Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a devastating kidney disease which is difficult&#xD;
      to treat and carries a poor prognosis, with 50% of affected children progressing to end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD). The purpose of this study is to investigate oral galactose as a benign&#xD;
      treatment for FSGS in children. The investigators hypothesize that galactose, a simple milk&#xD;
      sugar thought to bind to the protein factor (FSPF) that causes FSGS thereby inactivating it&#xD;
      and stopping it from damaging the kidney, resulting in a reduction in glomerular permeability&#xD;
      to albumin and decrease in proteinuria in children with nephrotic syndrome secondary to FSGS.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of 4 months of oral galactose administration on the level of FSPF&#xD;
           in children with steroid resistant FSGS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of 4 months of oral galactose administration on the first morning&#xD;
           urine protein to creatinine (urine protein: creatinine) ratio and serum albumin level in&#xD;
           children with steroid resistant FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of 4 months of oral galactose administration on dose of&#xD;
           immunosuppressive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess first morning urine protein: creatinine ratio, serum albumin level, and change in&#xD;
           immunosuppression dose at 3 months after discontinuation of oral galactose therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children is most commonly due to minimal change&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome and can be successfully treated with steroid therapy. However 10-15% of&#xD;
      children with nephrotic syndrome are diagnosed with FSGS, which is resistant to steroid&#xD;
      therapy and many other immunosuppressive drugs, and is associated with poor outcome.&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of patients with FSGS progress to ESRD within 5-10 years and in about 30%&#xD;
      of children, FSGS can recur after transplantation.(1) African-American children are at&#xD;
      significantly higher risk for FSGS.(2) Recent studies indicate that primary FSGS is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous disorder caused by genetic mutations in nearly a third of cases and as yet&#xD;
      undefined immunological defects in the remaining cases.(3) Immune mediated FSGS has been&#xD;
      associated with a circulating permeability factor, which is thought to increase glomerular&#xD;
      permeability to albumin, leading to proteinuria and contributes to sclerotic lesions in FSGS.&#xD;
      Presence of the FSPF is defined as permeability activity &gt;0.5. (4) Current therapies for FSGS&#xD;
      include plasmapheresis and many immunosuppressive agents that include cyclosporine,&#xD;
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and drugs that decrease proteinuria such as&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) with&#xD;
      inconsistent outcome. Additionally, these drugs have long-term consequences of&#xD;
      immunosuppression and some drugs such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus affect renal function&#xD;
      adversely when used for prolonged periods of time. (5) There is an urgent need for&#xD;
      investigating benign therapies such as galactose. If proven to be useful, it may present a&#xD;
      safe alternative or an adjunct to currently available therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. In 2008, Savin et al. showed that galactose, a simple nontoxic sugar, binds with high&#xD;
      affinity to the FSPF in vitro.(6) They also found that trace amounts of galactose (&gt;10-12 M)&#xD;
      inhibited glomerular permeability activity induced by FSPF in vitro. This series of in vitro&#xD;
      experiments also demonstrated that the effect of FSPF activity in serum can be reversed by&#xD;
      its incubation with galactose or alternatively by pre-incubation of glomeruli with galactose.&#xD;
      Additionally, the authors describe significantly decreased permeability activity in vivo in a&#xD;
      single patient with post-transplant FSGS in response to both IV and oral galactose. The FSPF&#xD;
      activity in this patient decreased progressively during the 4 weeks of galactose ingestion&#xD;
      (from 0.8 to 0.1), and persisted 4 weeks after discontinuation of oral galactose (0.2). The&#xD;
      proposed mechanism for this action is that FSPF have galactose-binding sites which interact&#xD;
      with galactose of the glomerular glycocalyx, activating signal transduction in podocytes.&#xD;
      Introduction of free galactose may block the FSPF binding sites or alter the tertiary&#xD;
      structure of the FSPF, thus inhibiting its activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the decrease in FSPF activity in this patient, proteinuria did not improve. The&#xD;
      authors propose the lack of clinical response may be due to the advanced stage of kidney&#xD;
      damage at the time of IV galactose therapy, and this patient was already on dialysis at the&#xD;
      time of oral galactose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be important to study the introduction of galactose early in the course of FSGS to&#xD;
      determine if it is effective in decreasing proteinuria and delaying the progression of FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De Smet et al presented their experience with a case of 48-year old male, with nephrotic&#xD;
      syndrome secondary to FSGS, treated with oral galactose at 10 gm BID for 6 months, at the&#xD;
      annual meeting of American Society of Nephrology 2008 (ASN 08, TH-PO-955). Their patient had&#xD;
      failed to respond to prednisone, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine and&#xD;
      plasma exchanges. Prior to treatment, the FSPF was detected at 0.87 and urinary protein&#xD;
      excretion was 4.3 gm/day. After treatment with galactose, the FSPF decreased to 0.09 and&#xD;
      urinary protein excretion decreased to 0.56 gm/day. The success obtained in this case argues&#xD;
      for trial in additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral galactose therapy: After obtaining informed consent and assent FSPF will be&#xD;
           obtained at a baseline to determine eligibility. Blood samples for FSPF will be&#xD;
           collected in a &quot;red-top&quot; tube (without anti-coagulant), allowed to clot, then spin and&#xD;
           separate. The serum will be shipped on ice for FSPF analysis to the laboratory of&#xD;
           Virginia Savin, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI. All other parameters&#xD;
           (including weight, height, blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein: creatinine ratio,&#xD;
           serum albumin, creatinine, electrolytes, and glucose) will be collected at the same&#xD;
           visit as part of standard of care. Female participants of child bearing age will be&#xD;
           given a urine pregnancy test and excluded from the study if pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once patients are found to be eligible, oral galactose will be initiated at a dose of&#xD;
           0.2gm/kg/dose BID to a maximum of 15 gm BID for a period of 4 months. The prescribed&#xD;
           dose of galactose powder will be dispensed to subjects in packets, mixed with 4 ounces&#xD;
           of water, and consumed orally. FSPF will be measured again at week 16. All the other&#xD;
           parameters will be repeated at 4, 10 and 16 weeks after starting oral galactose. Oral&#xD;
           galactose therapy will be stopped after 16 weeks. In order to determine the clinical&#xD;
           significance of the galactose treatment, a set of clinical parameters (weight, height,&#xD;
           blood pressure, urinalysis, first morning urine protein: creatinine ratio, serum&#xD;
           albumin, creatinine, electrolytes, and glucose) will be obtained at 12 weeks after&#xD;
           discontinuation of oral galactose. Measurement of adherence with galactose will be&#xD;
           estimated by counting the number of galactose doses returned at each subsequent monthly&#xD;
           visit. Patients will be considered adherent if they have taken &gt;90% of the prescribed&#xD;
           doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adjunct therapy of nephrotic syndrome: Each patient will remain on his or her baseline&#xD;
           therapy immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, tacrolimus or mycophenolate&#xD;
           mofetil. Steroids dose will be tapered to 0.5mg/kg, to a maximum of 40 mg, every other&#xD;
           day at the time of starting galactose. If patient achieves remission, as indicated by&#xD;
           negative first morning urine for protein for 3 consecutive days, alternate day steroid&#xD;
           therapy will be tapered by 0.12mg/kg/dose or by 10 mg/dose, once per week. If patient&#xD;
           has sustained remission for 1 month, and is off prednisone, the dose of&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drugs will be lowered by 25% per month until off. BP will be&#xD;
           controlled to below 95th percentile for height. If patient is on ACE inhibitors or ARBs,&#xD;
           the dose will stay unchanged during the duration of galactose administration unless&#xD;
           patient is experiencing side effects of therapy. If additional therapies for control of&#xD;
           hypertension are needed, they would be chosen from the antihypertensive drugs other than&#xD;
           ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Diuretics will be prescribed as needed for the symptomatic&#xD;
           relief of edema. Adjunct therapy medications described in this section are standard of&#xD;
           care and are not for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will serve as its own control. Results will be considered clinically significant&#xD;
      if the following criteria are met in response to oral galactose therapy at week 16 and if the&#xD;
      reduction in urine protein: creatinine and the increase in serum albumin persist at 12 weeks&#xD;
      after discontinuation of galactose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in FSPF to &lt;0.5 or decrease in FSPF by &gt; 0.3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decrease in first morning urine protein: creatinine ratio by 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase in serum albumin by &gt;1gm/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Decrease in dose of prednisone or other immunosuppressive drugs by 25% Statistical&#xD;
           Analysis The primary outcomes are the means of paired pre vs. post galactose treatment&#xD;
           differences in FSPF, urine protein: creatinine ratio, serum albumin and dose of&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drugs. We will use repeated measures ANCOVA models to estimate each&#xD;
           primary outcome as the dependent variable while holding constant pre-treatment levels.&#xD;
           Therefore, the independent variable will be the pre-treatment level of the corresponding&#xD;
           dependent variable, The model will be used to estimate the mean difference +/- the 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval (CI) corresponding to the mean level of the dependent variable at&#xD;
           pre-treatment. We will consider the pre-post difference to be statistically significant&#xD;
           if the 95% CI around the result fails to include 0 and to be clinically significant if&#xD;
           it meets the criteria specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequacy of the Sample: We evaluated the effect size difference that could be detected with&#xD;
      80% and 90% power in a pre-post treatment study of galactose involving 10 patients assessed&#xD;
      pre-treatment and post-treatment. The correlation between measurements on the same person was&#xD;
      assumed to be .7 and the two-tailed type 1 error was set at 0.05. The study will have better&#xD;
      than 90% power to detect effect size differences of 0.6 sd and better than 80% power to&#xD;
      detect effect size differences of 0.5 sd. These are considered to be moderate effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Facilities: The FS permeability factor will be tested in the laboratory of Virginia&#xD;
      Savin MD (Center for Glomerular Pathophysiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI)&#xD;
      using previously described methods.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Side Effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSGS is a difficult to treat disease associated with poor outcomes, including progression to&#xD;
      end stage renal disease. Galactose is a naturally occurring simple sugar and oral galactose&#xD;
      supplementation has no known side risks or side effects in humans. Patients eligible for this&#xD;
      study are those who have failed to respond to the current alternative treatments for FSGS,&#xD;
      which include steroids and other immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus,&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. These alternative immunosuppressive treatments have&#xD;
      many long term complications, some of which include stunted growth, nephrotoxicity,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. There is an urgent need for investigating benign therapies such&#xD;
      as galactose, which may present a safe alternative or an adjunct to current therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known side effects of oral galactose supplementation and no reports of toxicity&#xD;
      with chronic use in humans. The Certificate of Origin for the D-Galactose product from&#xD;
      FerroPfanstiehl is included in the Appendix and certifies that the D-Galactose to be used in&#xD;
      our study is safe for human consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-Galactose is administered safely in diagnostic testing for both glycogen storage disease&#xD;
      and cirrhotic liver disease (8) and as sonographic contrast agents, such as Levovist ®&#xD;
      (Bayer). Galactose has also been successfully administered as a treatment in Fabry's disease.&#xD;
      (9) In this case report, IV galactose infusions were administered at a dose of 1 g/kg every&#xD;
      other day for 2 years during which time liver function tests remained normal. Possible&#xD;
      associations between dairy intake and ovarian cancer has been investigated with inconclusive&#xD;
      results. A 2006 pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies done by Harvard School of public health&#xD;
      found no association of intake of dairy foods with ovarian cancer and a statistically&#xD;
      insignificant increase in risk of ovarian cancer at intakes of lactose &gt; 30 g/d. This study&#xD;
      involved analyzing surveys of reported dairy intake, but did not account for the presence of&#xD;
      other factors in milk, such as hormones, that could contribute to ovarian cancer risk (10).&#xD;
      Another 2005 meta-analysis in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention found no association&#xD;
      between milk/dairy products or galactose metabolism and ovarian cancer risk. (11) In addition&#xD;
      to occurring naturally in milk, galactose has been approved by the FDA as a substance&#xD;
      Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) as an ingredient in infant formula and other baby foods&#xD;
      and pediatric nutrition supplements in the form of galacto-oligosaccharides (a compound made&#xD;
      of 1 to 7 galactose molecules linked to a glucose molecule at the reducing end).&#xD;
      (www.fda.gov/food/foodingredientspackaging/generallyrecognizedassafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm1539&#xD;
      10.htm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSGS is resistant to steroid therapy and many other immunosuppressive drugs, and is&#xD;
      associated with poor outcome. Approximately 50% of patients with FSGS progress to ESRD within&#xD;
      5-10 years and in about 30% of children, FSGS can recur after transplantation.(1) Given the&#xD;
      devastating course of this disease and the benign nature of the proposed galactose treatment,&#xD;
      the anticipated benefits far outweigh the risks. If effective, galactose supplementation&#xD;
      could stop the progression of FSGS, limiting glomerular damage and preventing progression of&#xD;
      the disease to ESRD. The potential benefit of preserving kidney function and preventing the&#xD;
      need for dialysis or transplantation is significant for both participants in this study and&#xD;
      for other children with FSGS who may benefit from galactose therapy in the future.&#xD;
