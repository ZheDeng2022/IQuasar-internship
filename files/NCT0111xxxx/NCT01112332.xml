      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine normative Percentage&#xD;
      Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing Values and Weight-bearing Gait Characteristics in different&#xD;
      physiologic conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Values in increasing speeds from walking to running.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changing resistance and incline on an elliptical trainer&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ground jogging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stair climbing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treadmill running.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Walking.&#xD;

      Background information Orthopedic surgeons and rehabilitation physicians frequently request&#xD;
      limited weight-bearing for prolonged periods following certain bony or soft tissue&#xD;
      pathologies as well as certain lower - limb surgical procedures. Walking, stair climbing,&#xD;
      jogging, elliptical training and running on treadmill are a common activity that the injured&#xD;
      athlete will seek to return to as soon as possible following injury or surgery. In order for&#xD;
      the physician to be able to advise regarding weight-bearing, the Percentage&#xD;
      Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing (PBW/WB) values in increasing walking, jogging speeds, elliptical&#xD;
      training must be known. These parameters as well as the gait distribution changes have eluded&#xD;
      the rehabilitation community, mainly due to the technical inability to measure these&#xD;
      paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate percentage body weight/weight-bearing (PBW/WB) value analysis in walking has up been&#xD;
      investigated in laboratory settings, using balance plate systems and force plate platforms.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate normal gait characteristics and PBW/WB values using a&#xD;
      relatively new hand-held, portable, weight-bearing measuring device (Smartstep™).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their regular training the participants will use the flexible, light weight,&#xD;
      force-sensing insole for few minutes to receive the parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. subjects. In order to accurately control the speed changes, the test measurements will&#xD;
           be conducted on a treadmill (Technogym™ &quot;run excite 700&quot;). The tested speeds will be&#xD;
           4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 and 20 km/hr consecutively. Each subject will run for a 15 second&#xD;
           time period for each speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 25 subjects. The test measurements will be conducted on an Elliptical trainer (Precor&#xD;
           USA 576i EFX). The protocol includes 3 tests. In the first test, resistance and incline&#xD;
           will be paired together in increasing order at the set device levels of 1, 5, 10, 15,&#xD;
           and 20. In the second test, the resistance will be held constant at level 1, while the&#xD;
           incline will be increased from levels 1 to 20 in increments of five. In the third test,&#xD;
           the incline will remain constant at level 1, while the resistance will be increased from&#xD;
           levels 1 to 20 in increments of five. Each subject will be tested over a 20 second time&#xD;
           period for each of the changed resistances and inclines. The subjects will be instructed&#xD;
           to keep a steady pace within the range of steps/min = 70-95.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 40 subjects. The test subjects will be instructed to jog at their normal speed on a&#xD;
           solid ground surface over a distance of 16 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 40 subjects. The test measurements will be conducted on a flight of 10 stairs, each 17cm&#xD;
           high. The subjects will be instructed to ascend and descend the stairs at their normal&#xD;
           pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 40 subjects. The tested speed will be held at 8.5 km/hr on a treadmill (Technogym™ &quot;run&#xD;
           excite 700&quot;). Each subject will run for a 15 second time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 40 subjects. The test subjects will be instructed to walk at their normal speed on a&#xD;
           solid ground surface over a distance of 16 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed and a table of normal values will be established including&#xD;
      average PBW/WB values for the entire, hind and fore-foot as well as gait distribution&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
