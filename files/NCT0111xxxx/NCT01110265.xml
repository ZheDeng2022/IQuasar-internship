  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has consistently found attentional biases towards negative weight-related stimuli in&#xD;
      individuals with eating disorders. It has been suggested that these biases may act as a&#xD;
      vulnerability factor for the development and maintenance of body dissatisfaction and may&#xD;
      therefore be an important target for intervention. Previous studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      capacity to modify the patterns of attention allocation to threatening stimuli in a variety&#xD;
      of anxiety disorders, with a subsequent and sustained reduction in anxiety symptoms. Thus,&#xD;
      the present study aimed at testing the efficacy of attention training in reducing attentional&#xD;
      biases and eating disorder symptoms in individuals with elevated levels of body image&#xD;
      disturbance and eating disorder symptomatology of clinical severity. Thirty-two participants&#xD;
      were randomly allocated to receive eight sessions of a 10-minute computer task aimed at&#xD;
      training their attention away from weight-related stimuli or a control placebo training&#xD;
      condition. Results showed that participants in the attention training group had a&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction in their attentional bias and body dissatisfaction from pre-&#xD;
      to post-training relative to the placebo condition. At follow-up, both groups showed a&#xD;
      significant decrease in body dissatisfaction from their pre-training levels. The only&#xD;
      significant difference between groups in eating disorder symptoms at follow-up was in terms&#xD;
      of the attention training group experiencing a greater reduction in weight and shape&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;
