      This protocol is a prospective interventional pilot study at the Children's Hospital of&#xD;
      Philadelphia to determine whether or not two increments of sternal pressure known to occur&#xD;
      during &quot;leaning&quot; in CPR affects hemodynamic function, coronary perfusion pressures, and&#xD;
      intrathoracic pressure in order to inform the resuscitation community on reasonable target&#xD;
      pressures to avoid &quot;leaning&quot; on the chest during pediatric CPR.&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONALE The critical importance of positive and negative intrathoracic pressures&#xD;
      during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) has been recently demonstrated. During CPR,&#xD;
      excessive positive intrathoracic pressure caused by overzealous ventilation or incomplete&#xD;
      chest wall decompression has a detrimental effect on venous return to the heart, cardiac&#xD;
      hemodynamics, and survival in adults. FDA-approved monitor/defibrillators with sensors that&#xD;
      detect and provide feedback on the quality of chest compressions, including the amount of&#xD;
      sternal pressure (&quot;leaning&quot;), can improve the quality of CPR in adults. These&#xD;
      monitor/defibrillators have recently been implemented in the PICU and ED at CHOP. However,&#xD;
      determining whether &quot;leaning&quot; (or gentle sternal pressure) affects return of venous blood to&#xD;
      the thorax and intrathoracic pressure in children is unknown. A pilot study to determine&#xD;
      whether or not two increments of sternal pressure known to occur during &quot;leaning&quot; in CPR&#xD;
      affects hemodynamic function, coronary perfusion pressures, and intrathoracic pressure would&#xD;
      be a first step toward informing the resuscitation community on reasonable target pressures&#xD;
      to avoid &quot;leaning&quot; on the chest during pediatric CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the effect of the application of two different weights on the sternum&#xD;
           known to approximate &quot;leaning&quot; during CPR on central hemodynamic measurements and&#xD;
           coronary perfusion pressures in mechanically ventilated children.&#xD;

        -  To characterize the effect of the application of two different weights on the sternum&#xD;
           known to approximate &quot;leaning&quot; during CPR on intrathoracic pressure in mechanically&#xD;
           ventilated children STUDY DESIGN This protocol is a prospective interventional pilot&#xD;
           study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PHASES Screening: Prospective patients enrolled will be screened by a co-investigator.&#xD;
      Those that meet inclusion criteria will be approached by a member of the investigative team&#xD;
      during the routine pre-procedure evaluation in the Cardiac Intake Center for discussion of&#xD;
      the study and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: We will measure the depth of the chest. We will measure central hemodynamic&#xD;
      pressures and function, coronary perfusion pressures and intrathoracic pressures as two&#xD;
      weights (10% and 20% of body weight) are placed on the sternum. The primary outcome variable&#xD;
      will be the change in any of the central hemodynamic measurements before and after each&#xD;
      weight is applied to the sternum.&#xD;
