    <textblock>
      In the current study, the investigators will evaluate intratumoral pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data associated with the administration of the HDACI, Panobinostat, among&#xD;
      recurrent GBM patients. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      this agent, as well as evidence of anti-tumor activity in the patient population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll a maximum of 24 subjects with recurrent GBM who are scheduled for&#xD;
      planned debulking craniotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and enrollment on the study, subjects will receive 20mg panobinostat 3 times&#xD;
      a week for one week prior to surgery. Within 2-6 weeks of resection, subjects will resume&#xD;
      panobinostat at 20mg panobinostat 3 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be 6-month progression-free survival. Each cycle of therapy will be&#xD;
      28 days. All subjects will be assessed after every other cycle of therapy. Subjects will&#xD;
      remain on study therapy for at least one year unless they develop progressive disease,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance with study procedures or withdraw consent. Patients may&#xD;
      continue treatment with oral panobinostat until they experience unacceptable toxicity that&#xD;
      precludes further treatment, disease progression, and/or at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
