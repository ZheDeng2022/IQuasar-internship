    <textblock>
      Whenever a person has a cesarean section there is a risk that there will be a problem with&#xD;
      healing of the wound. The most common type of wound healing problem is separation and opening&#xD;
      of the skin and fatty tissue just beneath the skin. This type of wound healing problem&#xD;
      happens more often when the patient has a high body weight. In most cases, metal staples are&#xD;
      used to bring the skin together to close the wound. Usually, the staples are left in place&#xD;
      for a longer time when the woman is heavy, in hopes of decreasing the chance of wound healing&#xD;
      problems. But it is not known if leaving the staples in for a longer time is actually&#xD;
      helpful. In some cases, leaving the staples in longer may cause more pain and will require&#xD;
      you to see the doctor again to get the staples taken out. The purpose of this study is to see&#xD;
      if there is any difference in how the wound heals in heavy women after cesarean section when&#xD;
      the skin staples are removed after a short period of time versus a long period of time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cesarean delivery in the obese gravida is associated with numerous perioperative risks, the&#xD;
      most frequent of which is postoperative wound disruption, with a mean incidence of 15%. With&#xD;
      the exception of closure of the subcutaneous adipose layer, other useful measures to decrease&#xD;
      wound complications in the obese gravida have either not been studied or lack sufficient&#xD;
      evidence upon which to base a recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such intervention is the delayed removal of surgical skin staples. Skin staplers, which&#xD;
      were first introduced in the 1980's, were &quot;grandfathered&quot; through the United States Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, and have since become a widely utilized technique&#xD;
      for skin closure. Although neither the FDA nor device manufacturers make a specific&#xD;
      recommendation, skin staples are commonly left in situ anywhere from 3 - 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiologic rationale for delayed staple removal is unclear. Wound healing involves four&#xD;
      main stages including hemostasis, inflammation, granulation, and remodeling. Each phase can&#xD;
      be further broken down into overlapping steps. Reapproximation of the skin edges with staples&#xD;
      enables epithelialization, resulting in wound closure by a thin layer of cells by 48 hours&#xD;
      post-operatively. Although overall wound healing appears to be delayed in the setting of&#xD;
      obesity, whether the specific process of epithelialization is affected is unknown. Therefore,&#xD;
      there may not be a physiologic basis for delaying staple removal in obese women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, delayed staple removal has potentially negative effects on patient care that may&#xD;
      not be balanced by clinical benefits. Delayed staple removal may be associated with&#xD;
      prolongation of patient discomfort, additional clinical visits and increased associated&#xD;
      costs. These issues caused us to question whether the practice of delayed skin staple removal&#xD;
      in obese women is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this clinical trial is designed to compare wound healing outcomes after cesarean&#xD;
      following early (postoperative day #3) versus delayed (postoperative day #7 - 10) skin staple&#xD;
      removal in the obese patient.&#xD;
