  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study designed to assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of an oral Aripiprazole/Escitalopram combination therapy in&#xD;
      participants with MDD who have demonstrated an incomplete response to a prospective trial of&#xD;
      Escitalopram, and report a treatment history for the current MDD episode of an inadequate&#xD;
      response to at least one and no more than three adequate trials of an approved antidepressant&#xD;
      other than Escitalopram. An inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptom severity as assessed by the participant's self-report on the Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) and evaluated by the&#xD;
      investigator as part of the participant's medical and psychiatric history. An adequate trial&#xD;
      is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 6 weeks duration (or at least 3 weeks&#xD;
      for combination treatments) at an approved dose as specified in the ATRQ.&#xD;

      The study will be organized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-blind Prospective Treatment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single-blind Continuation Phase (Responder) or Double-blind Randomization Phase&#xD;
           (non-Responder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 day Post Treatment Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assigned Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Escitalopram monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aripiprazole/Escitalopram combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aripiprazole monotherapy&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early due to Sponsor decision, closure of this combination therapy&#xD;
    program is unrelated to any safety issues, no signals of concern.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Mean Change From End of Phase B (Week 8) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score to End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS assessed severity of depressive symptoms. It ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60 (higher scores indicating a greater severity of depressive symptoms). Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Score at The End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Mean Change From End of Phase B (Week 8) in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Mean Score to End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. All items are rated on an 11-point continuum (0= no impairment to 10= most severe) with the total SDS score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 30 (most severe). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>

Participants were titrated to the aripiprazole target dose of 12 mg/day at Week 9 if the initial 6 mg/day dose was tolerated. No dose increments were allowed after Week 12; however, doses may have been decreased at any week, based upon tolerability.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 237 major depressive disorder(MDD)participants were enrolled in Phase B(Single-blind Prospective Treatment Phase)to receive escitalopram monotherapy(10 or 20mg/day),of which 54 responders continued to Phase B+(Single-blind Phase B Responders),received escitalopram monotherapy(10 or 20mg/day).66 non-responders were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to Phase C(Double-blind Randomization Phase),received escitalopram or aripiprazole monotherapy or aripiprazole/escitalopram combination therapy.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The MADRS assessed severity of depressive symptoms. It ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60 (higher scores indicating a greater severity of depressive symptoms). Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>

          <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>

        <description>The SDS is a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. All items are rated on an 11-point continuum (0= no impairment to 10= most severe) with the total SDS score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 30 (most severe). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for analyses.</description>
