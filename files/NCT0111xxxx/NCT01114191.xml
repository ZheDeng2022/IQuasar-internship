  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the drug interaction between ketoconazole and ABT-869 to&#xD;
      determine the potential effect of ketoconazole on the metabolism of ABT-869. ABT-869 will be&#xD;
      taken alone or in combination with ketoconazole. The safety of a single dose administration&#xD;
      of ABT-869 when administered alone and in combination with ketoconazole will be assessed.&#xD;
