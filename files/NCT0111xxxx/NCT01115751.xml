      JWAA will consist of the following treatment phases parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - Dose escalation phase using a once-daily dosing schedule. Part B - Dose escalation&#xD;

Starting dose is 100mg. The dose will be subsequently increased to 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, and 600mg if no dose limiting toxicity is observed at the prior dose levels. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, demonstrate clinical benefit may receive treatment beyond two cycles until disease progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced&#xD;
             and/or metastatic (including Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma). The patient must be, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for experimental therapy after&#xD;
             available standard therapies have failed to provide clinical benefit for their&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) or the Revised Response Criteria for&#xD;
             Malignant Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Parts A and B: have measurable or nonmeasurable disease. Part C: have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x&#xD;
                  109/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin greater&#xD;
                  than or equal to 8 g/dL. Transfusions are not allowed to reach 8 g/dL prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN),&#xD;
                  alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) less than&#xD;
                  or equal to 2.5 times ULN. If the liver has tumor involvement, AST and ALT&#xD;
                  equaling less than or equal to 5 times ULN are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN or calculated&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance greater than 45 ml/mn.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued previous treatments for cancer and recovered from the acute effects&#xD;
             of therapy: at least 28 days for myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for&#xD;
             nonmyelosuppressive agents. At the discretion of the investigator, hormone-refractory&#xD;
             prostate cancer patients who are stable on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
             agonist therapy may have that treatment continued while they are enrolled in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with an&#xD;
             experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval&#xD;
             for any indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions (left to the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis (screening not&#xD;
             required). Patients with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they&#xD;
             are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their disease&#xD;
             is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have current acute or chronic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not&#xD;
             required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor&#xD;
             may affect the interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have QTc interval of &gt;470 msec on screening electrocardiogram(ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a strong CYP3A4 substrate with narrow therapeutic range, strong&#xD;
             inhibitor, or inducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have history of pituitary adenoma.&#xD;
