      This study will assess the potential of tazarotene foam to cause sensitization during a 48&#xD;
      hour challenge following 21 days of exposure on the skin of healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce contact sensitization following&#xD;
      repeated exposure under maximal stress conditions in healthy adult volunteers. Approximately&#xD;
      240 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65 years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam and vehicle foam.&#xD;
      Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema, edema, papules) or superficial effects at patch&#xD;
      sites will be visually assessed and scored according to the corresponding grading scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the following phases: 3&#xD;
      week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if indicated, a second 2 week Rest and&#xD;
      1 week Repeat Challenge.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
             authorization before any protocol-specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to complete the study and to comply with all study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possess Fitzpatrick skin types I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns&#xD;
             easily; tans minimally), III (burns moderately; tans gradually), or IV (rarely burns;&#xD;
             tans with ease) that will not interfere with the evaluation of any skin responses&#xD;
             (Fitzpatrick 1988). Determination of skin types will be based on sunburn and tanning&#xD;
             histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their responses to the first 30 to 45&#xD;
             minutes of sun exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects and their partners must agree to use a medically acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional criteria for women of childbearing potential, defined as one who is biologically&#xD;
        capable of becoming pregnant, including perimenopausal women who are less than 2 years from&#xD;
        their last menses:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A regular menstrual cycle before study entry (as reported by the subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the first application of study&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must&#xD;
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the duration of&#xD;
             the study. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods&#xD;
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was&#xD;
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an&#xD;
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.&#xD;
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a&#xD;
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth&#xD;
                  vaginally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of&#xD;
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.&#xD;
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods&#xD;
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal&#xD;
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermicide is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method&#xD;
        of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

             back due to sunburns, unevenness in skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair,&#xD;
             freckles, birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant skin diseases that may contraindicate participation or&#xD;
             interfere with patch test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic&#xD;
             dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Used antihistamines, selective leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg, montelukast&#xD;
             sodium, zafirlukast), or mast cell stabilizers (eg, cromolyn sodium or nedocromil&#xD;
             sodium) within 4 weeks of the Day 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications within 2 weeks of the Day 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using any medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect&#xD;
             the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participated in a previous study of the same study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employee of the study center, contract research organization, or Stiefel who is&#xD;
