  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform a pilot study of the S-FLARE imaging system, which uses low levels of safe,&#xD;
      invisible, near-infrared light to measure tissue oxygenation during breast reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery and to compare S-FLARE measurements to the gold standard, FDA-approved, the ViOptix&#xD;
      optical probe.&#xD;

      This pilot study will enroll three patients who have chosen to proceed with deep inferior&#xD;
      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction. This type of reconstruction uses&#xD;
      skin and fat from the abdomen to reconstruct a new breast shape. The construct is&#xD;
      vascularized through perforating arteries and veins that provide a blood supply to this&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current techniques to evaluate vessel selection rely on a handheld Doppler used for&#xD;
      confirmation of blood flow and perfusion; however, this modality is limited as it only&#xD;
      assesses a specific point within the flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The S-FLARE imaging system will be used to visualize vascularization in the DIEP flaps, and&#xD;
      this study will compare measurements by the S-FLARE imaging system and the standard-of-care&#xD;
      ViOptix point probe.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 minute imaging procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Due to patient-to-patient anatomic variation, the vascular perfusion to the skin in DIEP flaps is unpredictable and of great concern to the surgeon planning the flap design. We propose a method of imaging tissue oxygenation within a DIEP flap base on the use of invisible near-infrared light.&#xD;
This pilot study is a comparison study of oxygenation measurements taken by the ViOptix optical probe as the standard of care and the S-FLARE imaging system, with the intention of optimizing the ergonomics and functionality of the S-FLARE imaging system for use during breast reconstructive surgery.</description>
