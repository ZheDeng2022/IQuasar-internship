  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a diet rich in broccoli on cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk using biochemical indicators such as blood lipid profiles, most notably&#xD;
      cholesterol; markers of inflammation as well as established physiological measurements such&#xD;
      as Pulse wave velocity (PWV), Augmentation index (AIx) and Ambulatory Blood Pressure&#xD;
      Measurements (ABPM). Broccoli contains compounds known as glucosinolates which are&#xD;
      metabolised to isothiocyanates when consumed. The major glucosinolate in broccoli is known as&#xD;
      glucoraphanin which produces the isothiocyanate sulforaphane. The glucosinolates are thought&#xD;
      to be the principal component in broccoli that may reduce CVD risk. The investigators will&#xD;
      use a standard cultivar of broccoli and a cultivar that has enhanced levels of glucosinolates&#xD;
      ('HG broccoli'). This broccoli has been used in previous intervention studies (e.g.&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00535977). Volunteers will be asked to consume 400g of standard&#xD;
      broccoli, HG broccoli or peas each week over a 12 week period in a double blinded (for the&#xD;
      broccoli) parallel study. The volunteers recruited will, according to the Joint British&#xD;
      Societies (JBS 2) Guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in clinical&#xD;
      practise, have a 10-20% (mild to moderate) risk of developing cardiovascular disease or&#xD;
      having a cardiovascular (CV) event in the next 10 years.&#xD;
