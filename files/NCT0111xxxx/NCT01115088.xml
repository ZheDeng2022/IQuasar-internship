    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects that three different types of sweeteners&#xD;
      have on food intake, hunger and satiety levels, as well as insulin and glucose measures. The&#xD;
      study of whether food or beverages containing Stevia influence food intake to a greater&#xD;
      extent than food or beverages sweetened with Aspartame or Sucrose. Also, examining whether&#xD;
      taste preference and taste sensitivity influence food intake.&#xD;

      Expected time in this study will be approximately 24 hours spread over the course of one&#xD;
      initial screening visit and three test days during which you complete food tests at the&#xD;
      Pennington Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (Duration is 3 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will initially be asked to fill out psychological questionnaires to assess your&#xD;
           eating habits, food cravings, and preference for foods (i.e., tea and crackers with&#xD;
           cream cheese) that will be provided to you in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be asked to complete two taste tests during this visit. The first taste&#xD;
           test will be sodium chloride (table salt) followed by PROP (an extremely low dose of&#xD;
           hyperthyroid medication) sodium chloride (table salt).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be required to provide a blood sample (19 mL or 1.3 tablespoons) to check&#xD;
           glucose and insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are selected to be a participant for this study, you will receive a brief medical&#xD;
           evaluation during which you will be weighed, your height will be measured, and your&#xD;
           pulse and blood pressure will be taken. You will be interviewed about your medical&#xD;
           history and potential obstacles for completing the study. If you are female, a brief&#xD;
           interview will be conducted to determine your menstrual cycle phase. Total length of&#xD;
           time will be approximately three hours for the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Food Test Day (Duration is 7- 9 hours. You'll arrive after having fasted for 12 hrs.)&#xD;
      For females, all test meal days will be scheduled during their luteal phase. • Breakfast:&#xD;
      During your first food test day, you will be asked to come to the Pennington Center at any&#xD;
      time between the hours of 7:00 A.M. - 8:30 A.M. and consume a standard breakfast of Cheerios,&#xD;
      milk, orange juice, toast, butter, and jelly. You will then be free to leave but will be&#xD;
      asked to return 3.5 hours later. When your return, you will be sent to our inpatient unit for&#xD;
      a blood draw, which will test your level of insulin and glucose (total of 25 mL or 1.67&#xD;
      tablespoons). You will then be asked to rate your appetite on a computer using a visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS). After completing these VAS ratings, you will be provided with an&#xD;
      appetizer of 5 ounces of cold tea and 6 crackers with cream cheese. Both the tea and the&#xD;
      cream cheese will be sweetened with one of the following sweeteners: Aspartame, Sucrose, or&#xD;
      Stevia. After consuming this appetizer, you will be asked to complete another set of VAS&#xD;
      ratings, which again ask you about your appetite, as well as the sweetness of the appetizer.&#xD;
      Test times will be constant for all visits. Approximately twenty minutes after consuming this&#xD;
      appetizer, your insulin and glucose levels will again be tested and you will complete another&#xD;
      set of VAS ratings before your lunch meal. You will be required to consume breakfast at the&#xD;
      same time for all three visits. For example, if you come at 7:00 A.M. on your first test day,&#xD;
      you will be required to come in at 7:00 A.M. on your next two test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Lunch: After completing VAS ratings before lunch, you will be provided with a lunch&#xD;
      consisting of sandwiches, chips, and cookies. Your lunch meal will be served approximately 4&#xD;
      hours after your breakfast meal. Your eating behavior may be monitored by weight of the food&#xD;
      consumed and/or by video camera/tape. You may eat as much or as little of the lunch as you&#xD;
      wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • After Lunch: After you finish your lunch meal, you will be asked to complete post meal VAS&#xD;
      ratings. Your insulin and glucose will be measured on the three occasions after lunch: 30&#xD;
      minutes after lunch, one hour after lunch, and two hours after lunch for a total of 5 blood&#xD;
      draws (total of 25 mL or 1.67 tablespoons). You will also be asked to complete VAS ratings 30&#xD;
      minutes after lunch, and every hour for the next four hours. You will spend the afternoon at&#xD;
      the Pennington center to ensure that blood draws and VAS ratings occur at the appropriate&#xD;
      time intervals. During the afternoon you will be free to read, do paperwork brought from home&#xD;
      or work, or watch movies that will be provided to you by the Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Dinner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four hours after the test lunch, you will be provided with another appetizer of 5 ounces of&#xD;
      cold tea and crackers with cream cheese. Both the tea and the cream cheese will be sweetened&#xD;
      with one of the following sweeteners: Stevia, sucrose, or Aspartame. You will complete VAS&#xD;
      ratings before and after this appetizer, as well as before and after your dinner meal (4.5&#xD;
      hours after lunch), during which you will be instructed to eat as much or as little of any of&#xD;
      the items presented as you want. Your eating behavior may be monitored by weight of the food&#xD;
      consumed and/or by video camera/tape. After you complete VAS questions after the evening&#xD;
      meal, you will have fulfilled the requirements of the first food test day. However, you will&#xD;
      be asked not to consume any food or caloric beverages for three hours following your dinner&#xD;
      meal. You will be asked to report any adverse events from this day at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Food Test Day (Duration is 7-9 hours. You'll arrive after having fasted for 12 hrs.) •&#xD;
      On your second food test day, you will complete the same procedures and meal tests as you did&#xD;
      during the first food test day. However, the type of sweetener used in your tea and crackers&#xD;
      with cream cheese will differ from the type of sweetener you received on your first food test&#xD;
      day. You will be asked to report any adverse events from this day, as well as previous&#xD;
      visits, at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third Food Test Day (Duration is 7-9 hours. You'll arrive after having fasted for 12 hrs.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • On your third food test day, you will complete the same procedures and meal tests as you&#xD;
      did during your two previous food test days. However, the type of sweetener used in your tea&#xD;
      and crackers with cream cheese will differ from the type of sweetener you received on&#xD;
      previous visits. You will also be asked to report any adverse events from this day, as well&#xD;
      as previous visits, at this visit. We will also follow up by phone regarding adverse events&#xD;
      following your third visit. Table 1 presents a schedule of the procedures that will take&#xD;
      place at each of the study visits.&#xD;
