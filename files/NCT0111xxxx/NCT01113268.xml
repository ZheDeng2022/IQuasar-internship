  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main goal is to create a prospective cohort of 1500 patients with a first large&#xD;
      myocardial infarction allowing us, in a second step, to identify susceptibility genes for the&#xD;
      progression of patients towards chronic heart failure using a candidate gene/candidate&#xD;
      pathway approach. Our main hypothesis is that there is, for a given initial biomechanical&#xD;
      stress (duration of the ischemic episode, size of the infarcted area, etc.), a variation in&#xD;
      the individual susceptibility to develop left ventricular remodelling and to progress towards&#xD;
      heart failure, and that this variation is linked to genetic variants between individuals.&#xD;

      The research program comprises 4 phases: a selection phase at D0-D1, a pre-inclusion and an&#xD;
      inclusion phase at D4±2, a visit at M6, and a 5 year follow up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit at Day 0 - Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first 12-lead ECG, to be included in the observation book, is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first blood sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit at Day 4±2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first transthoracic echocardiography is performed in all patients selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the presence of at least 3 akinetic LV segments at the transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography, the patient is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data, medical and surgical anteriority, detailed circumstances of occurrence&#xD;
           of the MI and any other relevant information is obtained during an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second 12-lead ECG is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second blood sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first MRI is performed (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit at 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second transthoracic echocardiography is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third 12-lead ECG is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third blood sample is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 24-hour Holter-ECG monitoring is performed (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second MRI is performed (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five year follow up (phone contact until 7 years after inclusion):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient included at day 4±2 will be contacted by phone 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-MI to&#xD;
      obtain information regarding cardiovascular events and hospitalizations. If the patient&#xD;
      cannot be contacted directly, we will try to contact a member of his/her family or his/her&#xD;
      family physician.&#xD;
