      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and mantle cell&#xD;
           lymphoma (MCL) are types of cancers in which there are too many abnormal lymphocytes (a&#xD;
           type of white blood cell). Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a condition in which&#xD;
           the individual has a larger than normal number of lymphocytes. Individuals with CLL,&#xD;
           SLL, MBL, and MCL may survive for many years without the need for treatment, but there&#xD;
           is an apparent correlation between cell birth rates and disease activity. By studying&#xD;
           the birth and death rates of lymphocytes, researchers hope to identify individuals who&#xD;
           are at risk for worsening disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heavy water is similar in structure to regular water, but it has two deuterium atoms&#xD;
           instead of two hydrogen atoms. Deuterium has one more neutron than hydrogen, which is&#xD;
           what makes heavy water heavy. Heavy water is not radioactive, looks and tastes like&#xD;
           regular water, and has no known harmful effects at research-level doses. When a small&#xD;
           amount of heavy water is consumed daily, newly produced blood cells are labeled&#xD;
           (tagged), which allows researchers to track cell growth and to measure the birth and&#xD;
           death rates of CLL, SLL, MBL, MCL or normal lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the birth and death rates of lymphocytes from individuals with MBL, CLL/SLL, and&#xD;
      MCL, compared with lymphocytes from healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with MBL, CLL, SLL, or MCL,&#xD;
           but who have not been taking certain agents (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, or other&#xD;
           PDE-inhibitors, prednisone, cyclosporin-A, rapamycin, or other immunosuppressive agents,&#xD;
           more than 2 cups of green tea daily, or Celebrex) for 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age, but who have not been taking certain agents&#xD;
           (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, or other PDE-inhibitors, prednisone, cyclosporin-A, rapamycin,&#xD;
           or other immunosuppressive agents, more than 2 cups of green tea daily, or Celebrex)for&#xD;
           4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and initial&#xD;
           blood tests. Other tests may be administered to the individuals with cancer, as required&#xD;
           by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will drink regular doses of heavy water daily for a total of 4 weeks&#xD;
           (labeling period). There is an optional 6-month follow-up or wash-out period during&#xD;
           which no additional heavy water will be consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected weekly during the labeling period, and a bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy will be obtained where possible. Individuals with cancer may also have a lymph&#xD;
           node biopsy during this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples may be collected during the optional wash-out phase of the&#xD;
           study to determine the rate at which cancer cells disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment is not provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and its lymphoma variant, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)&#xD;
      were for decades considered diseases caused by the progressive accumulation of abnormal&#xD;
      lymphocytes. The prevailing view being that CLL and SLL disease processes were driven by an&#xD;
      underlying defect in apoptosis. While resistance to apoptosis appears to be important in the&#xD;
      CLL and SLL disease process, recent studies suggest that cellular proliferation is more&#xD;
      important than previously realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells from individuals with CLL who drank deuterated water (heavy water) for 6 weeks showed a&#xD;
      turnover rate of 0.1 % to 1.1 % per day. In a second study involving CLL subjects who drank&#xD;
      heavy water, average CLL turnover rates were in a similar range but approximately 2-fold&#xD;
      lower than average B-cell turnover rates from healthy individuals. These studies have shown&#xD;
      the safety and scientific value of using heavy water to study the kinetics of cell&#xD;
      proliferation in patients and normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose this study to expand on findings by other investigators. This study will&#xD;
      address the site of proliferation for CLL/SLL cells and will include individuals with&#xD;
      monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), a possible precursor of CLL. Furthermore, we will&#xD;
      include patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a disease in which tumor proliferation&#xD;
      plays an important role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will drink heavy water daily for a total of 4 weeks (labeling period) with&#xD;
      an optional 6 months follow up ( wash out period). Blood samples will be obtained weekly&#xD;
      during the labeling period. A bone marrow and/or lymph node biopsy will be obtained where&#xD;
      possible during the labeling period. Additional blood draws may be obtained during the&#xD;
      optional wash-out phase of the study to determine the rate at which tumor cells disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this exploratory study is to obtain an estimate of the proliferation&#xD;
      rate of tumor cells in individuals with MBL, CLL/SLL, and MCL. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      the comparison of proliferation rates between different anatomic compartments, specifically&#xD;
      peripheral blood, lymph node, and bone marrow and the estimation of the attrition or&#xD;
      disappearance rate of cells during an optional phase of the protocol. Healthy volunteers may&#xD;
      be included for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this exploratory study is to obtain an estimate of the proliferation&#xD;
      rate of tumor cells in individuals with MBL, CLL/SLL, and MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include: Proliferation rate in tissue compared to blood, disappearance&#xD;
      rate of labeled cells from the blood and tissue, and the safety profile of heavy water in the&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;
