    <textblock>
      Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme in the body for breaking down many&#xD;
      medications that are commonly used in children of various ages. The purpose of this proposal&#xD;
      is to investigate the relative roles of development and genetic variation in CYP2D6 activity&#xD;
      in school-aged children and adolescents with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and&#xD;
      health controls using the over-the-counter cough suppressant, dextromethorphan or &quot;DM&quot;, a&#xD;
      standard probe for determining CYP2D6 phenotype. Embedded in the study design are sub-studies&#xD;
      to search for by-products of normal body metabolism that reflect differences in enzyme&#xD;
      activity, and a pharmacokinetic study to assess the consequences of CYP2D6 genetic variation&#xD;
      on the systemic exposure to medications used by this patient population. Ultimately, the goal&#xD;
      of the research is to personalize the use of medications in children by selecting the&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the correct medication for individual patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal represents a continuation of previous and ongoing longitudinal studies to&#xD;
      characterize the relative contribution of pharmacogenetics and ontogeny to variability in&#xD;
      CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity between birth and adolescence. Specifically, the overall goal of&#xD;
      the research program is to test the hypothesis that genetic variability, rather than&#xD;
      ontogeny, is the primary source of variability in CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity during&#xD;
      adolescence. This study will extend our current series of longitudinal phenotyping studies&#xD;
      and will be a cross-sectional study in children aged 7-15 years, studied on seven occasions,&#xD;
      6 months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be recruited from Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, The Children's Mercy&#xD;
      Hospital Northland Campus, and The Children's Mercy South Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this study will consist of a total of 220 children and adolescents&#xD;
      from 7 to 15 years of age with a gender and ethnic distribution representative of the patient&#xD;
      population served by Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH; from a representative 12 month period)&#xD;
      as follows: White, 59.6%; African-American, 31.9%; Hispanic, 4.9%; Asian, 0.6%;Native&#xD;
      American, 0.1%; Other, 2.9%. The gender distribution is 44.4% female and 55.6% male. An equal&#xD;
      number of pediatric patients who meet the DSM-IV criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD or&#xD;
      ADD (~33%) and age- and sex-matched controls (~67%) will be recruited. The patients represent&#xD;
      a population of children who can reasonably expect to be treated with a medication that is&#xD;
      primarily dependent upon CYP2D6 for its elimination from the body. An example is atomoxetine,&#xD;
      also known as StratteraÂ®. Each patient will be asked to invite a friend to participate in the&#xD;
      phenotyping study with them, providing a non-ADHD population as a reference. Additional&#xD;
      phenotyping visits will occur every six months (totaling 7 visits). Justification: Assuming a&#xD;
      10% attrition rate for the second visit, the sample size is expected to provide approximately&#xD;
      25 patients and 25 controls (50 subjects total) in each initial 2-year age bin: 7.0 to 9.0 y,&#xD;
      9.1 to 11.0 y, 11.1 to 13.0 y, and 13.1 to 15.0 y.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled via informed permission/assent and will be studied as outpatients&#xD;
      utilizing resources provided by the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit located in the Division&#xD;
      of Clinical Pharmacology and Medical Toxicology at Children's Mercy Hospital. For the ADHD&#xD;
      group, patients being treated with atomoxetine at the time of study enrollment will be&#xD;
      allowed to participate. Although in vitro studies indicate that atomoxetine inhibits CYP2D6&#xD;
      activity by ~50%, there does not appear to be any effect in vivo as single dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of the CYP2D6 substrate, desipramine, were unaffected by four days of&#xD;
      atomoxetine 60 mg b.i.d. Thus, we do not expect any substantial effect on DM&#xD;
      biotransformation. Furthermore, if during the six month interval between phenotyping visits&#xD;
      ADHD patients are prescribed medications that are known CYP2D6 inhibitors, they will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue in the study; the dose and start date of these medications will be&#xD;
      recorded and the effect of the inhibitor on CYP2D6 phenotype (urinary metabolite ratio and&#xD;
      endogenous biomarker) will be determined. These data points will be excluded from the&#xD;
      ontogeny and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-study visit. (about 1 hour long) On a screening visit, prospective subjects (and their&#xD;
      parents) will be provided with a description of the proposed study. After all their questions&#xD;
      have been answered, they will be given a copy of the permission/assent form to review and&#xD;
      sign Subjects will then have their medical history and use of medications reviewed, including&#xD;
      the use of non-prescription and herbal remedies. All subjects will be given a complete&#xD;
      physical examination by a physician, including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      breathing rate, temperature, height and weight) and an assessment of pubertal development by&#xD;
      Tanner stage. Breast development will be assessed by visual inspection. Pubic hair will be&#xD;
      assessed by visual inspection. Testicular volume will be measured by direct comparison to&#xD;
      orchidometer beads. Tanner Staging will be assessed by a gender appropriate physician. Blood&#xD;
      will be drawn by needle stick for serum chemistries, liver function tests and a hematology&#xD;
      panel; a portion will also be retained for DNA testing (approximately 2 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
      total). Urine will be collected for a Urinalysis with Micro. Numbing cream may be applied to&#xD;
      the site to minimize discomfort. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for females of&#xD;
      child bearing age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA testing, referred to &quot;genotyping&quot; will be conducted by a combination of technologies&#xD;
      designed to detect variations from single nucleotide level (including polymorphisms,&#xD;
      insertions and deletions), to larger gene deletions, rearrangements, hybrid structures and&#xD;
      copy number variations using established methods in the Developmental Pharmacology and&#xD;
      Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory. As next-generation sequencing technology becomes&#xD;
      established, existing technologies will be replaced by next-generation sequencing for its&#xD;
      ability to assess the entire gene region rather than at individual locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 1 (about 5 hours long) Within approximately one week of the pre-study visit,&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the study unit. The child must refrain from eating 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to the scheduled visit. Prior to dosing, the subjects will completely empty their bladders&#xD;
      and provide a blank urine sample. Each subject will then be given a single 0.5 mg/kg dose of&#xD;
      DM as Robitussin Cough (7.5 mg/5 ml; alcohol-free, fruit punch flavor). All urine produced&#xD;
      over the 4-hour study period will be collected. Urine will be retained for analysis of DM and&#xD;
      its three metabolites, and for metabolomic analyses. One hour after dosing, the subjects will&#xD;
      be provided with a small meal that they will select from the standard hospital menu. A&#xD;
      pregnancy test will be performed for females of child bearing age. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      provide breaths (inspiratory and expiratory) for ten minutes with a handheld indirect&#xD;
      calorimeter (ie. MedGen/Body Gem: also known as &quot;GEM&quot;) with a clip on their nose. The&#xD;
      measurements obtained for resting metabolic rates will occur prior to dosing and 4 hours post&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked how they are feeling during the study and before going home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 2-7 (about 5 hours long) The remaining visits will occur every 6 months following&#xD;
      Study Day 1; the study sessions will be delayed for 1-2 weeks if the subjects are suffering&#xD;
      from flu-like symptoms. The child must refrain from eating 2 hours prior to the scheduled&#xD;
      visit. For females, a pregnancy test will be conducted using the pre-dose urine sample prior&#xD;
      to DM dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then have their medical history and use of medications reviewed, including the&#xD;
      use of non-prescription and herbal remedies. Subjects will be given a complete physical&#xD;
      examination by a physician, including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing&#xD;
      rate, temperature, height and weight) and an assessment of pubertal development by Tanner&#xD;
      stage. Breast development will be assessed by visual inspection. Pubic hair will be assessed&#xD;
      by visual inspection. Testicular volume will be measured by direct comparison to orchidometer&#xD;
      beads. Tanner Staging will be assessed by a gender appropriate physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the study unit. Prior to dosing, the subjects will completely&#xD;
      empty their bladders and provide a blank urine sample. Each subject will then be given a&#xD;
      single 0.5 mg/kg dose of DM as Robitussin Cough (7.5 mg/5 ml; alcohol-free, fruit punch&#xD;
      flavor). All urine produced over the 4-hour study period will be collected. Urine will be&#xD;
