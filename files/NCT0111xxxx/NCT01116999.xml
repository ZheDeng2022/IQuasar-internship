      The investigators hypothesise that, for novices, light guided tracheal intubation will&#xD;
      improve the time and success rate of this clinical skill compared to standard direct tracheal&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experiment was conducted under the close supervision of the coaching anesthesiologists in&#xD;
      several stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training stage: First of all, the operators received training with respect to the&#xD;
      theories and principles of airway management, including techniques of bag-mask ventilation,&#xD;
      Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation and light-guided and tracheal intubation until&#xD;
      they had a good master about the theoretical background, technical risks and indications of&#xD;
      the two techniques. Then, they had to receive manikin training of the two techniques on the&#xD;
      Airway Management Trainer. Exposure of the glottis(EG)/tracheal intubation(TI) training would&#xD;
      be continued before they were able to use both techniques to complete three consecutive cases&#xD;
      of Exposure of the glottis/tracheal intubation operation successfully on the manikin trainer&#xD;
      within 120 seconds (s) at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 medical workers were assigned to perform TI within 120s with either Direct laryngoscopy TI&#xD;
      or light-guided TI technique, which was selected randomly and then converted to the&#xD;
      alternative one until they complete 5 cases with each of the two techniques. The time of EG&#xD;
      started from mouth opening of the patient to the exposure of the glottis. The time of TI also&#xD;
      started from mouth opening of the patient to the completion of inserting the tracheal guide&#xD;
      to the tracheal and sealing it with cuff inflation. The EG time, Cormack-Lehane (C&amp;L) grades,&#xD;
      TI time, one-time success rate, and the overall success rate in using the two TI techniques&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was laid in a supine position, with the head laid on a 7cm-high pillow for the&#xD;
      sake of stability. The peripheral vein was accessed routinely and connected to a standard&#xD;
      monitor for electrocardiography (ECG), SpO2 and noninvasive blood pressure (BP). Sufficient&#xD;
      oxygen inhalation was initiated for &gt; 3min before induction of general anesthesia with&#xD;
      midazolam, propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium bromide. The anesthesiologist was not allowed to&#xD;
      give any instruction and suggestion or assistance to the operator during the whole process.&#xD;
      The coaching anesthesiologist supervised the whole TI process closely. Should any hidden risk&#xD;
      occur or the TI exceed the required time of the experiment, the TI attempt of the operator&#xD;
      would be terminated and replaced by the anesthesiologist in order to ensure patients' safety:&#xD;
      TI exceeded 120s; Attempt of TI exceeded 2 times; SpO2 decreasing to below 95%; appearance of&#xD;
      unstable hemodynamic situations (mean BP or HR fluctuating by more than 25% of the baseline&#xD;
      value); or occurrence of airway injury as evidenced by stained blood on the Macintosh Blade.&#xD;
      Any patient with C&amp;L grade III~IV as discovered by the anesthesiologist during TI would be&#xD;
      excluded from the present study and replaced by anther patient to re-start the experiment. A&#xD;
      7.0- or 7.5-mm-ID endotracheal tube was used as the guide according to the patient's&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
