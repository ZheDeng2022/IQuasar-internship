      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with brain tumors often have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to see if&#xD;
           the tumor has responded to therapy or to see if the tumor has grown. Sometimes, it is&#xD;
           difficult to tell if the scan is abnormal because of tumor size or shape, swelling, scar&#xD;
           tissue, or dead tissue. Because brain tumor biopsies require surgery, researchers are&#xD;
           looking for more noninvasive ways of evaluating brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use a radioactive sugar known as 18F-FDG to try&#xD;
           to determine if a tumor is active or not. Active tumors generally take up more sugar&#xD;
           than the surrounding tissue, but because normal brain tissue uses the same sugar as&#xD;
           brain tumors, it is then difficult to tell if tumor tissue is taking up sugar or not. A&#xD;
           different radioactive agent, 18F-FLT, is now being studied in some adults with different&#xD;
           kinds of tumors. Researchers are interested in determining whether it is possible to use&#xD;
           this agent as a marker of tumor activity in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of 18F-FLT for pediatric glioma scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the results of 18F-FLT studies with studies using the radioactive agents&#xD;
           18F-FDG and 1H-MRSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children less than 18 years of age who are having radiation therapy to treat malignant&#xD;
      gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have scanning tests before radiation therapy, 1 to 3 weeks after&#xD;
           radiation therapy, and if researchers suspect that the tumor is growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve three separate imaging tests (1H-MRSI, 18F-FDG PET, and 18F-FLT&#xD;
           PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proton spectroscopy (1H-MRSI) is a procedure that is similar to MRI and is performed in&#xD;
           the same scanner as an MRI. Because this scan is long (2-3 hours), most children will&#xD;
           receive medications from an anesthesiologist so that they can sleep through the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within 2 weeks of the 1H-MRSI scan, participants will have the PET scans with both the&#xD;
           standard contrast agent (18F-FDG) and the experimental agent (18F-FLT). These scans will&#xD;
           last approximately 1 hour each.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A limitation of current investigational therapy for patients with brain tumors is&#xD;
           assessment of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (18)F-FDG PET is commonly used to assess tumor metabolism. However, normal brain uses&#xD;
           glucose as an energy source, resulting in increased background FDG uptake, which&#xD;
           confounds results and makes it difficult to distinguish normal from neoplastic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newer imaging techniques that noninvasively assess metabolic and physiologic&#xD;
           characteristics of brain tumor tissue are being developed to identify biomarkers of&#xD;
           clinical efficacy in trials of new molecularly targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT) is a PET radiopharmaceutical that is taken up by&#xD;
           proliferating cells and may therefore serve as a surrogate marker of early response or&#xD;
           lack of response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will prospectively evaluate (18)F-FLT in children undergoing radiation&#xD;
           therapy for gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility of (18)F-FLT PET imaging in pediatric patients with malignant&#xD;
           gliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the ability of (18)F-FLT PET imaging to detect treatment changes in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with malignant gliomas undergoing radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and toxicity profile of PET imaging using (18)F-FLT in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with malignant gliomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate changes in (18)F-FLT PET before and after radiation with outcome (12 month&#xD;
           PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the performance of (18)F-FLT-PET to that of MR perfusion, proton magnetic&#xD;
           resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRSI) and (18)F-FDG PET in prediction of tumor response, time&#xD;
           to progression and overall survival time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children less than 18 years of age with malignant gliomas for whom radiation therapy is&#xD;
           prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hepatic: SGOT, SGPT less than 5 times the ULN; total and direct bilirubin less than&#xD;
                or equal to 2 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Renal: Serum creatinine must be within the upper limit of normal values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting serum glucose less than 150 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients will undergo MRI (with 1H-MRSI and perfusion), (18)F-FLT PET and (18)F-FDG PET&#xD;
      within 2 weeks of each other at the following time points: pre-radiation therapy, 1-3 weeks&#xD;
      post-radiation therapy, and at the time of suspected progression.&#xD;
