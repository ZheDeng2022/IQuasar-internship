  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial that aimed to compare the short-term clinical outcomes&#xD;
      and systemic inflammatory/cytokine responses of endoscopic submucosal dissection versus&#xD;
      laparoscopic resection for early colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc&#xD;
      endoscopic resection with conventional techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal&#xD;
      pathologies. The recent progress in endoscopic technologies and interest in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening have enabled the diagnosis of a larger number of early colorectal neoplasms,&#xD;
      including benign polyps and early cancers. Colonoscopic polypectomy remains the cornerstone&#xD;
      of therapy for the majority of colorectal polyps and helps prevent colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      However, if colorectal neoplasms are too large or cannot be removed &quot;en bloc&quot; endoscopically,&#xD;
      operative procedures are required to reduce risks of incomplete removal and local recurrence.&#xD;
      Laparoscopic resection represents a minimally invasive alternative for treating colorectal&#xD;
      neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection. However, laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery has to be done under general anesthesia, is associated with operative morbidity, and&#xD;
      is expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a revolutionary endoscopic procedure that enables&#xD;
      en bloc resection of large gastrointestinal tumors, irrespective of the size of the lesion.&#xD;
      ESD, which was pioneered in Japan for the treatment of early gastric neoplasms, has now been&#xD;
      successfully applied to the colon and rectum. ESD has been shown by recent studies to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective resection technique for large early colorectal neoplasms. However, no&#xD;
      report can be found in the literature comparing ESD and laparoscopic resection for early&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection with conventional&#xD;
      techniques. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether ESD is less invasive than laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery in terms of systemic inflammatory and cytokine responses, and all these may have&#xD;
      implications for cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to compare the short-term clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and systemic inflammatory/cytokine responses of ESD versus laparoscopic resection&#xD;
      for early colorectal neoplasms that are not amenable to en bloc endoscopic resection with&#xD;
      conventional techniques. The overall costs of the two therapeutic approaches will also be&#xD;
      compared. Findings of this proposed project may provide evidence-based clarification of the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of ESD in treating early colorectal neoplasms. We hypothesize that ESD is&#xD;
      associated with lower morbidity, earlier recovery, shorter hospital stay, and lower costs&#xD;
      when compared with laparoscopic resection. A faster recovery and earlier discharge after ESD&#xD;
      may reduce financial burden to the hospital and health care system. The results of this&#xD;
      proposed project may have a significant impact on the future treatment strategy for early&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasms, and may provide new insights into the systemic inflammatory responses&#xD;
      of ESD.&#xD;
