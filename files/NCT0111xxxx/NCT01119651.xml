      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of Tazarotene Foam to induce a&#xD;
      photoallergic reaction when exposed to UV and VIS light on skin of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, vehicle controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the potential of tazarotene foam 0.1% to induce a photoallergic reaction in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. Approximately 62 healthy, male and female, volunteer subjects aged 18 to 65&#xD;
      years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be exposed to patches containing tazarotene foam, vehicle foam, and no foam&#xD;
      (blank; negative control). Inflammatory skin responses (eg, erythema and local skin&#xD;
      reactions) or superficial effects at patch sites will be visually assessed to corresponding&#xD;
      grading scales. The study duration will be 6 weeks or 9 weeks and will consist of the&#xD;
      following phases: Screening, 3 week Induction, 2 week Rest, and 1 week Challenge, and if&#xD;
      indicated, a second 2 week Rest and 1 week Repeat Challenge.&#xD;

    <description>There are 2 phases in this study. The induction phase will include 6 days of patch application to the subject's back. Patches will be removed daily and irradiated. Patch applications will be placed on the same sites, unless a strong reaction is observed. The induction phase will be followed by a rest period followed by the Challenge Phase which consists of a 24-hr application of 3 sets of 3 patches (Set C, Set D, and Set E) applied to na√Øve sites on the subject's back. Each set of patches will consist of a tazarotene foam patch, a vehicle foam patch, and a blank patch. After 24 hrs, Set D patch sites will be evaluated and irradiated with UVA/UVB light. Set C patch sites will be evaluated and irradiated with UVA, UVB light and visible light. Set E patch sites will be evaluated &amp; will serve as nonirradiated controls. Patch sites will be evaluated 1 hr after patch removal and during follow up visits at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs after removal of the final patch in Set E.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent and Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
             authorization before any protocol-specific procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to complete the study and to comply with all study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Possess Fitzpatrick skin types I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns&#xD;
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately; tans gradually) that will not&#xD;
             interfere with the evaluation of any skin responses (Fitzpatrick 1988). Determination&#xD;
             of skin types will be based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects'&#xD;
             opinions of their responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects and their partners must agree to use a medically acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional criteria for women of childbearing potential, defined as one who is biologically&#xD;
        capable of becoming pregnant, including perimenopausal women who are less than 2 years from&#xD;
        their last menses:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A regular menstrual cycle before study entry (as reported by the subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks of the first application of study&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must&#xD;
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the duration of&#xD;
             the study. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods&#xD;
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was&#xD;
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an&#xD;
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.&#xD;
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a&#xD;
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth&#xD;
                  vaginally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of&#xD;
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.&#xD;
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods&#xD;
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal&#xD;
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal&#xD;
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermicide is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method&#xD;
        of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.&#xD;

             freckles, birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant skin diseases that may contraindicate participation or&#xD;
             interfere with patch test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic&#xD;
             dermatitis, acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
