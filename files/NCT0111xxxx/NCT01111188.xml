  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by cell cycle dysregulation. PD 0332991 is a&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor capable of inhibiting cell cycling of MCL. A phase&#xD;
      I study has demonstrated the safety and anti-lymphoma activity of PD 0332991. Bortezomib is a&#xD;
      first generation proteasome inhibitor approved for treatment of patients with recurrent MCL.&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggests that PD 0332991 and bortezomib may act synergistically in MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD 0332991 will be administered continuously for 12 days followed by a 9 day period without&#xD;
      treatment. Bortezomib will be administered by intravenous bolus on days 8, 11, 15, and 18 of&#xD;
      each cycle. One cycle is defined as three weeks. A maximum of ten cycles will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Escalating doses of PD 0332991 in combination with bortezomib will be studied sequentially,&#xD;
      with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is determined. PD 0332991 will be&#xD;
      given orally, starting on Day 1 of each cycle, once a day for 12 days followed by 9 days&#xD;
      without treatment. Bortezomib will be given by intravenous (IV) bolus or subcutaneously&#xD;
      (taking 3 to 5 seconds to administer) on days 8, 11, 15 and 18. For dose levels 3a and 4b,&#xD;
      bortezomib will be administered only on days 15 and 18. One cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21&#xD;
      days). Subjects will remain on treatment until they meet criteria for withdrawal from&#xD;
      treatment described in section 5.4 (e.g., DLT, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if applicable), drug preparation, and&#xD;
      dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers, patients' height, body weight, and body&#xD;
      surface area, and total drug administered in milliliters and milligrams. Any discrepancy&#xD;
      between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must be&#xD;
      recorded in the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the&#xD;
      investigator or identified sub-investigator (s). Treatment will be administered on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 7.&#xD;
      Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6. No investigational or commercial&#xD;
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to&#xD;
      treat the patient's malignancy.&#xD;
