  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orotracheal intubation following general anesthesia requires blades to be performed. The risk&#xD;
      of patients contamination with infectious agents related to reusable metal blades leads to&#xD;
      promote single-use blades. Some of these latter are plastic and this material may need more&#xD;
      strength to lift the jaw and expose the larynx before orotracheal intubation. Sometimes,&#xD;
      change of blade, from plastic to metal, during the procedure is necessary to increase the&#xD;
      larynx exposure. This change of blade may increase the frequency of sore throat following&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the study hypothesis is an increase of both sore throat intensity and frequency&#xD;
      with the plastic blades compared with the metal blades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the present study is to compare the impact of these two types of&#xD;
      blades, metal versus plastic, on sore throat intensity and frequency following scheduled&#xD;
      orotracheal intubation for general anesthesia&#xD;

      Trial design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, prospective, randomized and single-blind controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtaining of the Ethic Committee approval allows the enrolment of 712 patients scheduled&#xD;
      for surgery performed under general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation. Adult patients,&#xD;
      18 to 70 years-old, with grade I-II of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) status will&#xD;
      be enrolled after clear information and obtaining, at the anesthesia visit, of the&#xD;
      non-opposition to be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the anesthesia visit, the anesthesiologist will explain the purpose and protocol to the&#xD;
      patients and then will propose them to participate to the study. The decision to be enrolled&#xD;
      will be known at the pre-anesthesia visit, one day before the surgery. Therefore, the&#xD;
      patients will have a delay between the anesthesia and pre-anesthesia visits to make a&#xD;
      decision. The non-opposition to participate to the trial will be clearly mentioned in the&#xD;
      medical file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list will be established by a statistician. Informed and non-opposed patients&#xD;
      will be allocated both a randomization number and a plastic or metal blade in the operating&#xD;
      theatre via the Clean Web software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation and measure of the primary outcome will be made in a single-blind way. The&#xD;
      patients will evaluate the sore throat intensity being unaware of the type of blade used for&#xD;
      the orotracheal intubation. An independent research assistant in each centre will collect&#xD;
      data evaluated in both the operating room during the orotracheal intubation procedure and the&#xD;
      post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of tracheal intubation will be defined as the time elapsing from the mouth&#xD;
      insertion of the blade to the passage of the tube throughout the vocal cords announced by the&#xD;
      operator. The intra-tracheal position of the tube will be confirmed by three squared cycles&#xD;
      of capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be premedicated by hydroxyzine 1 mg kg-1 the previous evening and one hour&#xD;
      before the transfer to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization is performed in the operating room just before the anesthesia induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring will be standard with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An electrocardiogram (lookout of cardiac rhythm modifications)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pulse oxymetry to lookout arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A non-invasive blood pressure monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A capnograph to lookout carbon dioxide elimination in the expired gas and to confirm the&#xD;
           intra-tracheal position of the tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A gas analyser to control the concentration of administered halogenated volatile agents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A neuromuscular blockade monitor to lookout the depth of the neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
           required to perform tracheal intubation in optimal conditions. The monitoring will&#xD;
           consist of stimulating the facial nerve 1 cm near the external eyelid corner by a train&#xD;
           of four electric charges (30 mA). The muscular responses will be evaluated on the&#xD;
           corrugator Supercilia by counting the number of contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A bispectral index (BIS) or entropy to monitor the hypnosis depth. The expected values&#xD;
           will be 40-60 and 25-35, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A manometer to control the tracheal tube cuff pressure Before anesthesia induction,&#xD;
           patients will breathe 100% oxygen till expired oxygen concentration reach 90%.&#xD;
           Intravenous anesthesia will be then performed with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg kg -1) as&#xD;
           hypnotic, sufentanil (0.2 mcg kg-1) and atracurium (0.5 mg kg-1) as muscle relaxant.&#xD;
           Cis-atracurium or vecuronium as middle acting muscle relaxant or SUNCCYNILCHOLINE as&#xD;
           short acting muscle relaxant will be authorized. According to the randomization, the&#xD;
           blade used for orotracheal intubation will be metal or plastic. The metal blade is&#xD;
           reusable and the plastic blade is disposable. When the BIS or the entropy will reach&#xD;
           40-60 and 25-35, respectively, with efficient face mask ventilation (good thoracic&#xD;
           amplitude following by capnography cycles), no response to the TOF at the corrugator&#xD;
           Supercilia, the laryngoscopy will be performed according to the orotracheal intubation&#xD;
           algorithm. Tracheal tube sizes will be 7 mm for female and 7.5 for males. Tracheal tube&#xD;
           cuff will be standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, the anesthesia will be maintained with inhaled halogenated gas or&#xD;
      intravenously. Inhaled gas will be moistened. Postoperative analgesia will be anticipated in&#xD;
      the operating room with paracetamol 1 g, ketoprofen 100 mg and nefopam if necessary. In the&#xD;
      absence of contraindication, the three analgesics will be administered during laparotomies.&#xD;
      Wound and abdominal holes for laparoscopy will be infiltrated with ropivacaine. At the end of&#xD;
      the surgery, the tracheal tube will be withdrawn according to the standard procedure&#xD;
      recommended by the French Anesthesiology Society. Mouth secretions will be suctioned&#xD;
      delicately. In the PACU, analgesia will be continued with according to a protocol adapted to&#xD;
      the type of surgery. Morphine will be administered if pain VAS reaches 4/10. Pharyngeal and&#xD;
      laryngeal morbidity evaluation will begin at the discharge of the PACU and will last 48&#xD;
      hours. If signs persist more than 48 hours, an ENT examination will be performed to make a&#xD;
      diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The literature reports a 30% incidence of postoperative sore throat with metal&#xD;
      blades. The hypothesis is that this incidence could increase from 30% to 40% if plastic&#xD;
      blades are used. Un sample size of 356 patients per group is required to detect this increase&#xD;
      of 10% with a Chi2 test, a statistic power (1-beta) of 0.80 and alpha type I error&#xD;
      probability of 0.05.&#xD;
