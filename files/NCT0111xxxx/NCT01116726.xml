    <textblock>
      A program of motivational interviewing plus enhanced community services in prevention of&#xD;
      early childhood caries vs. enhanced community services alone for American Indian mothers and&#xD;
      their children will reduce the childrens' decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces measure&#xD;
      over a 3-year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six hundred mothers and their children will&#xD;
      be randomized over a 2-year period to motivational interviewing (MI) plus enhanced community&#xD;
      services vs. enhanced community services alone in equal numbers in the 2 groups. The MI&#xD;
      sessions will involve home visits concentrating on the mitigation of behavioral risk factors&#xD;
      for early childhood caries (ECC), shortly after childbirth and at 6, 12, and 18 months. The&#xD;
      enhanced community services will involve development of culturally appropriate messages&#xD;
      related to the mitigation of risk factors for ECC through public announcements and simple&#xD;
      brochures. The primary outcome measure will be decayed, missing, and filled tooth surfaces&#xD;
      (dmfs) of the children at ages 1, 2, and 3. Secondary outcomes will include children's ds, %&#xD;
      with dmfs and ds &gt;0, mother's dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, caries patterns,&#xD;
      and costs.&#xD;
