      asthma or bronchiectasis.&#xD;

      This study will assess the safety of a new study drug called DAS181 (Fludase速). This study is&#xD;
      being done with NexBio, Inc., the company that makes DAS181 (Fludase速). DAS181 is not&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however the FDA has given permission to&#xD;
      use DAS181 in human studies. To date, DAS181 has been given to about 81 healthy people and&#xD;
      has been well tolerated with no reported serious adverse reactions. This is the first&#xD;
      experimental study to test if it is safe to use this drug in people with well-controlled&#xD;
      asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is not being given to treat asthma or bronchiectasis, but to&#xD;
      learn if it is safe to use in people with well-controlled asthma or bronchiectasis. DAS181 is&#xD;
      being developed as a medication to prevent and treat infections due to common respiratory&#xD;
      viruses like influenza (including the pandemic H1N1 strain), parainfluenza, and other&#xD;
      viruses. New drugs to treat respiratory viruses are needed because some currently available&#xD;
      drugs are not effective against some types or strains of viruses. Drugs that are effective&#xD;
      against respiratory viruses are especially important for people with asthma or bronchiectasis&#xD;
      because these lung conditions increase the risk of serious complications due to respiratory&#xD;
      virus infections. Making sure the new drug is safe in people with asthma or bronchiectasis is&#xD;
      important because people with these lung conditions may have different side effects from a&#xD;
      drug than people who don't have asthma or bronchiectasis. We plan to enroll 24 volunteers&#xD;
      into the study: 12 persons with well-controlled asthma and 12 persons with bronchiectasis.&#xD;
