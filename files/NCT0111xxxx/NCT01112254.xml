  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a frequent disease, concerning more than 15% of all breast&#xD;
      carcinomas in France. Frequency increases due to breast screening programs. Breast&#xD;
      conservative treatment can be done for limited lesions. Complete pathological excision with&#xD;
      safe surgical margins is the main factor of success rate for conservative treatment. But safe&#xD;
      surgical margins are not always obtained in the first surgery because preoperative or&#xD;
      peroperative evaluation of the extent of the lesions is difficult. A 20 to 38% rate of&#xD;
      involved margins is reported in the literature, implying a second surgery. MRI is not&#xD;
      commonly performed today in the preoperative staging of DCIS, despite interesting results of&#xD;
      breast MRI in DCIS evaluation published recently in a German study (Kuhl, Lancet 2007).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, this retrospective study focused on a population of high-risk women (BRCA1-2&#xD;
      mutation carriers, family history of breast cancer…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional suspicious lesions detected by MRI require MRI-guided or CT-guided biopsy as they&#xD;
      are not detectable with mammography or ultrasound. Moreover, intraoperative pathological&#xD;
      analysis cannot be performed in DCIS and surgical strategy will be different for a unique&#xD;
      lesion (lumpectomy) or multiple/large lesions (mastectomy). If surgery is adapted according&#xD;
      to MRI and biopsy results, we can assume that the entire lesion could be removed in a single&#xD;
      operation, avoiding re-excisions, anxiety and reducing the costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this protocol is to evaluate the value of MRI+biopsy in the staging of&#xD;
      mammography-detected DCIS in an unselected population of women. It is a multicentric,&#xD;
      randomised study including patients from France presenting a unique, limited (&lt; 30 mm) DCIS&#xD;
      detected by mammography or breast ultrasound. The two compared arms are: preoperative breast&#xD;
      MRI+biopsy versus no additional diagnostic examination. High resolution dynamic 3D images&#xD;
      will be obtained in order to detect very small suspicious lesions, typical of DCIS. The main&#xD;
      endpoint is the re-excision rate for involved margins. In order to show a reduction of 50% of&#xD;
      the rate of second surgery (from 25% to 12.5% in the MRI arm), it is necessary to include 360&#xD;
      patients (bilateral test, alpha=5%, power=80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-effective study will be performed. The costs likely to differ between the two arms&#xD;
      (MRI, biopsy, outpatient visits, hospitalisations, transportation, and sick leaves) will be&#xD;
      assessed using data collected in the trial. The endpoint of the cost-effectiveness study will&#xD;
      be the cost by success (cost-effectiveness ratio). A success is defined as achieving&#xD;
      margin-negative resection after initial surgery (no need for re-excision). The other&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will be to determine the rate of initial mastectomy and to describe MRI&#xD;
      morphologic features in the MRI+biopsy arm.&#xD;
