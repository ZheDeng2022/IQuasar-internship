    <textblock>
      In current obstetric anesthesia practice, epidural analgesia is the most effective technique&#xD;
      to control labor pain for those women who request pain-free delivery. Epidural analgesia not&#xD;
      only allows us to obtain greater pain relief and increased satisfaction of mothers, but also&#xD;
      permits us to convert it to regional anesthesia in case of operative delivery, avoiding&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major concerns with epidural anesthesia in labor setting is the inability to&#xD;
      produce an intensive analgesia or adequate level to proceed with cesarean section. This study&#xD;
      is designed to examine the hypothesis that 10ml epidural normal saline to reduce rate of&#xD;
      one-side block, low segmental block, and patch block, and improve quality of labor epidural&#xD;
      analgesia/ anesthesia in obstetric population.&#xD;

      One of the major concerns with epidural anesthesia in labor setting is the inability to&#xD;
      produce an intensive analgesia or adequate level to proceed with cesarean section. The&#xD;
      incidence of this event is rather various among reports, reflecting variability in&#xD;
      definitions, authors' clinical judgment and perception, practice parameters, hospital&#xD;
      settings. In most of related studies, the term of incomplete block was used and defined as&#xD;
      (1) unilateral block; (2) unblocked sacral segments; (3) low level; (4) unblocked segments or&#xD;
      a patchy block. 1Reported incidence of inadequate analgesia/anesthesia was 18% to 31.8%. In&#xD;
      addition, the reported incidence of intraoperative discomfort/visceral pain was from 10% to&#xD;
      56%.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the anesthesia/analgesia is not adequate, other treatment modalities have to be provided&#xD;
      to improve pain relief, these include intravenous narcotics or ketamine, replacements of&#xD;
      epidural catheter, or general anesthesia, the risks of complications may be increased by&#xD;
      those managements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology and mechanisms of failed or dysfunctional epidural analgesia or anesthesia in&#xD;
      obstetrics are complex, multifactorial, and not entirely understood. Depending on the&#xD;
      situation, the causes might be evident or puzzling and difficult to explain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of fluid is frequently used for identification of the epidural space by the&#xD;
      loss-of-resistance (LOR) technique. It has been shown that different volumes of saline may&#xD;
      affect the subsequent epidural analgesia. Iwama showed that using 10 mL of saline as compared&#xD;
      to two mL in patients undergoing elective surgery during lumbar epidural anesthesia with 2%&#xD;
      mepivacaine resulted in a greater extent of anesthesia.2 Also, Okutomi et al examined the&#xD;
      effect of saline volume on anesthetic levels and quality of thoracic epidural block in&#xD;
      patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery. They demonstrated that the block level for cold&#xD;
      after mepivacaine 1.5% was proportional to the saline volume injected, whereas the block&#xD;
      level for pain was independent of the saline solution.3 Identifying the epidural space by a&#xD;
      lost of resistance to air method is thought to increase the incidence of inadequate&#xD;
      anesthesia. A randomized study, comparing air versus saline to identify the epidural space in&#xD;
      parturients, found a higher incidence of inadequate analgesia in the air group (36% versus&#xD;
      19%).4&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parturients requesting epidural analgesia, a few studies showed that 2- 10ml normal saline&#xD;
      giving to epidural space after LOR was obtained reduced the rate of venous puncture and&#xD;
      unblock segments to cold and pin prick, but did not improve the visual analog pain scale or&#xD;
      reduced the need for supplemental.3,5,6 No study on improvement of unilateral block, patch&#xD;
      block and patients' satisfaction in obstetric setting has been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We design this study to examine the hypothesis that 10ml epidural normal saline to reduce&#xD;
      rate of one-side block, low segmental block, and patch block, and improve quality of labor&#xD;
      epidural analgesia/ anesthesia in obstetric population.&#xD;
