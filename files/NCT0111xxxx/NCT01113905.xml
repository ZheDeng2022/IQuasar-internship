  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test whether beta-endorphin, a substance our bodies make in response&#xD;
      to painful and stressful stimuli, plays a causative role in radiation-induced fatigue that&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving radiation therapy commonly experience. If this is so, the&#xD;
      investigators' hope is to direct efforts at treating radiation-induced fatigue using agents&#xD;
      that block the action of beta-endorphin with the aim of improving quality of life for&#xD;
      patients undergoing radiation therapy&#xD;

      Participants will be breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy at Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital. There will be two groups of patients: those receiving adjuvant radiation&#xD;
      therapy alone following surgical tumor resection, and those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiation therapy following surgical tumor resection. Patients receiving any radiation&#xD;
      regimen detailed below in section 2b are eligible for the study. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators will be drawing blood for beta-endorphin measurement prior to, at various times&#xD;
      during, and following patients' treatment regimens. In addition, at each blood draw, patients&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires that assess fatigue, mood, and pain. These questionnaires have&#xD;
      all been validated for use in cancer patients (see &quot;Procedures Involving Human Participants&#xD;
      section below), and for our study, the investigators have formatted them onto computer&#xD;
      tablets for ease of patient completion and data analysis. This study will progress as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Patients expected to receive adjuvant radiation therapy at Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital will be approached for enrollment onto this study. Two groups of patients, a&#xD;
      chemotherapy group and a non-chemotherapy group, will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adjuvant radiation therapy without chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment goal for each group is 50 patients (total of 100 patients for the study). This&#xD;
      calculation is based on the approximate number of 30 patients the investigators will need to&#xD;
      achieve a sensitivity of β-endorphin changes of 5 pM being statistically significant to a&#xD;
      p-value of&lt;0.05 with 95% power. Based in our finding in mice, the investigators expect&#xD;
      β-endorphin levels to vary between individuals, and the investigators have increased sample&#xD;
      size by 70% from our calculations to account for deviations from our β-endorphin levels&#xD;
      estimations. Additionally, the investigators have added patients to account for a number of&#xD;
      patient dropping out of the study, since this is a long trial for patients requiring multiple&#xD;
      blood draws.&#xD;
