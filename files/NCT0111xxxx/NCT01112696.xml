      The purpose of the study is to assess the performance of a new subcutaneous glucose sensor&#xD;
      over a seven-day sensor life when used with currently marketed Medtronic Diabetes devices. In&#xD;
      addition performance will be calculated for use of the new sensor with proposed new devices&#xD;
      using new calibration algorithms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first generation Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor (Sof-Sensor) was&#xD;
      originally approved by the FDA for commercialization as part of the Continuous Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (CGMS) on June 15, 1999 (PMA 980022). The Sensor is composed of a&#xD;
      microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose oxidase beneath several layers of biocompatible&#xD;
      membrane. This same sensor was used as part of subsequent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)&#xD;
      systems, such as the Guardian REAL-Time and Paradigm REAL-Time sensor augmented insulin pump.&#xD;
      The current configuration of sensor has undergone in vitro and in vivo testing. A new&#xD;
      second-generation glucose sensor (herein referred to as the Comfort Sensor) has been&#xD;
      developed. The first-generation glucose sensor was approved with reported sensor accuracy&#xD;
      (MAD) of 18%; it was labeled for a maximum use duration of 72 hours, using only the abdomen&#xD;
      as an insertion site. The new sensor is shorter and has a smaller diameter, with a smaller&#xD;
      gauge introducer needle. The new sensor inserter is designed to be used with the new sensor.&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to 1) Assess performance of the Comfort Sensor when used&#xD;
      over a period of seven days with currently available devices, and 2) Assess performance of&#xD;
      the Comfort Sensor when used over a period of seven days using new calibration algorithms&#xD;
      (post-processed with algorithm for future devices). Accuracy data will be calculated based on&#xD;
      comparing calibrated glucose sensor values to a &quot;gold standard&quot; (YSI plasma glucose values)&#xD;
      in adult subjects during in-clinic testing, and on comparing calibrated glucose sensor values&#xD;
      to glucose meter values during in-home testing. The devices that will be used for gathering&#xD;
      sensor data during this study will be: 1) the Comfort Sensor, 2) the MiniLink (Transmitter),&#xD;
      3) the Guardian REAL-Time Display Device and 4) the CGMS iPro.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Days one through six of sensor use</time_frame>
    <description>The primary accuracy parameter (primary effectiveness endpoint) was the comparative readings of paired sensor and YSI glucose readings, measured on days 1 through 6. Accuracy is defined as within 20% agreement between YSI and paired sensor (within 20 mg/dL if YSI &lt;80 mg/dL). Accuracy ranges from 0 - 100, with higher number suggests better accuracy.</description>

    <description>Device related moderate adverse event: low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but is usually improved by simple therapeutic remedy.&#xD;
Device related severe adverse event: interrupts a subject's daily activity and typically requires intervening treatment.&#xD;
Note: device related determination is made by the site that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the device.</description>
