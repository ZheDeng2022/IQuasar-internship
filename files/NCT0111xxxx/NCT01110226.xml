  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I Clinical Trial. Phase I studies are designed to determine the amount of&#xD;
      investigational drugs that can be safely tolerated and to define the side effects that limit&#xD;
      the dose. The drug administered in this study is KML-001. It is a highly soluble, orally&#xD;
      available arsenic agent. It is currently being tested to determine its effects on telomerase&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, the purpose of this research study is to find the highest dose of KML001,&#xD;
      that can be given without causing severe side effects when it is combined with a standard,&#xD;
      commercially available anti-cancer drug called cisplatin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Telomerase is the enzyme synthesizing the specific DNA sequences found at the telomeres in&#xD;
      the body's chromosomes. It is thus responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres.&#xD;
      Telomerase has been detected in human cancer cells and is found to be 10-20 times more active&#xD;
      than in normal body cells. This provides a selective growth advantage to many types of&#xD;
      tumors. If telomerase activity was to be turned off, then telomeres in cancer cells would&#xD;
      shorten, just like they do in normal body cells. This would prevent the cancer cells from&#xD;
      dividing uncontrollably in their early stages of development. In the event that a tumor has&#xD;
      already thoroughly developed, it may be removed and anti-telomerase therapy could be&#xD;
      administered to prevent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being offered to patients with advanced cancer which has either no standard&#xD;
      therapy or which has progressed after treatment with one or more standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of KML001 in combination with cisplatin in patients&#xD;
      with advanced malignancy. This objective has been met. The study will be reopened with&#xD;
      expansion cohorts in advanced small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer to better&#xD;
      assess the activity of the combination, pending (Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the pharmacokinetics of KML001 and cisplatin in this combination. To assess the&#xD;
      response rate, disease-free survival and survival associated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate indications of patient benefit (response or stable disease) with pretreatment&#xD;
      specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest safest doses are determined by increasing the doses of cisplatin and KML001 in&#xD;
      successive groups of patients until at least some of them have serious side effects. All&#xD;
      patients on this study will receive the same dose of cisplatin, which is known to have&#xD;
      antitumor effects. The doses of KML001 will be increased in successive groups of patients. It&#xD;
      is possible that those entering the study early may receive suboptimal doses of KML001. At&#xD;
      the end of the study we hope to determine the appropriate dose of the KML001 in combination&#xD;
      with cisplatin, learn about its side effects and understand how the body metabolizes the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data from the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center (UMGCC) has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the combination of KML001 and cisplatin is synergistic in lung cancer cell&#xD;
      lines. Cisplatin is the best established agent for the treatment of lung cancer and most&#xD;
      treatment regimens have been established with cisplatin (or its congener, carboplatin). This&#xD;
      synergism is particularly interesting given that there is an anti-telomere effect for&#xD;
      cisplatin.&#xD;
