  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of blood plasma levels of methylphenidate in healthy volunteers over a 24&#xD;
      hour period after they take this medication.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the blood plasma concentrations of methylphenidate in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers for 24 hours after they take three different long acting methylphenidate&#xD;
      products. This is a single-centre, randomized (subjects will be assigned a treatment sequence&#xD;
      based on chance), open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention),&#xD;
      single-dose, three-way crossover study (participants may receive different interventions&#xD;
      sequentially during the trial) in 30 healthy adult volunteers. Study drug will be taken by&#xD;
      mouth with 240mL of room temperature noncarbonated water. Blood sampling will be done via&#xD;
      indwelling catheter at pre dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11,&#xD;
      12, 14, 16, 20 and 24 hours post dose. An indwelling venous catheter is put in place for the&#xD;
      24 hour period to minimize the discomfort of frequent blood sampling. Each patient will&#xD;
      receive one dose of each treatment under study in a specific sequence and at specified&#xD;
      timepoints. The treatments are: one 54mg Concerta tablet, one 54 mg Novo-methylphenidate ER-C&#xD;
      tablet, and 3x20mg Ritalin-SR tablets. The methylphenidate plasma concentrations observed&#xD;
      during the 24 hour post-dose time period will be compared for each volunteer and across all&#xD;
      volunteers. Adverse events will be monitored from the time the informed consent is signed&#xD;
      until the patient completes the last study-related procedure. The investigator must follow&#xD;
      all adverse events reported to the investigator to satisfactory resolution or until reaching&#xD;
      a clinically stable endpoint. Vital signs will be taken at study entry and before each dose -&#xD;
      as well as at specific timepoints over the 24 hour sample period. Clinical labs and EKG will&#xD;
      be done at screening and at each 24 hour timepoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The official study title is as follows: A Randomized, Open-label, Single-dose, Three-way&#xD;
      Crossover Study to Determine the Relative Pharmacokinetic Profile of Oral Doses of CONCERTA&#xD;
      Tablets, Ritalin-SR Tablets and Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C Tablets Under Fasted Condition in&#xD;
      Healthy Subjects. Methylphenidate is indicated for the treatment of attention deficient&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder in adults, adolescents and children. Each volunteer will receive one&#xD;
      54-mg CONCERTA tablet(once), one 54-mg Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C tablet (once) and three 20mg&#xD;
      Ritalin-SR tablets (once) at specified time points in the study. Tablets will be administered&#xD;
      as a single oral dose under fasted (minimum 10 hour fast) conditions. Study drug will be&#xD;
      administered orally with 240 mL of room temperature noncarbonated water.&#xD;
