    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this cluster randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      effectiveness between a combined implementation strategy and an educational strategy on the&#xD;
      implementation of a community occupational therapy program for clients with dementia and&#xD;
      their primary caregivers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is associated with a major decrease in quality of life of clients and their&#xD;
      caregivers and a major driver of costs in health care. Recently, evidence was found for the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a community-based occupational therapy (OT)&#xD;
      intervention for older adults with dementia and their caregivers (COTiD program). This&#xD;
      intervention resulted in significant improvements in both clients' and caregivers' daily&#xD;
      functioning, quality of life, mood and health status. In addition, caregivers experienced an&#xD;
      increased sense of competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently occupational therapists (OTs) are trained in using the program during a 3-day&#xD;
      course. In a pilot implementation study it was found that this course was not effective&#xD;
      enough as only 20% of the OTs actually used the COTiD program in practice because of a lack&#xD;
      of implementation skills, feedback and organisational barriers. In order to increase the use&#xD;
      of this program and increase the quality of care a new implementation strategy is developed.&#xD;
      This combined implementation strategy provides the OTs with two implementation training days,&#xD;
      coaching on the job, regional meetings, discussion platform, web-based registration system&#xD;
      and newsletters. In addition physicians and managers are provided with extra information on&#xD;
      the COTiD program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is designed primarily to evaluate the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the difference in adherence to the community OT guideline in dementia between&#xD;
           OTs receiving the combined implementation strategy and OTs receiving the educational&#xD;
           strategy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the difference in community OT use(referral rate + actual provision of OT)&#xD;
           between clusters provided with the combined implementation strategy and clusters&#xD;
           provided with the educational strategy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the difference in cost-effectiveness between the combined implementation&#xD;
           strategy and the educational strategy with regard to adherence of OTs to the community&#xD;
           OT guideline?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the effect of the implementation strategies on patient and caregiver outcomes&#xD;
      will also be measured.&#xD;
