  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, such as gastric, biliary, or&#xD;
      pancreatic carcinoma, present with metastatic disease, and have an extremely poor survival,&#xD;
      irrespective the type of treatment modality. The aim of the current monocentric phase II&#xD;
      study is to evaluate in these patients the effectiveness of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) plus&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy with cisplatin (HIPC). The study is&#xD;
      designed to have at least 80% power to detect a 40% increase in 1-year overall survival&#xD;
      common to all strata (gastric-biliary-pancreas) after CRS+HIPC. Over an anticipated period of&#xD;
      2 years, 60 patients will undergo CRS + HIPC. Translational research will quantify&#xD;
      perioperative circulating and peritoneal tumour cells, based on real-time RT-PCR for CEA and&#xD;
      EpCAM. Plasma concentration of cytokines will be determined for IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-γ, and VEGF at several time-points. Systemic immunological&#xD;
      changes will be assessed by flow cytometric quantification of the relative proportions and&#xD;
      absolute numbers of B- and T-lymphocytes, NK cells, effector T cells, HLA-DR+ T cells, and&#xD;
      regulatory T cells. Gene-expression studies will be performed using Affymetrix HG U133 Plus&#xD;
      2.0 arrays on primary and metastatic tissue samples.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Tumours located in the body or tail of the pancreas are treated by resection or LAT of&#xD;
           90°C&#xD;

&#xD;
           o Liver metastases&#xD;

           dissolved in 3 litres of normal saline heated to less than 41° Celsius and infused into&#xD;
           the abdominal cavity for a sustained hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for 60&#xD;
           minutes. Surgical reconstruction (anastomoses) is performed after HIPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perioperative quantification of peritoneal and circulating tumour cells&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Real-time qRT-PCR based on detection and quantification of CEA and EpCAM mRNA&#xD;
                transcripts&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood samples will be studied before and at&#xD;
                the end of surgical procedure (CRS+HIPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peritoneal tumour cells will be evaluated in lavage fluid at the start of surgery&#xD;
                (before any manipulation) and at the end of CRS+HIPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perioperative systemic cytokine profiles and lymphocyte immunophenotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Plasma concentration of cytokines will be determined using the BDTM Cytometric Bead&#xD;
                Array (CBA): IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-γ, and VEGF&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The relative proportions and absolute numbers B-lymphocytes (CD19+), T-lymphocytes&#xD;
                (CD3+), NK cells (CD56+CD3-), effector T cells (CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+), HLA-DR+ T&#xD;
                cells (CD3+HLA-DR+) and regulatory T cells (CD3+CD4+25+127low) will be quantified&#xD;
                with flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time-points for cytokine and immunophenotyping analyses: before surgery (d-1), at&#xD;
                the end of surgery (d0), day after (d1) and at day 7 following CRS+HIPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gene-expression of primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To better understand cancer biology and search for novel diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
                targets, fresh tissue samples from the primary tumour and from metastases will be&#xD;
                stored in RNA-later for RNA-extraction and future analyses. Hereto, samples&#xD;
                obtained from biliary, gastric, and pancreatic cancer tissue will be stored. Based&#xD;
                on the fact that pancreatic cancer is associated with the worst prognosis, and&#xD;
                based on our ongoing research on this disease, gene expression studies in the&#xD;
                current project will be focused on pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In close collaboration with the department of pathology, we have stored snap-frozen&#xD;
                tissue samples from surgically resected human pancreatic cancer for future&#xD;
                research. Clinical, histopathological, and survival data of over 200 patients are&#xD;
                registered in our database. Tissue samples (primary and metastases) from the&#xD;
                current study will be analysed together with available 96 primary tumour samples&#xD;
                that have already been controlled to be representative for high quality RNA&#xD;
                studies. These samples are obtained from patients with early and advanced localized&#xD;
                pancreatic cancer in various tumour stages. Gene-expression studies will be&#xD;
                performed using Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 arrays on primary and metastatic tissue&#xD;
                samples. These experiments will be conducted in close collaboration with the&#xD;
                microarray facility of VIB at KUL.&#xD;
