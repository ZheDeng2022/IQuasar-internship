  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, remarkable advances in medical oncology, surgery, and radiology have allowed&#xD;
      for increasing cure rates for childhood malignancies. This success has led to an emerging&#xD;
      understanding of the kinds of effects that treatments can have on the pediatric population&#xD;
      and how such effects can influence pediatric cancer survivor's functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life. It has become tremendously important to assess the long-term complications due to&#xD;
      therapy in this growing sector of survivors and to tailor our treatments so as to minimize&#xD;
      these late effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators at MGH are committed to improving the delivery of radiotherapy to our&#xD;
      patients and improving the outcome for these patients. MGH has an on-site cyclotron for&#xD;
      proton radiotherapy in order to provide the most advanced care for patients in need. Proton&#xD;
      therapy possesses a clinical advantage over standard photon therapy in that its optimal dose&#xD;
      distribution delivers the bulk of radiation to the tumor site. This method spares the&#xD;
      greatest volume of normal tissue, resulting in decreased short-term and long-term morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through open pediatric protocols for patients treated with proton radiotherapy, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to define and report the acute and late effects associated with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also treat a number of patients off-protocol with both proton and photon&#xD;
      radiotherapy, and are interested in reporting these patients' QOL outcomes in conjunction&#xD;
      with other clinical data that may be pertinent to the site of tumor treatment. This research&#xD;
      is significant in that it will allow us to delineate the positive and negative effects of&#xD;
      radiation treatment on patients' QOL, highlighting points of success and exposing areas that&#xD;
      are in need of improvement. Such knowledge will be used to improve the experience of&#xD;
      pediatric cancer survivors in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are: 1) to prospectively collect and report the QOL outcomes in&#xD;
      patients treated with radiotherapy and 2) to correlate the QOL data with pertinent clinical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
