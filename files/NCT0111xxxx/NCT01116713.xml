  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most common complications after&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery. Women undergoing mastectomy with axillary dissection are at a&#xD;
      particularly high risk for the development of PONV and an incidence of 60-80% in patients&#xD;
      receiving no antiemetic has been reported. Emetic episodes predispose to aspiration of&#xD;
      gastric contents, wound dehiscence, psychological distress, and delayed recovery and&#xD;
      discharge times. These justify the use of prophylactic antiemetics in women scheduled for&#xD;
      mastectomy. Most of the currently used antiemetics, including antihistamines, butyrophenones&#xD;
      and dopamine receptor antagonists have been reported to cause occasional undesirable adverse&#xD;
      effects, such as excessive sedation, hypotension, dry mouth, dysphoria, hallucinations and&#xD;
      extrapyramidal signs. Antiserotonins (e.g., ondansetron) are available for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of PONV in patients undergoing various types of surgery [4]. However, the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic antiemetic therapy with antiserotonins has been criticized for being too&#xD;
      expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone was first reported to be an effective antiemetic regimen in patients receiving&#xD;
      cancer chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment for&#xD;
      reducing pain and PONV as well as analgesic and antiemetic requirements in women undergoing&#xD;
      general anesthesia for mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant neoplasm worldwide. In emerging countries such&#xD;
      as Mexico, there has been an increase in its frequency and mortality [1, 2] and it is the&#xD;
      second most frequent neoplasm after cervical carcinoma. Between 25,000 and 30,000 new cases&#xD;
      are diagnosed annually. Unfortunately, only a few women have regular mammography screening so&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with locally advanced disease at diagnosis is high. In 2003, only&#xD;
      5-10% of newly diagnosed cases in Mexico were clinical stages 0 or I [2]. Surgical resection&#xD;
      with axillary lymph node dissection constitutes the treatment of choice associated with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy and postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting (PONV) are the most common complications after&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery. Women undergoing mastectomy with axillary dissection are at a&#xD;
      particularly high risk for the development of PONV and an incidence of 60-80% in patients&#xD;
      receiving no antiemetic has been reported. Emetic episodes predispose to aspiration of&#xD;
      gastric contents, wound dehiscence, psychological distress, and delayed recovery and&#xD;
      discharge times. These justify the use of prophylactic antiemetics in women scheduled for&#xD;
      mastectomy. Most of the currently used antiemetics, including antihistamines, butyrophenones&#xD;
      and dopamine receptor antagonists have been reported to cause occasional undesirable adverse&#xD;
      effects, such as excessive sedation, hypotension, dry mouth, dysphoria, hallucinations and&#xD;
      extrapyramidal signs. Antiserotonins (e.g., ondansetron) are available for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of PONV in patients undergoing various types of surgery. However, the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic antiemetic therapy with antiserotonins has been criticized for being too&#xD;
      expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone was first reported to be an effective antiemetic regimen in patients receiving&#xD;
      cancer chemotherapy. Some authors have reviewed the available randomized trials (1996-2001)&#xD;
      regarding perioperative single-dose steroid administration and found that dexamethasone had&#xD;
      antiemetic and analgesic effects in various types of operations. One ot this studies&#xD;
      demostrated that intravenous dexamethasone at 4 mg was effective for the prevention of PONV&#xD;
      following breast surgery but they could not demonstrate any difference in postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment for&#xD;
      reducing pain and PONV as well as analgesic and antiemetic requirements in women undergoing&#xD;
      general anesthesia for mastectomy with axillary node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Patients Between June and August 2009, 70 patients undergoing mastectomy&#xD;
      with axillary dissection were studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous dexamethasone (8 mg) or homologated&#xD;
      placebo 60 minutes before skin incision, using an equal number of blinded envelopes. Patients&#xD;
      of American Society of Anesthesiologists classes III and IV were excluded. Further exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were age more than 80 years; pregnancy; active menstruation; treatment with&#xD;
      steroids; severe diabetes mellitus (serum HbA1c &gt; 8%); use of opioids, sedatives or any kind&#xD;
      of analgesics less than one week before mastectomy, or a history of alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
      Patients with any history of motion sickness and ‚ÅÑor previous PONV after any surgical&#xD;
      procedure were excluded. All patients were admitted to the hospital one day before the&#xD;
      operation and were followed from hospital admission until 30 days after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure to detect any medical or surgical morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and surgery All patients underwent a standardized general anesthesia procedure and&#xD;
      none of them received any preanesthetic medication. Induction used intravenous propofol (2&#xD;
      mg/kg body weight) and fentanyl (3-5 mcg/kg). Vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg) was used to&#xD;
      facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 2-3% sevoflurane and 66%&#xD;
      nitrous oxide in oxygen. Ventilation was controlled mechanically and maintained constant&#xD;
      throughout surgery using an anesthetic and respiratory gas analyzer for monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were monitored with indirect determinations of arterial pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      using standard techniques, as well as the expired CO2 content and oxygen blood saturation.&#xD;
      Afterwards, all patients were extubated and transferred to the immediate postsurgical care&#xD;
      unit with cardiovascular and oxygen monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures All patients were treated according to the preoperative clinical stage&#xD;
      with radical mastectomy or breast conservative surgery with lymph node axillary dissection by&#xD;
      the same surgical team. In all patients, closed suction drains were placed in the region&#xD;
      subjected to surgery and were removed during the following days. Chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
      radiotherapy were administered 3-4 weeks after uncomplicated surgical resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesia and antiemetic therapies Pain was assessed immediately on return to the recovery&#xD;
      room and at 6, 12 and 24 h after the operation using a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 = no&#xD;
      pain to 10 = most severe pain). Analgesia was given as intravenous sodium ketorolac (30 mg&#xD;
      every 8 hours) and intravenous tramadol infusion (50 mg) was used as a backup analgesic&#xD;
      medication. The incidence of PONV was recorded immediately on return to the recovery room and&#xD;
      at 6, 12 and 24 h after the operation, using a three point ordinal scale (0 = none, 1 =&#xD;
      nausea, 2 = retching, 3 = vomiting). Nausea was defined as a subjectively unpleasant&#xD;
      sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit, retching was defined as the&#xD;
      labored, spasmodic, rhythmic contraction of the respiratory muscles without the expulsion of&#xD;
      gastric contents, and vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents from&#xD;
      the mouth. Intravenous ondansetron (4-8 mg) was given for antiemetic treatment on demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and statistical analysis Postoperative complications were recorded during&#xD;
      hospitalization and the patients were followed up to 30 days after discharge. Additional data&#xD;
      collected included patient age, body mass index (BMI), any history of smoking and neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, anesthesia and operation time and the frequency of use of analgesic and&#xD;
      antiemetic drugs. These parameters were summed and compared between the dexamethasone and&#xD;
      placebo groups.The study endpoints were postoperative nausea and vomiting, and pain measured&#xD;
      by the VAS and the need for additional analgesic and antiemetic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was predetermined. We expected a 35% difference in the incidence of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting between groups. The alpha error was set at 0.05 and beta error at 0.20; n = 35&#xD;
      patients for each group was considered adequate, according to a power analysis. Results are&#xD;
      expressed as percentages and as the mean ¬± standard deviation (SD). Student's t test, the&#xD;
      Chi-squared test or Fisher's Exact Test were used for the analysis of quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data, respectively. Differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki of 1989 and the Mexican Health Guidelines. The Ethical and Research Committees of&#xD;
      the Oncologic Institute, approved all protocols. Full, written informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from all patients before their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
