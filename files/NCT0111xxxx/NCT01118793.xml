    <textblock>
      This is a Scripps pilot study on the effect of high clopidogrel maintenance dosing and its&#xD;
      relationship to cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphism status [STSI/CTSA].&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When added to aspirin, clopidogrel at a routine dose of 75 mg daily reduces the incidence of&#xD;
      thrombotic vascular adverse events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and those&#xD;
      undergoing percutaneous interventions (PCI). The observation that many patients have less&#xD;
      than expected platelet inhibition with clopidogrel has given rise to the concept of&#xD;
      clopidogrel resistance. Clopidogrel resistance is associated with increased adverse events&#xD;
      such as stent thrombosis, post-stent ischemic events and periprocedural myocardial&#xD;
      infarctions. Some patients can overcome the resistance with increasing the dose of&#xD;
      clopidogrel. A higher maintenance dose (150 mg daily) in patients undergoing PCI results in&#xD;
      superior platelet inhibition and may reduce cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel is a&#xD;
      thienopyridine prodrug, which is converted to its active metabolite by several enzymes of the&#xD;
      P450 family, including CYP2C19. The loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 (681 G&gt;A) single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP), occurring as either a hetero- or homozygous allele, reduces the&#xD;
      conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. Two recent studies have shown an&#xD;
      association between CYP2C19*2 polymorphism and lack of platelet inhibition with clopidogrel.&#xD;
      These studies included healthy volunteers and patients undergoing elective PCI and&#xD;
      demonstrated a prevalence of the CYP2C19*2 allele of 25-30%. Platelet inhibition was not&#xD;
      affected by clopidogrel in those who carried the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is the following: Patients who are carriers of the loss-of-function CYP2C19*2&#xD;
      allele (heterozygous 1*/2* or homozygous 2*/2*) have decreased platelet inhibition on&#xD;
      clopidogrel which cannot be overcome with increasing the maintenance dose from 75 mg to 150&#xD;
      mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim will include an evaluation of the anti-platelet response of a higher&#xD;
      maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg /daily) in patients who are resistant to the usual&#xD;
      dose (75 mg/daily) and are either carriers or non-carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will be a single center, prospective, observational pilot study. We will&#xD;
      screen and enroll patients who are followed at Scripps Clinic and on chronic clopidogrel&#xD;
      therapy. All patients will be eligible. A blood sample will be collected to perform DNA&#xD;
      extraction and genotyping for the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism. Platelet function assays will be&#xD;
      performed using VerifyNow point-of-care assay. We will recruit 60 patients with high platelet&#xD;
      reactivity (PRU &gt; 230): 30 wild-types (normal) and 30 carriers (heterozygous or homozygous)&#xD;
      of the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism. These patients will be given 150 mg of clopidogrel for 1 week,&#xD;
      at which time the platelet assay will be repeated. At that time, patients will be counseled&#xD;
      by the study physicians regarding the potential risks and benefits of continuing to receive&#xD;
      150 mg of clopidogrel per day versus returning to the FDA approved dose of 75 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate objective is to evaluate the possibility of overcoming clopidogrel resistance&#xD;
      in carriers of CYP2C19*2 with a higher maintenance dose. The long term objective is to&#xD;
      improve patient care and outcomes using personalized medicine based on the individual's&#xD;
      genotype.&#xD;
