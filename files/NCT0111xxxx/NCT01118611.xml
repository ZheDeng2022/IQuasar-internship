      RATIONALE: Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A (GSK1070916A) may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of GSK1070916A in&#xD;
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine and establish the safety profile of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A&#xD;
           and define the dose-limiting toxicity in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters following administration of Aurora&#xD;
           B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tumor response after at least 1 cycle of treatment with Aurora B/C kinase&#xD;
           inhibitor GSK1070916A in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To propose a safe dose for Phase II evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effects of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A on markers of&#xD;
           mitosis/cell proliferation and apoptosis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the metabolism of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A IV over 1 hour once daily on days&#xD;
      1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive escalating doses of Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A until the&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD has been defined, 15-18 additional&#xD;
      patients are recruited for an expanded MTD cohort in which patients receive Aurora B/C kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor GSK1070916A at the MTD. Patients at the expanded MTD cohort must consent to have&#xD;
      either tumor biopsies taken or FDG-PET/CT and DW-MRI scans performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may undergo tissue, blood, and urine sample collection periodically for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other correlative laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception&#xD;
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with&#xD;
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception&#xD;
             (e.g. condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. History of cardiac ischaemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary angioplasty or stenting in&#xD;
             the previous 12 months. Patients currently on medication for cardiac arrhythmias are&#xD;
             also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%. A multi-gated&#xD;

&#xD;
        4.1.3 Additional inclusion / exclusion criteria for expanded MTD cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Once tolerability has been confirmed in the initial three to six patients of the MTD,&#xD;
        further patients in this expanded cohort must either consent to have tumour biopsies taken&#xD;
        or having FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI scans performed. The minimum number of patients&#xD;
        required in each part of the expansion cohort is six. The following additional inclusion /&#xD;
        exclusion criteria will apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients consenting to tumour biopsies:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Additional written (signed and dated) informed consent for tumour biopsies must be&#xD;
             given.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient&quot;s tumour should be amenable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For patients consenting to FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Additional written (signed and dated) informed consent for FDG PET-CT and DW/DCE-MRI&#xD;
             scans must be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with diabetes must have their condition under good control (blood sugar less&#xD;
             than 10mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to tolerate / comply with imaging protocol (i.e. patients with&#xD;
             high levels of pain, urinary incontinence, or claustrophobia etc should be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with tumours known to be poorly FDG avid (e.g. mucinous adenocarcinoma, well&#xD;
             differentiated neuroendocrine or hepatocellular carcinoma) or falsely negative (e.g.&#xD;
             all tumours less than 5-6mm) are excluded. Refer to Appendix 7 for full list of&#xD;
             excluded tumours.&#xD;
