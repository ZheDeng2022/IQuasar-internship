  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to compare the acute safety and long term outcomes&#xD;
      between hospitals with cardiac surgery on-site (SOS hospitals) and hospitals without cardiac&#xD;
      surgery on-site (non-SOS hospitals) for patients with ischemic heart disease treated with&#xD;
      elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (stable angina, acute coronary syndrome, or&#xD;
      non-Q wave MI) presenting to non-SOS hospitals.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MASS COMM trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled two-arm trial of&#xD;
      PCI performed at non-SOS hospitals (non-SOS-PCI arm) versus PCI performed at SOS hospitals&#xD;
      (SOS-PCI arm). The trial is designed to reject the null-hypothesis of inferiority, and&#xD;
      thereby show the non-inferiority of the non-SOS-PCI arm to the SOS-PCI arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, 3690 subjects will be enrolled in a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT), in which eligible subjects will be consented and randomized in a 3:1 ratio at the&#xD;
      non-SOS hospitals for PCI to be performed at either the enrolling non-SOS hospital (3 chances&#xD;
      out of 4) or a corresponding SOS hospital (1 chance out of 4).&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Any target vessel has evidence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  excessive thrombus (e.g. requires target vessel thrombectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  tortuousity (greater than 60 degree angle) that makes it unsuitable for proper&#xD;
                  stent delivery and deployment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  heavy calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any target lesion requires treatment with a device other than percutaneous&#xD;
             transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) prior to stent placement (e.g. but not&#xD;
             limited to, directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Any lesion that is located in a saphenous vein graft, however, lesions located within&#xD;
             the native vessel but accessed through the graft are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The target vessel is in a &quot;last remaining&quot; epicardial vessel (e.g. greater than 2&#xD;
             non-target epicardial vessels and the bypass grafts to these territories [if present]&#xD;
             are totally occluded).&#xD;
