  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori colonises an estimated 50% of the world´s population (Taylor &amp; Blaser,&#xD;
      1991; Go, 2002). Despite clear clinical guidelines on the treatment of this infection&#xD;
      (Malfertheiner et al. 2007) there is a drive to find alternative ways to control this&#xD;
      infection in a wider perspective without the complications of induction of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance in the pathogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L. reuteri has been widely studied in clinical trials and has been shown to have probiotic,&#xD;
      health-promoting effects in both adults and children (Connolly 2004; Casas &amp; Dobrogosz,&#xD;
      2000). L. reuteri has been shown in numerous studies to be safe for human consumption and it&#xD;
      has been shown to colonise the human gastrointestinal tract (Wolf et al., 1995, Valeur et&#xD;
      al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using supplementation with L. reuteri in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic H.&#xD;
      pylori-infected subjects show a clear reduction of infection load after 4 weeks of use and&#xD;
      this was concomitant with a reduction in symptoms associated with the infection (Imase et al.&#xD;
      2007; Francavilla et al. 2007, unpublished data). Further, dietary supplementation with L.&#xD;
      reuteri during and after the period of H. pylori eradication therapy has also been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the side effects of this therapy without affecting the degree of eradication (Lionetti&#xD;
      et al., 2007). It is also feasible, through the inhibitory action of L. reuteri on H. pylori,&#xD;
      that pre-exposure to L. reuteri may weaken H. pylori and make it more susceptible to&#xD;
      antibiotic attack during eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, an earlier pilot study was not been able to demonstrate a reduction in gastric&#xD;
      inflammation caused by H. pylori. This pilot study was performed with L. reuteri ATCC 55730&#xD;
      that has since been found to lack anti-inflammatory activity in in vitro screens. Recent&#xD;
      selection of natural, human L. reuteri strains has identified a specific strain with strong&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties in vitro (Lin et al, 2007 and submitted 2007). A combination of&#xD;
      this strain, together with the earlier proven L. reuteri strain, is expected to lead to both&#xD;
      a reduction of H. pylori load as well as a reduction in the gastric inflammation related to&#xD;
      the pathogen.&#xD;

      INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND PROCEDURES Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. One hundred (100) subjects, aged 18-65 years recruited from patients with symptoms&#xD;
      referred for consultation about H. pylori infection naive to treatment. HP infected patients&#xD;
      will then be randomly allocated to two groups, one to receive L. reuteri and the other to&#xD;
      receive an identical placebo preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 13C-UBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gastrointestinal symptom rating score (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serological assessment of H. pylori&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measurement of marker serum peptides related to gastric inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to take the study product each day for 28 days. On Day 29, the&#xD;
      subjects will return to the clinic for repeated analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 13C-UBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gastrointestinal symptom rating score (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of marker serum peptides related to gastric inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endoscopy with the collection of 5 gastric biopsy samples (4 from the antrum and 1 from&#xD;
           the corpus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this analysis (Day 29), eradication treatment will be initiated. Patients will receive&#xD;
      lansoprazole (30 mg b.d.) plus amoxycillin (1 gr b.d.) for 5 days followed by lansoprazole&#xD;
      (30 mg b.d.) plus clarithromycin (250 b.d.) and tinidazole (500 b.d.) for the next 5 days, as&#xD;
      recommended in the Maastricht III criteria (Malfertheiner et al. (2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study products will be administered throughout the eradication treatment period of 10&#xD;
      days. At the end of eradication therapy all subjects will return to the clinic for repeated&#xD;
      analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gastrointestinal symptom rating score (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of marker serum peptides related to gastric inflammation. At this visit&#xD;
           patients will be given a GSRS questionnaire to complete at home 30 days after this&#xD;
           visit. The completed GSRS shall be given to the investigators at the final visit by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will continue to take the study product for a further 60 days after the&#xD;
      completion of eradication. After this further 60 days (to allow discrimination between&#xD;
      recrudescence and re-infection), the level of eradication of H. pylori and the symptom score&#xD;
      will again be analysed&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 13C-UBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gastrointestinal symptom rating score (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of marker serum peptides related to gastric inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment During the period of the study (other than during the eradication&#xD;
      therapy), the subjects will refrain from ingestion of any kind of probiotic or bacterial&#xD;
      preparation, antibiotics, H2-antagonists, PPIs and NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product and Dosage L. reuteri Progastria consists of a mixture of two human strains of&#xD;
      L. reuteri, L. reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475. L. reuteri DSM 17938 is&#xD;
      essentially the same strain as L. reuteri ATCC 55730, except that it lacks plasmids that&#xD;
      carried antibiotic resistance traits for tetracycline and lincomycin. This strain has been&#xD;
      extensively studied in humans of all ages. L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 is a new strain that was&#xD;
      isolated from the breast milk of a nursing mother (as was L. reuteri DSM 17938).&#xD;
&#xD;
      L. reuteri will be delivered at a dose of 1x108 CFU of each strain of L. reuteri giving a&#xD;
      final dose of L. reuteri of 2x108 CFU. One dose is to be taken once per day giving a dose of&#xD;
      L. reuteri of 2x108 CFU/day. This dose of L. reuteri has been shown to be effective in a&#xD;
      series of conditions earlier, including inhibition of H. pylori in humans, and is considered&#xD;
      the optimal dose.&#xD;
