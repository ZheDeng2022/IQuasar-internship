  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and examine the effectiveness of an intervention that utilizes&#xD;
      multiple telecommunications technologies to improve cancer survivors' access to mental health&#xD;
      care and increase their ability to manage the high risk transition time from active cancer&#xD;
      treatment to survivorship. The intervention, referred to as Project Onward, uses an&#xD;
      interactive website, e-mail, telephone, and an online social network. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to pilot a novel intervention that can reduce costs, examine methods to improve&#xD;
      adherence to internet based treatment and overcome numerous barriers to treatment for mental&#xD;
      health concerns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 65% of those with cancer diagnoses will survive for at least 5 years, with&#xD;
      approximately 10.5 million cancer survivors in the United States. The time of transition for&#xD;
      cancer patients, from active treatment to survivorship, has been identified as a time of high&#xD;
      risk for depression and anxiety. Cancer survivors experience higher rates of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression than those without a cancer history. Research has identified fear of recurrence,&#xD;
      perceived loss of support, and social pressure to resume a &quot;normal&quot; life, among other&#xD;
      phenomena, as sources for this emotional distress. However, only about 20% of all patients&#xD;
      referred for psychotherapy ever enter treatment and of those who initiate treatment, nearly&#xD;
      half drop out before completion. This suggests that there are significant barriers to&#xD;
      receiving care. These barriers may be even higher for cancer survivors struggling with issues&#xD;
      related to re-entry, such as returning to work, resuming household responsibilities and&#xD;
      managing residual symptoms such as fatigue or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internet promises to provide inexpensive access to treatment at any time of the day or&#xD;
      night. Unfortunately, the potential for internet delivered services has not been realized.&#xD;
      Studies examining treatments that simply provide access to an internet site commonly result&#xD;
      in very high dropout after the first site visit, and typically little or no improvement&#xD;
      target symptoms. A variety of methods to improve responses to internet interventions have&#xD;
      been examined. In general, e-mail support improves adherence and telephone support can&#xD;
      improve adherence even more. Another type of support that has only begun to be investigated&#xD;
      is the use of social networks to help maintain adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention will combine a variety of outreach methods, including telephone, email and&#xD;
      an online social network, to increase adherence and promote the use of the website and the&#xD;
      skills it teaches.&#xD;
