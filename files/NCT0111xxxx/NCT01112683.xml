      The purpose of this 16-week research study is to determine whether a drug called memantine&#xD;
      hydrochloride (memantine) has the potential to help improve memory and other cognitive&#xD;
      abilities of young adults with Down syndrome (DS). Memantine (Namenda®) is a drug approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer-type&#xD;
      dementia. About 40 persons of both genders with Down syndrome aged 18-32 years will take part&#xD;
      in this study. This is a randomized and double blind study. This means that subjects will&#xD;
      have a 50/50 chance of being assigned to receive either the memantine pills or placebo&#xD;
      (inactive pills). Neither the study participants nor the research personnel will know who is&#xD;
      receiving active medication or placebo. Based on memantine's mode of action, current&#xD;
      knowledge on brain pathology in persons with Down syndrome, and some preclinical data on&#xD;
      mouse models of Down syndrome, we hypothesize that memantine may improve test scores of young&#xD;
      adults with Down Syndrome on memory tests targeted at the function of the brain structure&#xD;
      called the hippocampus. This research project has three specific aims: 1) investigate whether&#xD;
      memantine has the potential to improve test scores on hippocampus-dependent measures in young&#xD;
      adults with Down syndrome; 2) investigate whether memantine has the potential to improve test&#xD;
      scores by these subjects on other cognitive measures; 3) investigate whether memantine is&#xD;
      well tolerated by these subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Down syndrome, which is the result of the trisomy of Chromosome 21, is the most common&#xD;
      genetically defined cause of intellectual disabilities. The estimated number of people with&#xD;
      Down syndrome in the United States is approximately 300,000, and this figure is expected to&#xD;
      continue increasing due to projected increases in the life expectancy of people with Down&#xD;
      syndrome. Although this population trend reflects improvements in the general health care of&#xD;
      individuals with Down syndrome, there has not been a parallel progress in the understanding&#xD;
      of the pathogenesis and potential treatment of the psychological and neurological components&#xD;
      of this genetic condition. These include various degrees of intellectual disability,&#xD;
      increased incidence of seizure disorder in relation to the general population, motor&#xD;
      dysfunction (including hypotonia), abnormal oculomotor and vestibular functions, substantial&#xD;
      visual deficits, a neuropathology indistinguishable from Alzheimer disease, and increased&#xD;
      incidence of major depression and dementia in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last fifteen years, progress in the quantitative description of specific traits&#xD;
      associated with Down syndrome, the availability of postnatal-viable aneuploid mouse models of&#xD;
      Down syndrome, and our progressively more sophisticated knowledge of the human and mouse&#xD;
      genomes have provided investigators in this field with a realistic opportunity to start&#xD;
      bridging the gap between basic and clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas individuals with Down syndrome maintain relatively high levels of social intelligence&#xD;
      and procedural learning, they often suffer from grossly impaired declarative or explicit&#xD;
      memory. Not surprisingly, brain structures associated with declarative memory, namely the&#xD;
      hippocampal and parahippocampal regions of the medial temporal lobe, are the most severely&#xD;
      affected in persons with Down syndrome. The nature of these deficits suggests that therapies&#xD;
      targeting hippocampal function would be particularly efficacious in ameliorating the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits seen in persons with Down syndrome and, consequently, would enhance their&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamatergic neurons form the major excitatory system in the brain and play a pivotal role&#xD;
      in many physiological functions. Apart from the physiological role of glutamate, excessive&#xD;
      activation of its receptors can also evoke neuronal dysfunction and even damage/death. Cell&#xD;
      death ascribed to an excessive activation of glutamate receptors has been termed&#xD;
      'excitotoxicity' and seems to occur in acute insults such as stroke and trauma, but it may be&#xD;
      also associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease.&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) mediated glutamate excitotoxicity is thought to&#xD;
      play a major role in Aβ-induced neuronal death. This idea is part of the foundation of the&#xD;
      glutamatergic hypothesis (as opposed to the cholinergic hypothesis) for Alzheimer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memantine is an NMDAR antagonist that has been reported to be effective therapeutically in&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease. It has been available in Germany as well as in most of the European Union&#xD;
      for more than two decades. Recently, it has been approved for moderate to severe dementia in&#xD;
      the US. The chemical name for memantine hydrochloride is 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane&#xD;
      hydrochloride. Memantine is an uncompetitive, moderate affinity, antagonist of NMDARs. It has&#xD;
      been proposed that therapeutic doses of this drug inhibit the pathological effect of NMDAR&#xD;
      activation while leaving unaffected NMDAR-mediated physiological processes involved in&#xD;
      learning and memory. Recent preclinical data from the laboratory of this trial's P.I. on the&#xD;
      mouse model for DS (Ts65Dn) have suggested a dysregulation of NMDAR activity in these animals&#xD;
      and demonstrated improvement on learning and memory measures by the use of acute doses of&#xD;
      memantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all clinical trials so far, memantine was found safe and well tolerated. The tolerability&#xD;
      of an NMDAR antagonist depends upon its affinity towards the receptors, unbinding kinetics,&#xD;
      and voltage dependency. Memantine is thought to improve the fidelity of synaptic&#xD;
      transmission. Such action is predicted to provide both neuroprotection and symptomatic&#xD;
      restoration of synaptic plasticity by one and the same mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent open-label studies suggest that memantine may be clinically useful and well tolerated&#xD;
      in young individuals with other conditions that produce cognitive disabilities, such as&#xD;
      autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the ubiquity of Alzheimer disease-type pathology in persons with Down syndrome,&#xD;
      the preclinical findings consistent with dysregulation of NMDAR activity in mouse models of&#xD;
      Down syndrome, the safety profile of memantine (which is superior to the AChE inhibitors that&#xD;
      are already being tested in persons with Down syndrome), and the possibility that memantine&#xD;
      may indeed delay the onset of Alzheimer disease-type pathology in young adults with Down&#xD;
      syndrome, all the professionals involved with this project decided that a small-scale&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial was warranted at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to emphasize that the goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability and safety of memantine hydrochloride in enhancing the cognitive abilities of&#xD;
      young adults with Down syndrome aged 18-32 years. Therefore, the present investigation is a&#xD;
      non-overlapping and complementary clinical trial to the randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial on the efficacy and tolerability of memantine in preventing age-related&#xD;
      cognitive deterioration and dementia in people with Down syndrome age 40 and over&#xD;
      (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00240760?term=down+syndrome&amp;rank=15)&#xD;
      currently being carried out by our colleagues in London.&#xD;

California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) - Children's Version** - Measures episodic verbal memory (sum of the items recalled over the 4 learning trials); scale range in dataset 0-35; higher score indicates better performance&#xD;
Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test-Children's version** - Measures episodic memory for visual information presented in context; scale range in dataset 1-20; higher score indicates better performance * used in power analysis calculation of sample size ** secondary measures associated with the primary hypothesis</description>
