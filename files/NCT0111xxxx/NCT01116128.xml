    <textblock>
      Clinically demonstrated efficacy of Melphalan and Prednisone in MM subjects as well as the&#xD;
      confirmed inhibitory effect of dasatinib on several tyrosine kinase receptors and pathways&#xD;
      implicated in the pathophysiology of MM. Additionally, as a SRC inhibitor, dasatinib plays an&#xD;
      important role on bone metabolism through inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption&#xD;
      in vitro. Dasatinib could, thus, be beneficial on bone density of patients on study, through&#xD;
      blockage of osteolysis and control of bone lesions.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To determine whether the combination of dasatinib with melphalan and&#xD;
      prednisone provides therapeutic benefits and is safe in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      Multiple Myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, dose and mode of administration, and duration of treatment: Multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, single arm, two-stage, Phase II study of dasatinib in combination with melphalan&#xD;
      and prednisone (D-MP) in advanced, refractory MM patients. The three drugs will be&#xD;
      concurrently administered through 6 cycles; each cycle will be 28 days long (1 cycle = 4&#xD;
      weeks), for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. The treatment schedule will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melphalan 0,18 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone 1,5 mg/Kg/day from day 1 to day 4 for 6 cycles;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dasatinib 100 mg QD continuously (from day 1 to day 28). After the 6 cycles of D-MP&#xD;
           treatment, Dasatinib will be continuously administered alone as maintenance, until&#xD;
           occurrence of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-stage Phase II trial according to Simon with a bivariate endpoint design, by&#xD;
      which treatment efficacy and safety are jointly evaluated. This design allows the trial to be&#xD;
      early stopped after the first stage if the number of observed partial responses (PR) is&#xD;
      inadequate and the number of observed toxicities is too high. In the first stage of the&#xD;
      protocol 17 patients are required.&#xD;

                  population.&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. are pregnant or breastfeeding. Sexually active women of childbearing potential&#xD;

                  study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study&#xD;
                  enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of&#xD;
                  avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for&#xD;
                  an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test prior&#xD;
                  to first receiving dasatinib. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must&#xD;
