  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe and compare the percentage of patients infected by HIV-1&#xD;
      to maintain a complete virology suppression at the CSF (CSF CV 1 copy / mL) in patients with&#xD;
      CV &lt;50 copies / mL and treated with stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 3 years with&#xD;
      LPV / r 400/100 mg twice daily + 2 NRTI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combinations of antiretroviral for the management of HIV infection recommended by the main&#xD;
      treatment guidelines include a combination of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      (NRTI) with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) or an inhibitor protease (IP) .1&#xD;
      However, NRTIs can inhibit mitochondrial DNA gamma polymerase, causing mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction, which in turn can result in related adverse effects such as peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, abnormal lipid profile or lipodystrophy. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is advisable to design and search for therapeutic strategies to avoid prolonged exposure to&#xD;
      NRTIs and their adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IP monotherapy as a strategy of simplification, after an induction period with standard&#xD;
      triple therapy may be useful to minimize the risk of mitochondrial toxicity by NRTIs.&#xD;
      Additionally, this strategy may be useful to improve treatment adherence, reduce costs and&#xD;
      preserve future treatment options. In this sense, monotherapy with lopinavir / ritonavir (LPV&#xD;
      / r) can be an effective option for the treatment of HIV-1 as a simplification strategy in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice.3 OK04 study showed that in patients with sustained viral&#xD;
      suppression simplified to monotherapy with LPV / r, rates of viral load &lt;50 copies / mL were&#xD;
      similar to that patients continuing on standard triple therapy.4, 5 However, the virological&#xD;
      efficacy of this strategy in the CSF compartments has been questioned by some authors. Like&#xD;
      most protease inhibitors, lopinavir has a poor penetration in CSF. Thus, despite the&#xD;
      concentration of lopinavir in CSF usually exceed the inhibitory concentration (IC50) of wild&#xD;
      strains of HIV, it is possible that some patients may present lopinavir concentrations&#xD;
      insufficient to achieve sustained suppression of viral replication in that compartment. In&#xD;
      this sense, according to results from a recent study, up to 10% of patients treated with&#xD;
      lopinavir / ritonavir monotherapy may present detectable levels of viral load in CSF while&#xD;
      maintaining a CV &lt;50 copies / mL in plasma.9&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, about half of patients on antiretroviral therapy (HAART), despite&#xD;
      achieving virologic control and the treatment is performed properly, have been neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction.10 This has been associated with multiple risk factors, including the presence of&#xD;
      HIV in CSF.11 In fact, even though achieving undetectable viral load in plasma, up to 40% of&#xD;
      patients on HAART show presence of virus in CSF.12 This also has been associated with a worse&#xD;
      neurocognitive functioning. Therefore, the maximum control of viral replication is shown as a&#xD;
      priority for the improvement of CNS dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, the objective of this study is to explore and evaluate the virological&#xD;
      efficacy and safety at long-term neurocognitive level (&gt; 3 years) of monotherapy with&#xD;
      lopinavir / ritonavir as a strategy to simplify antiretroviral therapy in patients infected&#xD;
      by HIV.&#xD;
