  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the oral administration of&#xD;
      lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in the treatment of adult patients with&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed non-Ph+ B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two periods, an initial treatment period and an extended treatment&#xD;
      period. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will receive: Lenalidomide 25 mg p.o. once&#xD;
      daily on days 1-21 plus Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each&#xD;
      28-day cycle (4-weeks cycles) until CR achievement, progression of disease or intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity. The daily dose of Lenalidomide and that of Dexamethasone will remain fixed. No dose&#xD;
      adaptations are allowed according to the hematologic toxicity. However, in case of&#xD;
      non-hematologic grade &gt; 2 toxicity, the next cycle may be delayed up to 21 days after the&#xD;
      onset of the event until the adverse event has returned to baseline or ≤ grade 1. Patients&#xD;
      may be allowed to receive a pre-treatment with high doses of dexamethasone for initial&#xD;
      hyperleukocytosis at the discretion of the investigator. The use of hematopoietic growth&#xD;
      factor (HGF) during the initial or extended treatment period is also let at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator. At the end of the initial treatment period, all responding patients&#xD;
      (without HLA compatible donor) or patients showing sufficient clinical activity will be&#xD;
      allowed to receive extended treatment with cycles identical to the first cycle. Patients may&#xD;
      continue to receive treatment as long as the patient is tolerating the treatment well and the&#xD;
      patient's physician believes the patient is receiving some benefit. The severity of adverse&#xD;
      events will be graded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Any&#xD;
      life-threatening adverse effects that are observed during the initial or extended treatment&#xD;
      period, which are possibly or probably related to study drug, will require the subject to&#xD;
      discontinue study treatment.&#xD;

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused&#xD;
                  study drug to the investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Understand that the study medication is expected to have a teratogenic risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without&#xD;
             interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout the entire duration of&#xD;

             study drug therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject&#xD;
             commits to absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The&#xD;
             following are effective methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
