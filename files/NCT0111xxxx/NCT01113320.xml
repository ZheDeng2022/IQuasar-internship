          6. Treatment with opioids (e.g., tramadol, meperidine derivatives), serotonin&#xD;
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine), tri- or&#xD;
             tetra-cyclic antidepressants, in the past 8 weeks prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
             Dextromethorphan will be permitted if used for treating cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has received neurosurgical intervention related to PD (e.g. deep brain&#xD;
