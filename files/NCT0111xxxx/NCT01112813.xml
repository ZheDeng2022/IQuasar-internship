    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death in&#xD;
      Canada. Most stroke survivors live with residual impairments that diminish independence and&#xD;
      quality of life. This may include vascular cognitive impairment (loss of ability to plan,&#xD;
      think and reason) which can lead to dementia and loss of mental and functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment to reduce stroke induced brain tissue injury is limited to&#xD;
      thrombolytics (clot busters), a therapy useful only if given in the first hours following&#xD;
      stroke. One major new approach aims to reduce cell death after stroke by targeting the&#xD;
      ongoing tissue loss initiated by the stroke. The tissue can be maintained by interfering with&#xD;
      later neurochemical processes that are activated by stroke, potentially through activating&#xD;
      natural substances in the brain that help survival and growth of nerve cells (&quot;neurotrophic&quot;&#xD;
      factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent recognition of lithium as a neurotrophic agent has generated the first studies of&#xD;
      lithium treatment for managing brain diseases. Clinically, lithium has now been shown to&#xD;
      increase brain gray matter volume in bipolar patients. This effect is potentially important&#xD;
      in stroke because gray matter loss has been implicated in the development of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment after stroke, a result of the series of brain processes that are activated by lack&#xD;
      of oxygen due to stroke. Our primary objective is to examine the effects of lithium on total&#xD;
      brain gray matter volume in the post-stroke population, as measured by volumetric magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) with the hope that lithium may increase gray matter volume in&#xD;
      post-stroke patients and lead to greater cognitive and functional rehabilitation. This study&#xD;
      will provide valuable information on the tolerability of lithium, and its effects on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes relevant to stroke, providing the information needed for designing a large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

      The recognition of lithium as a neurotrophic agent has provided a rationale for evaluation of&#xD;
      this agent in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Numerous animal and in vitro studies have&#xD;
      shown lithium-mediated neurotrophic effects involve mechanisms highly relevant to the&#xD;
      post-stroke population: the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and&#xD;
      inhibition of abnormal activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). Lithium has&#xD;
      consistently been shown to increase serum concentration of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF.&#xD;
      BDNF is involved with neuronal proliferation, survival, and differentiation and it&#xD;
      facilitates cortical reorganization and functional recovery after focal ischemia (in rats).&#xD;
      GSK-3 is a neurotrophic intermediary. In animal and in vitro models, lithium treatment&#xD;
      effectively reduces the severity of ischemic damage and protects against ischemic damage of&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) neurons resulting from glutamate-induced cell death.&#xD;
      Importantly, these benefits were present when lithium was given after ischemic events rather&#xD;
      than prophylactically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of pharmacotherapy post-stroke is to enhance restoration of neurological function&#xD;
      and limit structural degradation. Gray matter atrophy is a relevant post-stroke relevant&#xD;
      outcome as it has been implicated in the development of vascular cognitive impairment after&#xD;
      stroke and is a result of the series of neurochemical processes that are activated by&#xD;
      ischemia. While the first clinical studies examining the neurotrophic effects of lithium and&#xD;
      its effects on total gray matter volume in bipolar subjects have just emerged, this has yet&#xD;
      to be explored in the post-stroke population. Our primary objective is to determine the&#xD;
      tolerability of lithium following a stroke and to examine its effects on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      including total brain gray matter volume as measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study, lithium carbonate (target 0.4 to 0.8 mmol/L) will be given&#xD;
      open-label for 60 days, to consenting patients with unilateral ischemic cortical lesions.&#xD;
      Total gray matter volume using magnetic resonance imaging will also be measured at baseline&#xD;
      and termination, and related to changes in clinical outcomes (standardized scales measuring&#xD;
      cognitive, activities of daily living, motor recovery) performed at the time of the MRIs. We&#xD;
      expect to find that post-stroke patients receiving lithium will have increases in gray matter&#xD;
      volume, and that increase in gray matter volume will predict improvements in clinical&#xD;
      outcomes over 60 days. In addition, since lithium has been shown to increase serum&#xD;
      concentration of the neurotrophic factor, BDNF, we will explore the relationship between&#xD;
      plasma BDNF concentrations and neurological and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide key information of clinical importance that will determine whether a&#xD;
      clinical trial with lithium is desirable and feasible. Results of this project have the&#xD;
      potential to focus the development of lithium as a new treatment strategy that would improve&#xD;
      outcomes at both the individual and societal level.&#xD;
