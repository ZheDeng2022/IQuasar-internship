  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immune response to a live attenuated&#xD;
      dengue vaccine that could protect people against all 4 types of dengue virus. Live attenuated&#xD;
      means that while this vaccine contains 4 live dengue viruses the viruses have been attenuated&#xD;
      (weakened) so as not to cause dengue disease in people. Dengue virus is spread to people by&#xD;
      mosquitoes and can cause sickness and even death. Seventy-two subjects between the ages of&#xD;
      18-45 years old will be enrolled in this research study at Saint Louis University Center for&#xD;
      Vaccine Development. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups to receive 2&#xD;
      doses of the study vaccine or placebo (inactive substance). Study procedures include:&#xD;
      maintaining a diary to record temperature and side effects, physical exam, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) (measures the activity of the heart), and blood samples. Participants will be involved&#xD;
      in study related procedures for about 10 months.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a tetravalent&#xD;
      dengue vaccine administered subcutaneously or intradermally. The hypotheses being tested in&#xD;
      this study is whether or not a tetravalent dengue vaccine may be safely administered to&#xD;
      healthy normal individuals by intradermal (ID) or subcutaneous (SC) injection and provide&#xD;
      measurable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies against all four dengue virus serotypes.&#xD;
      The study is also designed to compare safety and immunogenicity between routes of&#xD;
      administration and dose levels. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of a two-dose regimen tetravalent dengue vaccine administered either SC or&#xD;
      ID to healthy adult volunteers. Two dose levels will be tested in a dose-escalation format.&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be measured by conducting post-vaccination safety assessments&#xD;
      including physical examinations, injection site examinations, adverse event monitoring,&#xD;
      hematology, blood chemistry, and urine dipstick. The secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine, in terms of neutralizing antibodies, against all&#xD;
      four dengue serotypes when administered at two dose levels by two routes of administration in&#xD;
      healthy adults. Titers of serum neutralizing antibodies will be measured at pre-vaccination,&#xD;
      after prime and boost vaccinations and assessed by comparing titers at the two dose levels as&#xD;
      well as the two routes of administration. In addition, viremia deriving from the attenuated&#xD;
      vaccine viruses will be measured on days 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 5/6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 after both&#xD;
      prime and boost vaccinations. Levels of neutralizing antibodies will also be measured in&#xD;
      samples to be obtained on days 180 and 270 for analysis and submission in a supplement to the&#xD;
      study report. This study will enroll 72 healthy flavivirus-negative male and female subjects&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 45.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female at least 18 and less than or equal to 45 years old at time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In good health as determined by medical history, physical examination including height&#xD;
             and weight, and clinical safety laboratory examinations. For creatinine and alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase levels the applicable cut-offs for determination are the upper limits of&#xD;
             normal only, as there is no clinical significance associated with results below the&#xD;
             lower limits of normal for these laboratory values. For aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the applicable cut-offs for determination&#xD;
             are less than 1.5 times the upper limits of normal, as there is no clinical&#xD;
             significance associated with results below the lower limits of normal for these&#xD;
             laboratory values or with mild elevations above the upper limits of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values not listed in Table 3 which are obtained as part of a reference&#xD;
             laboratory pre-determined panel will be considered as acceptable for enrollment if&#xD;
             they are either within reference laboratory normal range or within the ranges&#xD;
             specified for a grade I AE per the protocol Toxicology Tables in Appendix B. Values&#xD;
             within reference laboratory normal ranges or within ranges specified for a grade I AE&#xD;
             per the Toxicology Tables in Appendix B will be considered as discussed with the&#xD;
             medical monitor and may be enrolled with no further discussion. Values with deviations&#xD;
             outside the ranges specified for a grade 1 AE in the Toxciology Tables in Appendix B&#xD;
             will be discussed further between the PI and the medical monitor prior to vaccination&#xD;
             and assessed for impact on volunteer safety. Urinalyses obtained from female&#xD;
             volunteers on their menses may be repeated after their menses have concluded without&#xD;
             discussion with the medical monitor. Laboratory values which are not listed in the&#xD;
             Toxicology Tables in Appendix B and which are out of the reference laboratory normal&#xD;
             range will be discussed with the DMID medical monitor to determine its relevance for&#xD;
             safety and impact on enrollment and follow-up vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood tests negative for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, Hepatitis&#xD;
             C, dengue, West Nile, and negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen.&#xD;

             device, female condom, diaphragm with spermicidal, cervical cap, use of condom by the&#xD;
             sexual partner or a sterile sexual partner, or abstinence) from screening until after&#xD;
             the last blood sample (at day 270).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
