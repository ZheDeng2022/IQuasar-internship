      This is a biomarker exploratory study which is designed to investigate the function and&#xD;
      oxidation of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) (the good cholesterol) in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus treated with Vitamin E versus placebo and segregated by the type of the&#xD;
      Haptoglobin protein they have in their blood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There exists ample evidence supporting the hypothesis that vitamin E supplementation to Hp&#xD;
      2-2 DM individuals will reduce the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      cardiovascular death. Data regarding the association between the Hp 1-1 and 2-1 phenotypes&#xD;
      and vitamin E treatment on cardiovascular outcomes such as MI, stroke and CV death is&#xD;
      lacking. Furthermore there is no data correlating Hp phenotype, vitamin E and HDL function,&#xD;
      structure and oxidation. We wish to evaluate the effect of vitamin E treatment on all&#xD;
      diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes on HDL function, structure and oxidation and correlate&#xD;
      these parameters to Hp phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first study to prospectively evaluate the interaction of the Hp&#xD;
      phenotype and vitamin E in type 2 diabetic patients. As such we wish to evaluate the&#xD;
      surrogate marker of reverse cholesterol transport as evidence to the function or dysfunction&#xD;
      of the HDL in a relatively small scale study before engaging in a large scale clinical&#xD;
      outcome study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives. To evaluate the effect of vitamin E treatment on HDL function of reverse&#xD;
      cholesterol transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test product. Natural Source Vitamin E (d-Î±-tocopherol) 400IU administered P.O. as soft gel&#xD;
      capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. The study population will be comprised of men and women, age 55 and above&#xD;
      with type 2 DM. 90 DM individuals will comprise the treatment phase of the study and will be&#xD;
      divided into 30 patients in each Hp phenotype (1-1, 2-1, 2-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 90 patients will be randomized in a double blind fashion into two treatment groups,&#xD;
      Vitamin E Natural source 400IU per day versus matching placebo assuring that there will be an&#xD;
      equal amount of patients of each phenotype allocated to placebo and Vitamin E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study power Calculation_We have calculated that a sample of a total 90 patient (30 in each&#xD;
      phenotype) will be required to identify a 30% difference in Reverse Cholesterol Transport&#xD;
      between the groups and a statistically significant interaction between phenotype and&#xD;
      treatment, with an 80% power and a two sided p value of &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study administration. Eligible patients will be identified using the ICARE study database&#xD;
      with the help of the ICARE study coordinator at Clalit Health Services. We will identify&#xD;
      patients from the 3 Hp phenotypes (those patients were Hp typed as part of the ICARE study&#xD;
      and their Hp type is on file). We will then call the patients and they will be asked&#xD;
      questions according to the screening questioner to be identified as eligible according to&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those eligible will be invited to the Technion faculty of&#xD;
      medicine and will be then recruited to the study after they agree and sign the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF). Patients will give a blood sample of 50cc of blood at enrollment which&#xD;
      will serve as baseline for testing reverse cholesterol transport as well as HDL structure and&#xD;
      oxidation. Patients will then be randomized to vitamin E or placebo in a double blinded&#xD;
      manner. We will recruit consecutive eligible patients from the ICARE registry till we reach&#xD;
      the number of 30 patients in each phenotype and a total of 90 patients. For all 90 treated&#xD;
      patients Blood tests (50cc of blood) will be performed after 3 months of treatment, then&#xD;
      cross over for an additional 3 months of treatment which in its end the last blood test will&#xD;
      be performed (again 50cc). Patients who participate in the treatment phase of the study will&#xD;
      have to arrive at the clinic 3 times (baseline and randomization visit, end of first&#xD;
      treatment visit and end of second treatment visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis. Reverse cholesterol transport results will be compared within and between the&#xD;
      groups using paired and unpaired student's t-tests as appropriate. The p for interaction&#xD;
      between the 3 phenotype groups and treatment will also be determined.&#xD;
