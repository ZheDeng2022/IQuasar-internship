      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention, which is&#xD;
      designed to increase contraceptive prevalence among postpartum women attending vaccination&#xD;
      services who desire to either space or limit their pregnancies, thus reducing unmet&#xD;
      contraceptive need in this population.&#xD;

      Study Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of an intervention, which is designed to increase&#xD;
      contraceptive prevalence among postpartum women attending vaccination services who desire to&#xD;
      either space or limit their pregnancies, thus reducing unmet contraceptive need in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Brief, concise messages conveyed to women during group education sessions regarding&#xD;
      pregnancy risk, benefits of FP, and family planning options during the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.IEC materials such as posters and brochures that deliver messages about the benefits of&#xD;
      spacing pregnancies by at least 2 years, LAM, return to fecundity and pregnancy risk during&#xD;
      the postpartum period and contraceptive options for postpartum women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.Use of a screening tool (Appendix A) to assess pregnancy risk for postpartum women coupled&#xD;
      with a brief counseling message depending upon risk classification which includes referral to&#xD;
      FP services for those currently or soon-to-be at-risk of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.Convenient offer of FP services to women attending vaccination services for their infants&#xD;
      either concurrently with vaccination services, or at the same facility and on the same day,&#xD;
      but at a different time from vaccination services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental, two-group (intervention/control) pretest (pre-intervention) /posttest&#xD;
      (post-intervention) design 12 month intervention period. A mid-course collection of process&#xD;
      data will also be conducted at 6 months to assess the degree to which the intervention is&#xD;
      being implemented as intended and to provide an opportunity for corrective action if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Women attending vaccination services for their infants, and vaccination and FP&#xD;
      providers&#xD;
