      Aims: To test the hypothesis that Diastolic dysfunction severity correlates with adverse&#xD;

      Recent studies have explored the prognostic role of TDI-derived parameters in major cardiac&#xD;
      diseases, such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and hypertension.(1-3). In&#xD;
      these conditions, myocardial mitral annular or basal segmental (Sm) systolic and early&#xD;
      diastolic (Ea or Em) velocities have been shown to predict mortality or cardiovascular&#xD;
      events. In particular, those with reduced Sm or Em values of &lt;3 cm/s have a very poor&#xD;
      prognosis. In heart failure and after myocardial infarction, noninvasive assessment of LV&#xD;
      diastolic pressure by transmitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/Ea or&#xD;
      E/Em) is a strong prognosticator, especially when E/Ea is &gt; or =15. (3) Conventional Doppler&#xD;
      indices and TDI parameters correlated with functional class in patients with advanced heart&#xD;
      failure. The E/E' ratio, which probably reflects high LV end-diastolic pressure, was the best&#xD;
      measure for differentiating patients with functional class III and IV, and it also correlated&#xD;
      with cardiac mortality and hospitalization for worsening heart failure, thereby providing&#xD;
      additional value to standard echocardiographic measures(4-5) In our study we'll try to&#xD;
      demonstrate that clinical deterioration of patients with LV systolic dysfunction directly&#xD;
      correlates with parameters of their diastolic function and that these parameters more&#xD;
      predictable than changes in LVEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed on the base of Natania Heart Institute (out of hospital clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within community-based population study we'll select the patients with LV systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be classified according to their LV systolic function, functional class&#xD;
      (NYHA) of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be evaluate according their baseline features, clinical status using&#xD;
      EQ-5D score, KCCQ Overall Summary Score, KCCQ Symptom Frequency Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment all our patients will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maximal work capacity testing (in METS) per BRUCE protocol,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HR response estimation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6-min walk test (to walk down 100 foot corridor to cover as much as possible in 6min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. VO2 estimation using the knowing formula VO2 (mlO2/kg/min) =&#xD;
           (mphX2.68)+(1.8X26.82XmphXgrade+100)+3.5 1MET =3.5 ml Q2/kg/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Echocardiography will be performed by VIVID -7 with 3.7 MHz probe All subjects examined&#xD;
           with color TDI, FPV, two-dimensional and M-mode echo in the left lateral decubitus&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Follow-up at least 2 years With out patients clinical evaluation monthly Exercise&#xD;
      capacity evaluation every 3 mo Echocardiography one in half a year&#xD;
