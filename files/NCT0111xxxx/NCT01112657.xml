      This is a prospective, multicentric, observational study with a 2 years recruitment period.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to observe the multiple sclerosis (MS) progression of subjects&#xD;
      since their first episode of neurological event and secondly, to determine status of&#xD;
      anti-AQP4 immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody in MS subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      characterised by areas of demyelination, or plaques, in the CNS. In 85% of subjects who later&#xD;
      develop MS, clinical onset is with an acute or subacute episode of neurological disturbance&#xD;
      due to a single white-matter lesion (e.g. optic neuritis, or an isolated brainstem or partial&#xD;
      spinal-cord syndrome). This presentation is known as a Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS).&#xD;
      Because a CIS is typically the earliest clinical expression of MS, research on subjects with&#xD;
      a CIS may provide new insights into early pathological changes and pathogenetic mechanisms&#xD;
      that might affect the course of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group of subjects with optic-spinal MS (OSMS), the main lesions are typically confined&#xD;
      to the optic nerve and spinal cord. In Asians, OSMS has similar features to the relapsing&#xD;
      remitting form of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) seen in Westerners. It is still a matter of&#xD;
      debate whether NMO represents a disease entity in itself or whether it is a subform of MS.&#xD;
      Early differentiation of NMO from MS is highly desirable, as treatment options and prognoses&#xD;
      differ widely. Recently, a new serum autoantibody (NMO-IgG) has been detected in NMO&#xD;
      subjects. The binding sites of this autoantibody were reported to colocalize with aquaporin 4&#xD;
      (AQP4) water channels. Optic-spinal MS is sometime suggested to be NMO based on the frequent&#xD;
      detection of the anti-AQP4 IgG antibody. In Taiwan, study has shown that 56% of MS subjects&#xD;
      were of the optic-spinal type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed firstly, to observe the MS progression of subjects since their first&#xD;
      episode of neurological event and secondly, to determine status of anti-AQP4 IgG antibody in&#xD;
      MS subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the progression of subjects who have experienced a CIS to MS over a 2-year&#xD;
           period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between CIS and MS including optic-spinal MS (OSMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the status of anti-AQP4 IgG antibody in subjects who convert to MS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject shall be followed up for 2 years after enrolment. At baseline, routine&#xD;
      examinations shall be performed to confirm subject's neurological episode. After the baseline&#xD;
      visit, the subject shall be instructed to return for further examination if he/she&#xD;
      experiences a relapse. During the follow-up examinations, the treating physician shall&#xD;
      determine whether the subject fulfil the diagnostic criteria for MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subject is being diagnosed with MS, he/she shall be considered as reaching the end of&#xD;
      his/her study participation. Further management of the MS condition will be at the discretion&#xD;
      of the treating physician. During 2-year follow-up period, telephone calls to the subject&#xD;
      shall be made quarterly to assess subject's neurological and/or visual status and to remind&#xD;
      subject that he/she need to return for evaluation in the event of a relapse. All data will be&#xD;
      collected using a standardised case report form (CRF).&#xD;
