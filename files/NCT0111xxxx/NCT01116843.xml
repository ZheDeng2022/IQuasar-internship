    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the biological effects in the primary tumor&#xD;
      following a short, pre-operative course of treatment with PF-00298804 in patients with Oral&#xD;
      Cavity Cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, biomarker driven, preoperative window of&#xD;
      opportunity study with a pharmacodynamic primary endpoint. Patients with resectable,&#xD;
      histologically confirmed OCC for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management,&#xD;
      will be randomized 2:1 to receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively at a dose of 45 mg once daily&#xD;
      orally for 7-11 days or to Matching Placebo for 7-11 days depending on surgery schedule. The&#xD;
      target is a total of 8 days of treatment but with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 dosing&#xD;
      days. All patients will receive surgery as per standard of care without delay. Biomarkers&#xD;
      from the surgical specimen and baseline tumor biopsy or consent to provide a tumor block from&#xD;
      existing primary diagnostic tumor biopsy completed within 90 days will be evaluated for&#xD;
      primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.&#xD;
