  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the report &quot;To Err is Human&quot; by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1999, attention was&#xD;
      brought to the general public that adverse events in medicine are common and are one of the&#xD;
      leading causes of morbidity and mortality within the United States. The report estimates that&#xD;
      44,000 - 98,000 patients hospitalized in the United States die each year as a result of&#xD;
      medical errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of the growing patient safety movement worldwide, health care has not become&#xD;
      measurably safer. Health care is one of the few risk-prone areas in which public demand&#xD;
      limits the use of common-sense safety-enhancing solutions, such as limiting the flow and&#xD;
      choosing the type of incoming patients. The latter is especially true for emergency&#xD;
      departments (EDs) since they deliver an important public service by providing emergency care&#xD;
      24 hours a day, 365 days per year, without discrimination by social or economic status. One&#xD;
      of the key expectations of EDs is the ability to provide immediate access and stabilization&#xD;
      for those patients who have an emergency medical condition. However, emergency department&#xD;
      (ED) crowding is recognized to be a major, international problem that affects patients and&#xD;
      providers. A recent report from the IOM noted that the increasing strain caused by crowding&#xD;
      is creating a deficit in quality of emergency care. Crowding has been associated with reduced&#xD;
      access to emergency medical services, delays in care for cardiac patients, increased patient&#xD;
      mortality, inadequate pain management, increased costs of patient care, and delays in&#xD;
      administration of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several issues remain concerning ED crowding and it's relation to adverse events. First, the&#xD;
      existing evidence on adverse event occurrence during ED crowding is largely anecdotal and&#xD;
      inconclusive. Secondly, although a few studies showed a relationship between ED crowding and&#xD;
      mortality, neither of these examined the causes of excess mortality. Finally, although a&#xD;
      significant increase in the average length of hospital stay was shown during ED crowding the&#xD;
      reasons for this are open to speculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study therefore is to identify six explicit adverse events and mortality&#xD;
      for patients who were admitted through ED and to compare these results in relation to ED&#xD;
      crowding. This will provide us novel insight into the reasons for the hypothesized increased&#xD;
      mortality during ED crowding.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since &quot;ED crowding&quot; is an unplanned condition, a randomized controlled trial is not possible&#xD;
      to assess its impact on adverse patients' outcome. Therefore, a large prospective cohort&#xD;
      study, with careful matching and correcting for risk factors is the second best design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED occupancy rate, defined as the ratio of the total number of ED patients to the number&#xD;
      of licensed treatment bays per hour, will be used as a measure of ED crowding. The numerator&#xD;
      includes all patients in the ED at any point during each study hour, regardless of ED&#xD;
      location (including in the waiting room, boarding, hallway location). The denominator,&#xD;
      constant per study hour, includes the total number of licensed treatment bays as defined&#xD;
      according to the ED's original blueprint but excludes hallway locations. For each hour of the&#xD;
      day, the ED occupancy rate will be derived from the ED information system. 104 weeks are&#xD;
      divided into 13-week seasonal blocks and nursing shifts starting 23:00, 07:00 and 15:00. The&#xD;
      mean ED occupancy rate is calculated for each shift as the sum of the occupancy rates within&#xD;
      that shift divided by 8. The top quartile of all mean ED occupancy rates during the cohort&#xD;
      period is considered as crowded. In order to match both 'crowded 'and 'not crowded' cohorts,&#xD;
      the following data elements are extracted from the hospital information system for each&#xD;
      registered patient: demographic data (age, sex, co-morbidities); referral source, surgical or&#xD;
      medical admission; time of arrival (including season, month of year, day of week, time of&#xD;
      day); triage category; ED and total hospital length of stay; and final admission diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records of patients who presented to the ED will be reviewed for the occurrence of&#xD;
      six adverse events and mortality up to ten days of their ED stay. The six adverse events are&#xD;
      searched through explicit clinical criteria. The reviewer first rates on a scale of 1 to 6&#xD;
      the confidence that medical management caused an adverse event. If the rating is 5 or 6,&#xD;
      indicating that the injury is probably or definitely caused by management, the event is&#xD;
      considered an adverse event. The same rating score is used to assess the degree of&#xD;
      preventability. Hospital mortality will be searched for all patients who presented to the ED&#xD;
      at some point in time and died during that hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify an adverse event occurrence hazard ratio of 1.2 with a power of 0.9&#xD;
      during ED crowding, a cohort of 104,000 patients is needed. Therefore, data will be retrieved&#xD;
      during a 2 year period during which the reviewer is blinded to the degree of ED crowding in&#xD;
      relation to the findings on adverse events. The occurrence of adverse events and mortality&#xD;
      will be compared to not crowded shifts, corrected for baseline risk factors. A carefully&#xD;
      standardized admission form for registration of relevant information as well as a&#xD;
      computerized search tool for screening for adverse events will allow finalizing this study&#xD;
      within the foreseen time frame.&#xD;
