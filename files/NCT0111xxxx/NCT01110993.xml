      This is a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study to evaluate quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) and influence of cognitive status on QoL in subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (RRMS) during two years of treatment with Rebif New Formulation (RNF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acquired demyelinating disease of unclear etiology, occurring&#xD;
      mainly in adults. Multiple sclerosis occurs in 30-100 people per 100 000. Usually the disease&#xD;
      attacks young adults aged between 20 and 40 years. The peak of this occurrence is in the&#xD;
      population of 30-35 year olds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main feature of the disease is multifocal (disseminated) injury of the central nervous&#xD;
      system. The injury causes various neurological symptoms and signs that go on and off&#xD;
      (relapsing-remitting form) or progress steadily, and with time cause irreversible damage of&#xD;
      the nervous system and permanent disability. In neuropsychological studies, 40-65% of MS&#xD;
      subjects show cognitive impairment with prominent involvement of memory, sustained attention&#xD;
      and information processing speed. Multiple sclerosis subjects with different disease courses&#xD;
      have different cognitive profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction can have a dramatic impact on a subject's QoL, influencing the&#xD;
      fulfillment in work and social life, independently from physical disability. The methodology&#xD;
      of cognitive status assessment in MS is based on established sets of tests, which could be&#xD;
      conduced by qualified neurophysiologists. There is a need of simple test that could be&#xD;
      quickly conducted by every physician, providing information of cognitive status/ or one of&#xD;
      its parameters (attention/concentration). That kind of information could be immediately used&#xD;
      by the physician during the visit to adjust the way of taking history or giving advices to&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 10 years there's been an enormous progress in the MS treatment. New drugs&#xD;
      appeared that proved to diminish clinical activity of the disease and slow its progress.&#xD;
      Early treatment with disease modifying therapies may reduce cognitive impairment or slow down&#xD;
      the progression of cognitive deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of this study is to evaluate the cognitive status (attention/concentration) and the&#xD;
      influence of cognitive impairment on QoL in subjects with RRMS during two years of treatment&#xD;
      with RNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the QoL in subjects with RRMS during two years of treatment with RNF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cognitive status (attention/concentration) and the influence of&#xD;
           cognitive impairment on QoL in subjects with RRMS during two years of treatment with RNF&#xD;
           Subjects will be treated according to widely-acknowledged standards for MS treatment and&#xD;
           the choice of drug will depend solely on medical indications. The potential subjects&#xD;
           will have been prescribed Rebif for the first time by their treating physicians and will&#xD;
           then be given the option to enter in this observational study. As this is purely an&#xD;
           observational study, the subjects will be followed by their treating physicians,&#xD;
           according to current medical practice and Rebif SmPC (Summary of Product&#xD;
           Characteristics) requirements (i.e monitoring of thyroid and liver enzymes prior to the&#xD;
           start of therapy, and hepatic function at months 1, 3, 6 and periodically thereafter,&#xD;
           prescription of antipyretics etc.) After each control visit, the treating physician will&#xD;
           complete subject's observations chart. The planned schedule of visits will be identical&#xD;
           to the routine schedule of control visits dictated by the National Health Found: 1st&#xD;
           Visit - 3 months after RNF therapy start, 2nd Visit - after 6 months, 3rd Visit - after&#xD;
           9 months, 4th Visit - after 12 months, 5th Visit - after 18 months, 6th Visit - after 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;0&quot; visit - doctors will be asked to complete data from subjects history (doctors will be&#xD;
      given the proposal of testing (MusiQoL[Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life],&#xD;
      MMSE [Mini Mental State Examination] and 10-PCT [10-Point Clock Test]) most subjects on the&#xD;
      visit when the disease-modifying drugs [DMD] therapy is instituted).&#xD;
