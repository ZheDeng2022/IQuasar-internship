  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors at MassGeneral Hospital for Children (MGHfC) are doing a research study to learn if a&#xD;
      gluten free-dairy free (GFCF) diet is helpful in improving gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      associated with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The gluten free/casein free diet (GFCF) will result in a higher proportion of&#xD;
      subjects having reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms associated with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of a GFCF diet on GI symptoms associated with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if improvements in GI symptoms result in improvements in autistic behavior&#xD;
           when using a GFCF diet in the dietary management of GI symptoms associated with ASD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the nutritional impact of a GFCF restrictive diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the role of food allergies in the manifestation of GI symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 14-week study that requires between 5 &amp; 9 office visits. All study related&#xD;
      activities -including physical exams, blood samples and allergy testing - and an amino acid&#xD;
      based supplement drink, are at no cost. Research study visits will take place at MGHfC in&#xD;
      Boston, or at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Newton, or at Lurie Center/LADDERS in Lexington.&#xD;
