  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Neu-P11,&#xD;
      following the administration of multiple ascending oral doses (2, 5, 20, 50 mg or matching&#xD;
      placebo) given nightly over 2 periods of 5 days to male and female subjects with primary&#xD;
      insomnia. In addition, the study is aimed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Neu-P11&#xD;
      after 1 and 5 days of administration and to evaluate the hypnotic effects of Neu-P11 as well&#xD;
      as the effects on mood and memory. The study hypothesis is that Neu-P11 is safe, tolerated&#xD;
      and have significant sleep promoting effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of four multiple ascending doses of orally administered Neu-P11 will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a double- blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Following a screening visit, the&#xD;
      recruited subjects will undergo an inclusion/habituation full night PSG screening recording&#xD;
      in the sleep clinic to exclude subjects with sleep disorders. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each. Following screening, each cohort will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive Neu-P11 or placebo for a first period of 5 days and will be crossed&#xD;
      over following at least 21 days to receive placebo or a higher dose of Neu-P11 for a second&#xD;
      period of 5 days. Each cohort will receive a different dose of Neu-P11, chosen from 2, 5, 20&#xD;
      and 50 mg. The starting dose is 5 mg but a smaller dose (2 mg) is also included for the&#xD;
      purpose of pharmacodynamic evaluation. Before proceeding from 5mg to the next higher dose&#xD;
      safety will be evaluated based on adverse events, clinical and biological data. Subjects of&#xD;
      Cohort A will be randomised to dose levels 2 and 3 (doses 5 and 20 mg). Subjects of Cohort B&#xD;
      will be randomised to dose levels 1 and 4 (doses 2 and 50 mg).&#xD;
