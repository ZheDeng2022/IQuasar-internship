    <textblock>
      Pulsed RadioFrequency (PRF) is a relatively new technique derived from a well established and&#xD;
      proven intervention, thermal radiofrequency (RF). Both procedures are used in the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic pain. Unlike RF treatment, PRF does no direct damage to the nerve. During PRF&#xD;
      treatment, electrical energy is applied with a small needle to the affected nerve using a&#xD;
      pulsed time cycle that delivers short bursts of RF current. This study is interested in&#xD;
      looking at the efficacy of PRF for chronic lumbar radicular pain (CLR) and to assess whether&#xD;
      a larger scale clinical study with the same methods can be used.&#xD;

      Methodology and Techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be screened at St Joseph-East End Pain Clinic for Chronic Lumbar Radiculopathy&#xD;
      (CLR) of at least 4 months duration. Based on the history and clinical examination, a&#xD;
      diagnosis of CLR involving one or more spinal segments is made and noted. The patient is&#xD;
      considered eligible for the study if a CT or MRI of lumbar spine done within the last 4&#xD;
      months demonstrates pathology that is concordant with the patient's clinical symptoms. The&#xD;
      spinal level(s) targeted for treatment will be based on clinical findings, e.g. if a patient&#xD;
      exhibits signs and symptoms of right L4 radiculopathy, and the MRI demonstrates right&#xD;
      paracentral disc herniations at both L4-5 and L5-S1, only the L4 DRG will be targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be fully explained about the nature of study,&#xD;
      interventions involved and the possible complications after which an informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken. Enrolled patients would be randomized-according to the method chosen and included in&#xD;
      the study according to previously randomized order. He/she will also meet the ASSESSOR (blind&#xD;
      to intervention)-who would note down the baseline parameters of the patient and also collect&#xD;
      a baseline Oswestry Score chart, along with noting down other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient having bilateral radiculopathy will be treated for his most affected side in the&#xD;
      trial. A patient having CLR of more than one segment on one side shall be treated for all the&#xD;
      involved segments with the same technique and counted as a single procedure or intervention&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All OR (operating room) personnel, including the physician performing intervention and&#xD;
      patient shall be blind to the randomization and treatment. The grouping code, hence the&#xD;
      actual treatment will only be known by the person operating the RF machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the RF technician shall be in view of the working details of the RF machine and the&#xD;
      noise of the machine is cut off. This ensures blinding of all involved except the RF&#xD;
      technician. After checking for informed consent and other safety checklist, patient will only&#xD;
      be revealed as belonging to group A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All interventions will be done as day care procedures in the OR. Patients would continue to&#xD;
      use their medications as before. If the pain relief obtained necessitates decrease in the&#xD;
      usage of medications that shall be recorded. Similarly unsatisfactory pain relief obtained&#xD;
      necessitating increase in the dose or change of medications shall be recorded. The other&#xD;
      parameters to be used for statistical analysis are collected as mentioned in the data&#xD;
      analysis paragraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have an established IV access. He would be put in prone position. The&#xD;
      involved area of back would be made sterile using chlorohexidine 2% and draped. The patient&#xD;
      would be connected to continuous monitoring of 3 lead ECG, NIBP (Non-Invasive Blood Pressure)&#xD;
      and pulse oximetry. Sedation, if used will be minimal (Grade I or II) to obtain the necessary&#xD;
      response of the patient. Under fluoroscopy guidance- particular spinal segment(s) affected is&#xD;
      (are) identified and confirmed. LA using 2% lidocaine is infiltrated to the skin at entry&#xD;
      site. For both groups a RF needle (Bayliss: 22-G needle, 5-mm curved active tip and 10 cm) is&#xD;
      used. With an appropriate fluoroscopy view needle is inserted to the target location in both&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target location: the DRG which is an enlargement formed by the dorsal nerve root just&#xD;
      proximal to its junction with the spinal nerve lies within the dural sleeve and occupies the&#xD;
      upper, medial part of the intervertebral foramen (22). It is confirmed with an&#xD;
      anteroposterior fluoroscopy view in which it is advanced, if required, until the tip is&#xD;
      located one-third to halfway into the pedicle column (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Confirmation (Malik et al): Appropriate fluoroscopic placement of needle-near DRG at&#xD;
      the lumbar area is noted; on anteroposterior x-ray projection, the DRG is described to lie&#xD;
      immediately behind the lateral aspect of the facet column at all spinal levels and on lateral&#xD;
      x-ray projection, it is localized to the dorsocranial quadrant of the IVF (intervertebral&#xD;
      foramen) Proximity of the needle to the DRG is determined by appropriate sensory stimulation&#xD;
      with 50 Hz, at more than 0.4 V (avoids intraganglionic placement) and less than or equal to&#xD;
      0.6 V; motor stimulation at 2 Hz with threshold 1.5-2 times greater than sensory threshold to&#xD;
      avoid placement near the anterior nerve root. A radiculogram done also confirms the&#xD;
      appropriate placement and helps recognise intradural placement of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the groups will have their respective DRG stimulated for sensory confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Once positioned the physician shall indicate to the RF technician as &quot;treatment&quot;&#xD;
      only, at which time either PRF or placebo (only continuing sensory stimulation at a low&#xD;
      frequency is applied), without revealing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Intervention: In Group A-PRF; PRF would be applied for 120 seconds at 42&#xD;
      degree centigrade. Group B-placebo; the needle would be continuously stimulated at a low&#xD;
      voltage to give a sensation of PRF application and also to obtain the necessary noise to&#xD;
      blind the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only lidocaine 1% 0.5 ml shall be given in both groups before carrying out the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the same procedure is done at all the involved spinal segmental levels. After&#xD;
      the procedure the patient is shifted to recovery area to be monitored, observed and managed&#xD;
      for any side effects. The observer, blind to the interventions, will record the pain scores&#xD;
      and also check for side effects observed before the patient is discharged home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Bias control In our study we plan to blind the patient, the treating physician&#xD;
      and the assessor for the actual intervention being done. The randomization code, hence the&#xD;
      actual treatment will only be known and administered by the person operating the RF machine.&#xD;
      The randomization will be concealed in sealed envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of patients will be achieved by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomly allocated to each group using a 1:1 ratio. The&#xD;
      allocation will be blocked using block sizes of 2, 4, 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions will be similarly, including the use of fluoroscopy. Both interventions&#xD;
      will be done using the same kind of needle and technique of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients belonging to placebo group will have a continuous low voltage stimulation to mask&#xD;
      the effect of &quot;no intervention&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of assessor will be achieved by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will not know the randomization order, Will not be present during the intervention, Will not&#xD;
      be able to access any written or dictated notes regarding the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding of the treating Physician will be achieved by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will not know the randomization order or grouping of patients, Will not be revealed the&#xD;
      treatment applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment period Treatment intervention period will involve approximately 30 mins&#xD;
      to 60 mins of actual intervention done in the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and Frequency of follow up The duration of follow up will be 3 months after the&#xD;
      intervention. The frequency of follow up will be as follows,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient would be assessed post-intervention on the following days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 30 minutes post-procedure in recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24 hrs after-by a phone call (only VAS and side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At 1 week post-procedure-Visit to Observer (VAS, ODI, medications, side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At 4 weeks post-procedure-Visit to Observer -assessment for success (VAS, ODI,&#xD;
           medications, side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. At 2 months post-procedure-Visit to Observer (VAS, ODI, medications, side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At 3 months post -procedure-Visit to Observer-last follow up visit (VAS, ODI,&#xD;
           medications, side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size, Recruitment Rate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size has been determined based on feasibility considerations. Total duration of&#xD;
      recruitment planned is 8 months The proposed target is recruitment for 8 months, with an&#xD;
      expectation of 4 patients/month, making a total of 32 patients for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential to recruit patients, as 4 patients every month has been calculated based on the&#xD;
      TransForaminal Steroid Injections (TFESI) performed in the last 3-6 months and also booked&#xD;
      for the next 3-6 months (calculated as monthly) at St Joseph's Healthcare; data obtained from&#xD;
      St Joseph's Healthcare Department of Anesthesia and Pain Dept Secretary Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFESI represents a well accepted, presently performed intervention for patients of CLR and&#xD;
      most patients suitable for that are potential recruits for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Tests The Characteristics of the trial participants will be described using mean&#xD;
      (standard deviation) or counts as appropriate. We will use a flow diagram to summarize the&#xD;
      flow of patients in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes will be reported as counts (proportions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of The Trial The proposed study would only recruit patients for 8 months and compare&#xD;
      with the expected estimation of the recruitment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) From Baseline to 4 Week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (at recruitment) and at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to: care for oneself, walk, sit, sexual function, stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability.The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

The study of the efficacy of cervical PRF-DRG showed significant results favoring PRF-DRG for a 20% pain reduction in VAS score. It has been noted that a 30% reduction in pain appears to reflect at least a moderate clinically important difference, and this needs to be considered in clinical trials.</description>

        <title>Change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) From Baseline to 4 Week</title>
        <description>ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to: care for oneself, walk, sit, sexual function, stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability.The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

          <description>ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire used to quantify disability for low back pain. The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to: care for oneself, walk, sit, sexual function, stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability.The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
