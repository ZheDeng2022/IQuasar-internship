  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two treatments for dental hypersensitivity:&#xD;
      cyanoacrylate (Super Bonder®) compared with use of low intensity laser treatment (LILT). As&#xD;
      the cyanoacrylate is a lower cost treatment, the hypothesis in investigation is if this&#xD;
      product is equally effective as the laser treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study included 62 patients (15 male and 47 females, aged 12 to 60 years). The&#xD;
      initial cervical dentin hypersensitivity was checked throughout a thermal test (air blast).&#xD;
      The 434 teeth included were that with a score ≥5 in a numerical scale rating of pain. Teeth&#xD;
      were randomly assigned according quadrants (split mouth design) - 216 were allocated to LILT&#xD;
      group and 218 for the Super Bonder® group. Thermal tests with a tetrafluoroethane spray&#xD;
      (Endo-Ice®) and air blast were performed and considered as baseline. Pain parameters were&#xD;
      recorded using a numerical scale rating with 24 hours, 30, 90 and 180 days after the&#xD;
      interventions. Quality of life of the patients was also assessed with the use of OHIP-14 at&#xD;
      baseline and after 180 days.&#xD;

    <description>Change in pain experienced by the participants was calculated as the difference between baseline level of pain sensitivity and after 180 days. Pain was recorded using a numerical pain assessment scale with range between 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The higher the numbering the worse the result.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between the level of quality of life - Oral Health Impact Profile &quot;OHIP&quot; at baseline and 180 days. OHIP-14 total scale ranges from 0 to 56 points with higher scores indicating a poorer oral health-related quality of life. The response format uses a Likert-type frequency scale such as follows: very often = 4, fairly often = 3, occasionally = 2, hardly ever = 1, never = 0. Total score is obtained by summing the response codes of the 14 items constituting the measure.</description>
