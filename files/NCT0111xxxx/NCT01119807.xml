      The objective of this study will be to compare humeral and tibial IO needle insertions to&#xD;
      peripheral IV access during cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis There is a difference in first attempt success of tibial IOs compared to humeral&#xD;
      IOs or peripheral IV among cardiac arrest patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a randomized controlled trial conducted within Mecklenburg County by the&#xD;
      Mecklenburg County EMS Agency (MEDIC). The study population includes all adult (greater than&#xD;
      18 years of age) cardiac arrest patients of a medical etiology upon whom resuscitative&#xD;
      efforts are initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Care Protocols Prehospital protocols for adult cardiac arrest patients within&#xD;
      Mecklenburg County state that all first responders follow advanced cardiac life support&#xD;
      (ACLS) algorithms during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Current MEDIC protocols specify that&#xD;
      initial vascular access be obtained by paramedics via either tibial or humeral IO needle&#xD;
      insertion, followed by peripheral IV for secondary access. This study will randomize initial&#xD;
      vascular access to a humeral IO, tibial IO, or peripheral IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once paramedics arrive on-scene, they will take a pack from the ambulance containing all&#xD;
      necessary supplies to begin resuscitation. These packs are already present on each ambulance&#xD;
      in Mecklenburg County and contain an EZ-IO drill, IO needles, ACLS medications, and KING LTD&#xD;
      airway device. For the purposes of this study, peripheral IV start kits will be added to&#xD;
      these resuscitation packs at the start of study implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 note cards will be prepared in advance and labeled with a vascular access method. [50&#xD;
      cards with &quot;Tibial IO&quot;, 50 cards &quot;Humeral IO&quot;, 50 cards with &quot;Peripheral IV&quot;] Each note card&#xD;
      will be sealed in a blank, numbered envelope. A master list will be prepared in advance&#xD;
      according to envelope number indicating which vascular access method was placed in each&#xD;
      numbered envelope. This list will only be available to the MEDIC Quality Assurance/Quality&#xD;
      Improvement (QA/QI) personnel responsible for paramedic debriefing and recirculation of&#xD;
      unused envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealed envelopes will then be shuffled and placed at the MEDIC circulation window where&#xD;
      resuscitation packs and ambulance equipment are distributed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each crew will randomly select and open an envelope prior to every shift. By opening the&#xD;
      envelope at the start of the day, this will eliminate the possibility of envelopes being left&#xD;
      in the ambulance unit or lost at the scene, as well as prevent delays with patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The envelope number will be recorded at the circulation window indicating the specific MEDIC&#xD;
      ambulance unit and assigned crew.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vascular access route selected will apply to the crew's first cardiac arrest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resuscitation Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paramedics will conduct the resuscitation according to existing procedure, and will proceed&#xD;
      with vascular access as follows depending on the method selected by randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibial IO First attempt will be a tibial IO. Second attempt should occur on the opposite&#xD;
      tibia if the first IO fails. Subsequent attempts will be for a humeral IO or peripheral IV as&#xD;
      selected by the paramedic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humeral IO First attempt will be a humeral IO. Second attempt should occur at the tibia if&#xD;
      the first humeral IO fails. Subsequent attempts will be for a peripheral IV or additional IOs&#xD;
      as determined by the paramedic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral IV First attempt will be a peripheral IV in the AC. If this fails, second attempt&#xD;
      will be a tibial IO, followed by a humeral IO when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is extremely rare for any crew to conduct more than one cardiac arrest on a given&#xD;
      day, the randomized vascular access method will only apply to the first cardiac arrest of the&#xD;
      day. As crews do not return to the distribution center until the end of a shift (12 hours),&#xD;
      it will be impossible to select additional envelopes for subsequent patient encounters.&#xD;
      Paramedics will proceed with vascular access per current MEDIC prehospital protocols for any&#xD;
      further cardiac arrest resuscitations that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a contraindication to the vascular access site selected such as extremity&#xD;
      amputations, orthopedic hardware, skin infection, or traumatic injuries, paramedics will&#xD;
      proceed to the next insertion site as per the above protocol. For instance, if a patient with&#xD;
      bilateral lower extremity amputations is randomized to a tibial IO insertion site, paramedics&#xD;
      will classify this as a failed attempt and proceed to humeral IO, then peripheral IV as&#xD;
      stated above. For patients with isolated skin infections or orthopedic hardware involving one&#xD;
      extremity, paramedics will select the unaffected extremity for the first attempt. Any&#xD;
      unforeseen circumstances will be addressed according to the paramedics' discretion and&#xD;
      reported to the primary investigator immediately. Such occurrences will be included in the&#xD;
      final data analysis for this study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All cardiac arrests of a medical nature in patients greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
             of age occuring in Mecklenburg county, NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Traumatic cardiac arrests - different prehospital protocols exist for resuscitations&#xD;
             involving traumatic arrests (i.e. motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents,&#xD;
             falls, and penetrating injuries including stabbings and gunshot wounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cardiac arrests due to hemorrhage - for the purposes of this study, such arrests are&#xD;
             not considered to be of a &quot;medical etiology&quot; since massive blood loss is the&#xD;
             contributing factor and only rapid volume resuscitation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cardiac arrests involving children or young adults - any patient less than 18 years of&#xD;
             age will be excluded as different prehospital protocols exist for children in cardiac&#xD;
             arrest. Age verification will occur upon data collection using patient date of birth&#xD;
             when available. Any data collected from a patient found to be less than 18 years of&#xD;
             age after resuscitation, will also be excluded from data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with established vascular access prior to cardiac arrest - patients who&#xD;
             deteriorate during transport into cardiac arrest but already have a peripheral IV or&#xD;
             IO needle established will be excluded from the study. Randomization cannot be applied&#xD;
             to these encounters as vascular access has already been selected and documentation by&#xD;
             a sole provider is not possible during transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) - in some circumstances, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
             resuscitation is initially performed on patients until a DNR order is produced. These&#xD;
             patients will be excluded from the study as the full protocol cannot be implemented.&#xD;
