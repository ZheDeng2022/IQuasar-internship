  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib&#xD;
      (VELCADE) in combination with pralatrexate in patients with previously treated multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, AL amyloid and Waldenstroem's macroglobulinemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I dose-escalation safety study of VELCADE in combination with&#xD;
      pralatrexate in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. In a standard 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation trial design, escalating doses of pralatrexate in combination with VELCADE will be&#xD;
      studied sequentially, with at least 3 patients in each dose level until the MTD is&#xD;
      determined. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD are determined during cycle 1 of treatment.&#xD;
