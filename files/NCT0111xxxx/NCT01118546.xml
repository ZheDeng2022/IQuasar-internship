  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin is very effective in protecting patients with coronary artery disease against adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events, because it is a potent &quot;antiplatelet agent&quot;. Some patients may develop a&#xD;
      history of hypersensitivity to aspirin and treatment cannot usually be resumed in these&#xD;
      patients. We have developed a rapid procedure to induce tolerance in these patients&#xD;
      (SILBERMAN et al, Am J CARDIOL 2005;95:509-10) and wish to test whether aspirin is as&#xD;
      effective as antiplatelet agent in patients with a history of allergy to aspirin and who&#xD;
      undergo desensitization as it is in patients without history of hypersensitivity&#xD;

      Previous studies in allergology have proved the safety of desensitization procedures in&#xD;
      allergic patients with an imperative indication for a medication. This tolerance state is&#xD;
      usually obtained after a cumbersome procedure requiring several hours to days. We have&#xD;
      adapted successfully such a procedure to the patients with acute coronary artery disease&#xD;
      requiring urgent aspirin (excluding the ST elevation myocardial infarction) (SILBERMAN et al,&#xD;
      Am J CARDIOL 2005;95:509-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a history of Aspirin or NonSteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs hypersensitivity&#xD;
      appear to have alterations of eicosanoid metabolism : these drugs trigger an imbalance toward&#xD;
      the leucotriene pathway. This case-control study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate after desensitization therapy the anti-aggregant effect of aspirin in these&#xD;
           very particular patients : clinical outcome, PFA test, levels of the urinary metabolite&#xD;
           of thromboxane A2 (11 dehydro thromboxane B2) and also usual aggregation tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the in VITRO basophil activation induced by aspirin before and after&#xD;
           desensitization procedure by flow cytometric cellular allergen test using basophils&#xD;
           surface marker and mediators' dosage. Before the challenge procedure these tests aim to&#xD;
           confirm the clinically established diagnosis of hypersensitivity. After desensitization,&#xD;
           these tests intend to better assess the efficiency of the induced tolerance, to attempt&#xD;
           to identify predictors of successful desensitization as well as identify potential cross&#xD;
           reactivity with other NSAIDs..&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is indicated in all patients with aspirin or NSAID intolerance with imperative&#xD;
      cardiological indications for aspirin, such as acute coronary syndrome, or placement of a&#xD;
      stent. The desensitization procedure must be performed in a coronary care unit; the patients&#xD;
      are duly informed about benefits and risks of the challenge and provide written informed&#xD;
      consent. Desensitization consists in rapidly escalating aspirin dose administration with ad&#xD;
      hoc aspirin capsules prepared by the hospital pharmacist. Blood and urinary samples are&#xD;
      obtained during the hospital stay for coronary and desensitization care. An additional blood&#xD;
      and urine sample will be obtained 6 to 8 weeks later during an outpatient visit in the&#xD;
      laboratory. Initial biological data will be compared to those of two control groups matched&#xD;
      for age, gender and type of acute coronary syndrome :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls 1: patients with CAD on aspirin, without history of hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controls 2: patients without CAD, not on aspirin and without history of&#xD;
           hypersensitivity.&#xD;
