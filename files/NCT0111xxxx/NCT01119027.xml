      The purpose of this study is to improve the investigators understanding of different training&#xD;
      methods in laparoscopic colon surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators use an objective evaluation system which deconstructs&#xD;
      laparoscopic colectomy into its component steps. Critical components of the procedure as well&#xD;
      as overall operative performance can be evaluated. This is applied to surgeons and trainee&#xD;
      surgeons attending laparoscopic colorectal training courses using different training models&#xD;
      to compare each model and correlate outcomes with each model to pre-course experience. This&#xD;
      project is aimed at better educating trainers and getting better information on the validity&#xD;
      of new training models for laparoscopic colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of Project&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe and assess surgical technique during laparoscopic colorectal skills training&#xD;
           courses using a previously validated tool for formal assessment of surgical technical&#xD;
           skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate technical errors and patterns of error during training at laparoscopic&#xD;
           colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine outcomes and error rates with different training models and correlate these&#xD;
           with prior surgical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants/subjects in research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited in several sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the principal investigators facility at University Hospitals of Cleveland Case Medical&#xD;
           Center, where surgeons from outside institutions visit regularly for training courses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Laparoscopic&#xD;
           colorectal training courses, where surgeons participate in courses with invited faculty&#xD;
           at national meetings (the PI is national Program Director and runs these courses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  American Society of Colorectal Surgeons (ASCRS) Laparoscopic colorectal training&#xD;
           courses, where surgeons participate in courses with invited faculty at national meetings&#xD;
           (the PI is national Program Director and runs these courses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course attendees will be informed before the start of an appropriate laparoscopic course that&#xD;
      the study is being performed. The study will be explained to them in detail and they will be&#xD;
      given a copy of the appropriate paperwork to review. Verbal consent will be requested. It&#xD;
      will be explained to them that they should feel under no pressure to participate in the&#xD;
      study, and that if they do participate that these data are not used for their evaluation. The&#xD;
      number of cases of components of cases that they perform will not be related to participation&#xD;
      or non-participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an observational study in which trainees' technical surgical skills are&#xD;
      evaluated while performing specific steps of laparoscopic colectomy cases, as outlined in the&#xD;
      accompanying datasheets. The plan is to enroll 200 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of each case, forms will be completed by the trainee, and by the teaching /&#xD;
      supervising surgeon. Independent observers cannot be used, as only an attending laparoscopic&#xD;
      colorectal surgeon is adequately skilled to score the resident performing the case, and it is&#xD;
      not feasible to have a second attending surgeon present during each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr Delaney will score trainees when possible using the standardized form. For courses at&#xD;
      University Hospitals Case Medical Center (UHCMC), the colorectal faculty will be instructed&#xD;
      in standardized assessment, and will also assess trainees. For courses at SAGES or ASCRS, the&#xD;
      course faculty will be shown the training assessments and directed in the standardized&#xD;
      assessment prior to evaluations.&#xD;
