  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study designed to assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of an oral Aripiprazole/Escitalopram combination therapy in&#xD;
      participants with MDD who have demonstrated an incomplete response to a prospective trial of&#xD;
      Escitalopram, and report a treatment history for the current MDD episode of an inadequate&#xD;
      response to at least one and no more than three adequate trials of an approved antidepressant&#xD;
      other than Escitalopram. An inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptom severity as assessed by the participant's self-report on the Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) and evaluated by the&#xD;
      investigator as part of the participant's medical and psychiatric history. An adequate trial&#xD;
      is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 6 weeks duration (or at least 3 weeks&#xD;
      for combination treatments) at an approved dose as specified in the ATRQ.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Mean Change From End of Phase B (Week 8) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score to End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS assessed severity of depressive symptoms. It ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60 (higher scores indicating a greater severity of depressive symptoms). Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Mean Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Scale Score at the End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a 7-point clinician-rated scale ranging from 1 to 7, rated as 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. A higher score indicates greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase C: Mean Change From End of Phase B (Week 8) in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Mean Score to End of Phase C (Week 14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>SDS is a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. The participant is asked to rate the degree to which their functioning is impaired on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The scores for the 3 domains are summed into a total score that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). A higher score indicates greater impairment. A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants received initial dose of escitalopram 10 milligram (mg) blinded capsule (over-encapsulated tablet), orally, once daily, increased to 20 mg/day at the end of Week 1 based upon tolerability profile, for up to maximum of Week 8. No dose reductions were allowed after Week 4 and no dose increments were allowed after Week 3. Participants with incomplete response at the end of the Phase B (Week 8) entered Phase C and the rest of the participants continued to Phase B+.</description>

    <description>Participants with incomplete response (less than 50% reduction in depressive symptom severity between Baseline and Week 8 measured by the HAM-D17 Total Score and HAM-D17 Total Score of ≥14 at Week 8 and CGI-I Score of ≥3 at Week 6 and 8) at Week 8 received initial dose of aripiprazole 6 mg blinded capsule, orally, once daily at Week 9. Participants were up titrated to aripiprazole target dose of 12 mg/day at Week 10 (if initial 6 mg/day dose was tolerated) or down titrated to 3 mg/day (if significant tolerability issues arise on initial 6 mg/day dose), and thereafter received same dose up to maximum of Week 14. No dose increases were allowed for aripiprazole after end of Week 12, however, doses might be decreased at any visit based upon tolerability. In combination with aripiprazole, participants received escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day blinded capsules) taken during final week of Phase B for up to maximum Week 14, in Phase C. No dose adjustments allowed for escitalopram during Phase C.</description>

Participants were up titrated to aripiprazole target dose of 12 mg/day at Week 10 (if initial 6 mg/day dose was tolerated) or down titrated to 3 mg/day (if significant tolerability issues arise on initial 6 mg/day dose), and thereafter received same dose up to maximum of Week 14. No dose increases were allowed for aripiprazole after end of Week 12, however, doses might be decreased at any visit based upon tolerability. In combination with aripiprazole, participants received escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day blinded capsules) taken during final week of Phase B for up to maximum Week 14, in Phase C. No dose adjustments allowed for escitalopram during Phase C.</description>

        <description>The MADRS assessed severity of depressive symptoms. It ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60 (higher scores indicating a greater severity of depressive symptoms). Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement.</description>

Participants were up titrated to aripiprazole target dose of 12 mg/day at Week 10 (if initial 6 mg/day dose was tolerated) or down titrated to 3 mg/day (if significant tolerability issues arise on initial 6 mg/day dose), and thereafter received same dose up to maximum of Week 14. No dose increases were allowed for aripiprazole after end of Week 12, however, doses might be decreased at any visit based upon tolerability. In combination with aripiprazole, participants received escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day blinded capsules) taken during final week of Phase B for up to maximum Week 14, in Phase C.

        <description>SDS is a 3-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility. The participant is asked to rate the degree to which their functioning is impaired on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The scores for the 3 domains are summed into a total score that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). A higher score indicates greater impairment. A negative change from Week 8 indicates improvement.</description>

In combination with aripiprazole, participants received escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day blinded capsules) taken during final week of Phase B for up to maximum Week 14, in Phase C. No dose adjustments allowed for escitalopram during Phase C.</description>
