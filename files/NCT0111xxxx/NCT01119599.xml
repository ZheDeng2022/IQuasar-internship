    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling&#xD;
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) when given together with temozolomide and radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. Enzyme inhibitors, such&#xD;
      as gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097, may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving gamma-secretase/Notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together with temozolomide and radiation therapy may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-SURGERY TREATMENT: Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor&#xD;
      RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 of week 1 and day 1 of week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery 2-3 hours after administration of gamma-secretase/Notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 on day 1 of week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT CONCURRENT WITH RADIOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients undergo&#xD;
      conventional focal (intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT] or 3-D conformal)&#xD;
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks. Patients also receive&#xD;
      gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD for approximately 10 weeks&#xD;
      beginning the day of radiotherapy and temozolomide PO QD for approximately 6 weeks beginning&#xD;
      the day before radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT TREATMENT FOLLOWING RADIOTHERAPY: Approximately 4 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097&#xD;
      PO QD on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
