  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the present time, scientific consensus exists on obesity multifactorial etiopatogenia. As&#xD;
      well, professionals and researchers agree that the treatment must approach several scopes,&#xD;
      such as dietetic, physical activity, pharmacologic and surgical. These two last ones should&#xD;
      not be the first election and must be reserved for those cases of morbid obesities or in case&#xD;
      the previous ones have failed. The combination of diet and exercise is still not sufficiently&#xD;
      studied, in special, the addition of strength training, as we propose in this project, for&#xD;
      which established intervention protocols do not exist, and that could suppose an additional&#xD;
      benefit in the reduction of risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives that we aim in this project are enumerated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To discover which are the most effective training protocols and to determine what type&#xD;
           of exercise combined with nutrition is more appropriate for obesity intervention&#xD;
           programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the relationship between markers related with cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           (adopokines and lipid profile) and the different intervention protocols proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the influence of nine genetic polymorphisms (selected by their relationship&#xD;
           with the energy expense and the physical yield) on the effect of different training&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how important is body composition (fat mass and muscle mass mainly) in&#xD;
           total daily energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish rules of nutritional and exercise intervention that can be applied in&#xD;
           public and private training centers. If the proposed objectives are fulfilled, this&#xD;
           would contribute to an improvement in patients health in long term, along with an&#xD;
           enormous saving in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to propose&#xD;
           new lines of intervention in overweight and obese adults that, until now, little have&#xD;
           been investigated. This way, resistance training is proposed in combination with&#xD;
           cardiovascular training and endocrinologic treatment. It fits to emphasize that, as far&#xD;
           as we know, it is the first project of these characteristics, that puts in touch the&#xD;
           public and private sector (hospitals, universities and fitness area), to establish&#xD;
           standardized relations protocols to allow a close pursuit of obese patients.&#xD;
