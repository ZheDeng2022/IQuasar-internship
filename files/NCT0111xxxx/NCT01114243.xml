    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a serious autoimmune childhood disease that&#xD;
      encompasses several types of chronic arthritis. It is the most common rheumatic disease in&#xD;
      children and can cause significant short-term and long-term disability, including permanent&#xD;
      joint damage. Management of JIA is based on a combination of pharmacologic interventions,&#xD;
      physical and occupational therapy, and psychosocial support. Intra-articular steroid (IAS)&#xD;
      injection, or injection of steroid medication into an arthritic joint, is a routine&#xD;
      therapeutic procedure in clinical rheumatology. Most pediatric rheumatologists currently&#xD;
      perform injections based on knowledge of anatomy and by feeling for anatomical landmarks, but&#xD;
      results from adult studies on ultrasound (US)-guided technique have suggested a role for&#xD;
      using US in treating and managing JIA. The overall goal of this project is to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a multicenter study comparing US-guided IAS injection with the usual technique&#xD;
      of using external anatomic features to improve arthritis symptoms in JIA. The key issues that&#xD;
      this pilot project will determine will be: 1) the ability to use US to successfully image and&#xD;
      detect abnormalities in the joints in children with JIA 2) image the injected medication in&#xD;
      the joint space or its surroundings immediately after the injection 3) determine methods to&#xD;
      measure the clinical response to injection 4) evaluate the feasibility of using saved US&#xD;
      scans to localize injected medication in or around the joints and to determine abnormalities&#xD;
      concerning for arthritis. These results will be used to establish the protocols necessary to&#xD;
      design a multicenter study to determine the effect of US-guided IAS injection in the&#xD;
      treatment of juvenile arthritis. Studies regarding the applicability and feasibility of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal US in an outpatient pediatric rheumatology setting are important in order to&#xD;
      establish the utility of this new technology in guiding diagnosis and therapy in JIA. Results&#xD;
      from this study may have a significant impact on pediatric rheumatology and the way by which&#xD;
      pediatric rheumatologists currently assess signs of arthritis and perform routine therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

      AIM 1: The first aim will be a two-part cross-sectional study comparing US imaging of active&#xD;
      joints in 55 subjects with JIA to standardized clinical and functional measures, assuming&#xD;
      that each subject will have at least 1 active joint. Subjects less than 21 years diagnosed&#xD;
      with JIA per classification described by the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR)&#xD;
      with large and medium joint synovitis will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1. A pediatric rheumatologist will examine 25 subjects with a spectrum of&#xD;
           arthritis severity after informed consent is obtained. Large and medium joints, such as&#xD;
           knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows, will be assessed for active arthritis, as defined by&#xD;
           swelling or limitation of motion with pain or warmth. Grading of clinical severity is&#xD;
           derived from the ACR Pediatric 30 and will assess for swelling on a scale of 0-3 and&#xD;
           limitation of motion with warmth or pain on motion on a scale of 0-3. Based on this&#xD;
           grading, a Clinical Severity Score for inactive, mild, moderate, or severe arthritis&#xD;
           will be obtained for each joint. Following the clinical evaluation, a pediatric&#xD;
           rheumatologist who has received training in musculoskeletal US (PI) will image the&#xD;
           joint. A portable US machine with a high frequency probe (6-18 MHz) and power Doppler&#xD;
           capability will be used to image the target joints and to identify anatomical signs&#xD;
           suggestive of arthritis. At least 2 views, coronal and transverse, of each joint will be&#xD;
           obtained and recorded per musculoskeletal US specifications as described by the European&#xD;
           League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). US images will be saved under a subject code on the&#xD;
           US machine hard drive. These images will be reviewed with a consulting rheumatologist&#xD;
           with expertise in musculoskeletal US (J. Nishio, MD). US determination of synovitis&#xD;
           (synovial thickness with Doppler enhancement), effusion, erosions, and tenosynovitis&#xD;
           will be based on definitions established by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis&#xD;
           Clinical Trials (OMERACT) 7 consensus group for adults with rheumatologic disease. An US&#xD;
           score for arthritis will then be developed based on the gold standard of clinical exam.&#xD;
           The US score will assess for active arthritis as defined by synovitis on a scale of 0-3&#xD;
           and/or effusion on a scale of 0-3. In addition, other significant abnormalities in the&#xD;
           joints will be evaluated, including absence or presence of erosions and tenosynovitis.&#xD;
           The result of this phase of Aim 1 will be the creation of an US Severity Score for&#xD;
           inactive, mild, moderate, or severe arthritis in a single large or medium joint that is&#xD;
           consistent with the Clinical Severity Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II. The US Severity Score developed as described above will be tested for&#xD;
           correlation with the Clinical Severity Score. An additional 30 subjects meeting&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be enrolled and assessed for arthritis by physical exam&#xD;
           performed by a pediatric rheumatologist followed by an US exam performed by the PI. If&#xD;
           the subject has more than 1 large or medium joint with arthritis, a single joint will be&#xD;
           chosen by random selection. Based on the findings, the clinician will assign a clinical&#xD;
           score, and the PI and the consulting rheumatologist will assign an US score based on the&#xD;
           standardized US Severity Score obtained from Phase I. The PI and consulting&#xD;
           rheumatologist will be masked to physical exam findings and the Clinical Severity Score.&#xD;
           The US score will then be compared to the clinical score to assess how the US scoring&#xD;
           relates with the standardized clinical measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: The second aim will study the use of US in imaging the placement of IAS and response&#xD;
      to this therapy in 20 subjects receiving IAS for treatment of active arthritis in large and&#xD;
      medium joints. Patients less than 21 years old with a diagnosis of JIA per ILAR&#xD;
      classification receiving IAS injections of the knee, wrist, elbow, or ankle as part of their&#xD;
      standard medical care will be eligible. Non-eligible patients include subjects with a&#xD;
      non-inflammatory diagnosis, such as mechanical joint disease, or a large joint effusion&#xD;
      requiring additional therapeutic procedures, such as arthrocentesis. Informed consent and&#xD;
      assent for children over 7 will be obtained. The targeted joint will be scored by a&#xD;
      rheumatologist other than the PI using the Clinical Severity Score described above. Sedation&#xD;
      may be provided per routine for joint injection. Routine process for joint injection will be&#xD;
      followed. The pediatric rheumatologist performing the injection will use standard external&#xD;
      clinical landmarks and palpation to identify the appropriate injection site. Triamcinolone&#xD;
      hexacetonide with 1% unbuffered lidocaine will then be shaken to allow the introduction of&#xD;
      air per GAS-graphy technique as described by Koski et al. and injected into the targeted&#xD;
      joint. The PI, who will not perform any injections in this study, will obtain US imaging just&#xD;
      prior and immediately following the joint injection. The rheumatologist performing the&#xD;
      injection will be masked to US images. Each image will be obtained and recorded using EULAR&#xD;
      specifications, saved under a subject code on the US machine hard drive, and scored by the PI&#xD;
      and the consulting rheumatologist using the US Severity Score described above. For the second&#xD;
      aim, I will also determine the presence or absence of steroid within the target joint&#xD;
      capsule. The physician performing the physical exam, the subject, and the subject's&#xD;
      guardian(s) will be masked regarding US results, including location of steroid within or&#xD;
      around the joint space and sonographic recordings of joint pathology. Patient outcomes will&#xD;
      be determined at 1 week, 4-6 weeks and 3-6 months by the Clinical Severity Score and by US&#xD;
      using the US Severity Score described and developed in Aim 1. The clinician performing the&#xD;
      physical exam and the sonographer will be masked to each other's scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other variables will also be collected as part of both aims, including pain as assessed by a&#xD;
      standardized pain scale, physician assessment of global disease activity, and functional&#xD;
      status as determined by the childhood health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ), a validated,&#xD;
      reliable measure of functional status in JIA. These last assessments are 3 of the 6 measures&#xD;
      of the ACR Pediatric 30, a validated measure used in clinical trials in JIA (Giannini et al.,&#xD;
      1997). Other patient data that will be collected include JIA subtype, duration of disease,&#xD;
      age of onset, age at procedure, race/ethnicity, concurrent medications, and whether the&#xD;
      procedure required the use of general anesthesia.&#xD;
