  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of techniques have been recommended for the prevention of ventilator acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia (VAP). These techniques - such as patient positioning, continuous sub-glottic&#xD;
      suction of the secretions, selective decontamination of the digestive tract etc… - aim at&#xD;
      prevent the inhalation of oro-pharyngeal contaminated secretions around the cuff of the&#xD;
      tracheal tube used for connecting the patient to the machine. Their efficacy has been&#xD;
      regularly challenged and they are still unable to suppress totally the occurrence of VAP. The&#xD;
      cuff of the tracheal tube used for long-term MV in the ICU is most often a low pressure high&#xD;
      volume polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cuff in order to adhere to a large surface of the tracheal&#xD;
      wall without inducing ischemic lesions. Recent advances allowed industrial companies to&#xD;
      provide us with 1) polyurethane cuffs and 2) cuffs with a conic shape, both potentially&#xD;
      offering a better tightness against inhalation at least in VITRO and in animal models. The&#xD;
      effect on the reduction of VAP incidence has been suggested by several pilot series. The aim&#xD;
      of the present project is to assess the efficacy of four types of cuffs (PVC with a conic or&#xD;
      a cylinder shape and polyurethane with a conic or a cylinder shape) to prevent tracheal&#xD;
      colonisation. We shall measure both oro-pharyngeal and tracheal colonisation during the hours&#xD;
      and days following intubation. This will be done in 600 ICU patients of four university&#xD;
      affiliated centres from France and Tunisia divided in 64 cluster randomized groups. The&#xD;
      results of this research will confirm (or not) the rationale to perform a larger study&#xD;
      designed specifically to address the impact on VAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term mechanical ventilation (MV) is a risk factor for acquisition of bacterial pneumonia&#xD;
      because the tracheal tube by-passes the natural mechanisms of airway protection, and&#xD;
      particularly epiglottis and trachea-bronchial mucosa. Acute respiratory failure and potential&#xD;
      associated organ dysfunctions require that MV patients are sedated and sometimes in strict&#xD;
      horizontal supine position. Sedation and conscience alteration do not permit to swallow&#xD;
      oro-pharyngeal secretions, and horizontal position favors bacterial colonization and&#xD;
      secretions stagnation in the posterior part of the pharynx. These aspects favor iterative&#xD;
      inhalation of oro-pharyngeal secretions around the cuff of the tracheal tube. The cuff, which&#xD;
      principal objective is to permit the pressurization of lower respiratory tract during the&#xD;
      inspiratory phase by preventing air leak around the tracheal tube, allows a certain degree of&#xD;
      protection of the tracheal tree against micro-inhalations. Using diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
      Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) based on distal protected samples, their incidence is&#xD;
      around 10 per 1,000 MV-days in medical-surgical ICUs. These VAP are associated to an&#xD;
      attributable mortality around 25%. A number of recommendations have been established to&#xD;
      prevent VAP occurrence. The 45° semi-recumbent positioning of the patient 's reduces&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux and VAP incidence. This result is limited by the fact that a 45°&#xD;
      inclination is not routinely obtained in every patients (30° would not give the same result )&#xD;
      and that several studies have shown conflicting results. The continuous suction of the&#xD;
      secretions above the cuff is very logical but its efficacy has been challenged, partly&#xD;
      because technical failures due to the occlusion of the aspiration system and because gravity&#xD;
      prevents the tracheal secretions clearance. The selective decontamination of the digestive&#xD;
      tract is effective particularly to prevent early VAP, but is limited by its potential role in&#xD;
      the global increase in resistance to antibiotics. Oral decontamination with Chlorhexidine or&#xD;
      iodine polyvidon reduce VAP. Using drugs which increases the gastric pH to prevent stress&#xD;
      ulcers favors gastric bacterial growth and VAP. Using gastric pro-kinetics or post-pyloric&#xD;
      enteral nutrition do not reduce VAP. Alternate prone positioning, has not been proven to&#xD;
      improve the outcome of ARDS patients but reduces the incidence of VAP, potentially because it&#xD;
      favors pharyngeal drainage through the mouth. The use of heat and moisture exchangers to&#xD;
      limit airways drying with ventilation, seems better than heat humidifiers to reduce VAP.&#xD;
      Recently, the use of an positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was shown to reduce the&#xD;
      volume on inhalations around the cuff. Finally, mask ventilation, by preserving upper airways&#xD;
      integrity, in those cases it allows a sufficient ventilation replacement, is associated to a&#xD;
      substantial reduction in VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those patients ventilated through an oro-tracheal tube, the rational use of the above&#xD;
      mentioned techniques allows to reach a low VAP incidence rate, but not to completely&#xD;
      eradicate these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cuffs of the tracheal tubes which are currently recommended and routinely used in&#xD;
      long-term (more than 2 days) ventilation are made of polyvinyl chloride and have a high&#xD;
      volume cylindrical shape, allowing a low pressure after inflation, designed to cover the&#xD;
      tracheal wall without inducing ischemic lesions of the tracheal mucosa. Such lesions are&#xD;
      responsible for laryngeal edema - a clinical stridor after extubation occurs in around 12% of&#xD;
      patients -, and rarely for granuloma and stenosis which induce sequelae which are disabling&#xD;
      and/or difficult to repair with surgery. The use of tube coated with antiseptics is currently&#xD;
      under investigation. Protection against tracheal lesions induced by the tracheal tube&#xD;
      requires a regular and frequent assessment of the cuff pressure over the day and night time.&#xD;
      Recent experimental studies showed that these cuffs are bad protectors against&#xD;
      micro-inhalations around the cuff. Several companies provide us with new polyurethane cuff&#xD;
      tubes, which physical characteristics are associated - in VITRO, on animal tracheas, and&#xD;
      during general anesthesia to a better tightness than polyvinyl chloride cuffs. They also&#xD;
      provide us with conic shaped cuffs, made out of either PVC or polyurethane. Authors found&#xD;
      that the Hi-Lo and the SEALGUARD cuffs have similar capabilities to prevent against methylene&#xD;
      blue leakage, and others did not find a preventive effect of the pressure control of the&#xD;
      Hi-Lo cuff against VAP. A reduction of early VAP was observed in one series after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the tracheal tubes with a polyurethane and/or a conic shaped cuff are&#xD;
      associated with a lower colonization of the tracheal tree during the days following tracheal&#xD;
      intubation, than tubes with a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride cuff. The patients will be&#xD;
      allocated to randomized clusters into four groups : 1) cylindrical PVC cuff, 2) cylindrical&#xD;
      polyurethane cuff, 3) conic PVC cuff and 4) conic polyurethane cuff. In the four groups, the&#xD;
      tubes will be inserted with the conventional technique of tracheal intubation under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and direct laryngoscopy, inside the ICU. The tube cuff will be immediately&#xD;
      inflated to a 25 cm of water or at the plateau pressure level of the ventilator in case it is&#xD;
      higher than 25 cm of water according to the current recommendations. The tracheal tube will&#xD;
      be connected to the ventilator, set in a volume or pressure control mode with a minimal PEEP&#xD;
      of 5 cm of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted according to the protocol, following the good clinical&#xD;
      practices and current recommendations about MV and Intensive Care practices proposed by the&#xD;
      French Society of Intensive Care Medicine (www.srlf.org) and the European Society of&#xD;
      Intensive Care Medicine (www.ESICM.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal endpoint(s) : quantitative assessment of bacterial colonization in the&#xD;
      oro-pharyngeal (above the cuff) and tracheal (below the cuff) secretions at 2 hours (H2), 1&#xD;
      day (D1), D2 and D3 after intubation. The collection of the secretions above and below the&#xD;
      cuff will allow to document the origin of the tracheal bacteria. The bacterial quantity at&#xD;
      each sampling will be compared between the patients groups to establish the role of the cuff&#xD;
      in the antibacterial protection of the lower airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oro-pharyngeal and tracheal samples will be performed 2 hours after oro-pharyngeal&#xD;
      application of Chlorhexidine and a tracheal aspiration. Bacterial cultures will be done on&#xD;
      standard media and the quantitative cultures will be carried out by serial dilution of the&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP occurrence : the diagnosis of VAP will be based on the positive results of a protected&#xD;
      specimen brush (over 103 cfu/mL) or a broncho-alveolar lavage (over 2 % infected cells or&#xD;
      over 104 cfu/mL). Distal bronchial samples will be performed under fiberoptic bronchoscopy&#xD;
      when several of the following criteria suggestive VAP will be present, corresponding to a&#xD;
      CPIS score at least equal to 6 : fever, new chest X-ray opacity, hyper-leucocytosis, arterial&#xD;
      oxygenation alteration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over cluster randomization : an individual randomization is almost impossible to&#xD;
      achieve, because of the emergency setting of any decision of tracheal intubation in the ICU.&#xD;
      Therefore we chose to ascribe random periods during which every tracheal tubes of the ICU&#xD;
      will be those of the study protocol for the given period. The random plan will be different&#xD;
      in each participating ICU. Each ICU will have to perform periods of 10 patients. Each ICU&#xD;
      intend to recruit 10 patients in periods of around 2 months. The physicians in charge of the&#xD;
      patients will be kept blind of the bacteriological samples results. This will prevent them to&#xD;
      modify their clinical practices according to these results and particularly to influence&#xD;
      their clinical suspicion of VAP and/or stridor.&#xD;
