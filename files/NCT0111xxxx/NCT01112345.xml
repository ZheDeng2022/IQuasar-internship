  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess the adherence to therapy with interferon beta-1a (Rebif®)&#xD;
      and at investigating potential factors that are involved in its outcome, in a representative&#xD;
      sample of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), under real life&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the relapsing-remitting type of the disease the objective of the therapy is the reduction&#xD;
      of relapse rate, duration and severity, as well as the delay of transition to the progressive&#xD;
      form of the disease. Subjects' adherence to long-term therapy of MS plays a pivotal role in&#xD;
      the optimization of therapeutic outcome and maximization of the derived clinical benefit for&#xD;
      the treated subjects. Rebif current formulation has been developed by assessing and refining&#xD;
      the physicochemical characteristics of existing formulations aiming at further improving&#xD;
      product's tolerability profile. Studies performed for the assessment of Rebif have&#xD;
      demonstrated a 3-fold reduction in injection site reactions as well as improved overall&#xD;
      tolerability and safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, prospective, non interventional, non randomized, open label study for&#xD;
      the assessment of the adherence to therapy with Rebif of subjects with RRMS. The&#xD;
      participating subjects shall be already on treatment with (Rebif) prior to their enrolment&#xD;
      into the study, according to the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and the&#xD;
      clinical, imaging and laboratory findings of the disease, as evaluated by their treating&#xD;
      physician, in real life clinical practice. Data will be collected retrospectively from a&#xD;
      sample of 150 subjects' medical files and through questions that will be posed to the&#xD;
      subjects, and prospectively during the course of the study. The total duration of the study&#xD;
      is estimated to be 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the compliance and persistence with Rebif therapy in MS subjects, after six&#xD;
           months of therapy, in &quot;real life&quot; clinical settings in Greece&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the potential factors influencing compliance and persistence to Rebif&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
