  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-interventional study is to evaluate daily symptom&#xD;
      variability in COPD patients. The secondary objectives are; to evaluate effects of COPD&#xD;
      symptoms on the morning activities of patients, to determine therapeutic expectations of&#xD;
      patients and physicians in COPD, to determine which and how frequent non-drug approaches are&#xD;
      recommended in order to prevent COPD exacerbations, to define COPD patient profiles about the&#xD;
      below-mentioned issues: Demographic characteristics, Disease characteristics, Concomitant&#xD;
      diseases and implemented drug treatments. All patients, who apply to the study physicians and&#xD;
      fulfill all patient selection criteria during patient enrolment period, will be included.&#xD;
      Patients, who provide all of the following measures will be included in the study: To apply&#xD;
      to a physician for outpatient treatment for any reason, Age over 45 years, being diagnosed&#xD;
      with COPD, being a smoker or used to be a smoker once (&gt; 10 package years), to give consent&#xD;
      for the use of their medical data. The patients that exhibit the following exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study: COPD exacerbations still on-going or experienced in the last&#xD;
      3 months (Exacerbation is defined as worsening of COPD symptoms leading to antibiotic and/or&#xD;
      short-term oral steroid treatment and/or hospitalization or admission to the emergency&#xD;
      unit.); Presence of lung cancer or an important respiratory disease such as bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis; Participation&#xD;
      in an interventional clinical trial at present and Enrollment in this study once. In this&#xD;
      study, patients will be recorded at their visit to the physician and there will be no&#xD;
      follow-up thereafter.&#xD;
