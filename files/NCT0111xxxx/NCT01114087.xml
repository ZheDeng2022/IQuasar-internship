  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the possible deleterious effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on sperm&#xD;
      concentration, after 6 months of therapy, which corresponds to 2 cycles of spermatogenesis&#xD;
      and on the sperm nuclear integrity. The main comparison criterion will be the mean difference&#xD;
      in sperm concentration before and after the 6 month treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antityrosine - kinases, such as imatinib are presently the gold standard therapy of chronic&#xD;
      myeloid leukaemia (CML), with complete cytogenetic responses being achieved in 70-90% of&#xD;
      patients receiving the drug as first -line monotherapy. Imatinib selectively inhibits the&#xD;
      hybrid oncogen BCR/ABL involved in the genesis of CML and other tyrosine kinases, such as&#xD;
      c-kit and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PGDF-R), involved in malignant gastro&#xD;
      intestinal stromal tumours (GIST) . Despite its good tolerance, in vivo animal studies have&#xD;
      proved that imatinib induces teratogenesis and dose-related effect on spermatogenesis. In&#xD;
      humans, few pregnancies involving male CML patients have been reported with one spontaneous&#xD;
      abortion, one case of gut malrotation and 15 healthy children. However, in the absence of&#xD;
      detailed and definite evidence of the lack of deleterious effect of imatinib on&#xD;
      spermatogenesis and sperm nuclear integrity in humans, specific studies are warranted. Male&#xD;
      patients (38) will be included in this study if they are 18 to 60 years old, presenting with&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukaemia or malignant GIST and receiving for the first time a treatment by&#xD;
      imatinib, a tyrosin-kinase inhibitor, preceded or not by hydroxyurea therapy for less than&#xD;
      one month. These patients should have signed the informed consent and be covered by the&#xD;
      French social security system. In this open prospective study, each patient will be his own&#xD;
      control. The effect of imatinib on the spermatogenesis will be evaluated by the concentration&#xD;
      of spermatozoa before the beginning of the treatment and after 6 months of imatinib,&#xD;
      representing 2 cycles of spermatogenesis. Patients will be recruited by the&#xD;
      onco-haematologists (5 corresponding centres) and referred to the CECOS Tenon. A medical&#xD;
      investigator will collect the informed consent and fill the study file. A classical sperm&#xD;
      analysis, according to OMS, will be performed. A sample of the ejaculate will be fixed for&#xD;
      further analysis of the percentage of sperm nuclei with fragmented DNA (TUNEL procedure). The&#xD;
      rest of the semen will be frozen, packaged in straws and stored in liquid nitrogen to be&#xD;
      used, if necessary, by the patient if an ART is mandatory to conceive a child.Another sperm&#xD;
      recovery will be performed after a period of 6 months under the anti tyrosine-kinase (ATK)&#xD;
      therapy and the same sperm analysis will be carried out and the results compared to the first&#xD;
      evaluation, before ATK. The plasmatic concentration of imatinib will be determined, for each&#xD;
      patient, the day of the second sperm recovery to check the efficiency of ATK administration.&#xD;
