  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects meeting criteria will be enrolled and randomized to one of two&#xD;
      different suctioning schemes, either continuous or intermittent. Accumulated secretions will&#xD;
      be collected above the cuff on the breathing tube by one of the two methods depending on&#xD;
      which group the subject is randomized into. Secretions will continue to be collected at&#xD;
      predetermined periods of time for the duration of surgery in order to characterize the pH and&#xD;
      volume as well as the micro-organism content.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of pneumonia and other infections from intubation in the intraoperative&#xD;
      setting has not been well-studied. An understanding of the content of the fluid that&#xD;
      accumulates above the cuff in this setting will further strengthen the relationship between&#xD;
      intubation and infection. The purpose of this study is to characterize the content of fluid&#xD;
      extracted from the endotracheal tube cuff during surgery. This study will also evaluate the&#xD;
      content of the fluid across various intervals of suctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suctioning Schemes -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous Suctioning Anesthesia staff will suction secretions continuously at 20 mmHg&#xD;
           with a safety stop of 5 seconds every 30 minutes. Staff will be responsible for&#xD;
           monitoring the interval between each safety stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermittent Suctioning Anesthesia staff will suction secretions intermittently using an&#xD;
           intermittent suction regulator. The regulator will be set to suction at 100-150 mmHg.&#xD;
           The regulator has a preset cycle of intermittent suctioning for 15 seconds with an 8&#xD;
           second pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized clinical study of 48 subjects at a single site in the United&#xD;
      States. Those placing the tube and performing the suctioning schemes will be experienced&#xD;
      study staff and have met all training requirements to ensure consistency. Subjects will be&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery requiring intubation using the TaperGuard Evac Endotracheal Tube&#xD;
      for a minimum of two hours, but no longer than twelve hours. They must also be 18 years of&#xD;
      age or older, able to provide consent and have no presence of tracheostomy. Pregnant subjects&#xD;
      will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suctioning will begin as soon as the tube is in place and will continue until extubation or&#xD;
      until the patient is moved from the operating room, whichever comes earlier. Secretions will&#xD;
      be collected in a Lukens Trap. Anesthesia staff will collect the accumulated secretions every&#xD;
      30 minutes for the duration of the surgery, and secretions will be processed according to the&#xD;
      instructions provided in the sample collection kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the first objective of the study, the first and last sample obtained from each&#xD;
      subject will be analyzed individually for pH, volume, and microorganisms; all other samples&#xD;
      will be evaluated for volume. The amount of colony forming units (CFUs) will be determined&#xD;
      semi-quantitatively across all organisms, and presented separately for individual genera and&#xD;
      species. The samples will be characterized with descriptive statistics including frequencies,&#xD;
      percentages, means, medians, standard deviations, and 95% CIs. To address the second&#xD;
      objective of the study, comparisons of pH, volume, microorganisms, and CFUs by suctioning&#xD;
      scheme and patient-level characteristics will be conducted using chi-squared tests of&#xD;
      independence and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Graphical methods will be developed to aid&#xD;
      interpretation, both as a function of time and cumulatively over time.&#xD;
