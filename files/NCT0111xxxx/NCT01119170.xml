      In this study the investigators want to test the safety of D-lactate producing probiotics in&#xD;
      babies from birth to 1 month of age. Previous data demonstrated no increase in urinary&#xD;
      D-lactate in 4 month old infants supplemented with D-lactate producing probiotics. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of D-lactate producing probiotics&#xD;
      on D-lactate excretion in young infants during the neonatal period (days 0 - 28).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lactate, in addition to being found in more common fermented foods of today, such as yogurt,&#xD;
      lactate, in its two stereoisomer forms, known as the D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary) is&#xD;
      also produced in the colon through the normal fermentative process of lactic acid producing&#xD;
      bacteria. Both D-lactate and L-lactate produced by these microbes are metabolized by enzymes&#xD;
      within human cells and do not typically pose an acid-base risk by reducing pH to a&#xD;
      threatening degree in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the specific dehydrogenase that converts D-lactate to pyruvate is far less active&#xD;
      than that for L-lactate, and it has been suggested that very young infants may be a&#xD;
      vulnerable group for D-lactic acidosis. Previous data have shown that urinary D-/L- lactate&#xD;
      excretion were not significantly different between 2 groups of 4 month old infants taking a&#xD;
      control formula or a formula containing D-lactate producing probiotics for 4 weeks. However,&#xD;
      measures were not collected in babies during the first month after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we want to test the safety of D-lactate producing bacteria in babies from birth&#xD;
      to 1 month of age. This safety study is a randomized, controlled, single center, clinical&#xD;
      trial of 2 groups of infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of a starter formula containing D-lactate producing probiotics versus&#xD;
      a starter formula without probiotics, on D-lactic acid urine levels in healthy formula-fed&#xD;
      infants, from birth to 28 days of age. Urinary D-lactate concentration (mmol/mol creatinine),&#xD;
      will be measured at (baseline, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluation of effects on gut microbiota, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tolerance, duration of sleep and crying, morbidity and growth, with a follow up to 6 months&#xD;
      of age.&#xD;
