  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the most common cause for motor disability in the grown-up population in the&#xD;
      Western world. In Sweden &gt; 80 % are above 65 years of age at onset (1).Areas in the brain,&#xD;
      controlling the movement in the upper extremity (UE) are often damaged at a stroke, which&#xD;
      leads to impaired function. This impairment of the UE often leads to limitations in&#xD;
      activities of daily living and reductions in the level of social activities; therefore,&#xD;
      interventions that will improve function are needed to reduce the consequences for the person&#xD;
      living with stroke. The time course of recovery of the UE is not clear and therefore the&#xD;
      optimal timing of the intervention for the person and its content (ways of intervention)&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed objective assessments of motor performance with new&#xD;
      technology (kinematic analysis and virtual reality with haptics). Since having an impaired UE&#xD;
      often results in reduced capacity in daily living and social activities, this might lead to&#xD;
      decreased participation. To complement the traditional focus on body function, there is a&#xD;
      need for assessments of the person's activity level and participation, as well as&#xD;
      self-perceived function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from this study will lay the ground for an intervention study focusing on&#xD;
      improved function in the upper extremity.&#xD;

      Tools to objectively assess upper extremity function and activity Grippit: The handgrip force&#xD;
      will be recorded, both the peak maximum grip force and the mean value of the ten-second&#xD;
      sustained grip for the right hand Kinematics: An optoelectronic system is used for the&#xD;
      three-dimensional motion analysis. This system includes an advanced optoelectronic camera&#xD;
      system that produces clean and accurate 3D data. Ball shaped markers are positioned on the&#xD;
      body, and reflect infrared light from camera flashes. Data analysis itself is performed with&#xD;
      special software. The drinking task test is performed with the person sitting in a&#xD;
      standardized manner ARAT (Action research Arm Test) is a performance test for UE function and&#xD;
      dexterity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR The user observes a 3D image displayed above the tabletop using stereographic shuttered&#xD;
      glasses. The user is able to reach into a virtual space and interact with 3-dimensional&#xD;
      objects, with a haptic device, which creates the illusion of manipulating virtual objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tool to assess self perceived function and activity ABILHAND is a questionnaire aiming to&#xD;
      measure manual ability in chronic stroke. It is interview based and focused on perceived&#xD;
      difficulty in everyday activities and contains unimanual and bimanual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a scale where the person replies on perceptions regarding life&#xD;
      after the stroke..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on participation and autonomy (IPA-E); is an instrument where the person estimates&#xD;
      perceived handicap and autonomy for persons living in the community&#xD;
