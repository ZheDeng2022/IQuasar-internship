    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Yearly around 12,500&#xD;
      Dutch women are diagnosed with breast cancer and 3,500 die of this disease. One of the&#xD;
      problems leading to such striking effect refers to late tumor detection due to inadequate&#xD;
      sensitivity of current imaging techniques. Current screening is performed by means of&#xD;
      mammography, consisting of traditional film-screen mammograms of digital mammograms. These&#xD;
      digital mammograms offer digital enhancement to aid interpretation, which is especially&#xD;
      helpful in women with dense breast tissue. Screening mammography is nowadays the single most&#xD;
      effective method of early breast cancer detection. For screening of high risk individuals,&#xD;
      increasingly the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique is emerging. However, none of the&#xD;
      above mentioned techniques has an optimal sensitivity and specificity, leading for instance&#xD;
      to a significant portion of false positive results. The clinical consequence of this error is&#xD;
      that additional tests and procedures are performed in women who may not have cancer. In the&#xD;
      United States, for example, 11% mammograms require additional evaluation; the lesion turns&#xD;
      out to be benign in more than 90% of cases [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      False-positive readings False positive readings are more common in younger women, both&#xD;
      because the tests are less specific and because breast cancer is less common [2,3]. As a&#xD;
      result, more follow-up procedures, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, will be&#xD;
      done in younger women even though fewer cancers will be found. Furthermore, because breast&#xD;
      cancer screening occurs repeatedly, the risk of a false-positive study is likely to rise with&#xD;
      repeated screening [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging adjuncts to mammography include ultrasonography, which is helpful for further&#xD;
      assessment of known areas of interest, and magnetic resonance imaging. Image-guided biopsy -&#xD;
      directed by ultrasonography or stereotactic mammography views - plays a critical role in&#xD;
      histological confirmation of suspected breast cancer.&#xD;

      Objectives of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The aim is to perform a feasibility study to show that VEGF PET imaging&#xD;
      using 89Zr-bevacizumab as tracer can be used for early breast cancer detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives A secondary aim is whether positive lymph nodes can be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint will be 89Zr-bevacizumab tracer uptake in primary breast tumors &lt; 2&#xD;
           cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary endpoint will be 89Zr-bevacizumab tracer uptake in axillary lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a breast tumor size &lt; 2 cm in diameter (as determined by means of&#xD;
           conventional imaging techniques: mammography, ultrasound or MRI) who are scheduled to&#xD;
           receive operative intervention either by means of a mastectomy or lumpectomy.&#xD;

           or interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant or lactating women. Documentation of a negative pregnancy test must be&#xD;
           available for pre-menopausal women with intact reproductive organs and for women less&#xD;
           than two years after menopause.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Trial Design All patients will undergo a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan preoperatively at day 4&#xD;
      following tracer injection (see: section 16 for timetable). The uptake of 89Zr-bevacizumab in&#xD;
      the tumor will be quantified. Results will be fused and compared with standard imaging&#xD;
      techniques and with standard tumor histology as well as specific tumor stainings for&#xD;
      angiogenesis including VEGF staining. Sensitivity and specificity will be compared with&#xD;
      conventional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiolabelling of bevacizumab Conjugation and radiolabeling of the monoclonal antibody is&#xD;
      essentially performed as has been described by Verel et al (15), with only minor adjustments&#xD;
      with regard to purification. In short: FTP-N-sucDf-Fe (kindly provided by the VU University&#xD;
      Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was conjugated to the mAb at a 10:1 molar ratio.&#xD;
      Fe(III) is subsequently removed by an excess of EDTA (Calbiochem, San Diego, California, USA)&#xD;
      for 30 min at 35°C and the antibody is purified by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin-2 Centrifugal&#xD;
      Concentrator, filter 30 kDa, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). This purified antibody is either&#xD;
      stored at -80°C or immediately used for radiolabelling. The conjugated antibody is added to&#xD;
      89Zr-oxalate (100-1000 MBq/mg mAb, kindly provided by the VU University Medical Center,&#xD;
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands), 0.9% NaCl (Braun Melsungen AG, Oss, The Netherlands), 2M Na2CO3&#xD;
      (OPG Farma, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and 0.5M HEPES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The&#xD;
      Netherlands). After 60 minutes, the radiolabeled antibody is purified by ultrafiltration&#xD;
      Vivaspin-2 Centrifugal Concentrator, filter 30 kDa, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) and&#xD;
      diluted in 0.9% NaCl/gentisic acid (5 mg/ml, Merck Schuchardt OHG, Hohenbrunn, Germany). The&#xD;
      89Zr isotope has a physical t ½ of 78 hours. 89Zr-bevacizumab has radiochemical purity &gt;95%&#xD;
      and excellent long term stability in human serum (&gt; 1 week). Conjugation and radiolabeling is&#xD;
      performed in the radiopharmacy facilities of the department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular&#xD;
      Imaging under GMP-conditions, under responsibility of a hospital pharmacist. More detailed&#xD;
      information regarding 89Zr-bevacizumab is found in the investigational medicinal medicinal&#xD;
      product dossier (IMPD; appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging Patients will be injected intravenously with 37 MBq 89Zr-bevacizumab (protein&#xD;
      dose 5 mg) at day 0. Subsequently, images will be made 4 days after the injection of&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab (see section 16 for timetable). For imaging a Siemens PET/CT camera will be&#xD;
      used. Recording will be performed in 3D mode from lower thorax to neck, in approximately 2&#xD;
      bedpositions. The Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging is certified according&#xD;
      to the ISO-NEN-9001 standard. Standard operating procedures for dynamic scanning will be used&#xD;
      for all PET scans. Actual operation of the PET camera and scan acquisition will be performed&#xD;
      by a nuclear medicine technologist. Final image analysis will be performed by a nuclear&#xD;
      medicine specialist. 89Zr-bevacizumab distribution will be scored visually and&#xD;
      quantitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of patients will also undergo sentinel node detection for staging of the axilla&#xD;
      during the surgical treatment of the primary tumor. For the sentinel node procedure,&#xD;
      99mTechnetium labeled nanocolloid is used. The anticipated time between 89Zr-bevacizumab and&#xD;
      99mTc-nanocolloid administration will be approximately 2 weeks. By then, 7 half-life episodes&#xD;
      of the 89Zr radiolabel will have passed and its signal will be negligible. Therefore, no&#xD;
      interference of the radiolabel signals is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose/safety Use of positron emitting isotopes means exposure to ionizing radiation.&#xD;
      Because of the potential hazards of radiation, guidelines for the exposure of healthy&#xD;
      volunteers are specified in &quot;Besluit Stralingsbescherming (BS 2000), artikel 64 - en Nota van&#xD;
      Toelichting (Staatsblad 2001, 397)&quot;, which refers to the guidelines of the International&#xD;
      Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). As the kinetics of the antibody bevacizumab are&#xD;
      almost comparable to those of trastuzumab, the radiation dose of 89Zr labelled bevacizumab is&#xD;
      expected to be in the same range as that of 89Zr-trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For estimating the radiation dose to a 'standard female' during 89Zr-trastuzumab scanning,&#xD;
      use was made of available kinetic data from previous 111In-trastuzumab planar imaging. This&#xD;
      is possible as the halftime of 111In is in the same order of magnitude as that of 89Zr and&#xD;
      therefore it enables us to track tracer kinetics over a time period that is also relevant for&#xD;
      89Zr dosimetry. Using scan-series consisting of 4 consecutive planar scans over a period of&#xD;
      168 hours, residence times of the main source organs and the whole-body were calculated,&#xD;
      adjusting for the difference in nuclide half-lives. These residence times were fed into the&#xD;
      OLINDA program, which calculates the effective radiation dose using the MIRD scheme. The&#xD;
      final estimate was found from averaging the results from 5 different patients, yielding 18&#xD;
      mSv for an injected dose of 37 MBq. In the current protocol, this would result in a radiation&#xD;
      dose (including the attenuation correction for low dose CT) of 19.5 mSv for women (and 16.5&#xD;
      mSv for men). According to ICRP 62 this radiation dose falls in category III (moderate risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor staining In addition to the standard evaluation of the postoperative tumor specimen,&#xD;
      specific staining for VEGF pathway related proteins will be performed including VEGF, CD34&#xD;
      staining for mean vascular density (MVD), SMA for vascular maturation, HIF-1alpha for&#xD;
      hypoxia, VEGF receptors, Ki 67 for proliferation or other relevant staining according to the&#xD;
      most up to date scientific insights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, follow- up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before start&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO performance score (see appendix B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional imaging of the breast (mammography, ultrasound or MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histological confirmation of malignant breast lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of in- and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria of evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scan PET scans will be evaluated by a nuclear medicine physician blinded for clinical&#xD;
      information and location of the tumor. The PET data will be correlated to the conventional&#xD;
      imaging data. The final postoperative pathological evaluation will be related to the PET&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor staining Evaluation of VEGF related tumor staining will be performed in collaboration&#xD;
      with a pathologist, blinded for clinical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study we will postulate high demands to prove the sensitivity of&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab-PET scan to detect breast cancer lesions in order to justify our final&#xD;
      future aim to obtain a good discrimination between benign versus pre-malignant/malignant&#xD;
      lesions with VEGF imaging. Demands for very high sensitivity to detect the tumor with&#xD;
      89Zr-bevacizumab-PET scanning requires a sensitivity no worse than 99%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a stopping rule with a type 1 error of 5% (one-sided alpha of 5%) and a beta of&#xD;
      10% (~a power of 90%), and external reference values for false negative rates of 0.01 and as&#xD;
      alternative 0.10. An extensive description of the stopping rule with two boundaries, is&#xD;
      included in appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the requirements are p0=0.01, p1=0.10, alpha(rule)=0.05,&#xD;
      beta(rule)=0.10 and alpha(futile)=0.05. After exact calculation, this results in&#xD;
      alpha(n)=0.1364, beta(N)=0.055 and alpha(futile,n)=0.6431, with 47 as the maximum number of&#xD;
      patients. With a true failure rate of 0.01, the probability of passing the upper boundary is&#xD;
      0.049; with a true failure rate of 0.10 this probability is 0.903. The upper boundary,&#xD;
      representing the maximum of acceptable failures, is 1 within the first 35 patients and 2 up&#xD;
      to the total number of 47 patients. Monitoring with the stopping rule can be stopped (because&#xD;
      of futile testing) when no failures are observed within the first 31 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      events, the procedures and possible hazards to which he/she will be exposed, and the&#xD;
      mechanism of treatment allocation. They will be informed as to the strict confidentiality of&#xD;
      their patient data, but that their medical records may be reviewed for trial purposes by&#xD;
      authorized individuals other than their treating physician. An example of a patient informed&#xD;
      consent statement is given as an appendix to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethics committee of the UMCG will validate local informed consent documents before start&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be emphasized that the participation is voluntary and that the patient is allowed to&#xD;
      refuse further participation in the protocol whenever he/she wants. This will not prejudice&#xD;
      the patient's subsequent care. Documented informed consent must be obtained for all patients&#xD;
      included in the study before they are registered or randomized in the study. This must be&#xD;
      done in accordance with the national and local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent procedure must conform to the ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
      This implies that &quot;the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by&#xD;
      the patient or by the patient's legally acceptable representative&quot;.&#xD;
