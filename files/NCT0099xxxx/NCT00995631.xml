  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The typical female pattern of accumulating fat in the hips and thighs has long been thought&#xD;
      to confer less risk for disease than the typical male abdominal fat pattern. However, leg fat&#xD;
      may not simply be benign with respect to disease risk, but may in fact protect against&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk. Although the mechanism for this is unknown, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that removing a portion of this important fat depot (via liposuction) could&#xD;
      increase disease risk. Such unfavorable results may or may not be transient depending on an&#xD;
      individual's ability to defend their fat mass. Because sex hormones appear to play a role in&#xD;
      regional fat accumulation, the investigators hypothesize that estrogen-deficient&#xD;
      postmenopausal women may have an augmented abdominal fat accumulation and an attenuated hip&#xD;
      and thigh re-accumulation compared to premenopausal women following lipectomy and compared to&#xD;
      non-surgical controls. As a result, the increased abdominal fat accumulation may worsen&#xD;
      disease risk in postmenopausal women. Menopause-related differences in fat storage at&#xD;
      baseline are also expected to determine the degree to which lipectomy alters disease risk and&#xD;
      the propensity for AT re-accumulation.&#xD;

      Lipectomy is the most frequently performed aesthetic surgery in the U.S. today and is&#xD;
      considered permanent, by The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, but no long term&#xD;
      follow-up studies have been done to verify this assertion. Indeed, animal studies suggest&#xD;
      rapid adipose tissue (AT) re-accumulation after lipectomy is common and may even be&#xD;
      accompanied by unfavorable changes in disease risk. Recent studies in humans have focused on&#xD;
      abdominal lipectomy as a means of reducing metabolic disease risk in obese premenopausal&#xD;
      women. However, none of these studies evaluated AT re-accumulation or reported long-term (&gt;6&#xD;
      mo) changes in metabolic outcomes, and none have evaluated the effect of removing femoral AT&#xD;
      despite this being a common site for lipectomy in women and despite the apparent&#xD;
      cardioprotective benefit of lower body adiposity. Further, none of these studies included&#xD;
      postmenopausal women who are at an increased risk of abdominal AT accumulation. It is the&#xD;
      investigator's overall working hypothesis that removal of femoral AT by lipectomy may worsen&#xD;
      metabolic disease risk (as measured by postprandial lipemia) in estrogen-deficient&#xD;
      postmenopausal women who, in contrast to premenopausal women, will accumulate AT in the&#xD;
      abdominal rather than the femoral region. The global aims of this study are to determine&#xD;
      whether: 1) there are menopause-related differences in regional (abdominal vs. femoral) AT&#xD;
      re-accumulation following lipectomy; and 2) changes (removal and regain) in femoral AT mass&#xD;
      alter postprandial triglyceride clearance and storage of meal-derived fatty acids. Further,&#xD;
      the investigators postulate that menopause-related differences in postprandial lipemia and&#xD;
      handling of dietary fatty acids will determine the degree to which femoral lipectomy worsens&#xD;
      these parameters. Pre- and postmenopausal women (n=80) will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      femoral lipectomy or control (no surgery). All eligible volunteers will undergo testing at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study and at 2, 8, and 14 months following lipectomy. Measurements will&#xD;
      include body composition assessments, meal tests and AT biopsies to assess lipectomy-related&#xD;
      changes in: 1) abdominal and femoral fat mass; 2) systemic postprandial triglyceride&#xD;
      excursions; and 3) storage of dietary fatty acids in AT. These studies are designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of femoral lipectomy on regional AT re-accumulation and metabolic disease&#xD;
      risk in pre- and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
