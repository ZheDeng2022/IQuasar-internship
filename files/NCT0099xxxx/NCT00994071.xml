      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An experimental drug called ABT-888 has been studied in combination with temozolomide (a&#xD;
      type of chemotherapy) in adults who have certain kinds of cancer. ABT-88 has been shown to&#xD;
      increase tumor sensitivity to temozolomide and improve treatment outcomes in people who have&#xD;
      cancer. More research is needed to determine if this combination of drugs will work well as&#xD;
      an effective treatment for children who have brain tumors. This will be the first time this&#xD;
      combination has been studied in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum doses of ABT-888 and temozolomide when given in combination in&#xD;
           children with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how children metabolize and clear ABT-888 from their bodies so that appropriate&#xD;
           doses of this medication can be recommended for future clinical trials of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn what side effects may occur when ABT-888 and temozolomide are given together.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how certain tumors respond to this combination of drugs by studying the&#xD;
           characteristics of these tumors in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals less than 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with a cancer of the nervous&#xD;
      system (including brain and brain stem tumors) that has not responded to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before beginning the study, participants will have a full medical history and physical&#xD;
           examination, and may also be required to have scans of the brain and spine or provide&#xD;
           samples of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will consist of up to 13 28-day cycles of therapy, for a total of 52 weeks (1&#xD;
           year). Participants will receive a dose of ABT-888 twice daily for 5 days, and will&#xD;
           receive a dose of temozolomide once daily for 5 days, every 28 days. The morning dose of&#xD;
           ABT-888 will be given 60-90 minutes before the dose of temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have routine blood tests at least once a week throughout the treatment&#xD;
           cycles, and will have scans of the brain and spine performed as required by the&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subset of patients with pediatric CNS tumors continue to have a poor prognosis despite&#xD;
           advances in surgery and radiation. Novel strategies are required for improving outcome&#xD;
           for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has shown modest activity in recurrent pediatric&#xD;
           CNS tumors, including high-grade gliomas, medulloblastoma/PNET, and low-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide induces single-stranded DNA breaks, the majority of which are repaired by&#xD;
           the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, is a&#xD;
           critical nuclear enzyme that binds to DNA breaks, recruits and activates key proteins in&#xD;
           the BER and other DNA repair pathways, halts DNA replication, and facilitates repair of&#xD;
           damaged DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABT-888 is a potent and orally bioavailable PARP inhibitor that has been shown to&#xD;
           enhance cytotoxicity of temozolomide and other chemotherapy agents in several&#xD;
           pre-clinical models of human tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with temozolomide&#xD;
           in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 and PARP inhibition in peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to recommend a Phase 2 dose of ABT-888 in&#xD;
           combination with temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the toxicities of the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide in children&#xD;
           with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must be less than or equal to 21 years of age at registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a diagnosis of a primary CNS malignancy (including low-grade glioma) that&#xD;
           is recurrent or refractory to standard therapy and for which there is no known curative&#xD;
           therapy Progression and recurrence will be documented by review of MRI scans. If time&#xD;
           permits we will have the diagnosis confirmed by the NCI Laboratory of Pathology.&#xD;
           Patients with intrinsic brain stem tumors must have radiographic evidence of&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for greater than 16 yrs of age) or Lansky Performance&#xD;
           Score (LPS for less than or equal to 16 years of age) greater than or equal to 50&#xD;
           assessed within two weeks of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of all prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or decreasing dose for at&#xD;
           least 1 week prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      -ABT-888 will be given twice daily on day 1-5, and temozolomide will be given once daily on&#xD;
      day 1-5, every 28 days. The morning dose of ABT-888 will be given 60-90 minutes prior to&#xD;
      temozolomide.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients must be less than or equal to 21 years of age at the time of study enrollment. At&#xD;
        the time the MTD or the dose to be recommended for future trials is identified, up to 12&#xD;
        additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level to further define the toxicity&#xD;
        profile. Six of these patients will be less than 12 years of age and the other half will be&#xD;
        greater than or equal to 12 years.&#xD;
