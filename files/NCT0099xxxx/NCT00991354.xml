      An effective vaccine may be the only way to stop the HIV pandemic. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the safety of and immune response to the DNA vaccine, PENNVAX-B with or&#xD;
      without an IL-12 adjuvant when given using electroporation.&#xD;

      An effective and safe vaccine must be developed in order to halt the HIV pandemic. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immune response to the HIV DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      PENNVAX-B when given with and without an IL-12 adjuvant and delivered via electroporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and will visit&#xD;
      the study clinic 9 times over 9 months. Group 1 will enroll first. Participants in this group&#xD;
      will receive 3 mg of the PENNVAX-B or placebo vaccine at Months 0, 1, and 3. Once safety data&#xD;
      has been examined for Group 1, Group 2 will begin enrollment. Group 2 participants will&#xD;
      receive 3 mg of PENNVAX-B vaccine plus 1 mg of IL-12 adjuvant or placebo at Months 0, 1, and&#xD;
      3. Once Group 1 and Group 2 safety data have been collected Group 3 will begin enrollment.&#xD;
      These participants will also receive 3 mg of PENNVAX-B vaccine plus 1 mg of IL-12 adjuvant or&#xD;
      placebo at Months 0, 1, and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At clinic visits participants will have physical exams and blood and urine collected. After&#xD;
      receiving study injections, participants will be observed in the clinic for at least 30&#xD;
      minutes. In addition, participants will be asked to monitor symptoms for 3 days after each&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
