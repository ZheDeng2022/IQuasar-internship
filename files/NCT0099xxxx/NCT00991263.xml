      RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer&#xD;
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples from women treated with paclitaxel&#xD;
      for breast cancer on clinical trial CALGB 9344 or CALGB 9741.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether subtype-specific treatment effects correlate with disease-free&#xD;
           survival (DFS), as determined by a significant interaction between PAM50-based intrinsic&#xD;
           subtypes, and (a) paclitaxel benefit in CLB-9344 and (b) dose density in CALGB-9741.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether subtype-specific treatment effects correlate with DFS for the&#xD;
           HER2-negative subsets in CALGB-9344 and CALGB-9741, as determined by analysis of tissue&#xD;
           microarray (TMA) and slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the relationship between PAM50-defined risk of relapse (ROR) score and DFS&#xD;
           in CALGB-9344 and CALGB-9741.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the relationship between PAM50-defined ROR score and DFS in the&#xD;
           HER2-negative subsets in CALGB-9344 and CALGB-9741, as determined by analysis of TMA and&#xD;
           slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship between PAM50-defined proliferation score and DFS in&#xD;
           CALGB-9344 and CALGB-9741 in multivariate Cox-proportional hazards models including the&#xD;
           following covariates: (a) number of positive lymph nodes, square root transformation;&#xD;
           (b) menopausal status (pre versus peri/post); CALGB-9344 only; c) dose of doxorubicin&#xD;
           hydrochloride (60/75/90 mg/m^2); and CALGB-9741 only; and (d) sequence of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS) in a Cox-proportional hazards-regression model for&#xD;
           testing the interaction between ROR with (a) paclitaxel benefit in CALGB-9344 and (b)&#xD;
           dose density in CALGB-9741.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test for a significant interaction between ROR and paclitaxel benefit at 5-year and&#xD;
           10-year DFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test whether 5-year and 10-year DFS rates can be associated to a significant&#xD;
           interaction between the proliferation score with (a) paclitaxel benefit in CALGB-9344&#xD;
           and (b) dose density in CALGB-9741.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Tissue blocks from CALGB-9344 and CALGB-9741 are utilized to purify RNA to be tested&#xD;
      in the PAM50 assay (a 50-gene quantitative PCR assay, that provides an intrinsic breast&#xD;
      cancer subtype diagnosis) and generate risk of relapse (ROR) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assay identifies five subtypes with the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Luminal A: This subtype expresses estrogen receptor (ER) accompanied by high levels of&#xD;
           ER-associated gene expression. Genes associated with cell cycle activation are not&#xD;
           highly expressed and this tumor type is only very rarely HER2+. This subgroup has the&#xD;
           most favorable prognosis and is enriched for endocrine therapy responsive tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Luminal B: This subtype expresses ER and ER-associated gene expression but to a lower&#xD;
           extent. Genes associated with cell cycle activation are highly expressed and this tumor&#xD;
           type can be HER2+ (~20%) or HER2- thus, from the clinical perspective, Luminal B tumors&#xD;
           are at least two further subtypes defined by the presence or absence of HER2-gene&#xD;
           amplification. The prognosis is unfavorable (despite ER expression) and endocrine&#xD;
           therapy responsiveness is generally diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basal-like: This subtype is ER-, is almost always clinically HER2- and expresses a suite&#xD;
           of &quot;basal&quot; biomarkers. Genes associated with cell cycle activation are highly expressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER2-enriched: This subtype is ER- and is HER2+ in the majority of cases. Genes&#xD;
           associated with cell cycle activation are highly expressed and these tumors have a poor&#xD;
           outcome. Tumors within this classification that are clinically HER2- fall into a class&#xD;
           previously described as double-negative non-basal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal-like: A tumor subtype diagnosis cannot be provided from samples that exhibit a&#xD;
           normal-like profile. Since this profile was trained on samples without cancer,&#xD;
           &quot;normal-like&quot; implies there are too few tumor cells in the sample to make a true tumor&#xD;
           subtype diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,245 tissue blocks from CALGB-9544 and 1,432 tissue blocks&#xD;
      from CALGB-9741 will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
