  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to assess the effect of cold water immersion on knee joint&#xD;
      re-positional sense in healthy subjects. Cryotherapy, in the form of cold water immersion,&#xD;
      had previously been shown to improve athletic performance however, debate exists within the&#xD;
      existing literature regarding whether proprioception, in the form or joint position sense, is&#xD;
      effected post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis (H0): Water immersion has no effect on joint position sense (JPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate hypothesis (H1): Water immersion has an effect on joint position sense.&#xD;

      This was a prospective, randomised, cross-over design where volunteers acted as their own&#xD;
      controls. The volunteers were immersed at two temperatures (detailed below) and these&#xD;
      sessions were separated by six to ten days. The order of the testing was randomly assigned&#xD;
      using a random number generator. Ethical approval of the design of this trial was gained from&#xD;
      the University of Limerick's Research Ethics Committee and signed informed consent was gained&#xD;
      from each participant before any data collection took place.&#xD;
