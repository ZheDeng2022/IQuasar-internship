      Standard care of care and up to twelve (12) weekly debridements. Subjects randomized into the&#xD;
      weekly debridement group will receive up to twelve (12) debridement during the twelve (12)&#xD;
      weeks of the study. There will be two (2) subject groups in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized into either the monthly debridement group or the weekly debridement group.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate subjects enrolled and randomized to the&#xD;
      weekly sharp debridement group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major secondary objectives are incidence of complete wound closure at Week 12, rate of&#xD;
      healing, ulcer recurrence, wound characteristics, and microbiologic information.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must have evidence of a full-thickness cutaneous wound of at least 30 days&#xD;
             duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 1 year to be determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The study ulcer must be from 1 cm2 to 20 cm2 in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The study ulcer must have been present for at least 30 days at study Day -7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject's Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) must be equal to or less than 10.0% for&#xD;
             subjects with diagnosed diabetes at study Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject, legal guardian or authorized representative must have understood, signed&#xD;
             and dated the IRB approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject must be available for evaluation on a weekly basis for the twelve (12)&#xD;
             weeks of the study. Visits at Week 13 and Week 14 are required for initial wound&#xD;
             healing, which is achieved in study Week 11 or 12. The Investigator will evaluate both&#xD;
             groups at Week 16. Subjects must be available for evaluation at Week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject's TCpO2 must be equal to or greater than 25 mm of mercury in the periwound&#xD;
             area and ABI greater than 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject whose ulcer has healed 30% or greater from the evaluation Study day -7 to the&#xD;
             post-debridement Study Day 0 as determined by wound measurements using ARANZ&#xD;
             Silhouette&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of alcohol or substance abuse, within the previous year, which could, or in&#xD;
             the judgment of the Investigator, would interfere with study compliance or protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participation in clinical trials evaluating investigational pharmaceuticals, biologics&#xD;
             or devices within 30 days of admission to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject with a history of receiving any of the following within the last 30 days:&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids exceeding a total daily dose of 20mg, immunosuppressive&#xD;
             agents, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Anticipated use of the above during the&#xD;
             study period will also exclude a subject from entry into the study. Topical and&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids are not prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with medical comorbidities known to affect wound healing such as end stage&#xD;
             renal disease, severe hepatic insufficiency, vasculitis, and HIV will be excluded from&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
