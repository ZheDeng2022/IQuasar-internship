    <textblock>
      During a prostate biopsy, a needle is guided through the rectum into the prostate. Although&#xD;
      patients are given antibiotics before the biopsy, there is still a risk of bacteria getting&#xD;
      from the rectum into the bladder, prostate and bloodstream during the biopsy. For most&#xD;
      surgical procedures, the surgical field is cleaned with antiseptic solution, but this is not&#xD;
      common practice for prostate biopsies. In this study patients undergoing prostate biopsy will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either receive an antiseptic preparation of the rectum or no&#xD;
      preparation prior to biopsy, and the rate of infection after the biopsy will be determined.&#xD;

      1. Purpose This research aims to determine the efficacy and safety of cleaning the rectal&#xD;
           mucosa with antiseptic solution (Povidone-iodine) prior to transrectal prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis We hypothesize that prophylactic cleaning of the rectal mucosa with&#xD;
           antiseptic solution prior to transrectal prostate biopsy will decrease the rate of&#xD;
           infectious complications after biopsy. We believe that this can be achieved without any&#xD;
           significant complications related to the antiseptic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Since the diagnosis of&#xD;
           prostate cancer requires a transrectal prostate biopsy, this procedure is performed&#xD;
           frequently. More than 6000 biopsies are performed in British Columbia each year, and&#xD;
           more than 1000 are performed at Vancouver General and UBC Hospitals (combined numbers).&#xD;
           In these hospitals, the biopsy is performed by the radiologists using transrectal&#xD;
           guidance. Subjects receive antibiotic prophylaxis in the form of ciprofloxacin for three&#xD;
           days starting one day before the biopsy. They also instill an enema into the rectum a&#xD;
           few hours before the biopsy to empty the rectum. Local anesthetic is injected through&#xD;
           the rectal mucosa into the periprostatic space prior to the biopsy. Depending on the&#xD;
           size of the prostate, between 8 and 12 cores of tissue are remove from the prostate by&#xD;
           repetitive passes of the 18 gauge biopsy needle through the anterior rectal wall.&#xD;
           Cleaning the rectum with an antiseptic solution prior to biopsy is not routinely&#xD;
           practiced and is not considered a current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite routine antibiotic prophylaxis, prostate biopsies are associated with a&#xD;
           considerable rate of infectious complications. Sepsis after biopsy is described in the&#xD;
           literature with an incidence 0.1 to 2.0 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Rate of sepsis has been determined in a retrospective but contemporary study of&#xD;
           approximately 4500 biopsies at VGH/UBC to occur with a rate of 0.55% (Lange et al.,&#xD;
           submitted to Journal of Urology). Less severe but more common adverse events include&#xD;
           urinary tract infection and fever, which both occur in approximately 10% of men&#xD;
           undergoing biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cleaning the rectum prior to biopsy offers a potential method to decrease the risk of&#xD;
           these infectious complications, and we propose the use of Povidone-iodine for this&#xD;
           purpose. Surgical site disinfection is standard in most surgical procedures, and&#xD;
           Povidone-iodine is a safe antiseptic utilized routinely for the surgical preparation of&#xD;
           the body surface as well as mucosal surfaces, including the vagina, mouth and bowel.&#xD;
           Park et al. reported that the mean number of colony-forming units decreased 99.9% after&#xD;
           Povidone-iodine cleansing of the rectum. Hay et al. reported similar results with&#xD;
           Povidone-Iodine enema administration when combined with metronidazole. Povidone-iodine&#xD;
           has been shown to significantly reduce bacterial concentrations in the mucosa of the&#xD;
           colon and rectum. Brown et al. reported that a Povidone-iodine enema provided a safe and&#xD;
           effective means for preventing bacteremia and bacteruria after transrectal prostate&#xD;
           biopsy. Furthermore, severe allergic reaction to Povidone-iodine is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether cleaning the lining of the rectum with an antiseptic solution&#xD;
           before prostate biopsy is effective in decreasing the rate of three outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary Tract Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine at what rate bacteria are found in the rectum prior to biopsy that are&#xD;
           resistant to ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine at what rate bacteria are found in the urine after biopsy, with or without&#xD;
           rectal cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine any adverse reactions to antiseptic solution in the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method All subjects undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy as clinically&#xD;
           indicated and determined by the treating Urologist at Vancouver General Hospital and&#xD;
           University of British Columbia Hospital will be considered for entry into this trial. If&#xD;
           the subject consents to participation, he will be randomized to undergo prostate biopsy&#xD;
           with rectal cleaning with antiseptic solution (&quot;treatment&quot; group) or without rectal&#xD;
           cleaning (&quot;control&quot; group). A urine sample will be collected before and after biopsy and&#xD;
           sent for routine culturing. A rectal swab will be taken before the biopsy (and before&#xD;
           rectal cleaning in treatment group) and will be cultured in ciprofloxacin-enriched&#xD;
           medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the treatment group, the radiologist performing the biopsy will wipe the rectal&#xD;
           lining overlying the prostate with gauze soaked with Povidone-iodine. Otherwise the&#xD;
           biopsy is performed in standard fashion in both groups. After the procedure, the&#xD;
           subjects are instructed to measure and record their temperature every 6 hours for 48&#xD;
           hours. A telephone interview is conducted seven days after biopsy to ascertain any&#xD;
           adverse events from the biopsy, including whether a temperature ≥38.0˚C was measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis The primary outcome in this study will be the rate of urinary tract&#xD;
           infection and the rate of fever after biopsy (see definitions below). The rate of sepsis&#xD;
           will be measured, but the study will not be powered to detect a difference in the rate&#xD;
           of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rate of UTI and fever is estimated from the literature data at 10% each. A relative&#xD;
           reduction of 50% (absolute reduction from 10% to 5%)would be considered clinically&#xD;
           significant. With type I &amp; II errors set at 0.05 and 0.2, respectively, and a two-sided&#xD;
           test of significance, the necessary sample size is estimated at 435 in each group.&#xD;
           Assuming 20% inability to enroll and loss to follow up, the total sample size is 1044.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive statistics of baseline parameters will be provided in each group. The mean,&#xD;
           median, standard deviation or range of the variables will be computed as applicable. The&#xD;
           association between exposure and the defined outcomes will be assessed in univariate&#xD;
           analysis. The proportion of each outcome in each group will be compared using the chi&#xD;
           square test. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression will be performed to assess&#xD;
           effect of variables such as age, number of biopsy cores, individual performing the&#xD;
           biopsy and other co-morbidities. A test of interaction will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Definition of Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary tract infection: &gt; 100 million colony forming units per liter in the urine&#xD;
                culture obtained48 hours after biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fever: oral temperature ≥38.0˚C within 48 hours after biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sepsis(19),(20): positive urine or blood culture plus two or more of the following&#xD;
                within 1week of biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. temperature ≥38.0˚C or &lt; 36.0˚C,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. heart rate &gt;90 beats/minute,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. WBC count &gt;12.0 or &lt;4.0 x 10 9/L, or &gt; 0.10 immature forms (bands).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Summary of Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be counseled in the office regarding the prostate biopsy as per each&#xD;
      physician's routine. This includes instructions for ciprofloxacin prophylaxis (1000 mg of&#xD;
      extended release ciprofloxacin daily for three days starting the day before the biopsy) and&#xD;
      the use of a fleet enema at home approximately 2 hours before biopsy. The Urologist will also&#xD;
      discuss this study with the subject at the same time as he/she orders the biopsy. He/she will&#xD;
      ensure that the subject meets the eligibility criteria using a pre-biopsy questionnaire. The&#xD;
      subject will be able to take the consent home for further consideration and discussion. It&#xD;
      must be signed before the biopsy for the subject to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be assigned a study code. At the time of biopsy, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 by computer generated random numbers into two groups. The first group&#xD;
      (&quot;controls&quot;) will undergo biopsy according to the current standard of care, which does not&#xD;
      include antiseptic cleaning. The second group (&quot;treatment&quot;) will undergo biopsy in the same&#xD;
      fashion, but after cleaning the rectal lining with 10% Povidone-iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the biopsy is started, the subject is asked to give a midstream urine sample for&#xD;
      routine culture. A culture swab is also inserted into the rectum and then cultured in&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin-enriched media in order to isolate ciprofloxacin-resistant rectal flora prior&#xD;
      to the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will undergo the routine biopsy while in the treatment group, the&#xD;
      radiologist performing the biopsy will have a gauze soaked with Povidone-iodine over his/her&#xD;
      index finger, and will insert this into the rectum. Before this, the Radiologist asks the&#xD;
      subject again if he has allergy to Povidone-iodine, shellfish or IVP dye. The gauze will be&#xD;
      wiped back and forth across the prostate with the finger at least five times from one lateral&#xD;
      margin to the other. The radiologist will allow at least 2 minutes to pass between prep and&#xD;
      the insertion of the first needle into the prostate in order to allow the Povidone-iodine to&#xD;
      dry. The radiologist will ask the subject to inform the Radiologist if the subject does&#xD;
      experience any symptoms of allergic reaction (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing;&#xD;
      tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue ). The 2 minutes will be&#xD;
      spent measuring the prostate size using the rectal ultrasound probe. After those two minutes&#xD;
      the routine biopsy is done. A second rectal swab for culture will not be taken, as this will&#xD;
      likely be negative due to the Povidone-iodine contamination of the swab, and due to the added&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be discharged from the recovery according to standard care. During the&#xD;
      recovery period, a watchful eye is kept on the subjects in the treatment group for developing&#xD;
      severe allergic reaction. A crash-cart will be available all the time during the procedure&#xD;
      and in the recovery room. Should the subject develop an allergic reaction, the radiologist&#xD;
      will take the necessary measures as per the Radiology Department standard of care protocol.&#xD;
      The subjects will be asked to provide another midstream urine sample for routine culturing 2&#xD;
      days after the biopsy. This will be grown in conventional media. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      measure and record their oral temperature once they wake up and just before going to sleep&#xD;
      and every 6 hours in between, for 2 days after the procedure. A telephone interview using a&#xD;
      post-biopsy questionnaire will be performed with the subject seven days after the biopsy to&#xD;
      ascertain any side effects from the biopsy, including whether a temperature ≥38.0˚C was&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
