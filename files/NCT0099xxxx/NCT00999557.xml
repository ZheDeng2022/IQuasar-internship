      RATIONALE: Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution may help increase eyebrow and eyelash growth in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how wells bimatoprost ophthalmic solution&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution in expediting regrowth of&#xD;
           eyebrows and eyelashes in patients who have undergone chemotherapy for breast cancer and&#xD;
           in increasing eyebrow growth in healthy participants with no known underlying disease as&#xD;
           assessed by two physicians and an aesthetics expert on a scale of 0-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effectiveness of this treatment as assessed by patient self-report on a&#xD;
           scale of 0-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the psychological impact of this treatment as assessed by patient-completed&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients apply topical bimatoprost ophthalmic solution to base of upper eyelid&#xD;
           margins OR to eyebrow region once daily for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients apply topical placebo solution to base of upper eyelid margins OR to&#xD;
           eyebrow region once daily for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires at baseline and monthly for 5 months about changes in&#xD;
      eyebrows/eyelashes, side effects of treatment, and the psychological impact of treatment.&#xD;
      Photographs of eyebrows or eyelashes and surrounding skin are taken at baseline and monthly&#xD;
      for 5 months and reviewed by a physician and aesthetics expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.&#xD;
