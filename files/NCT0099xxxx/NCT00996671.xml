  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug and to look at how the drug is&#xD;
      handled by your body. This is the first time the drug will be given to people, the drug has&#xD;
      been safely given to animals over many days at higher doses than will be given in the study.&#xD;
      The study will be done in healthy men and woman to determine what effects, good or bad, it&#xD;
      has on thier health. This study will find out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the drug has any side effects after one dose of the drug is given? How much of the drug&#xD;
      gets into the bloodstream, and how long does the body take to get rid of it? If the drug&#xD;
      causes any changes to a substance that is in skin, hair or blood.&#xD;

      This study represents the first administration of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor&#xD;
      GSK2256098 to humans to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),&#xD;
      and preliminary food effect following single oral doses in adult healthy subjects before&#xD;
      proceeding to studies in subjects with cancer that will be given at higher doses over an&#xD;
      extended period of time. FAK is a protein in the body that is important in cancer&#xD;
      development. Objectives of the study will be to characterize the safety of single doses of&#xD;
      GSK2256098; to characterize the single dose PK of GSK2256098 in the presence and absence of&#xD;
      food; to examine the dose proportionality of GSK2256098 PK parameters following single dose&#xD;
      administration; and to characterize the effect of single doses of GSK2256098 on phospho-FAK&#xD;
      (pFAK) tyrosine 397 (Y397) levels in skin and hair follicles. Dose- and concentration-effect&#xD;
      relationships for various safety parameters will be explored as appropriate.&#xD;
