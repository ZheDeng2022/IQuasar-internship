  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The limited existing&#xD;
      knowledge about the impact of influenza in immunocompromised patients suggests that they are&#xD;
      at increased risk of influenza virus acquisition, of developing complications and of&#xD;
      prolonged illness and viral shedding. However, some other data about the effect of antiviral&#xD;
      agents on the infection course, and risk of resistance in immunocompromised children are&#xD;
      lacking. The emergence of the pandemic H1N1 swine-origin influenza A virus has generated an&#xD;
      additional need to study the epidemiology, clinical course and outcome of influenza&#xD;
      infections in immunocompromised children. This study proposed to conduct a prospective&#xD;
      observational clinical study to answer these questions.&#xD;

      This study aims to do the following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency of influenza virus infections due to various subtypes in&#xD;
           immunocompromised children and young adults at SJCRH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe and compare the clinical course and outcome of pandemic H1N1 influenza&#xD;
           infection with that due to other influenza virus subtypes in immunocompromised children&#xD;
           and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the duration of influenza virus shedding in immunocompromised children and&#xD;
           young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the immunologic response to natural infection with various subtypes of&#xD;
           influenza virus including the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the viral resistance to antiviral agents in relation to antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare accuracy of rapid methods for influenza A subtyping and for determination of&#xD;
           antiviral resistance.&#xD;

      -  Nasopharyngeal swab collection is as follows: after tilting the tip of the patient's&#xD;
           nose upward, a swab is inserted through the nostril along the floor of the nose into the&#xD;
           nasopharynx. Then, the swab is gently rotated, removed and placed in its receptacle for&#xD;
           delivery to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory specimens will be stored at 2-8ºC and processed within 24-48 hours of&#xD;
           collection. Serum and whole blood for immune assays will be frozen at -20ºC or in liquid&#xD;
           nitrogen until processed in batched assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All blood specimens will be sent to the laboratory for immunologic assays.&#xD;
