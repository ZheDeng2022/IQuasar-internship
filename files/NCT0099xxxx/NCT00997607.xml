      This study will test two new vaccines, one for Ebola and one for Marburg virus, to see if&#xD;
      they are safe, if they have side effects, and if they create an immune response in people who&#xD;
      receive them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses known to induce hemorrhagic fever-a set of&#xD;
      symptoms characterized by sudden onset, aching, fever, and bleeding in the internal organs.&#xD;
      Both filoviruses are associated with high mortality rates, and the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control (CDC) lists them as Category A bioterrorism agents because of their potential for a&#xD;
      major public health impact. Vaccines for both viruses are under development using a&#xD;
      prime-boost strategy that involves multiple injections over a period of time to confer&#xD;
      long-lasting immunity. Preliminary research supports the vaccines' safety. This study will&#xD;
      test these experimental vaccines for the Ebola and Marburg viruses, first administered&#xD;
      separately and then together, to ensure they are safe and do not have side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will entail 11 study visits over 2 years. The study will have two&#xD;
      parts, to be completed sequentially, and three groups. In part one, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the first group, which will receive the experimental Ebola DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      or the second group, which will receive the experimental Marburg DNA vaccine. In part two,&#xD;
      the third group will receive both the Ebola and the Marburg vaccines, one shot in each arm.&#xD;
      One fifth of the participants in each group will be controls and receive placebo injections.&#xD;
      All vaccines and placebos will be delivered via an intramuscular injection at three time&#xD;
      points: at study entry, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete study assessments at 12 points in time: at baseline and at Weeks&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 52, 78, and 104. At each assessment, changes in health and&#xD;
      medications will be recorded and blood will be drawn. Participants will also complete a diary&#xD;
      card daily for 5 days after receiving each injection. In it, they will record their&#xD;
      temperature and any skin changes at the injection site.&#xD;
